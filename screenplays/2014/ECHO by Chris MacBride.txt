          TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX
           EXT. DOWNTOWN - TYSON’S CORNER, VIRGINIA - DAY 

           SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV - Dozens of faces pass by. Young. 
           Old. Black. White. Smooth. Wrinkled. No two identical.     

           Our CAMERA POV allows the faces to drift by indifferently, 
           until it starts to slowly follow ONE FACE. A woman’s face. 

           This is ANNA NEVEN. (30s) Our CAMERA POV continues to 
           covertly follow her throughout the day...    

           EXT. ART STUDIO - DAY - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV

           Our CAMERA POV looks in through the front window of an art 
           studio. Anna and several OTHER PAINTERS sit painting.

           She answers a CALL ON HER CELL. A quick, unheard discussion.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - EVENING - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV

           Anna walks down the street. She stops in front of a store 
           window. Looks at her reflection, which is strangely situated 
           overtop of a mannequin’s featureless head.  

           She brushes her hair. A slight melancholy. As if she didn’t 
           like the face staring back at her. She suddenly turns and... 

           Looks in our direction. Our CAMERA POV quickly hides behind a 
           corner. After a beat we peer around the corner... 

           Anna’s heading to her car parked on the side of the road. Our 
           CAMERA POV ABRUPTLY SHUTS OFF. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - VIRGINIA SUBURBS - NIGHT

           Anna’s car pulls into the driveway of a mid-sized suburban 
           home. She gets out of the car... Stops. Looks up and down the 
           quiet street. As if sensing she’s being watched. She walks 
           quickly to the house and goes inside.                      

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Anna stands at the door. Watching through the peephole.  

           She shakes her head. This is so stupid. She takes off her 
           coat. Heads towards the kitchen.

           The doorhandle rattles. Anna jumps. The door opens... 

           A MAN ENTERS. 30s. Intense looking. Stops. Stares at Anna.

                             (exhales, relived)
                        Bob. 

                                 BOB
                        Expecting someone else?

           This is BOB NEVEN. Anna’s husband. 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s... Nothing. I... I had this 
                        feeling I was being followed home. 

           This seems to concern Bob. He looks out the front window.

                                 BOB
                        What gave you that feeling?

                                 ANNA
                        Forget it. It’s stupid.  
                             (starts heading upstairs)
                        Gonna jump in the shower. We’ve got 
                        to be at Max’s in forty five. 

                                 BOB
                             (remembering - annoyed)
                        Do we have to? I’ve got a lot of-

                                 ANNA 
                        Wear your beige sweater.

           She heads upstairs. Ending the debate. Bob watches her until 
           she’s out of sight. Things seem a bit frosty between them. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Through steamed glass we see Anna’s naked silhouette in the 
           shower. Bob, now wearing his beige sweater, quietly sneaks 
           into the bathroom. He sees Anna’s cell by the sink. He picks 
           it up. Scrolls through her call list. Stops on one...

           6:12 PM. 44 SECONDS. UNKNOWN CALLER.  

           EXT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Bob walks to a shed at the back of the yard.

           INT. BACKYARD SHED - NIGHT

           Bob turns on the light. A car engine sits on a table with 
           wheels. Bob moves the table aside. He lifts an empty shelving 
           unit up and off the wall, revealing a CHART HIDDEN BEHIND...

           It’s all about Anna. Photos of her. Notes on where she goes. 
           Who she talks to. What she eats. Times. Dates. An obsessive 
           documentation of his wife’s every move. 

           Bob pulls a small camcorder out of his pocket. Takes the 
           memory card out and sticks it in a laptop set up under the 
           chart. The footage is the CAMERA POV we saw earlier. 

           Bob goes to a specific spot in the footage - Anna answering 
           the call on her cell. He writes a note on the chart...

           “6:12 PM. 44 SECONDS. UNKNOWN CALLER.”

           He leans in close to the chart. His eyes scanning across it. 
           As if it were a puzzle he was just on the edge of solving. 

                                 BOB
                             (softly to himself)
                        Who are you?

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob picks up a picture off the dresser. It’s him and Anna. 
           The WASHINGTON MONUMENT seen through the window behind them. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        It’s important that I remember my 
                        wife. My real wife. 

           Anna walks into the room. All dolled up and ready to go out. 

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I owe it to her to find out who 
                        this person is. 

           Anna looks over at Bob. A small, polite smile. 

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This person living in my house.

           Bob smiles back. Equally polite. 

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This person sleeping in my bed.

           As they leave, we PAN to the photo of them on the mantle.

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This person who’s replaced her. 

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           ABSTRACT PAINTINGS hang on white walls. A large WATERFALL 
           MACHINE giving off a soothing BUBBLING SOUND. 

           Bob’s lying on a couch. In a track suit. Seems slightly 
           sedated. His words dripping slowly. Sitting in a chair behind 
           Bob’s couch, is DR. CARTER. 60s. Tablet in his hands. 

                                 DR. CARTER
                        Your “real” wife, as you call her. 
                        Tell me about her. How’d you meet? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A blurry OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE... Color... Movement...

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        It was a party.  

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Yeah. It was a party.

           The image (memory) COMES SLIGHTLY INTO FOCUS...

           INT. CONDO - PARTY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A crowded room full of people. Our POV SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS.

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        A costume party, wasn’t it?

           The room COMES INTO FOCUS. Everyone’s wearing costumes. As if 
           Carter’s words were making the memory appear piece by piece.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        It was a costume party. 

           Bob walks into the party. Suit and tie. Holding a book. 

           A white guy WEARING TRADITIONAL ARAB GARB approaches Bob.

                                 ARAB GARB GUY
                        There he is! Where’s your costume?

           Bob holds up the novel “Gravity’s Rainbow”.
                                 BOB
                             (proud of himself)
                        I’m Thomas Pynchon.

           Bob’s friend just stares back at him like he’s an alien.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        You know, cause, nobody knows... 
                             (his friend still blank)
                        What... he looks like.  
                             (gives up)
                        And who are you?

           His friend opens up his robe revealing a suicide vest.

                                 ARAB GARB GUY
                        BOOM!

           The suicide vest is made up of beer cans. 

                                 ARAB GARB GUY
                        I’m “Beer Ladin”!

           He rips off a can and tosses it to Bob, who’s not impressed.

                                 ARAB GARB GUY
                        Listen, mingle. Have a good time.

                                 BOB
                             (doesn’t want to be left)
                        Hang on, I...

           He’s already gone. Bob looks around. Room full of strangers. 

           INT. CONDO - PARTY - LATER

           Bob’s standing with a woman dressed as the QUEEN OF HEARTS. 

                                 QUEEN OF HEARTS
                        Burma is seriously a hidden gem. 
                        The beaches are breathtaking. 

                                 BOB
                        Myanmar.

                                 QUEEN OF HEARTS
                        Excuse me?

                                 BOB
                        It’s called Myanmar now. 

                                 QUEEN OF HEARTS
                        Oh.

                                 BOB
                        Their military also uses child 
                        soldiers. They take kids from the 
                        poorest families and brain wash 
                        them into killing machines. When 
                        you go on vacation there, you’re 
                        actually funding child soldiers.

           A silent, awkward beat. She points across the room.

                                 QUEEN OF HEARTS
                        I’m just gonna... 

                                 BOB
                             (knows he’s blown it)
                        Sure.

           She slinks off as fast as she can. Poor “too serious for his 
           own good” Bob, wanders off in the opposite direction.  

           WIDE ON the room illustrating how Bob’s the only person by 
           himself. Everyone else talking, laughing. Normal. 

           INT. CONDO - PARTY - BACK BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob slips into the back bedroom. Exhales. Flops on the bed. 

           A NOISE behind him. Bob stands and turns... It’s Anna. 

                                 BOB
                        Oh, I was just looking for my coat-

                                 ANNA
                        It’s okay. I’m hiding too. 

           Although only a few years younger, she seems entirely 
           different from his very put together wife we first met. Long 
           hair. Dyed streaks. A clumsy sincerity about her.

           Bob stays awkwardly frozen, half way out the door. Unsure. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (grins at him)
                        There’s no shame in hiding. Being 
                        thrown into a room with complete 
                        strangers and knowing how to act is 
                        utterly abnormal.
                             (points to the party)
                        They’re the freaks, not us. 

           Bob smiles. He slowly, cautiously sits down beside her.

                                 ANNA  (CONT’D)
                        I keep thinking one day I’ll learn 
                        how to chit chat with strangers 
                        about mindless crap. Like that 
                        skill will just kick in when I hit 
                        thirty or something. But every time 
                        I’m at one of these things I just 
                        end up feeling like I’m fifteen at 
                        a high school dance. 

                                 BOB
                        Don’t even mention high school 
                        dances. I used to hide in the 
                        bathroom stall. I’d just sit there 
                        and wait it out. 

                                 ANNA
                        Jeez. Why not just leave? 

                                 BOB
                        Cause then it’s like admitting you 
                        can’t do something that...
                             (searching for the words)
                        ...Everyone else finds so easy. 

                                 ANNA
                        I guess the only way to escape is 
                        if you left with another person.
                             (off Bob’s confused look)
                        You know, cause then people just 
                        assume you’re hooking up. 

                                 BOB
                             (slightly sad smile)
                        Wish I’d thought of that. 

           A quiet moment. Awkward kindred spirits silently looking out 
           the bedroom door at the party beyond. Anna pops off the bed. 

                                 ANNA
                        Alright. If we’re getting out of 
                        here, we’re gonna have to put on a 
                        bit of a show for these freaks.  

           She messes up her own hair. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        You and I just had a crazy make out 
                        session.

           She gently runs her hand through Bob’s hair. Messing it up. 
           Bob tries to stay cool. Nervous and exited at her touch.

                        Probably first base, but who knows.  

           She undoes the top button on her shirt...

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe even a little light 
                        petting...

           She loosens his tie a bit...

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        And now we’re off to a seedy motel. 
                        Sound good?

           Bob smiles up at her. Trying to hide his excitement. Unsure 
           where the joke ends and reality begins.

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
                        Is she really so different?

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob on the couch. His mind far off, lost in the memory...

                                 BOB
                        It’s not the same woman. 

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - PARTY - NIGHT

           Back to the older, married Bob. In his beige sweater. 
           Wandering through a party in a suburban home. Even years 
           later, he still seems a bit out of place at things like this. 

           Bob stops in front of a bunch of kids playing a VIDEO GAME ON 
           A HUGE FLAT SCREEN. The kids firing missiles at targets. 
           Something about the game captivates Bob for a moment. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        She dragged you, huh? 

           MAX, 30s, the host, and Anna’s brother, approaches.

                                 BOB
                        Kicking and screaming. 

           JERRY, 40s, approaches. Patriots jersey. Coors Light in hand. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        This is my sister’s husband, Bob. 
                        Bob, this is Jerry. He works in the 
                        governor’s office.

                                 JERRY
                        Don’t let it excite you. I stare at 
                        a monitor all day. 

                                 BOB
                        Me too. 

                                 JERRY
                        Max tells me you’re in the 
                        consulting game? Government work?

                                 BOB
                             (aloof)
                        Yeah. We have some contracts with 
                        the state department.  

                                 JERRY
                        Like what kinda stuff?

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        This should be good. 

           Bob turns and sees Anna. He can see instantly she’s drunk. 

                                 ANNA
                             (playful - feisty)
                        What kinda stuff, Bob?

                                 BOB
                             (lasers from his eyes)
                        It’s a little complicated. 

           Bob just glares at her. Max, sensing the tension...

                                 MAX
                        Okay... Someone’s had too many. 

           Max leads Anna away. Turns back to Bob for a second...

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Everything alright with you guys?

                                 BOB
                             (curt)
                        Everything’s fine.

           Bob keeps his eyes on Anna as she moves through the room. She 
           navigates the party like a pro. Small talk. Fake smiles. A 
           far cry from the awkward, sincere woman he first met. 

                                  BOB (V.O.)
                        They look the same. Sound the same. 
                        Even smell the same.

           BOB’S POV - Watching Anna. EVERYTHING STARTS TO SLOW DOWN. 

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But it’s not her.

           BOB’S POV - CLOSE ON little details... Anna’s eyes moving 
           from person to person. Her not quite sincere smile appearing 
           and disappearing. Something false about her. Like every 
           expression... A mask somehow... It’s eerie and scary.

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s not my Anna.  

           EXT. VIRGINIA BEACH - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           The same night Bob and Anna met... The two of them sit on a 
           bench at the edge of the ocean. The beach is dark. Deserted.  

                                 ANNA
                        This is definitely more like it. 
                             (thoughtful - looking out 
                              at the black waves)
                        I wonder if there’s anywhere like 
                        this left on earth. Not overrun 
                        with people. Somewhere you could 
                        truly escape.  

                                 BOB
                        Tristan da Cunha.

                                 ANNA
                        Where?

                                 BOB
                        One of the most remote islands in 
                        the world. Three hundred residents. 
                        No airport. Only way to get there 
                        is a six day boat ride from South 
                        Africa that only leaves once a 
                        month. And to top it off, it’s an 
                        active volcano. If you really 
                        wanted to escape, that’s the place.  
                             (re: the dark empty beach)
                        This is how I picture it. In my 
                        mind. 

                                 ANNA
                             (closes her eyes - enjoys 
                              the words)
                        Tristan da Cunha. 
                             (opens her eyes - smiles)
                        I love that you know weird shit 
                        like that.

           Bob smiles sheepishly. Loving that she loves it. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        So, tell me, what would you do 
                        sitting in that bathroom stall 
                        while all your friends are slow 
                        dancing to Stairway to Heaven?

                                 BOB
                        Honestly... Graffiti.

                                 ANNA
                             (laughs)
                        “Deborah's a bitch”? Stuff like 
                        that?

                                 BOB
                        No, I... It’s stupid. I had this 
                        little symbol I’d carve. 

                                 ANNA
                        You had a symbol? Like Batman? 

                                 BOB
                             (embarrassed)
                        I don’t know. I guess I was like 
                        a... A prisoner. Carving those 
                        little lines to pass the time. 

           Anna takes him in. Endeared by his awkward vulnerability. 

                                 ANNA
                        What was it? The symbol.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t remember.

                                 ANNA
                        Yes you do. 

           Bob smiles. Grabs a stick. He draws his “symbol” in the sand. 
           A simple triangle like shape with a circle in the center. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Aww, now I want a symbol. 

           Anna takes the stick. Starts designing her own in the sand. 
           It’s intricate. Detailed. Bob watches. Clearly smitten.  

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be intimidated by my skills. 
                        I’m a painter. 
                             (beat)
                        Sort of. I paint. 
                                 (MORE)

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (looks up at him)
                        What do you do?

                                 BOB
                        I work for a consulting firm. 
                             (under his breath)
                        Sort of. 

           Anna finishes the symbol. Her and Bob stand back. Admire it.   

                                 ANNA
                        You know what... If we combined 
                        them... 

           She starts to draw her symbol inside and around Bob’s symbol. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Huh. They fit together pretty well.  

                                 BOB
                             (with meaning)
                        They fit perfectly. 

           Bob looks over at her. She’s already looking at him. Giving 
           him every sign possible. It’s now or never and he knows it. 

           He cautiously leans forward and kisses her gently. As the 
           kiss continues, the awkwardness gradually melts and they 
           start passionately making out.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Older Bob and Anna. Getting ready for bed on opposite sides 
           of the room. In silence. Going through the motions. 

           Anna crawls into bed. Bob heads out of the room...

                                 ANNA
                        Hey? Where you going?

                                 BOB
                        Gonna do some work in the shed.

                                 ANNA
                        The engine? Bob, it’s the 12th.
                             (off Bob’s blank look)
                        Ovulation?

                                 BOB
                        Anna, it’s late. You’re drunk-

                                 ANNA
                        What was our agreement? On the 12th 
                        we have to try. 
                             (off Bob’s sigh)
                        I’m sorry it’s so horrible to have 
                        to fuck me once a month.

                                 BOB
                        It’s not that, it’s...

           She touches his arm, but he instinctively recoils.

                                 ANNA
                        What’s going on with you?

                                 BOB
                        Nothing.

           This is the last thing he wants, but he has to hide it. 

           She pulls off her night gown...

           EXT. VIRGINIA BEACH - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Bob and Anna making love in the sand. Excited and passionate. 

           WE BEGIN TO INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH...

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The SOUND OF WAVES CRASHING carrying over to this scene...

           Bob and Anna making love in their bed at home. It's cold and 
           mechanical. To the point. A task to be performed. 

           EXT. VIRGINIA BEACH - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Bob looks into Anna's eyes as he makes love to her... There's 
           a sparkle in her eyes... A genuine passion...

                                 BOB (V.O.)

           BOB’S POV OF ANNA - SLOW MOTION - Anna's eyes looking into 
           Bob's. Something dark and stern in her eyes. Something 
           hidden. It’s not her. It’s not the same woman. To Bob at this 
           moment it feels like... Adultery.

                        Forgive me for betraying you.

           PAN AWAY from the bed. Up to the wall. A painting hanging 
           there. It’s Bob and Anna’s joined symbol. The same one 
           created on the beach the night they met. 

           EXT. VIRGINIA BEACH - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           PAN AWAY from Bob and Anna... Up to the joined symbol drawn 
           in the sand. A wave washes it out of existence. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. STRANGE WINDING HALLWAYS - UNKNOWN TIME

           Bob slowly wanders through a dimly lit, winding hallway. It 
           feels sterile. Like a creepy hospital at night. 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Bob?... Bob?

           Her voice is coming from a METALLIC DOOR at the end of the 
           hall. Bob rushes to the door. Goes through it... 

           A DARKENED ROOM... 

           A MAN walks towards Bob. The man’s FEATURES ON HIS FACE ARE 
           IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX. Fluctuating between dozens of 
           other noses, eyes, etc. It’s a horrifying image. The sound of 
           ELECTRICITY BUZZING becomes deafening as the man gets closer.

           The face stops fluctuating and settles on a specific face... 

           An ARAB WITH BLUE EYES. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Bob SCREAMS and bolts upright in bed. Waking from a 
           nightmare. He takes in his surroundings. It’s morning. It’s 
           his bedroom. Everything’s fine. 

           He instinctively turns and reaches towards Anna, but... The 
           bed’s empty. Anna’s gone. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - MULTIPLE ROOMS - LATER

           Quick snippets of Bob going through his morning routine. 

           Showers. Brushes his teeth. Gets dressed.

           As he pulls his tie on, something catches his eye... 

           The picture on the dresser of Bob and Anna in D.C. It’s gone. 
           The picture frame empty and knocked awkwardly on its side.  

           Bob walks to the dresser. Holds the empty frame in his hands. 

           EXT. BLAND OFFICE BUILDING - TYSON’S CORNER - MORNING

           Bob parks in the parking lot of a bland office building. 

           INT. BLAND OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

           Bob walks past rows of cubicles. Coffee mug in hand. Polite 
           nods. Just another day at the office. He walks down a hall. 
           Puts his hand on a scanner. CLOSE ON the scanner... 

           BOB NEVEN. ID CONFIRMED. 

           The door opens automatically and Bob walks through it into... 

           INT. THE CIA - SPECIAL ACTIVITIES DIVISION - MORNING

           Rooms full of computers. Analysts everywhere pouring over 
           data. Bob sticks his face into a console. A laser from a 
           RETINA SCAN floats across Bob’s eye. Another door opens. 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - MORNING

           Small and dark with half a dozen large WALL MOUNTED SCREENS 
           displaying DRONE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE from locations around 
           the world. FOUR IMAGE ANALYSTS sit in the room, including 
           SANDRA. 40s. Short hair. Ex military. Tough as nails.

                                 BOB
                        Morning, Sandra. How are the kids?

                                 SANDRA
                        Imran almost walked on his own. 

                                 BOB
                        Come on.

           On the screen ahead of him, we see what they're referring to. 

           A live image of a house in a little village in WAZIRISTAN, 
           PAKISTAN. A woman in a FULL BODY BURQA, ALIMA, 20s, sits 
           watching her THREE LITTLE KIDS playing outside their house. 

           Sandra REWINDS the displayed footage backwards...

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        Here. Watch.

           The smallest of Alima’s children, IMRAN, struggles mightily, 
           but manages two or three wobbly steps before falling.  

           Bob and Sandra both laugh. They’ve clearly been watching this 
           family for a long time. Getting to know them. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        Taking my break. Let me know if he 
                        walks again.

           Sandra leaves. Bob sips coffee while watching the family.    

           ON THE SCREEN - Alima walks into the house. Bob is still able 
           to see her intermittently as she passes by windows.  

           Alima lays out a mat. She kneels and begins to pray. 

           She finishes. Rolls up her mat. Starts to strip off her 
           burqa, revealing, surprisingly, a beautiful face and figure. 

           Bob feels strange watching, but he can't look away. No one 
           gets to see what Alima looks like except her husband, and the 
           drone team spying on her from thousands of miles away. 

           Alima approaches a mirror. Looks at her own reflection. 
           Brushes some strands of hair. A slight melancholy. (Very 
           similar to Anna looking at her reflection on the street.) 

           Bob watches this private little moment. Transfixed.    

           Alima opens a LARGE CHEST. She pulls something out. Starts to 
           strap it around her body... What appears to be...

           Explosives. 

           Bob's eyes go wide. He puts his head set on...

                                 BOB
                        I have a possible code six. Repeat, 
                        code six. 

           Lights on the panels in front of Bob start flashing to life. 
           Sandra comes back into the control room. 

                                 SANDRA 
                        What happened?

                                 BOB
                        Is that what I think it is?

           Bob points to the object Alima is strapping to herself.  
                                      New Revision1

                                 SANDRA
                             (shocked)
                        It’s not Shahab. It’s his wife.

           Bob and Sandra watch as Alima pulls her burqa on over her 
           explosives. Covering every part of her body except her eyes. 

           Bob looks down at the TIME CODE at the bottom of the monitor. 

                                 BOB
                        Wait a second? Is this not real 
                        time? Am I in flashback here?

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh, shit.
                             (mortified with herself)
                        I rewound to show you Imran.

                                 BOB
                        Jesus. Switch me to real time eyes.

           The recorded footage on the screen of Alima getting dressed 
           suddenly switches to a ”real time” live image of the house... 

           It's empty. Alima's gone.

                                 SANDRA
                        Shit.

                                 BOB
                             (suddenly panicked)
                        Give me flashback again. Speed up 
                        to two hundred percent.

           The image of the house REWINDS to Alima strapping the bomb 
           on. The footage SPEEDS FORWARDS until we see... 

           A WHITE PICKUP TRUCK pulls up to the house and then drives 
           off into the desert. Out of view of the drone’s camera.  

                                 BOB
                        103, I need emergency eyes on the 
                        desert road at 55 north by 80 east. 

           INT. GROUND CONTROL STATION - DAY

           A DRONE PILOT and SENSOR OPERATOR sit in a small, windowless 
           room in some unknown location in the world. Monitors 
           displaying drone telemetry from above Alima’s house.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                             (over headset)
                        There's a white truck somewhere in 
                        there heading north. Find it.

                        Roger, control. Repositioning. 

           The pilot maneuvers the joystick-like control. 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tense moments as everyone watches the telemetry from the 
           drone as it hunts for Alima’s truck. 

                                 BOB
                        Where is she?

                                 SANDRA
                        There!

           They see it. A small white dot moving along the desert. 

                                 BOB
                        103, do you have the bogey moving 
                        north? Zero in and enhance.

           The drone camera zooms in closer on the white truck as it 
           barrels along the road... towards a crowded market. 

                                 BOB
                             (horrified)
                        She’s gonna blow up the market.

                                 SANDRA
                        We can't let her get there. 

                                 BOB
                        Show me her getting dressed again.

           Next to the live image of the truck, a second screen rewinds 
           to the moment Alima strapped the object to herself. 

                                 BOB
                        That’s a suicide vest, right?

                                 SANDRA
                        What else could it be?

           Alima strapping the object to herself plays on a loop. Though 
           it certainly appears to be a suicide vest, the poor quality 
           of the image makes it impossible to be certain.

                                 DRONE PILOT (V.O.)
                        Ninety seconds to the market. 

           Bob’s eyes desperately scan across the images in front of 
           him. Multiple screens show multiple images of Alima. 

           BOB’S POV - Just like with Anna, EVERYTHING SLOWS DOWN. CLOSE 
           ON little details... The slow way she disrobed... Her 
           melancholy expression in the mirror... 

           This is what Bob does. His “super power” so to speak. 
           Analyzes the little details of human behavior to form a split 
           second decision...

                             (quiet - to himself)
                        She’s going to do it.

                        Roger. Laser lock initiating. 

           Bob watches the truck race across the desert. He understands 
           the gravity of the next few seconds. This isn’t a video game. 

                                 BOB
                        Give me flashback again. The point 
                        where she gets in the truck.

                                 SANDRA
                        Bob, there’s no time.

                                 BOB
                        Show it to me. Now!

           A second screen REWINDS to the truck arriving at the house. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Let it play there. Enhance. 

           Alima gets into the passenger side next to the unseen driver. 
           And in the back... 

           Her three little kids get into the truck.

           INT. GROUND CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Tension in the pilot’s eyes as he watches the truck race 
           towards the market. His finger literally on the trigger.

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           An agonizing moment as Bob looks back and forth from the 
           speeding truck to the image of the kids getting in.

                                 DRONE PILOT (V.O.)
                        Thirty seconds to the market. Are

                        Bob, you need to call it.

           Bob takes one last look at the image of the kids, then...

           They all watch silently as a HELLFIRE MISSILE HITS THE MOVING 
           TRUCK DEAD ON. A massive but silent explosion as they see it 
           vaporized on the grainy screen. 

           Everyone is silent. The tension still palpable in the small 
           dark room. 

           EXT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Bob arrives home. Parks his car in the driveway. His NEIGHBOR

           Bob and Anna sit at the table eating Chinese food. Silent. 
           The only sound the clink of chop sticks. The light hanging 
           over the table FLICKERS OCCASIONALLY.

                        Nothing. Work stuff. 

           They eat silently. Bob sneaks a covert glance at Anna. 
           Watching little details. Her fingers fiddling with her 
           chopsticks. Her mouth chewing her food. The overhead 
           flickering light adding to the strange tension. 

           Bob gets up and goes to the fridge. Grabs some Soy Sauce. He 
           comes back and reaches out to pour some on Anna’s noodles. 

           She grabs his hand.

                        nothing happened at work? 

           Bob sits back down. Looks her square in the eye.

                                 BOB
                        How many times are you going to ask 
                        for details about work? 

                                 ANNA
                        Excuse me?

                                 BOB
                        You know I can’t talk about it. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m sorry. I get confused about 
                        what I’m allowed to talk with my 
                        husband about over dinner. Maybe 
                        you should make me a rule book?

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, maybe I should.

           She gets up. Brings her plate to the counter. Grabs her coat. 

                                 BOB
                        Where you going?

                                 ANNA
                        To get light bulbs, Bob. Okay? Or 
                        do you have to run it by the 
                        president?

           She leaves. Bob hears the front door open and close. 

           He gets up and walks to the sink. Washes his hands. Realizing 
           there’s no towel, he opens the cupboard. Then notices...

           A stack of unopened light bulbs. 

           Bob quickly turns and bolts out of the kitchen.

                        Do you remember the first time you 
                        had this sensation? That your wife 
                        was someone else?

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob lies on the couch with Dr. Carter behind him.

                        It was just after your car

                        You’d gone to DC for the weekend.  

           The image (memory) COMES SLIGHTLY INTO FOCUS... A crowded 
           room full of people. Carter’s words making it appear...

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Yes. We went to DC.

           INT. RITZ CARLTON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A WAITRESS takes Bob and Anna’s picture by the window. The

           (This is the moment the missing picture was photographed.)   

           The WAITRESS hands Bob his phone after taking the picture.

                                 BOB
                        Thank you very much.

                        I don’t know. I think that Merlot’s 
                        catching up with me. 
                             (looks at Bob. Seems fine)
                        God, do you ever get drunk?

           Bob smiles. Drops money on the table. Takes Anna’s hand.

                             (melancholy)

                        her. 

           INT. RITZ CARLTON - HALLWAY OUTSIDE THEIR ROOM - LATER

           Bob and Anna arrive at their room. Anna pulls out her key

                                 ANNA
                        What are you doing?

                                 BOB
                        This is me drunk. 

           He kisses her. Anna giggles. Fumbling with the door key.

           INT. RITZ CARLTON - HOTEL ROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           The next morning. Bob paces. Cell to his ear.

                        The next morning I was called into 
                        work. 

           Anna, in a hotel bath robe, watches Bob from the bed. 

                                 BOB
                             (into phone)

           Bob and Anna standing in the doorway.

                        I’m sorry. Apparently it’s urgent. 
                        Couple hours. That’s it.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s okay. I’ll get room service.

           Anna’s disappointed but not surprised. Bob kisses her. 

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I left her. 

           Bob looks back to his room as he walks off. One last look at 
           Anna, as she slowly closes the door to their room.

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I left her alone and they took her.

           Bob puts his cell on speaker as someone picks up.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (over phone)
                        Hey, Bob.

                                 BOB
                        Hey. So, you know why I got called

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Called in? Nobody called you in.

           Bob’s expression darkens... 

           BAM! A WHITE VAN SMASHES INTO THE SIDE OF BOB’S CAR. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Bob wakes up abruptly in bed. Another bad dream. Once 
           again... He’s alone in bed. Anna’s not there. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           About to leave for work, Bob watches a NEWS REPORT on TV. 

           ON TV: Images of the smoking ruin of the white truck where 
           the drone missile hit it. An ANGRY MOB has gathered. Holding 
           up an infant’s shoes, black and charred. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        International uproar over the CIA’s 
                        covert drone program has reached a 
                        fever pitch. At the UN today the 
                        Chinese officially introduced a 
                        motion calling for the immediate 
                        dismantlement of the CIA’s covert 
                        program.

           Bob turns it off. Disturbed by it all. Heads out the door.  

           INT. THE CIA - OFFICE AREA - MORNING

           Bob walks through the office. No better here than at home. 
           People glued to the news coverage. The Chinese ambassador 
           speaking at the UN... 

                                 CHINESE AMBASSADOR (V.O.)
                        Not only are these illegal strikes 
                        killing civilians, but they are 
                        creating new terrorists every day.  
                        With every new attack that occurs, 
                        it is further proof that the drone 
                        program has failed and needs to 
                        come to an end. One way or another. 

           Another analyst, DEBBIE, 50s, approaches Bob. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Morning, Bob. Got something a 
                        little odd here. This...
                             (hands Bob an envelope)
                        ...Arrived anonymously in the mail.  

           Bob opens the envelope. Glad for any kind of distraction. 

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Looks like shipping manifests of 
                        some kind. Whoever sent this 
                        highlighted a bunch of materials 
                        sent to these GPS coordinates.  

           She points at the highlighted GPS coordinates. 

                                 BOB
                        Okay. So? 

                                 DEBBIE
                        So... It was sent here. 
                             (off Bob’s blank look)
                        To this address. Addressed to 
                        Special Activities. Who knows the 
                        CIA is in this building? 

           Bob nods. Understanding now. That is interesting. 

                                 BOB
                        Thanks, Debbie.

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Bob and Sandra sit watching live DRONE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE 
           of Alima’s house. Alima’s family members weep uncontrollably.  
           It’s excruciating. Seeing the family’s pain. The children's 
           toys in the yard that will never be played with again.

                                 SANDRA
                        She put those kids in that truck. 
                        Not you.

                                 BOB
                        I know.
                             (clears his throat)
                        Let’s find out who put her in that 
                        truck. 

           DRONE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE of Alima’s house REWINDS. 

                                 BOB
                        There. Freeze it. 

           The same WHITE TRUCK arrives at the house days earlier. Alima 
           gets out of the truck. TWO ARAB MEN carry the chest with the 
           explosives into the house.   

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Show me where that truck came from.

           The white pickup truck’s course is tracked in reverse through 
           the desert until it travels out of view of the drone’s eye. 

                                 SANDRA
                        That’s as far back as we go. 

                                 BOB
                        Don’t we have eyes on that area?

                                 SANDRA
                        Too close to the Chinese border. 

                                 BOB
                        Well, let’s see how close we can 
                        get. I want to know what’s in that 
                        desert. 

           DAVIS (50s), Bob’s superior, walks into the room.

                                 DAVIS

                        No matter what happens in there... 
                        You made the right call.

           Bob looks over at him. Appreciative. Davis just stares 
           forward. Both serious men of few words.  

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Bob and Davis sit at a conference table with 4 US SENATORS 
           from the oversight committee and several CIA LAWYERS.

                        Just to be clear, you were aware 
                        there were civilians in the truck 
                        when you authorized the strike?

                        Yes, sir, I was.

                        Sir.

                                 SENATOR
                        So, these “signature strikes”, as 
                        you call them... Clock’s ticking. 
                        No time to go up the chain of 
                        command. How’s that call made?

                                 BOB
                        We analyze the behavior of our 
                        target to determine if it 
                        corresponds to terrorist patterns. 
                        Then it’s ultimately up to the 
                        discretion of the targeting 
                        officer.

                                 SENATOR
                        So, whether a life is taken or not, 
                        whether an international incident 
                        is triggered, comes down to one 
                        man’s ability to interpret 
                        behavior. Do I have that correct?

                                 BOB
                        Yes, sir. I suppose that’s true.

                                 SENATOR
                        And what happens if you make a 
                        mistake? What if you misinterpret 
                        the intentions of the subject 
                        you’re surveilling? That’s a lot of 
                        responsibility to put on the 
                        perceptions of one man?

                                 BOB
                        It is, sir. I agree. 

           Bob seems sincere. As if he almost resented the 
           responsibility. At least on this day... He does.  

           A CIA LAWYER chimes in... 

                                 CIA LAWYER
                        I think we can wrap this up.
                             (reading from a paper)
                        Agent Neven, did you, to the best 
                        of your abilities, conform to 
                        article 51 of the UN charter in 
                        yesterday’s drone strike?

                                 BOB
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 CIA LAWYER
                        Have you recently consumed any 
                        chemical substances that could 
                        impede your judgment? 

           Davis rolls his eyes. What a joke this all this.  

                                 BOB
                        No, sir.

                        Has anyone identified you in your 
                        civilian capacity and attempted to 
                        gain information from you on the 
                        agency’s drone program? 

           Bob doesn’t answer immediately. The question hitting a nerve.

                                 BOB
                        No, sir.

                        process in regards to the agency’s 
                        drone program?

           Bob fidgets in his seat. Should he say something? Voice his 
           concerns about Anna? 

           The lawyer looks up at Bob for the first time.

           INT. BACKYARD SHED - NIGHT

           Bob sits in front of the chart documenting Anna’s behavior. 
           The only light is from a laptop playing the footage of Anna 
           getting in the black Mercedes. (The whole set up eerily 
           similar to what Bob does in the drone room.)

           Bob freezes the footage on the licence plate of the Mercedes. 
           He writes the licence on the chart, next to several other 
           notes we PAN ACROSS... 

           KEEPS PROBING ABOUT WORK... SECRETLY MEETING A HANDLER... 
           WHAT ARE THEY AFTER...? 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Bob? You out here? 

           Anna’s right outside the shed. 

           Bob quickly leaps up. In a panic he lifts the empty shelving 
           unit up and overtop of the Anna chart. 

           The door to the shed starts to open, just as Bob realizes...

           The laptop’s still open. Bob shuts it just as Anna enters. 

                                 BOB
                             (out of breath)
                        Hey.

                                 ANNA
                        Hey.
                             (looks around the shed)
                        Everything alright?
                                         Revision

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, just...

           He nods towards the car engine. His alibi for being out here.

           As Anna walks further into the shed, Bob notices...

           The shelving unit didn’t go on the wall completely. Part of 
           the Anna chart is sticking out of the corner of the wall. 

           Bob walks in front of Anna, cutting her off.

                                 ANNA
                        What are you doing?

                                 BOB
                        Nothing. Was just going to head in. 

           It’s a standoff. Neither one of them moving. Anna can’t go 
           deeper into the shed, but he can’t leave. Then finally... 

                                 ANNA
                        Just wanted to check on you. 

                                 BOB
                        Thanks.

           She turns and heads out. Bob exhales. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Anna sleeps soundly in bed. Beside her, Bob ever so carefully 
           reaches over her and grabs Anna’s cell off the bedside table. 

           Anna stirs. Bob freezes mid-grab. A beat then... She settles. 

           Bob turns his back to her in the bed. He searches her cell. 
           In her outgoing texts he finds...

           “2PM TMRW” 

           Bob stares at this text. Thinking. He goes into her internet 
           history. Sees the last visit... 

           A web site. A restaurant called “SACHIMA”. Directions to it.

           Bob gingerly reaches over Anna and puts her cell back. 

           He lies back down. Staring at the ceiling. Paranoid as hell.

           INT. CIA - BERNIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob hands the license of the Mercedes to a bearded, bookish 
           analyst named BERNIE. 

                                 BERNIE
                        What’s this?

                                 BOB
                        It’s this thing called a license 
                        plate. People who aren’t afraid of 
                        driving have them on their cars.

           Bernie grabs the license. Starts typing on his computer.

                                 BERNIE
                        You have any idea how many people 
                        were driven off the road in 
                        Virginia last year? 

           Bob smiles. He likes Bernie. Kindred spirits who are more 
           comfortable in dark rooms in front of monitors. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT’D)
                        If forty thousand people a year 
                        died in plane crashes you’d never 
                        step foot on a plane. And I’m crazy 
                        for taking the bus...   

           Bernie trails off. Turns to Bob with a guilty expression. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. I know you’re the last guy I 
                        gotta quote accident stats to.

                                 BOB
                        It’s okay. What do ya got?

                                 BERNIE
                             (re: the monitor)
                        Huh. 

                                 BOB
                        What?

                                 BERNIE
                        Bounced back a “no-hit”. Not 
                        registered. Is it one of ours?

                                 BOB
                        Why do you ask?
                                         Revision

                                 BERNIE
                        Cause that’s usually the only time 
                        we get “no-hits”. Agency vehicles. 
                        FBI. Spooks generally. 

           Bob gets up to go. Letting this sink in. Worried. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Wanna grab lunch?

                                 BOB
                        No, I ah... I already have plans.

           EXT. “SACHIMA” RESTUARANT - DAY - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV

           Anna walks into the restaurant “Sachima”. Through the front 
           window, our camera follows her through the seating area. She 
           sits at a table just outside the camera’s view.

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Shit.

           EXT. “SACHIMA” RESTUARANT - DAY

           Bob gets out of his car. Crosses the street. He peers in 
           through the front window... He can see Anna. She's sitting a 
           few tables away from the window. Her back turned. Alone. 

           A SUDDEN BLARING NOISE right behind Bob. He spins around. 
           Three cars have almost collided head on in the intersection. 
           All three honking like mad at each other. 

           Bob calms. He turns back around towards the restaurant...

           Anna is standing at the window. Staring at Bob. 

           He's caught red handed. For a loaded second the two just 
           stand staring at each other, separated only by glass. 

           INT. “SACHIMA” RESTUARANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob walks to Anna’s table. Both of them acting confused. 

                                 ANNA
                        What are you doing here?

                                 BOB
                        I was... Just passing by. Saw you. 
                        Were you meeting someone?

                                 ANNA
                        What? No. No, I was... No.
                             (gestures to the table)
                        Well... Let’s...

           They both sit down. Both trying to act normal. Bob’s eyes 
           scan the restaurant. Who was she here to meet?

           Bob notices a HANDSOME MAN walk into the restaurant. He looks 
           around, scanning the room, then sits at a table by himself. 

           Bob sees TWO ARAB MEN sitting in the corner. Hushed 
           conversation. At another table a BALD MAN IN A SUIT talking 
           on his cell. Everyone looking suspicious to him. 

                                 ANNA
                        So, where were you heading?

           A tense pause as Bob takes a second too long to come up with-

                                 BOB
                        Donatello’s. Just up the street. 

           She can see the lie in his eyes. He sees that she sees. 

                                 BOB
                             (turning the tables)
                        This place is kind of far for you 
                        to come for lunch, isn’t it?

                                 ANNA
                        Oh... Well... The food’s excellent. 

           Bob stares right through her. She feels it. Who’s lying now?  

                                 BOB
                        So, what’s good?

           Anna picks up the menu. Is her hand shaking slightly?

                                 ANNA
                        The... Ah... Gnocchi. 

           A WAITER approaches their table. 

                                 BOB
                        Two gnocchi, please. 

           Bob smiles at her. She smiles back. The charade continues.

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s late. The house dark. Bob sits watching TV, but not 
           really watching. Pre-occupied. He looks towards the kitchen.

           Anna passes by the doorway. She grabs a CARVING KNIFE from a 
           wooden knife holder and walks out of view. 

           THE KITCHEN - Anna’s at the counter chopping up a late night 
           snack. Her expression similar to Bob’s. The suspicion and 
           tension from today’s lunch still running through them both.   

           THE LIVING ROOM - The CHOPPING SOUND stops. Bob looks over...

           Anna stands in the doorway. The light from the kitchen behind 
           her, covering her in almost complete shadow. 

                                 ANNA
                        Heading to bed. 

                                 BOB
                        Be up soon. 

           Anna walks upstairs. Bob just sits there. Thinking.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The dead of night. The room dark. Bob wakes up in bed. He 
           slowly turns over and sees... 

           Anna is sitting up in bed and staring at him. 

           Bob’s startled. Something creepy as hell about it. 

                                 BOB
                        What are you doing?

                                 ANNA
                        Nothing. Couldn’t sleep.

           Anna slowly lies down with her head on the pillow. Bob slowly 
           turns around, his back to her again.

           His eyes drift to the mirror on the wall. In the reflection 
           he can see that Anna is staring at the back of his head.

           One of her arms is hidden under the blanket. A slight bulge. 
           Is she holding something?

           QUICK FLASH OF MEMORY - Earlier tonight. Anna, covered in 
           shadow, the kitchen behind her. 
                                      New Revision3

           CLOSE ON - The wooden knife holder in the kitchen behind her. 
           One of the slots empty. She didn’t put the knife back.

           BACK TO THE BEDROOM

           Bob’s eyes stay on the reflection of Anna’s hand under the 
           blanket. 

           Bob sees his boots by the bed. He slowly, quietly reaches out 
           and grabs one of the boots. He pulls out something hidden in 
           the heel... A SMALL BLADE.  

           He holds the blade at the ready. Watching Anna’s reflection. 

                                 BOB
                        Why are you staring at me?

                                 ANNA
                        I’m not.

           In the mirror Bob sees that she’s still staring at his head. 

           He slowly turns over to face her... 

           Her eyes are closed. Bob stares at her a moment, then slowly 
           turns back. In the mirror he sees her eyes are still closed. 

           His hand quietly places the blade back in his boot.  

           INT. STRANGE WINDING HALLWAYS - UNKNOWN TIME

           Once again, Bob wanders through the strange, dimly lit halls. 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                             (scared - desperate)
                        Bob?!

           Bob sees the METALLIC DOOR at the end of the hall. Where 
           Anna’s voice is coming from. He rushes to it, through it... 

           A DARKENED ROOM - Anna’s there. She rushes to Bob. 

                                 ANNA
                             (relieved to see him)
                        Bob! You found me!

           Bob hugs her. Overjoyed. She hands him something... 

                                 ANNA
                             (whisper)
                        You need this.

           Bob looks at what she’s put in his hands. 
                                      New Revision3

           A gun. He pulls back from Anna’s embrace and sees...

           Her FACE IS FLUCTUATING BETWEEN DOZENS OF OTHER FACES. 

           Bob jumps back in horror. The BUZZ OF ELECTRICITY SUDDENLY 
           BLARING. Her face stops fluctuating and settles on a new 
           face... The same ARAB WITH BLUE EYES. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Bob wakes up abruptly in bed. Anna’s not there as usual. 

           Something’s BUZZING. Bob realizes it’s his phone. He looks at 
           it. Whatever he sees disturbs him. He turns on the TV.

           ON THE TV - The news is going nuts. A TERRORIST ATTACK. A 
           bomb has exploded at the US embassy in Rome. Images of the 
           embassy on fire. Emergency crews running around. Chaos.  

           INT. THE CIA - MORNING

           The building is buzzing. A frantic energy in the air as the 
           agency tries to get on top of today’s attack. 

           Bob, Sandra, and several other analysts sit watching SECURITY 
           CAMERA FOOTAGE of the explosion. 

           SECURITY CAM - A WOMAN IN A FULL BODY BURQA walks towards the 
           front of the embassy. The woman starts to yell something. 
           Several SECURITY GUARDS immediately rush towards her. They 
           grab her. There’s a brief struggle and then...

           A horrible BLINDING FLASH OF WHITENESS as the woman explodes, 
           taking everyone around her and the security camera with her.

                                 BOB
                        Take me back to five seconds before 
                        the blast and slow it down. 

           The FOOTAGE REWINDS to the struggle between the woman and the 
           guards. It starts MOVING FORWARDS again in SLOW MOTION. 

           Just before the bomb goes off the guard rips off part of the 
           burqa... Revealing the woman’s face for a split second. 

                                 BOB
                        Freeze it on her face and enhance.

           The image freezes on the woman’s face. ZOOMS IN closer...

           It's Alima. The woman they took out in the truck. The exact 
           same face.
                                         Revision

           Bob stares at the image. Dumbfounded. Unable to believe it. 

           INT. CIA CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

           A room full of analysts including Sandra and Davis. Bob 
           stands in front of side by side images of Alima's face, and 
           the face of the woman who blew up the embassy. 

                                 BOB
                        Facial recognition software hasn't 
                        been much help because of the poor 
                        quality of the image, but, our eyes 
                        can see, what our eyes can see.

           The whole room is silent. No one knows what to make of this. 

                                 DAVIS
                        So, what are we talking about here? 
                        Twin sister suicide bombers? 

                                 SANDRA
                        Alima Ahmed’s family history shows 
                        three older brothers. No sisters.

                                 RANDOM ANALYST
                        Are we sure she was really in the 
                        truck when we hit it?

                                 BOB
                        We reviewed the UAV footage. 
                        There's no doubt Alima Ahmed got 
                        into that truck and that she was 
                        still in it when we hit it. And no 
                        one walked away from that truck.

                                 DAVIS
                        So, what am I looking at here?

           Bob looks at the identical faces of the two women. He seems 
           to want to say something... Suggest something... But then... 

                                 BOB
                        I don’t know, sir. I just don’t 
                        know.

                                 SANDRA
                        Is that the same-

                                 BOB
                        -desert Alima’s truck came from?  

                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah. Did we reposition 103 there?

                                 SANDRA
                        Roger that.
                             (to another analyst)
                        Display 103’s telemetry on screen 
                        six, please.

           An AERIAL VIEW of the desert appears on the wall screen.   

                                 BOB
                        Could take weeks to scan the whole 
                        desert.

                                 SANDRA

                        we’re looking for.
                             (turns to Bob)
                        What are we looking for?

           Bob’s eyes scan the desert for... Something... Anything... 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

           The other analysts have left for the night. Bob’s alone. The 
           only one still at it. Scanning the endless, empty desert. 

           CNN is on one of the screens. TALKING HEADS debating...
                                         Revision

                                 TALKING HEAD
                        This attack couldn’t have come at a 
                        worse time for the agency, and 
                        plays right into the narrative the 
                        Chinese have been pushing, that the 
                        drone program is creating more 
                        terrorists than it’s stopping.  

           Bob’s eyes listlessly scan across the wall screen displaying 
           the desert. Across the data being fed from the drone... 

           The drone’s altitude... Speed... Exact GPS position...  

           Bob’s eyes stop on the GPS data. An idea occurring to him.

           He gets up and walks to another desk. Roots through the 
           drawer until he finds...

           The shipping manifests anonymously mailed to the CIA. He 
           looks at the highlighted GPS coordinates. Considers for a 
           moment whether this is a good idea, then-

                                 BOB
                             (into headset)
                        103, I need you to reposition to 
                        coordinates 45 north by 62 west.

                                 DRONE PILOT (V.O.)
                        Copy that, control. Repositioning. 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - LATER

           Bob’s drifting off a bit. All alone in the dark room. His 
           eyes slightly closing when...

                                 DRONE PILOT (V.O.)
                        Control, we’re at those coordinates 
                        you specified.

           Bob sits up. Rubs his eyes and adjusts his headset. Looks at 
           the image on the wall screen ahead of him... 

           Just another patch of desert. 

                                 BOB
                        103, enhance by fifty percent. 

           The image from the drone zooms in tighter on the desert. 
           Though the image is grainier, more details are visible. Sand. 
           Rocks. Shrubs. Bob sees something... 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        103, enhance grid... 48 by 56.  
                                         Revision

           The image zooms in on a specific spot. Revealing...  

           Tire tracks. At a certain point, the tracks seem to come to a 
           dead stop.  As if the vehicle that left them just vanished. 

           Bob picks up the anonymous GPS coordinates. Stares at them.

                                 BOB
                             (softly - to himself)
                        Who are you?

           CLOSE ON the image of the desert. This DISSOLVES INTO...

           RIPPLES OF WATER. The ripples slowly stop and the water 
           calms, revealing a REFLECTION OF BOB’S FACE... 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Bob’s in the bath. A far off, pensive expression. A million 
           questions running through his mind. A million worries. A 
           stereo by the tub PLAYS MUSIC SOFTLY.

           A KNOCK. Anna opens the door and walks in. She sits on the 
           side of the tub. Seems thoughtful. Sad. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I had this whole speech planned...
                             (trails off - hesitant)
                        What do you think about... Going 
                        away somewhere. Maybe for awhile.   

           Bob doesn’t respond. Just watches her. What’s she up to?

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I just feel like... Something’s 
                        gone wrong. With us. 
                             (looks to him)
                        Don’t you feel it? 

           Bob stays stoic. Trying to read her. Giving away nothing.

                                 BOB
                        And my job?

                                 ANNA
                        Well... 
                             (okay here goes...)
                        I think your job is part of the 
                        problem. A big part. 

           Now Bob gets it. That’s what this is about.  
                                      New Revision1

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I know I agreed to this life... 

           As Anna keeps talking, Bob’s eyes drift to the stereo plugged 
           into the wall. He realizes how close it is to the tub.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (far off sounding)
                        ...I just feel like we need to do 
                        something drastic. 

           Anna’s words start to sound far off and quieter to Bob.  

           Whether absentmindedly or deliberately is unclear, but... 
           Anna’s hand moves right behind the stereo.  

           Anna’s still talking but Bob can’t hear a word. All his 
           attention now on the stereo. Anna’s hand. The wire plugged 
           into the wall... All it takes is one little push.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Bob?

           Bob snaps out of it. Looks away from the stereo. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Are you even listening to me?

                                 BOB
                        I’m listening. You’re trying to 
                        convince me to leave the CIA. 

                                 ANNA
                        See. That. Right there. The way 
                        you’re looking at me. Like you’re 
                        accusing me of something. 

                                 BOB
                        You’re trying to get me to leave my 
                        job.  

                                 ANNA
                        I’m trying to get you to leave your 
                        job at your job. When you’re home, 
                        we barely speak. Every chance you 
                        get you escape to that damn shed. 

                                 BOB
                             (angry - snaps a bit)
                        Can you just stay out of the shed? 
                        Is it so terrible I have one place 
                        that’s mine?

           Bob knows instantly he shouldn’t have gotten that mad. Anna 
           shakes her head, gets up to leave.   

                                 BOB
                        Wait...

           She storms out of the bathroom. Slams the door. 

           Bob unplugs the stereo from the wall, abruptly CUTTING OFF 
           THE MUSIC. Leans back. Rubs his hands on his face.

                                 ANNA (PRE-LAP)
                        So, what’s the big secret?

           INT. BOB’S SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Younger Bob. In a suit. Stands in his small, sparse 
           apartment. He looks nervous. Something weighing on him.  

                                 BOB
                        What?

           Anna comes out of the washroom. Dressed for a night out.

                                 ANNA
                        Where you taking me?

                                 BOB
                        You’ll see.

                                 ANNA
                        How do I look?

                                 BOB
                             (smiles - genuine)
                        Perfect. 

           She grabs her purse. Heads for the door but sees Bob isn’t 
           following. Frozen in place. Staring at the floor. 

                                 ANNA
                        What’s wrong?

           He looks up at her. Seems to be rallying his courage.

                                 BOB
                        I want to show you something before 
                        we go.
           INT. BOB’S SMALL APARTMENT - HOME OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob leads Anna into his office. He slowly walks to a large 
           wall mounted painting. He pulls it off the wall (just like 
           how he hides his hidden chart in the shed) revealing...

           A COMPLEX CHART of CIA documents. Photos of wanted men. 
           Tracking their every movement. Contacts. Behavior. Etc.   

           When Anna sees the chart, her mood instantly turns serious. 
           She can tell somehow her world is about to turn upside down.

                                 ANNA
                        Bob, what... What are you doing?

                                 BOB
                        It’s what I’m not doing. I’m not 
                        working for a consulting firm. 

           Anna walks to the chart. Everything about it feels dangerous. 
           She knows instinctively what it means. Who Bob really is.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I get it if this is all... Too 
                        much. Guess that’s why I waited so 
                        long to tell you. Was afraid it 
                        would be.   

           Anna looks over at Bob. Trying to digest it all.  

                                 BOB  (CONT’D)
                        I’m telling you now because... I 
                        don’t want there to be any secrets 
                        between us...  

           Bob pulls a small ring box out of his pocket. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        ...For the rest of our lives. 

           Anna’s mouth opens as Bob gets down on one knee. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I was gonna wait till the 
                        restaurant, but...

           Bob opens the box, revealing the ring inside. 

           He keeps his eyes on the ground. Too nervous to look at her. 

                                 BOB
                             (really vulnerable)
                        If you can’t, I understand. I 
                        just... I had to tell you before...

           Her hand touches his face. He looks up at her. Terrified.

           She smiles down at him. Tears in her eyes. She takes the 
           ring. Slips it on her finger.  

                                 ANNA
                        It fits.

           Bob smiles. Happier than he’s ever been in his life.  

                                 BOB
                             (quoting the night they 
                              met)
                        They fit perfectly. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bob, his hair still wet from the bath, pulls on a track suit. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Bob walks down the stairs. Through the living room. The house 
           feels dark. Empty. Quiet. 

           Bob walks through the kitchen and out the back door...

           EXT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Bob walks through the backyard to the shed... 

           INT. BACKYARD SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Bob walks into the shed and sees...

           Anna is standing in the shed.

           She’s found the secret chart documenting her every move. She 
           turns from the chart and looks at Bob. Her eyes wet and red. 

                                 ANNA
                             (quivering voice)
                        Bob, what... What are you doing?

           Bob's a deer in headlights. He wasn't prepared for this. He 
           slowly, instinctively starts to back away from her...

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Bob, what the hell is this?

           He just stares at her. Shock and adrenaline coursing.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Bob?!

                             (quiet - intense)
                        Who are you?

                                 ANNA
                        What?

                                 BOB
                        Tell me who you are.

                                 ANNA
                        Jesus, Bob, what the hell is wrong 
                        with you, I’m your god damn wife!

           Bob lunges towards her... All the suspicion and tension Bob's 
           been hiding for months now exploding to the surface. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Who are you working for?!

                        Bob, stop it, you’re scaring me!

           She tries to get away, but he grabs her by the arms.  

                                 BOB (CONT’D)

                                         Revision

           Anna fights her way free of him. Barrels out of the shed and  
           sprints across the lawn. Runs off down the street. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - MULTIPLE ROOMS - NIGHT

           Bob locks the front door. Locks the back door.   

           In the den, Bob moves aside a copy of GRAVITY’S RAINBOW on 
           his bookshelf, revealing a small sleek safe. Inside the safe 
           is a stack of bills, several passports and... A revolver. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob, revolver in hand, paces the room. Not sure what to do 
           with himself. The Rubicon’s been passed and he knows it. 

           He sits in a chair. PAN AWAY from Bob... To the painting on 
           the wall. Bob and Anna’s joined symbol. This DISSOLVES TO...

           THE DESERT... From a drone’s hovering POV...

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - MORNING

           Bob sits staring at the mysterious patch of desert on the 
           wall screen. Sandra enters the room...

                                 SANDRA
                        Find any messages in the sand yet? 
                             (takes in Bob’s 
                              appearance)
                        You been at this all night? 

                                 BOB
                        Take a look at this. 

           Bob zooms in and enhances multiple spots on the desert floor. 
           Each with a set of tire tracks that all come to an abrupt 
           stop at roughly the same location. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        There’s just under a dozen 
                        different tracks that lead in from 
                        the desert and stop at this point. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Maybe a sand storm or something 
                        covered the rest up?

                                 BOB
                        No. Look how abruptly they stop.
                                      New Revision1

           It does appear that the tire tracks simply cut off abruptly. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Now watch this.

           The image changes to a wider INFRARED VIEW of the desert. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Infrared shows that every four 
                        hours or so... This happens. 

           A HEAT BLOOM flares up from a spot on the desert floor. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        A heat bloom. At this exact spot. 

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s the desert. There’s 
                        temperature fluctuations. 

                                 BOB
                        In the middle of the night? 
                        Contained to one area?

                                 SANDRA
                        So, what are you thinking? Was 
                        there something at this location 
                        that got moved?

                                 BOB
                             (shakes his head)
                        I don’t know. 

           They both sit quietly staring at the patch of desert.

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - FRONT HALL - AFTERNOON

           A KNOCK at the front door. Bob cautiously approaches. Peers 
           through the peephole. Relaxes slightly. Opens the door... 

                                 MAX
                        Hey, buddy.

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Max sits on the couch. Bob in a chair across the room.

                        Anna’s at my place. She’s pretty 
                        shaken up.

           Max keeps waiting for a response from Bob, but getting none.

                        Bob? What happened?

           Bob looks up at him. How does he even begin to explain?

                                 BOB
                        Have you... Have you ever been so 
                        sure of something... Something you 
                        couldn’t explain, couldn’t prove... 
                        But sure with every ounce of your 
                        being that it was true?

                        I don’t know. Maybe.

                                 BOB
                        Max, if you’ve ever trusted me, you 
                        have to trust me now. The woman 
                        staying in your house is not your 
                        sister. She’s not my wife. She’s 
                        not Anna.

           Max tries his best to contain his shock. It’s one thing to 
           hear Anna explain it. Quite another to see it in person.

                                 MAX
                             (trying to be delicate)
                        Okay. Then who is she?

                                 BOB
                        I don’t know. 

                                 MAX
                        Bob, people change, over the course- 

           Bob stands up. Frustrated. Max doesn’t get it. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Anna says you’ve been following her 
                        around. Video taping her? 

           Bob looks to the ground. It all sounds so crazy coming out of 
           Max’s mouth. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        How long has this been going on?

                        this is all because of some sort of 
                        brain injury?

                        Can you at least entertain the 
                        possibility... The possibility... 
                        That you might need some help. 

           Bob shakes his head. Looks down. Exasperated. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I know someone you can talk to. If 
                        not for Anna, then for me. 

           Bob looks up. Locks eyes with Max. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        On one condition. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t trust her.

                        Bob-

                        If I’m going to entertain your 
                        theory, then you entertain mine.

           Bob rests his head on the couch. Dr. Carter behind him.

                                 DR. CARTER
                        I’d like to talk about the weekend 
                        in DC again.

                        Why do we have to keep going over 
                        these memories?

                                 DR. CARTER
                        Because it’s important how you 
                        remember them. 

           Bob stares off into the ether. Remembering...

           IN BOB’S MIND - QUICK FLASHES FROM THAT WEEKEND...

           Bob and Anna walking into the Ritz... 

           Having dinner in the hotel restaurant... 

           Bob says goodbye to Anna outside their room... 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        I was called into work, but it was 
                        just a ruse to separate us. 

           Bob in his car, on the phone with work...

                                 BOB
                        Hey. So, you know why I got called 
                        into the office?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Called in? Nobody called you in.

           BAM! A WHITE VAN SMASHES INTO THE SIDE OF BOB’S CAR. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WASHINGTON DC - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Bob lies in a hospital bed with a bandage on his head. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        My car was sideswiped. Hit and run. 

           He slowly opens his eyes. Disoriented.  

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        There were four hours between when 
                        I was hit and when the hospital was 
                        able to finally get ahold of Anna. 

           The door to the room opens. A DOCTOR and Anna walk in.

           Anna rushes over and hugs Bob. Seems overjoyed he’s alright.

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        What happened when you saw her?

           BOB’S POV - EVERYTHING SLOWS DOWN. CLOSE ON little details of 
           Anna’s face. Her mouth speaking... Eyes scanning...

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        It started out as a feeling. An 
                        instinct. Nothing more. I kept 
                        trying to dismiss it, but... I 
                        couldn’t fight the sensation that I 
                        didn’t know this woman.

           PUSH IN CLOSE on Anna’s face moving in SLOW MOTION. We see 
           her as Bob does... Some sort of menacing intent in her eyes.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        That the woman I left in the hotel 
                        room... The woman I fell in love 
                        with... Was not the woman sitting 
                        next to me.

           Dr. Carter’s hugely interested in all this. Jotting notes.

                             (renewed certainty)
                        Our anniversary in DC. That was it. 
                        That was when they took her. 

           INT. THE CIA - BERNIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob walks into Bernie’s office. 

                                 BOB
                        Anything?

                        Well, luckily pretty much every 
                        head of state stays at the Ritz 
                        when they visit DC, so naturally... 
                             (hands Bob a thumb drive)

           INT. BACKYARD SHED - NIGHT

           Bob’s huddled over his laptop. Reviewing security camera 
           footage from the Ritz on the weekend of his anniversary. 

                                 BERNIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...It’s in this footage somewhere.    

           HOTEL SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE - A high angle security camera. 
           Bob and Anna walk in the front doors of the Ritz Carlton. 

           RESTAURANT SECURITY CAM - That night, Bob and Anna in the 
           hotel restaurant. They ask a WAITRESS to take their picture. 

           HALLWAY SECURITY CAM - Bob and Anna arrive at their room. Bob 
           stops Anna. Starts to make out with her in the hall.  

           Bob (in the shed) watches with a deep sadness. This was the 
           last moment he remembers with his wife. His real wife.

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bob sits watching telemetry of the desert. (The parallel to 
           watching footage from his anniversary, unmistakable.)

           Bob seems beat. He starts to pack up to leave. 

                                 IMAGE ANALYST
                        Sir!

           Bob turns back. On the wall screen he sees...

           A truck. Heading through the desert. In the direction of the 
           mysterious patch of desert.  

                                 BOB
                             (excited)
                        Enhance that vehicle.

                                 IMAGE ANALYST
                        Already on it. 

           The drone camera zooms in. CLOSE ON the truck, then...

           It vanishes.

           Bob jumps up from his chair.

                                 BOB
                        What happened?!

           INT. BACKYARD SHED - NIGHT

           Bob reviewing the Ritz Carlton security footage...

           HOTEL SECURITY CAM - The hallway outside Bob and Anna’s room 
           the next morning. Bob kisses Anna in the doorway of their 
           room, then turns and leaves. Anna goes back into the room. 

           Bob (in the shed) fast-forwards the footage until... 

           TWO ROOM SERVICE WAITERS arrive at Anna’s room. Pushing a 
           long cart with a white sheet over it. Anna opens the door and 
           lets them in the room.  

           Bob fast-forwards the footage again. Looking at the time 
           code... 1 minute passes... 5 minutes... 10 minutes... Bob 
           can’t believe this... What’s going on in that room? 

           Finally the door opens again. The waiters leave Anna’s room. 

           Bob freezes the image on the lead waiter’s face. Studies it. 
           Something familiar to Bob. He goes back to earlier footage...

           THE LOBBY - When Bob and Anna first arrived. Behind them...

           The same man walks into the hotel behind them. 

           He’s in a suit. Definitely not a room service waiter. Bob 
           fast forwards too...

           HOTEL RESTAURANT - Bob and Anna getting their picture taken. 
           A few tables away from them... The same man. Watching them. 

           Bob goes back to the moment the waiters brought the room 
           service. The “lead waiter” leans over Anna’s food. He’s doing 
           something. Is he pouring something on the food? 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bob watches the drone feed of the truck disappearing on a 
           loop in SLOW MOTION. The truck gets to roughly the position 
           the other tire tracks end... And it simply disappears. No 
           puff of smoke. Just gone.  

                                 BOB
                        It’s got to be a problem with the 
                        drone camera.

                                 BOB
                        Then the feed must have cut out.

                                 IMAGE ANALYST
                        There was no interruption in the 
                        signal. We never stopped recording. 

                                 BOB
                        Well it couldn’t have just 
                        disappeared!

           Bob stands with his hands on his hips. Frustrated.  

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Enhance the truck as much as 
                        possible. 

           The drone image zooms in on the truck.  

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        That marking on the side... Can we 
                        clean that up?

           A small mark on the bottom corner of the truck slowly de-
           pixilates... It’s a logo of some kind... It says...

           ZTS.

           Bob quickly flips through the anonymously mailed shipping 
           manifest. Excited. The pieces starting to come together. 

           He sees the same logo all over the document - ZTS. 

           INT. BACKYARD SHED - NIGHT

           Bob reviewing the hotel footage... 

           After the suspicious room service waiters leave Anna’s room, 
           Bob fast forwards... 1 hour passes... 2 hours... 3 hours... 

           Until finally... “Anna” walks out of the room. 

           Bob freezes the footage. He studies Anna’s face. Is this the 
           same woman? Is this the moment the imposter arrived? Hard to 
           tell if it’s our imagination but something feels different. 
           Her gait more confident. Her gaze colder. 

           PUSH IN CLOSE on “Anna’s” face until it’s just pixels... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE tries to identify the man tailing 
           Bob and Anna at the Ritz. (Very visually similar to the “man 
           with shifting features” in Bob’s reoccurring dreams.)

           A match pops up.

           INT. THE CIA - BERNIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob huddles over Bernie’s shoulder at the computer. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT’D)
                        Weapons manufacturer. They’re like 
                        the Raytheon of China. We think 
                        they’re in essence a corporate arm 
                        of Beijing but we can’t prove it. A 
                        few recent cyber attacks were 
                        linked back to ZTS. 

           Bob lets this sink in. Grave concern over the implications. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT’D)
                        I uh... I couldn’t help but notice 
                        Anna was in the Ritz footage. 

           Bob says nothing. He’s caught. It’s awkward for both of them.

                                 BERNIE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell’s going on, Bob?

           EXT. THE CIA - OUTDOOR COURTYARD - DAY

           Bob and Bernie sit on a bench in a little courtyard outside 
           the CIA cafeteria. From Bernie’s disturbed expression, it’s 
           clear Bob’s just brought him up to date. 

                                 BERNIE
                             (not sure what to say)
                        So... It’s a person that looks like 
                        Anna? 

                                 BOB
                        I understand how it sounds. I...

           He trails off. Thinking. Something occurring to him.

                                 BOB
                        What if it’s not a person that 
                        looks like Anna. 

           Bob looks at Bernie. Bernie chuckles. Bob doesn’t.

                        The atom bomb was just science 
                        fiction until the world saw a

                        Hell, how long ago were drones 
                        science fiction? This could be the 
                        new frontier in espionage-

                        since your accident. 

           Bob gets up. Doesn’t want to hear this again.

                                 BOB
                        Enjoy the bus, Bernie. 

           Bernie watches him go. Very worried for his friend.

           EXT. ZTS OFFICES - DAY

           Bob sits in his car across from ZTS. An impressive corporate 
           tower. Their slogan... “Tomorrow’s Technology Today.”

           Bob films the front of the building. Corporate looking people 
           walking in and out. Nothing out of place. 

           Through the front window, Bob can see an old, STERN LOOKING 
           MAN sitting at the reception desk. The man gets up, seemingly 
           off for his lunch break, and is replaced by a nervous looking 
           YOUNG FEMALE RECEPTIONIST.  

           Bob shuts off the camera. Starts his car.

                        The heat blooms have continued 
                        unabated every four to six hours.

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Bob stands in front of the wall screen at the front of the 
           room delivering a debrief to Davis who listens stoically. 
           Sandra and several other analysts have gathered as well. 

                                 BOB
                        As for the truck vanishing, we 
                        figure it comes down to two 
                        options. Either the drone was 
                        faulty or something interfered with 
                        its ability to record telemetry in 
                        this area.   

           Davis watches the recording of the truck disappearing over 
           and over on a loop. He holds the anonymously mailed envelope 
           containing the GPS coordinates in his hand. 

                                 DAVIS
                             (re: envelope)
                        And the whole reason we have eyes 
                        on this area is because of this 
                        anonymous package?

                                 BOB
                        Yes, sir. Shipping manifests from 
                        the Chinese defence contractor ZTS.   

                                 DAVIS
                        Do you have anything linking this 
                        area to our twin suicide bombers?

                                 BOB
                        Both originated from this area.

                                 DAVIS
                        Meaning what? 

           Bob hesitates. Does he really want to articulate his theory?  

                                 BOB
                        We all know suicide attacks have 
                        increased dramatically in the last 
                        few months. What if these aren’t 
                        random radicals blowing themselves 
                        up? What if this is all part of a 
                        larger plan? 

                                 DAVIS
                             (skeptical)
                        Explain.
                                         Revision

                                 BOB
                             (speaking fast - excited)
                        If you were a foreign power that 
                        wanted to bring down America’s 
                        drone armada, you couldn’t do it 
                        through force. You’d do it through 
                        international pressure. Through 
                        manipulating public opinion. And 
                        every one of these attacks is being 
                        used to prove that the drone 
                        program is not working. That it’s 
                        only creating more radicals.  

                                 DAVIS
                        What exactly are you recommending?

                                 BOB
                        I think at the very least we need 
                        to send a team out here to 
                        investigate this area.

           Davis looks at the envelope with the GPS. His stern face 
           revealing nothing. Bob waits. Confident he’s made his case.

                                 DAVIS
                        No.

                                 BOB
                        No?

                                 DAVIS
                        Until we have some proof that- 

                                 BOB
                             (loud - angry)
                        Something is happening in this 
                        desert.

                                 DAVIS
                             (to the room)
                        Give us a minute, please.

           Everyone but Bob and Davis starts to clear out. All of them 
           feeling the tension. Sandra shoots Bob a “behave yourself” 
           glance. As soon as Bob and Davis are alone...

                                 DAVIS
                        Bob, you have no proof anything is 
                        even going on in this desert.  

                                 BOB
                        How about the fact that trucks 
                        disappear when they drive into it? 
                        Like it’s the Bermuda Triangle!

                                 DAVIS
                             (stern - had enough)
                        Bob.
                             (turns to leave)
                        Bring me more than marks in the 
                        sand, faulty drone telemetry and 
                        wild theories about new weapons. 
                        Bring me something real. 

           Bob stands alone in the room. Staring at the carpet. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Bob looks at his reflection in the mirror. Closes his eyes 
           and exhales. Preparing himself for what’s about to happen.

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Bob walks into the living room where Max is already sitting. 
           Beside him on the couch... Anna. 

           She makes only brief, tentative eye contact with Bob. She’s a 
           shaky mix of emotions. Anger. Grief. Confusion.  

           Bob sits down on the opposite side of the room. His eyes on 
           Anna. As if she could lunge out and attack at any second.  

                                 MAX
                        So, Bob, I’ve spoken to a friend of 
                        mine at Berkeley. A psychology 
                        professor. He’s been educating me 
                        on something called Capgras 
                        Syndrome. Have you heard of it?

           Bob says nothing. All his attention still on Anna.  

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Well, it’s a...
                             (tries to be delicate)
                        ... It’s a form of schizophrenia. 

           Anna wipes her eye. Just hearing the word, disturbs her. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        People who suffer from it believe 
                        that people very close to them have 
                        been replaced by identical looking 
                        imposters. They’ve been conducting 
                        a study on it at Berkley for years.  

           Max puts a disk on the table. 
                                         Revision

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        These are interviews they’ve 
                        conducted with patients for their 
                        case study. My friend thought it 
                        might be useful for you to see 
                        these. Realize it’s not just you. 
                        That you’re not alone.  

           Bob doesn’t even look at the disk. Not buying any of this. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (to Anna)
                        You have anything you want to say?

           Anna tries to steady herself. Keeps her eyes down.

                                 ANNA
                        Bob, I know that recently things 
                        have... Well... We’ve had better 
                        days. I know some of it’s because 
                        of your work. The stress you’re 
                        under. And maybe...
                             (hesitates, seems guilty)
                        ...I haven’t been there for you 
                        lately.   

           She stops. Max squeezes her arm. Encouraging her. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I should have realized earlier that 
                        something was wrong with you. It 
                        was... It was the way you looked at 
                        me. I saw it, but I didn’t...

           She stops. Gathers herself then finally looks up at him. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t pretend to understand 
                        exactly what’s happening with you, 
                        but... I just want you to know... 
                        This feeling... About me. However 
                        strong it is... Just know that I am 
                        your wife. And I love you. 

           She stares at him, desperately needing him to say something. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Do you... I mean... 
                             (vulnerable, confused)
                        Do you not love me anymore?

                              conviction...)

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        I love my wife. Before I met her I 
                        was... Just a bunch of broken 
                        pieces masquerading as a human 
                        being. And she put the pieces 
                        together. She’s the only one that 
                        ever could. 

           Tears start to sneak down Anna’s face as she listens. She’s 
           never heard Bob speak like this. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        But you...
                             (leans forwards)
                        ... Are... Not... My... Wife. 
                             (lets it hang in the air)
                        And I’d rather live with only my 
                        memories of her, than betray her by 
                        spending another second with you.   

           Anna stares back in absolute shock. Bob’s words 
           simultaneously the most romantic and most unimaginably 
           hurtful thing she’s ever heard. 

           Even Max is too shocked to speak. Bob’s absolute conviction 
           in ripping Anna’s heart right out of her chest.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob peers through the curtains in the front window, watching 
           Anna and Max walk away from the house. 

           Anna suddenly collapses, as if her legs just gave out. 
           Sobbing uncontrollably. Utterly shattered to her soul. Max 
           has to steady her. 

           Bob watches silently. The first trace of regret starts to 
           crawl across his face.

           Her pain is so genuine. So intense. So real. 

           Bob slowly sits down. The room incredibly quiet and empty.

                        You must have at least considered 
                        the idea that... All of this may be 
                        in your head?

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Bob sits quietly eating dinner at the kitchen table. He looks 
           to the opposite end of the table. The empty seat. Something 
           sad and lonely about him now eating alone.

                        That it’s you that’s changed. Not 
                        Anna.

           Bob’s eyes drift to the living room table. The disc Max left.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Bob shuts off the lights. Getting ready to turn in. Again, 
           his eyes drift to the disk Max left. On the table. Untouched. 

           He turns and walks out of the room. A beat, then-

           The lights suddenly come back on. Bob grabs the disc. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Bob sits at the computer. Watching the video Max gave him. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        No. I’ve seen things. Clues. 

           THE VIDEO - A bad resolution image of an interview with a 
           Capgras sufferer, TRISH. Late 40s. Perfectly normal looking.  

                                 TRISH
                        It was just after my dad moved in 
                        with us. I started noticing things.

                        Things going missing. Things of 
                        mine he was taking. Toothbrush. My 
                        jewelry. That’s when I knew.

                        Don’t you think if you look at 
                        anyone’s life close enough, they’ll 
                        start to seem strange. Suspicious.

           Bob watches another interview...  A disheveled looking man, 
           BILL, 40s, in what appears to be a MENTAL INSTITUTION. 
                                      New Revision1

                                 BILL
                             (southern drawl)
                        Was round ‘bout when she turned 
                        eleven. No. Twelve. That’s when she 
                        started changing.  

                                 OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        What happened when your daughter 
                        turned twelve?

                                 BILL
                        The demon came inside her. It 
                        looked like her. But it wasn’t her 
                        no more.

                                 OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Is that why you locked her in her 
                        room for ten days without food?

           Bill’s face contorts into a quiet sob. An unbearable pain.  

           Bob shuts it off. He can’t watch anymore. Sick to his 
           stomach. The horrible realization sinking in... How sick 
           these people are. How he may be one of them.   

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob sits up. Covers his face with his hands. Lost. Desperate.

                                 BOB
                        Is there something wrong with me?

           Dr. Carter gets up from his chair behind Bob. Kneels next to 
           him. Close. Intimate. Seems to genuinely care for Bob.  

                                 DR. CARTER
                        I know how terrifying it is to 
                        realize you can’t trust your own 
                        mind. Every step you take the sands 
                        shift beneath your feet. 

           Bob looks up at him. Eyes red. Defeated. Scared.

                                 BOB
                             (sincere)
                        What do I do?

                                 DR. CARTER
                        Separate yourself from the person 
                        your illness has fixated on.

           Bob shakes his head. No way.

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bob crawls into bed. Something sad and lonely about him going 
           to bed all alone now. He lies there for a beat. His eyes 
           open. Staring across the room at the empty picture frame. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        I just want the real Anna back. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob sits at his computer. Scanning through dozens of digital 
           photos of him and Anna. 

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re not in love with the real 
                        Anna anymore, Bob.

           CU ON - THE PHOTOS - Them on vacation... Them with their 
           families... Waking up in bed on a lazy Sunday morning... The 
           disparate images of a life spent with another person...

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        The real Anna and the Anna in your 
                        memories have become two separate 
                        people.

           He clicks on a folder labelled “Backups”. Then a sub-folder 
           labeled “Anniversary - Washington”. He finds the one he’s 
           looking for. Him and Anna. The Washington Monument behind.

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        You’re in love with the memory. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Bob puts the photo back in the frame. Sets it on the mantle. 

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re in love with this perfect 
                        picture of the two of you happy.

           He just stands, staring at it in the dark, lonely room.  

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        A picture that exists now only in 
                        your mind.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           A NEWS BROADCAST - AN ANCHOR speaking over images of the UN.
                                      New Revision3

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        The UN today officially drafted a 
                        resolution to launch an 
                        internationally monitored 
                        investigation into the CIA’s covert 
                        drone program.

           PULL BACK from the broadcast revealing it’s on a TV in...

           INT. THE CIA - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bob, Sandra and a room full of analysts watch the TV.  

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        A team of UN inspectors are being 
                        dispatched to the regions most 
                        affected to ascertain the 
                        effectiveness, legality and human 
                        tole of the most controversial 
                        covert program in the world. 

           Davis, at the head of the room, shuts it off. 

                                 DAVIS
                        As you can all see, we’re under a 
                        microscope right now. All pre-
                        planned strikes are being halted 
                        until this heat passes, but we 
                        can’t control what comes out of 
                        nowhere. 

           Everyone in the room seems concerned. Listening attentively. 
           Except Bob. At the back. Seeming distracted. Half listening. 

                                 DAVIS
                        We can’t afford any mistakes, 
                        people. Stay on your toes. 

           Davis nods, dismissing the room. Everyone clears out. 

           Bob leaves slower than the rest. Seeming preoccupied. 

           Davis’ eyes stay on Bob as he leaves. Concerned expression.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Bob looks rough. Unshaven. Thrown together clothes. Starting 
           to even look like a crazy person.  

           Max reads from papers on Capgras printed off the internet. 
                                 MAX
                        Apparently Capgras is caused by 
                        damage to the Amygdala, which can 
                        happen when you have a brain 
                        injury. Like your accident in DC.

           Bob’s only half listening. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (reading from papers)
                        The Amygdala is the part of the 
                        brain that links visual recognition 
                        to emotion. You look at the 
                        person’s face, your brain 
                        recognizes the features, but none 
                        of the emotions you would normally 
                        associate with that face are there.   

           Max picks up the house’s wireless phone. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        They say something that works is to 
                        talk to the person you suspect over 
                        the phone. Because there's nothing 
                        wrong with the part of your brain 
                        that controls hearing.  

           Bob eyes the phone in Max’s hand as if it were radioactive.

                                 BOB
                        Maybe she’s better off without me.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t believe that.

           Max stands up. Sets the phone down beside Bob.

           He leaves. Bob sits at the table. The phone in front of him.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Bob leans against the wall. Phone in his hand. Unsure.

           He slowly dials a number. Closes his eyes. Exhales deeply.  

           INT. BATHROOM STALL - CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Bob, in a tuxedo, exhales deeply. Sitting in a bathroom 
           stall. Not going to the bathroom, just sitting there. SOUNDS 
           OF A PARTY heard through the walls. 

           Head down. Eyes closed. Knee bouncing nervously.  
                                         Revision

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        You ready to do this, buddy?

                                 BOB
                        Be right out. 

           He exhales deeply. Gets up. Flushes the toilet for 
           appearances. Walks out of the stall.      

           We LINGER ON the stall wall... Bob and Anna’s joined symbol, 
           freshly scratched into it. Old habits die hard.  

           INT. CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Anna, escorted by her father, veil across her face, walks 
           down the aisle towards a very nervous Bob. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
                        Bob?

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Bob leans against the wall. Phone to his ear. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over phone)
                        You don’t need to say anything. I 
                        know it’s you. 

           Bob doesn’t move a muscle. He seems terrified. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)(CONT’D)
                             (over phone)
                        I know you can’t control this thing 
                        that’s happening to you. And I 
                        don’t blame you for it. Any of it.  

           Bob listens intently. It sounds like her. Like Anna. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)(CONT’D)
                             (over phone)
                        Just know... It’s me.
                             (starts to cry)
                        I swear to you it’s me. And I love 
                        you. I love you so much, and this 
                        is killing me.  

           He knows it’s her. It’s really her. It’s Anna. 

           Bob's face crinkles into a silent sob. 
                                         Revision

                                 BOB
                        Anna... I’m so sorry. 

           Bob looks over towards the glass back door of the house... 

           Anna’s standing in the backyard. Cell to her ear. Tears 
           rolling down her face. 

           Bob rushes to the door and slides it open. She comes in and 
           wraps her arms around him. Bob grabs on to her. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                             (muffled sobs)
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Bob slowly lifts Anna’s veil... Revealing Anna’s face. The 
           most beautiful she’s ever looked. Tears in her eyes. 

           Bob stares at her face. As if seeing it for the first time. 

           He leans in and kisses her. The whole room STARTS CHEERING.

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Anna holds Bob in her arms on the floor. Rocking back and 
           forth. Both holding onto each other for dear life.

                        Islamabad’s saying there’s nothing 
                        in this desert. We haven’t seen 
                        anymore... Disappearing trucks. 

           Davis notices Bob can’t take his eyes off the desert.

                        I’m fine. 

           Davis taps his fingers. Trying to be delicate about asking...

                                 DAVIS
                        It’s been about... Six months since 
                        your accident, hasn’t it? 

           Bob doesn’t like where this is going.

                             (defensive)
                        About that, yeah. 

                                 DAVIS
                        I just need to be sure you’re a 
                        hundred percent. The whole world’s 
                        watching our every move. 

                                 BOB
                        I’m fine, sir. 

           Bob gets up and leaves. Davis watches him go. 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Bob stands staring at the patch of desert on the wall screen.

                        You know what... Leave it there.

           The analyst gives him an “are you sure” look.

                        It’s fine. But, uh, do me a favor. 
                        Take the telemetry off the big 
                        screen and patch it to my monitor.

           The analyst can smell something wrong. But Bob’s the boss. 
           Bob looks around to see if anyone’s overheard. No one has.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           Bob and Anna give their orders to the waiter.

                                 ANNA
                        The, uh, Teriyaki. Thank you.

           The waiter leaves and the two of them are suddenly alone. 
           They sit silently. Unsure what to say to each other. 

                                 ANNA
                        Should we get an appetizer?

                                 BOB
                        Sure. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh... He took the menus. 

           Bob taps his fingers nervously. Keeps his eyes on the table.

                                 ANNA
                             (searching his face)
                        You still feel it, don’t you?

           He looks up at her. Unsure if he should deny it or not.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (sad)
                        I can see it. The way you look at 
                        me. 

           Bob looks down sheepishly. Nods yes. 

                                 BOB
                             (struggling to articulate)
                        It’s like... My mind knows what 
                        it’s seeing, but...

           He points to his chest. Trying to find the words, but can’t.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s okay. 
                             (Smiles. Genuine.)

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bob and Anna get ready for bed. Anna gets into the bed, but 
           Bob delays. Anna picks up on his hesitation. 

                                 BOB
                             (points to the bathroom)
                        I’m just gonna...

                                 ANNA
                             (no pressure)
                        Sure.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob washes his hands. Looks at his reflection in the mirror.  

           He notices Anna left her cell in the bathroom. Picks it up.

           He slowly puts it back down without looking at it. Like an 
           alcoholic barely managing to turn down a drink. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob quietly crawls into bed next to Anna. He lies on the 
           opposite end of the bed. Stays there for a beat. 

           He slowly turns around. Cautiously, awkwardly, snuggles up 
           next to her. Putting his arm around her.

           Though he can’t see it, Anna smiles. The gesture meaning the 
           world to her. 

           INT. STRANGE WINDING HALLWAYS - UNKNOWN TIME

           Bob wanders through the strange, dimly lit halls. He turns a 
           corner - the walls are now lined with glass. Water on the 
           other side. Like giant fish tanks. 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                             (far off - scared)
                        Bob?... Bob?

           As Bob moves through the winding halls, HUMAN FACES start to 
           slowly emerge from the water tanks on either side of him. 
           SPOOKY BLANK FACES emerging one by one just after Bob passes. 

           Bob rushes through the METALLIC DOOR at the end of the hall.

           THE DARKENED ROOM - Bob can see more of the room now...
                                      New Revision3

           The walls are lined with massive TV SCREENS. (Very similar to 
           the Drone Control Room.) On each screen is a different moment 
           from Bob’s past. A different memory. As if cameras had been 
           recording Bob his entire life... 

           Bob and Anna meeting at the costume party... On the beach at 
           night... Bob proposing to her...  

           One of the screens catches Bob’s attention. It shows what 
           occurred a few seconds ago. Bob wandering through the winding 
           hallways. And behind Bob...  

           The MAN WITH THE FLUCTUATING FACE is following him. 

           Bob’s fear starts to rise. The BUZZ OF ELECTRICITY builds. 

           The man follows Bob through the metallic door... 

           Bob (in the room) spins around... 

           The MAN WITH THE FLUCTUATING FACE is right behind him. The 
           face settles on the same ARAB WITH BLUE EYES. 

           Bob, terrified, looks down at his own hand. Sees that he’s 
           holding the gun Anna gave him in the last dream. 

           He points the gun at the man’s face and fires. On the BANG-

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bob startles awake in bed. Breathing fast. A nightmare.  

           He turns. Looks beside him - expecting he’ll be alone... 

           Anna’s there. Sound asleep. 

           Bob gets up. He walks around to her side of the bed. Looks  
           at her peaceful sleeping face. Serene. Perfect. His wife.   

           INT. BACKYARD SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob looks across the “Anna Chart”. No longer a puzzle to be 
           solved. It’s an abomination. A testament to his sickness. 

           He starts to slowly pull the pieces off. Disassembling it. 

           LATER

           The chart’s almost bare now. Bob stands on a step ladder 
           trying to unscrew the top of the chart from the ceiling. 

           His screwdriver slips and goes through plaster. He sees...
                                      New Revision3

           A BLACK WIRE. Underneath the plaster. Something about it 
           immediately confuses Bob. This shouldn’t be here. 

           He follows the wire... It leads right to the light. Bob 
           loosens the base of the light. Finds the wire leading into... 

           A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

           SURVEILLANCE CAMERA POV - A black and white image. We see 
           Bob. Staring into the camera. Shocked expression.  

           BACK TO THE SHED

           Bob holds the camera in his hand. His mind reeling. The whole 
           time he’s been watching Anna.... Someone’s been watching him.

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bob’s in a panic. All the paranoia he’s tried so hard to 
           suppress, roaring back with a vengeance.  

           SURVEILLANCE CAMERA POV - From a camera hidden in Bob’s TV, 
           we see Bob looking through the living room. Trying to figure 
           out where another camera could... 

           He walks up to the TV. Stares right into our camera’s POV.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - MULTIPLE ROOMS 

           Bob finds another camera behind the mirror of the bathroom...

           Another in the light above the kitchen table...

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           ANGLE ON - Anna, sleeping in bed. PULL BACK revealing...

           Bob standing over her. His gun in his hand. Staring down at 
           her as if she were a monster. 

           EXT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV - DAY

           Through the front window - Anna pacing back and forth. Phone 
           to her ear. Worried. The house is torn apart. Bob’s gone.   

           LATER - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV - AFTERNOON 

           Anna walks out the front door. Gets in her car...

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV - AFTERNOON

           Anna’s car pulls into an almost empty parking lot. 

           She parks next to another car. A BLACK PORSCHE. She gets out 
           of her car and gets in the passenger side of the Porsche.

           LATER - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV 

           Anna gets out of the Porsche and gets into her own car. Both 
           cars drive off in opposite directions. 

           EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP - SUBJECTIVE VIDEO CAMERA POV - LATER

           The Porsche pulls into a car dealership. It parks in the lot. 
           The door opens and...

           It’s the HANDSOME MAN that walked into Sachima and then tried 
           to play it cool. That was who Anna was meeting that day.  

           EXT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Anna’s car pulls in. She gets out and walks to the house. 

           She looks haggard. Exhausted from a day of searching for Bob. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Anna walks into the house and sees...

           The Handsome Man is on his knees. 

           The side of his face bloodied. A terrified expression. 

           Anna turns. Sees Bob. Gun in his hand. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh my god.

                                 BOB
                        Sit down.

           Anna very slowly sits down. Her terrified mind racing. 

                                 BOB
                             (to Anna)
                        Who are you?

                                 ANNA
                        Bob. Put the gun down. 
                                      New Revision1

           Bob points his gun at the Handsome Man’s head.

                                 BOB
                        Who is this? Your handler?

           The Handsome Man turns away. Pressing his face into the wall.

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Paul! Paul! My name’s Paul!

                                 BOB
                        Why’s your license a no-hit?

                                 PAUL (HANDSOME MAN)
                        Wh... What?

                                 BOB
                        Why isn’t your license registered?!

                                 PAUL
                        I... I work at a dealership. The 
                        cars aren’t sold yet.

           Anna, horrified, jumps up from the couch. 

                                 ANNA
                        Bob, listen to me. You’re sick. 
                        You’re very sick. You know this.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t believe you anymore.

           Terrified, she cautiously approaches Bob. 

                                 ANNA
                        Bob, please. You’re about to make a 
                        horrible mistake.  

                                 BOB
                        Why are there cameras in the house?

                                 ANNA
                        Bob, please... You’re confused.
                        If there’s cameras in here, you put 
                        them here. 

                                 BOB
                        Stop lying to me!

           Bob presses the gun right into Paul’s head. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)

                        Bob, Stop!

           Bob has a wild look in his eyes. He’s going to do it!

                                 BOB
                        Tell me where my wife is!

                                 ANNA
                        We had an affair!

           This stops Bob in his tracks. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        We had an affair. Alright.  

           Bob tries to process this. A curveball he wasn’t expecting.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I only met him today to warn him 
                        that you might...

           She starts to break down. Bob listens cautiously. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        We were like strangers for so long. 
                        If I had any idea it was because 
                        you were sick I never would have... 
                             (wipes away tears)
                        As soon as I found out what was 
                        happening with you, I told him it 
                        was over. Told him I had you back. 

           She looks up at Bob. A resolve in her red, teary eyes. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t have you back, do I? As 
                        long as I’m in your life, you’ll 
                        never be free of this thing. 

           A horrible silence. Bob slowly lowers his gun. Looks from 
           Paul, sniveling in the corner, back to Anna.  

                                 BOB
                        My wife, would never do this to me.

           INT. BOB’S CAR - PARKED ON THE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob gets in his car. He starts to punch the roof of the car. 
           Rage and sadness and fear boiling over.

           He leans back and closes his eyes. When he opens them again, 
           he notices something... A black wire sticking out from the 
           rearview mirror. Leading to... Another surveillance camera. 

           Bob yanks the camera out. Stares down the barrel of the lens.

           we’re watching Bob through the window of...   

           INT. DAVIS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Davis watches Bob through his office window. Concerned 
           expression. Davis’ ASSISTANT pops her head in. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        You wanted to see me?

                        Sir. We have a possible code six 
                        coming out of Yemen.

           Everyone snaps to attention. On the wall screen they see

                        where they’ve been before this. 

           The room springs into action. Dozens of drone and satellite

           They all turn to another screen. Footage of the Land Rovers 
           parking in another village. BOMBED OUT BUILDING beside them.

                        spot a month ago with a strike.

           A GROUP OF VILLAGERS carry something towards the Land Rovers. 
           Something large. Covered in a blanket.

                        What is that?

                        The one in front. Get me his face.

           The analysts ZOOM IN on the man greeting the tribal leader. 
           The image SWIVELS. DE-PIXALATES. The face becoming clear...

           It’s an Arab man... With blue eyes. 

           The exact same man from Bob’s dream.  

           As Bob stares at the man’s face, an OMINOUS ELECTRIC BUZZING 
           starts to build in Bob’s ears. 

           BOB’S POV - Focusing on the Arab Man’s face. EVERYTHING SLOWS 
           DOWN. CLOSE ON the little details Bob is digesting... The 
           Arab Man speaking with the villagers... His hands moving... 
           His blue eyes scanning the desert... The curl of his mouth...

           The man’s every movement seeming tinged with menace. The 
           horrible ELECTRIC BUZZING building in Bob’s ears.

           The whole room is razor tense. All the other image analysts 
           seem as worried as Sandra, but Bob’s barreling forwards. 

           Suddenly, something catches Bob’s eye... He looks to the 
           monitor on his desk displaying the mysterious desert...

           Something is moving across the desert. 

           With everyone else’s eyes glued to the big screen, Bob leans 
           in closer to the monitor on his desk. 

           TWO MEN are running through the desert. 

           Bob can’t believe what he’s seeing. Where did they come from?

           Davis’ eyes drift across his desk. To the envelope with the 
           anonymously mailed GPS coordinates. Davis picks up the 
           envelope. Looks at the address written on the envelope. 

           He puts the envelope directly beside Bob’s handwriting in his 
           psych evaluation...

           The handwriting is identical.

           desert. The fleeing man stops. Looks up revealing his face...

           It’s Bob. It’s Bob’s face.

           Bob (in the drone room) stares at the screen in absolute 
           shock. His brain turning upside down.

           He looks over at the rest of the room. Everyone else is glued 
           to the Land Rovers on the wall screen. 

           Bob looks back to his monitor... Frozen in disbelief... 
           Unable to speak. It’s him... It’s his face.

           Across the room he sees AN AGENT looking his way. At the 
           opposite end, ANOTHER AGENT, who quickly looks away.   

           Whether he’s imagining it or not is unclear, but to Bob it 
           feels like everyone is watching him.  

           INT. THE CIA - BERNIE’S OFFICE - LATER

                        Just one second. Would you like a 
                        water or anything?

                                 BOB
                        I’m fine, but... Could I use your 
                        facilities? 
                             (before she can answer)
                        It’s okay. I’ve been here before. I 
                        know where it is.

           As Bob walks off down the hall, we hear the receptionist...

                                 YOUNG FEMALE RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        I have a John Lynch here for Liu? 

           Bob sees doors leading to an office area. His eyes clock a 
           camera on the ceiling. And on the wall... A fire alarm.

           Bob loiters for a second while BUSINESS MEN pass by. He walks 
           to the fire alarm, nonchalantly scratching the side of his 
           face to hide it from the camera. He pulls the alarm. 

           A BLARING ALARM rings throughout the building. 

           Bob walks into the washroom. Keeps the door open a crack.

           Dozens of ZTS EMPLOYEES file past as the building is emptied. 

           Bob waits until there’s no more people, then slips out.

           Goes through the doors into the main office area. Standard 
           corporate. Rows of cubicles. Offices. Not unlike the CIA.

           Bob scans the names on the outside of the offices. Until he 
           finds the one he’s looking for... Liu Ziang.

           He jumps on the computer. Finds the connection to the server. 
           Sticks the POCKET DRIVE into the computer and hits DOWNLOAD.

           A PROGRESS BAR moves slowly as a program is downloaded from 
           the pocket drive to the company’s server. 

           Bob walks to the window. Down on the street he can see all 
           the employees in front of the building. Chatting. Smoking. 

           Suddenly the ALARM STOPS. 

           Bob sees all the employees start heading back inside.

           He goes to the computer. The progress bar inching along.

                        Oh, Mr. Ziang. 
                             (he stops and looks)
                        John Lynch is here for you.

                                 LIU ZIANG
                        Who?

           INT. LIU ZIANG’S OFFICE - DAY

           Through frosted glass, Bob sees A SILHOUETTE approach the 
           office door. 

           Bob rushes over to the door. Locks it just in time. 

           OUTSIDE ZIANG’S OFFICE

           Ziang tries to open the office door but can’t. Confused. 
           Getting suspicious. He presses his face against the frosted 
           glass window, trying to see inside the office. 

           IN ZIANG’S OFFICE

           Bob stays frozen behind the door. Ziang’s face pressed up 
           against the window, directly beside him. 

           Ziang mumbles something in Mandarin and moves off. 
                                      New Revision3

           Bob scurries back to the computer. The download has finally 
           finished. Bob grabs the pocket drive. 

           He opens the office door a crack, peers out... 

           The cubicles are now full. People everywhere. 

           Bob, as swiftly as possible without drawing attention, exits 
           the office and makes his way through the room. 

           INT. ZTS TELECOMMUNICATIONS - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Bob walks as fast as possible past the receptionist. 

                                 YOUNG FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                        Excuse me? Sir?

           Bob ignores her and heads for the front doors. Behind him, 
           Ziang and TWO SECURITY GUARDS rush into the lobby...

           EXT. ZTS TELECOMMUNICATIONS - DAY - SECURITY CAMERA POV

           Ziang and the guards exit out onto the street. They look 
           around but Bob is nowhere in sight. Vanished.  

           Ziang pulls out his cell phone. Dials a number...

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT  

           Bob’s using one of the library’s computers. The pocket drive 
           plugged into it.

           ON THE COMPUTER - Bob uses the software he installed at ZTS 
           to access the company’s internal servers remotely. 

           He roots through folders, financial records, internal memos. 

           Something catches his attention. A folder labeled PROJECT 
           ECHO.

           He sees a list of SCIENTIST NAMES assigned to the project. He 
           picks one of the scientists, DR SERVINO ANTINI. Does a search 
           on his name... 

           He finds multiple news headlines featuring Antini...

           “INTERNATIONALLY BANNED GENETIC EXPERIMENTS”... 

           This is it. This is what he’s been after. 
                                         Revision

           Bob clicks on “Supply Chain”. Hundreds of shipping manifests 
           for project Echo. All sent to...

           A specific set of GPS COORDINATES. In the Pakistani desert. 

           EXT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bob parks on the street a few doors down from his house. He 
           scans the street. No cops. The house seems quiet and normal. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bob walks in the house. It’s dark. Not a sound. He cautiously 
           tip toes to the bookshelf. Moves the copy of GRAVITY’S 
           RAINBOW. Types a code into his safe and opens it. He pulls 
           out his “getaway kit”. Fake passports. Money. Etc.       

           THE BEDROOM

           One last thing he needs. He walks over to the photo of him 
           and Anna on their anniversary. The Washington Monument behind 
           them. Just as he pulls the picture out of the frame... 

           A slight THUMP SOUND from the closet. 

           Bob hears it. Drops the picture frame awkwardly on its side. 

           Bob pulls out his gun. He slowly walks towards the closet. 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        I always loved that one too.

           Bob spins around. Anna’s in the bedroom doorway. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        The picture. 

           The two just stand still. Unsure of each other’s intentions. 
           Bob sees Anna has two suitcases with her.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t decide what to take. 
                        When you decide to end one life and 
                        start another... What do you take 
                        with you? It’s all just stuff.  

           Bob slowly puts away his gun. Anna doesn’t seem like a threat 
           right now. Her smeared makeup. Thrown together clothes. A 
           woman pushed to the edge. Overcome with grief. 

           She turns and starts heading down the stairs. Bob watches...

                                 BOB
                             (a realization)
                        You really believe you’re her, 
                        don’t you? 

           She stops. Turns back to him. There’s no anger in her eyes 
           when she looks at him now. No malice. If anything... Pity.   

                                 ANNA
                        What are you going to do, Bob?

                                 BOB
                        I’m going to find out who did this 
                        to us.

           Anna smiles a small, sad smile. She’s genuinely sad for him. 

                                 ANNA
                        Goodbye, Bob.

           She walks down the stairs. Slowly walks out the front door. 

           Bob just stands alone. A quiet moment in the dark bedroom.  

           He turns back to the closet. Opens it... 

           A MAN IN A HAZMAT SUIT jumps out of the closet. 

           Before Bob can scream or react, the man plunges a syringe 
           into Bob’s neck. 

           Bob’s body goes limp. The Hazmat Man catches him. Lays him on 
           the ground. He takes Bob’s gun. Bob’s eyes are open, but his 
           body is paralyzed. 

           Note - We see the following action from Bob’s vantage point 
           on the ground. His eyes only able to see pieces...  

           Bob hears the front door open. SIX MORE MEN IN HAZMAT SUITS 
           enter the bedroom. Carrying a gurney of some kind. A body 
           lying on it. They take the body off the gurney and place it 
           in Bob’s bed. 

           It’s Bob. Its an exact replica of Bob. 

           From the ground, Bob is still paralyzed. But we see the 
           horror in eyes. He’s being replaced. 

           The Hazmat Men take Bob’s wedding ring and watch. They take 
           them over to the Bob replica (who from this point on we’ll 
           refer to as “Bob-B”) on the bed and put them on him.  
                                      New Revision1

           One of the HAZMAT guys sticks a needle into Bob-B’s neck. 
           Another checks his pulse. Another attaches some kind of 
           ELECTRO SHOCK DEVICE up to his chest. They ZAP HIM. 

           Just to add to the horrific surreality of it all, one of the 
           Hazmat Men appears to be video taping everything going on.

           The Hazmat Men scurry over to Bob on the ground. They pick 
           him up and put him on the gurney. 

           As Bob is carried out of the room, he gets one last chilling 
           look at his replacement, sleeping soundly in his bed. 

           The Hazmat Men carry Bob down the stairs. As Bob passes rooms 
           he sees more Hazmat Men. Cleaning up the house from when Bob 
           tore it apart. Re-installing cameras. 

           EXT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Hazmat Men load Bob into the back of a white van. They 
           attach restraints to Bob’s wrists. They shut the doors to the 
           van and jump in. The van drives off. Like it was never there.  

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A quiet, eerie moment... Bob-B. Lying in bed. Sleeping 
           soundly. The “new Bob” flawlessly inserted.  

           INT. WHITE VAN - TRAVELLING - LATER

           Bob, on the gurney in the back of the van. He can hear and 
           feel that they’re moving. Driving somewhere. 

           Bob’s scared eyes look down at his hand. He’s regaining 
           feeling in it. Able to clench and make a fist. 

           He tries to lift his ankle up towards his hand. He 
           desperately twists and contorts his body until finally his 
           fingers reach his boot. Hidden in the heel, he pulls out...

           His small blade. 

           He starts to cut at the restraint around his wrist. He hears 
           a SHIP HORN BLOW. Where the hell is he?

           The van suddenly stops. Bob frantically keeps cutting. He 
           hears the doors of the van open and shut. 

           He cuts and cuts... Finally... The bond breaks.  

           Bob uses his free hand to quickly get his other one free. 
                                      New Revision1

           The back doors of the van open... Multiple Hazmat Men.  

           Bob lunges forward. He stabs his blade into the neck of one 
           of the Hazmat Men who recoils screaming.  

           Bob barrels his way past the other men and out of the truck. 

           Has only a split second to take in his surroundings. He’s on-

           EXT. SHIPYARD DOCKS - NIGHT

           -a pier. The other Hazmat Men are barreling towards him.   

           In a split second decision, with the Hazmat Men closing on 
           him, he does the only thing he can... 

           Bob jumps off the edge of the pier. 

           He lands awkwardly and painfully in the dark water below. 

           Several of the Hazmat Men pull out machine guns with 
           silencers and start firing into the water. 

           Bob submerges. Bullets whizzing past him as he swims as far 
           and fast as he can... Deeper into the dark water.

           EXT. SHIPYARD DOCKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Further down the pier... Bob floats in the water. Hidden 
           behind a rusty buoy. He watches the Hazmat Men running up and 
           down the pier, searching the water with flashlights. 

           EXT. SHIPYARD DOCKS - LATER

           Further down the pier, Bob pulls himself up and out of the 
           water and onto an embankment. He checks the bag around his 
           waist... Money, passports, GPS. Still there. Thank god. 

           He lies on his back. Shivering. Shocked. Fighting tears. He’s 
           not James Bond. This is all scaring the shit out of him. 

           He looks out at the horizon. The sun starting to rise. Dawn. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Bob-B. Lying in bed. Just as the Hazmat Team left him. The 
           sun starts to rise, falling across Bob-B’s face. 
                                         Revision

           Bob-B suddenly bolts upright and screams. As if waking from a 
           nightmare. He takes in his surroundings. It’s his room. His 
           bed. He’s fine.  

           He leans back down. Instinctively reaches towards the other 
           side of the bed, but... It’s empty. He’s alone. 

           (Note: As it will slowly sink in over the next few moments, 
           we have seen this scene earlier in the film.)

           INT. SHIPYARD DOCKS - OFFICE AREA - MORNING

           Bob sneaks into the offices of the shipyards. He finds a set 
           of lockers. He finds some jeans. A half decent blazer. Starts 
           to undress.    

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Quick shots of Bob-B going through his morning routine. 

           Showers. Brushes his teeth. Gets dressed. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

           Bob, now wearing the clothes he stole, stuffs the stolen ZTS 
           shipping manifests into an envelope. We see the front of the 
           envelope addressed to... 

           “CIA - SPECIAL ACTIVITIES DIVISION”

           He drops the envelope into a mailbox and scurries off. 

           INT. BOB AND ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           As Bob-B pulls his tie on, something catches his eye... 

           The picture on the dresser of Bob and Anna in D.C. It’s gone. 
           The picture frame empty and knocked awkwardly on its side.  

           Bob-B picks up the empty frame in his hands. 

           This is all starting to look very familiar.

           EXT. AIRPORT - MORNING

           Bob exits a cab. Walks into the airport.

           EXT. BLAND OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

           Bob-B parks his car. Walks into the building. 

           INT. AIRPORT CHECK IN COUNTER - MORNING

           Bob smiles at an AIRLINE EMPLOYEE as he hands her his fake 
           passport. She types his information into her computer. 

           INT. BLAND OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

           Bob-B walks past rows of cubicles. Nods at coworkers. Just 
           another day at the office. Sticks his hand on a scanner... 

           CLOSE ON the scanner - BOB NEVEN. ID CONFIRMED. 

           INT. AIRPORT SECURITY - MORNING

           Bob walks through a metal detector. A TSA AGENT waves a wand 
           over him and lets him past.

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - MORNING

           Bob-B walks in. Sees Sandra. 

                                 BOB-B
                        Morning Sandra. How are the kids?

                                 SANDRA
                        Imran almost walked on his own this 
                        morning.

                                 BOB-B
                        Come on. 

           On the wall screen ahead of them we see Alima playing with 
           her three little kids in Waziristan, Pakistan. 

           And with that it’s sealed... We’ve been watching the story of 
           Bob’s replacement all along.

           INT. AIRPLANE - TRAVELLING - DAY

           Bob sits looking out the window. High above the clouds now. 
           He hears a noise and looks over - Three little ARAB CHILDREN 
           are running up and down the aisle, squealing with laughter.

                        we clear to engage, control?

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           An agonizing moment as Bob looks back and forth from the 
           speeding truck to the image of the kids getting in it. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Bob, you need to call it.

           Bob takes one last look at the image of the kids, then...

                                 BOB
                             (voice catching)
                        103, you're cleared to engage. 

           They all watch silently as a HELLFIRE MISSILE HITS THE MOVING 
           TRUCK DEAD ON. 

           INT. AIRPORT - TAJIKISTAN - NIGHT

           Bob exits his plane and walks through the airport. He stops 
           and looks at a news report on one of the airport televisions.  

           It’s the aftermath of the strike on Alima’s truck. Angry 
           protesters. UN Ambassadors condemning the drone program. (The 
           exact same report we saw earlier.)   

           We PUSH IN on the TV showing the Chinese Ambassador...

                                 CHINESE AMBASSADOR (ON TV)
                        With every new terrorist attack 
                        that occurs, it is further proof 
                        that the drone program has failed 
                        and needs to come to an end. One 
                        way, or another. 

           We then PULL OUT from the newscast, revealing we’re seeing it 
           on a TV in...

           INT. THE CIA - OFFICE AREA - DAY

           Bob-B is watching the same newscast. Debbie approaches him.

                                         Revision

           She hands Bob-B the envelope that Bob mailed. Bob-B looks 
           inside and sees the ZTS shipping manifests.  

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.) (PRELAP)
                        So, what the hell’s at these 
                        coordinates? 

           EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - TAJIKISTAN - AFTERNOON

           Bob sits with a slightly overweight, bearded man. REMMY. 

                                 BOB
                             (purposely coy)
                        Answers. Hopefully.  

                                 REMMY
                        Since when you a field man, Neven?

                        Can you get me into Pakistan or 
                        not? 

           Remmy looks at the GPS coordinates circled on the map. 

                                 REMMY
                        Take me a few days. Maybe a week. 

           Something behind Remmy catches Bob’s eye. He gets up and 
           walks over to the TV. It’s a newscast. A bomb has exploded at 
           the embassy in Rome. (This is the same attack we saw earlier. 
           The exact same news report.)   

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - LATER

           The moment Bob-B first discovered the mysterious patch of 
           desert. Bob-B walks to the wall screen. Looks at the tire 
           tracks in the sand. Looks down at the anonymous mailed 
           shipping manifests in his hand...

                                 BOB-B
                             (softly - to himself)
                        Who are you?

           EXT. TRIBAL VILLAGE - INDUS VALLEY - PAKISTAN - DAY

           A crowded market. Teeming with life. And poverty. And danger. 
           A PAKISTANI TEEN leads Bob through the market. Some time has 
           passed. Bob’s beard now full.

           INT. SMALL APARTMENT - INDUS VALLEY - DAY

           Bob’s led into a smoky room. Several MEN WITH GUNS inside.  

           Laid out on the bed are a dozen DIFFERENT TYPES OF FIREARMS.  

           Bob looks them over. Decides on TWO REVOLVERS and an AK-47. 

                                 BOB
                             (subtitled - in Urdu)
                        These three. 

           Bob hands the men American dollars. He pulls a GPS out of his 
           pocket. Types in the coordinates of the mysterious patch of 
           desert. Hands the GPS to one of the gun dealers. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Also, I need transportation here.

           The Gun Dealer stares at the location of the coordinates. 

                                 GUN DEALER
                             (subtitled - in Urdu)
                        Impossible. Too dangerous. 

           Bob smiles knowingly. He lays down more cash on the bed. 

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - JEEP - TRAVELLING - DUSK

           The desert flies by as we speed along a lonely desert road. 

           Bob sits in the back of a beat up jeep. FIVE ARMED MEN sit in 
           the back with him, all unapologetically staring at Bob. He 
           ignores their glares. Looks down at a picture in his hands. 
           The picture missing from the mantle back home. Bob and Anna’s 
           anniversary.

                                 BOB
                             (quiet whisper)
                        I’m coming.

           Bob looks out at the desert flying past him...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
                        It’s been about... Six months since 
                        your accident, hasn’t it? 

           INT. THE CIA - DAVIS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Bob-B in Davis’ office. Staring at the mysterious desert on 
           the monitor. Davis is staring at Bob-B suspiciously. 
                                         Revision

                                 BOB-B
                        About that, yeah. 

                                 DAVIS
                        I just need to be sure you’re a 
                        hundred percent. The whole world’s 
                        watching our every move. 

                                 BOB-B
                        I’m fine, sir. 

           Davis nods. Bob gets up and leaves. Davis watches him go. 

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

           Bob wakes up from sleep. The jeep has stopped. The DRIVER 
           opens the back of the jeep and gestures for Bob to get out. 

                                 BOB
                             (subtitled - in Urdu)
                        Why are we stopped?

           The driver points to a MOUNTAIN RANGE beyond the desert.

                                 DRIVER
                             (subtitled - in Urdu)
                        There. Towards the mountains. 

                                 BOB
                        No, no. We had an arrangement. You 
                        take me into the desert. 

           The driver shakes his head and heads back inside the jeep.

                                 DRIVER
                        Too dangerous. 

           The jeep heads off. Bob stands alone. The middle of nowhere. 

           EXT. INDUS VALLEY DESERT - DAY

           Bob trudges through the desert. Nothing around him for miles 
           except endless sand. The unrelenting sun beating down on him.  

           He stops. He checks his position on the GPS. He takes a drink 
           from his canteen. And keeps trudging.

           EXT. INDUS VALLEY DESERT - LATER

           Bob struggles with each step. His face red and lips parched. 
                                      New Revision1

           Every step he takes, the sand shifting beneath his feet. 

           A BLEEP from his bag. He stops. Pulls his GPS out of his bag. 

           He’s arrived. He’s standing at the exact spot of the GPS 
           coordinates. He looks around... Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

           Bob swings the GPS around in the air, trying to see if it’s 
           working properly. He taps it. Soft at first and then harder. 
           Frustrated. Desperate.  

           The GPS keeps showing the same thing. He’s there. Bob looks 
           around. East. West. North. Nothing. 

           He SCREAMS in frustration. Throws the GPS. 

           He falls to his kneels. In his eyes we see more than fear... 
           A crushing realization starting to sink in... Am I a madman? 

           Bob falls to his back. Tries to shield his face from the sun. 

           His weak, burnt fingers reach into his bag. He pulls out the 
           picture of him and Anna on their anniversary. 

                                 BOB
                             (weak, quiet)
                        I’m sorry, Anna. 

           A wind gusts. The photo flies out of Bob’s hand. He struggles 
           to his feet. Walks towards the photo. Just before he gets 
           there, the wind blows it further away. As if the desert 
           itself was trying to keep him from his wife. 

           He almost catches up with it, when suddenly the photo falls 
           over the edge of... 

           A huge thirty foot drop.

           Bob stops himself just before he goes tumbling over as well. 

           He looks down... The desert floor simply stops at an abrupt 
           edge. Bob watches the photo fall down the drop, to-

           The entrance to an underground facility. 

           Bob looks down in awe. Am I really seeing this? 

           It’s a huge opening. Big enough for vehicles. Bob looks 
           around. The mysterious patch of desert... The location of the 
           GPS coordinates... It’s the roof of an underground facility.  

           Bob walks a few steps back from the edge. From his view point 
           now, there’s nothing. 
                                      New Revision3

           The sand on the roof of the facility looking like it’s on the 
           same vertical plane as the rest of the desert, which is in 
           fact below it. An optical illusion. Looking at it from above 
           (or from a drone) it appears as nothing but empty desert. 

           Bob leans his head over the edge. Looks into the facility.

           FIVE MEN with machine guns sit chatting and smoking near the 
           entrance. They seem like Tribal militia. Hired guns.  

           A HISSING SOUND behind him. Bob turns. Walks towards the 
           sound. It’s coming from a large desert shrub. HOT STEAM is 
           escaping from the base of the shrub. 

           Then, just as suddenly as it started, the steam stops. 

           Bob wipes sand from the base of the shrub. He finds a metal 
           grate. Some kind of exhaust system for the facility below.  

           Bob puts the sleeves of his shirt over his hands to protect 
           him from the heat and pulls the grate up and off the ground. 

           There’s a circular ventilation shaft. Leading into darkness.  

           Bob readies himself. I’ve come this far. He carefully lowers 
           himself down into the ventilation shaft. 

           As Bob lowers, WE PULL BACK from him... Making it appear from 
           our POV as if he is slowly sinking into the desert. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - DAY

           Bob kicks the vent cover, knocking it off. He quickly drops 
           out of the ventilation shaft. 

           He’s in a long hallway. Creepy. Sterile. Like a hospital.  

           Holding his rifle at the ready, Bob starts to walk down the 
           halls. By the way he’s holding it, it’s clear he’s slightly 
           out of his element with the large weapon. 

           VOICES approach. Bob sees a door and quickly goes through. 

           4 MEN IN HAZMAT STYLE SUITS walk past. Speaking in MANDARIN.

           They slowly pass. Bob realizes where he’s walked into...     

           Another hallway. Lined with glass. Some kind of WATER TANKS. 

           Bob walks slowly down the hall. Something familiar to him... 

           This is the hallway from his dream.
                                      New Revision3

           Bob walks right up to the glass. Peering into the dark water 
           on the other side. 

           A HUMAN FACE emerges from the water.  

           Bob jumps back from the tank.  

           HUMAN BEINGS. Hooked up to dozens of wires, inside semi 
           translucent sacs. Like artificially created wombs. Some as 
           small as children. Others almost adult sized. 

           Bob passes by a window looking into a room. Inside the room 
           he sees THREE IDENTICAL LOOKING MEN. All sitting in chairs 
           facing giant TV screens. 

           On the screens in front of them, hundreds of faces flash by. 
           (Very similar to facial recognition software cycling through 
           features.) Every few seconds the flashing faces will stop on 
           a specific face, and the men get ZAPPED BY AN ELECTRIC JOLT.  

           Bob watches... Horrified. What the hell is going on here? 

           Bob looks to the far end of the hall. A METALLIC DOOR. The 
           same one he was drawn to in his dream. He walks towards it. 
           Somehow knowing it’s where he needs to go. 

           He puts his hand on the knob. Turns it... Walks in...

           It’s a fully furnished room. Carpeted. ABSTRACT PAINTINGS 
           hang on white walls. A large WATERFALL MACHINE giving off a 
           soothing BUBBLING SOUND. 

           A couch with a chair sitting right behind it. It’s...

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob looks around at the room. It’s a surreal sight in the 
           middle of the sterile, hospital-like building. 

           He lowers his rifle. Stares at the couch. Something familiar 
           coming back to him... Just out of reach...

           FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING. Bob quickly hides behind the couch.  

           He watches underneath the couch as a MAN’S FEET walk in. 

           Bob peers up over the couch. The man is standing in the 
           corner of the room. His back turned. 

           Bob slowly stands up. His rifle trained on the man’s back.

           The man freezes. Knows someone’s there. Slowly turns around.
                                      New Revision1

           It’s Dr. Carter.

           For a loaded moment, the two men just stand staring at each 
           other. Bob’s rifle aimed at Carter’s chest. 

                                 BOB
                        Who are you?

                                 DR. CARTER
                             (amazed)
                        Bob...

                             (confused, unsure)
                        I know you.

                        Please, Bob, put the gun down.

                        How do you know my name?

                             (re: the couch)
                        Why don’t you have a seat-

           Bob rushes towards Dr. Carter, causing him to back up.  

                                 BOB
                        That thing that’s in my house right 
                        now. This is where you made it. 
                        Isn’t it?!  

                                 DR. CARTER
                             (quiet - a little scared)
                        Yes.

                        When you replaced me you didn’t 
                        kill me. You tried to take me. You 
                        did the same thing with Anna, 
                        didn’t you?

                        She is here! Take me to her. Now!

           He shoves his gun right in Carter’s face.

                             (a beat, then-)

           INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           Dr. Carter walks in with Bob behind him. Rifle on his back. 
           The room has SEVERAL LARGE MONITORS ON THE WALL. Along the 
           opposite wall a ONE WAY MIRROR looking into a prison cell.   

           SOMEONE is in the corner of the cell. A BAG OVER THEIR HEAD.  

                                 BOB
                             (nervous)
                        Go. You do it. 

           Dr. Carter walks into the cell. Approaches the prisoner. Bob 
           watches from the doorway. His anticipation building... Is 
           this it? Has he finally found her? 

           Dr. Carter slowly pulls the bag off the person's head...

           It’s not Anna... It's Bob. The real Bob.  

           Bob (with the rifle) backs up against the wall. His eyes 
           wide. Mouth open. It can’t be... 

           Bob (the real Bob, who will always be referred to simply as 
           “Bob”) squints and looks away from Carter. He’s skinny and 
           weak. Seems scared of Dr. Carter. 

                                 BOB
                        Who... Who is that?

           In the observation room, Bob (rifle) stares at his imprisoned 
           doppelganger in shock. Not knowing what else to do...

                                 BOB (RIFLE)
                             (quiet - intense)
                        Put the bag back on. 

           Dr. Carter puts the bag back on Bob’s head. Walks back into 
           the observation room. 

                                 BOB (RIFLE)
                             (shocked - terrified)
                        Who is that? 

                                 DR. CARTER
                        That... Is Bob Neven. The real Bob 
                        Neven. 

                                 BOB (RIFLE)
                        No. It’s just another one of your 
                        monsters.

           Dr. Carter gestures to a remote control on the desk.
                                         Revision

                                 DR. CARTER
                        May I?

           Dr. Carter hits a button and the SCREENS ON THE WALL SPRING 
           TO LIFE. It’s visually very similar to the drone control 
           room. Except instead of drone feeds from around the world, 
           it’s all images of Bob throughout the story. The watcher is 
           now the watched.   

           One screen shows Bob in an undeveloped state, floating in 
           water in a translucent sack. 

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        Your first six months you were in a 
                        vat of water, not unlike a mother’s 
                        womb. Though growing at ten times 
                        the rate of a fetus.

           Another screen shows Bob lying on the couch with Dr. Carter 
           behind him. Going over the story of how Bob and Anna met. 

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        We then assessed the successful 
                        transference of Bob Neven’s 
                        memories to you. 

           Another screen shows footage from inside Bob and Anna’s hotel 
           room on the weekend of their anniversary. Anna lies 
           unconscious on the bed. Liu Ziang (dressed as a room service 
           waiter) checks her pulse. Makes sure she’s fully asleep. The 
           other, unseen “waiter” films everything.  

           Once he’s sure she’s out, Ziang says something into his cell. 

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        After making sure Anna had a nice 
                        long sleep...

           Another screen shows video footage from inside a VAN tailing 
           Bob’s car on the street in DC. A man in a HAZMAT SUIT gets a 
           call on his cell. Nods to the driver, who then hits the gas.  

           The van SMASHES INTO THE SIDE OF BOB’S CAR, knocking Bob 
           unconscious behind the wheel. 

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        We then inserted you into Bob 
                        Neven’s life. 

           The CAMERA WATCHES as a Hazmat Team rushes to Bob’s car. They 
           remove Bob’s clothing. Watch. Wedding ring. They carry Bob’s 
           unconscious body away. In the driver’s seat they place...  
                                         Revision

           An exact duplicate of Bob. The original replacement. (Who 
           from this point on we will refer to as “BOB-A”.)

           After a quick flurry of activity, the Hazmat Men scurry back 
           to the van. Leaving only... 

           Bob-A. Passed out. In his car. FAR OFF SIRENS getting closer.  

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You're an exact duplicate of Bob 
                        Neven in every way. Except for one 
                        thing.  

           We PAN ACROSS various screens on the wall. Showing 
           surveillance from the hidden cameras in Bob-A’s house 
           throughout the past few months. It’s a surreal, hidden 
           surveillance recap of Bob-A’s journey...

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The flesh and blood woman never 
                        matched the perfection of the 
                        memories we implanted. 

           Bob-A in the bathtub arguing with Anna...

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You somehow knew the woman in your 
                        memory didn’t match the woman in 
                        front of you.  

           Anna discovering the shed chart. Bob-A screaming at her... 

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Your obsession with her jeopardized 
                        our entire mission. It was the fly 
                        in our ointment. It was what made 
                        you malfunction. It was what 
                        brought you here. 

           Bob-A discovers the cameras hidden in the shed... 

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Luckily, we came up with a solution 
                        for your... Replacement. 

           Dr. Carter hits a button and suddenly all the screens switch 
           to images of Bob-B. 

           ON ONE OF THE SCREENS - Bob-B on the couch with Dr. Carter. 

                                 BOB-B
                        Is there something wrong with me?

                        your illness has fixated on. 

           ON SCREEN - Bob-B waking up in bed. Turning over only to 
           realize Anna’s gone. He’s in bed alone.  

                                 DR. CARTER
                        We convinced the next one that he 
                        was sick. That he had to stay away 
                        from his wife, for her own good. 

           ON SCREEN - Bob-B replacing the anniversary picture.

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        We used his love for his wife 
                        against him. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Bob (rifle) looks away from the monitors. The horrible truth 
           sinking in...  

           He is BOB-A. He is a replacement. 

                                 BOB-A
                             (quiet - overwhelmed)
                        Why?

                                 DR. CARTER
                        We needed you to kill this man... 

           Dr. Carter points to one of the monitors... Bob-A strapped to 
           a chair in front of a screen. Hundreds of faces flash by. 
           Periodically the faces settle on the image of the Blue Eyed 
           Arab. Which coincides with an ELECTRIC SHOCK TO BOB-A’S BODY.  

                                 DR. CARTER
                        Fareed Banerjee. The UN special 
                        envoy conducting the investigation 
                        into the CIA’s drone program. And 
                        in a matter of moments... With the 
                        entire world watching... He is 
                        about to be assassinated by a drone 
                        strike. A strike authorized by Bob 
                        Neven of the CIA. 

           Bob-A looks to Carter in awe. The horrible brilliance of it. 

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        After today, there will no longer 
                        be a CIA drone program.

                                 BOB-A
                        No... I told them about this place. 
                        I mailed the GPS coordinates. 

                                 DR. CARTER
                        We know. In fact, your replacement 
                        is watching this facility at this 
                        very moment. But it’s too late. Any 
                        moment he will see Banerjee and the 
                        kill switch we implanted will be 
                        triggered. 

           Bob-A pulls himself up off the ground. He walks to the one 
           way mirror. Looks into the prison cell beyond. Looks at the 
           real Bob, lying in the corner of the cell. 

                                 BOB-A
                        Get him out of there. 

                                 DR. CARTER
                        There’s nowhere to run, Bob.

           Bob-A looks at the wall of the cell. A little symbol that’s 
           been scratched into the wall. It’s Bob and Anna’s symbol. 
           Dozens of them across the walls. 

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        Even if you could escape this 
                        facility, where would you go? You 
                        are not Bob Neven. 

           Bob-A looks at Bob’s fingers. Bloody and scab ridden. He's 
           been carving the symbol into the walls with his bare fingers.

                                 DR. CARTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re an experiment. A weapon that 
                        malfunctioned. 

           Bob-A is overwhelmed with emotion. The force of will it would 
           take to carve these. The love this man has for Anna.

           Bob-A wipes a tear from his eye. Turns to Dr. Carter. 

                                 BOB-A
                        I said get him out.

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Bob-B sits staring at the monitor on his desk. Displaying 
           telemetry from the mysterious patch of desert.

           EXT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - DAY

           The GUARDS sit at tables playing cards and smoking. 

           GUN SHOTS RING OUT! 

           Bob runs at full speed towards the entrance. The bag is still 
           on his head, causing him to run in a bit of a zigzag pattern.    

           The shocked guards spring into action. They grab their 
           weapons. One of them hits a button and AN ALARM BLARES. 

           Bob runs out of the entrance and into the desert. The guards 
           barrel out of the facility after him.  

           The lead guard aims his gun at Bob... He fires. 

           Bob is cut down in a hail of bullets. 

           All the guards converge around his body, lying motionless on 
           the desert floor. A guard reaches down and pulls the bag off 
           his head...

           It’s not Bob. It’s Dr. Carter.

           Tape over his mouth. His lifeless eyes staring up. 

           The confused guards start to look around in a panic. Yell at 
           each other accusingly. One of the guards turns and sees...  

           Bob and Bob-A running into the desert. 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           The analysts desperately try to ZOOM IN on different faces in

           It’s an Arab man. With blue eyes. (Fareed Banerjee)

           Bob-A leads Bob through the desert. Bob hasn’t been outside 
           in months and can’t open his eyes. The scorching sun too 
           painful. He’s running blind with Bob-A leading him.

           Something catches Bob-B’s eye. He looks to the monitor on his 
           desk... 

           TWO MEN are running through the desert. 

                                 BOB

           The drone camera zooms in on one of the fleeing men...

           It’s Bob. It’s Bob’s face. 

           Bob-B’s jaw drops. Unable to believe what he’s seeing. 

           Suddenly... Behind the two fleeing men... TEN MORE MEN APPEAR 
           OUT OF NOWHERE. They appear to be chasing after the escapees.

           EXT. INDUS VALLEY DESERT - DAY

           Bob-A and Bob keep running through the desert. Behind them 
           the facility guards give chase. Firing their rifles. 

           Bob-A stops and turns back. He FIRES HIS AK-47 wildly at the 
           pursuing guards which makes them duck for cover. 

           Bob and Bob-A reach an outcropping of rock and jump behind it 
           as BULLETS RICOCHET all around them.

           Bob collapses in exhaustion. Still unable to open his eyes. 

           Bob-A peers over the rock wall... The guards are closing on 
           them. Firing their weapons. And behind them...

           A HUMVEE. Heading after them.  

           Bob-A fires back at the soldiers, causing them to scatter. 
           But the situation is hopeless and he knows it. 

           Bob-A picks Bob up off the ground. 

                                 BOB-A
                        Look at me.
                             (he doesn’t)
                        Look at me!

           Bob struggles, then... Through squinting eyes, he sees the 
           face of the man in front on him. Bob-A’s face. His own face. 

           His fear is quickly replaced with a delirious awe. 

                                 BOB
                             (trembling voice)
                        Who... 

           Bob-A gives Bob the bag with the money, passports and GPS. 

                                 BOB-A 
                        Take this.

                        Take it!

           He hands Bob the canteen of water and one of his revolvers.  

                                 BOB-A (CONT’D)
                        You’re the one she needs.

           Bob just stares back. Not understanding what’s happening.

           Bullets RICOCHET OFF THE ROCKS. The guard’s VOICES closer.

                                 BOB-A (CONT’D)
                        Go to her! Go! Now! Run!

           A delirious Bob, turns and runs in the opposite direction. 

           Bob-A turns back to the approaching guards. He fires at them. 

           All of this buying Bob time as he runs into the desert.

           Bob-A keeps firing. The guards return fire from behind rocks. 
           A few seconds of a furious gun battle then...

           BAM. Bob-A is hit. Then again. And again.

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Bob-B watches his monitor in shock as the guards shoot down 
           Bob-A. 

           Bob-B backs away from the monitor in horror. He’s watching 
           “himself” being killed.

                        Bob, you need to call it now!

           Bob-B looks over at the cavalcade of vehicles heading to the 
           drone base. The whole room waiting for his decision...

           EXT. INDUS VALLEY DESERT - DAY

           The facility guards and the humvee go right past Bob-A, who’s 
           lying lifeless on the ground. Their sights set firmly on Bob, 
           who’s still fleeing.   

           Bob-A slowly struggles to his feet. He uses his rifle to 
           start making some kind of marks in the sand. 

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Bob-B looks back and forth from his desk monitor to wall 
           screen displaying Fareed’s convoy...

           EXT. INDUS VALLEY DESERT - DAY

           Bob-A keeps making marks in the sand with his rifle. His 
           strength finally gives out and he falls to the ground.  

           He stares up at the sun. His last breath escaping him...

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Bob-B, tension and uncertainty in his eyes...

                                 BOB-B
                             (shaky voice)
                        108... You’re clear to...

           Bob-B’s eyes look back to the monitor on his desk. Next to 
           Bob-A’s lifeless body... Something written in the sand...    

           “YOU ARE THE REPLACEMENT”.

           Bob-B’s eyes are wide... Could it be possible... Are they 
           communicating directly to him...  

           Bob-B looks back and forth from the message in the sand to 
           the man about to be hit by a drone strike... On some level 
           understanding the strings being pulled... Himself being 
           pushed to do this...

           EXT. INDUS VALLEY DESERT - DAY

           Bob runs. Exhausted. Delirious.  

           Behind him the pursuing guards jump into the Humvee which 
           continues racing in Bob’s direction.

           Bob finally runs out of steam. He stops. 

           He knows there’s no escape. Only one thing left to do. 

           He turns to face the approaching vehicle... 
                                      New Revision1

           Points his gun at them, causing the guards to aim at him... 

           Which is what he wants... He’s not going back there...

                                 BOB
                        Goodbye Anna.

           Bob pulls the trigger...

           BLAM! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION. 

           THE HUMVEE IS VAPORIZED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.  

           Bob is sent flying backwards. Landing on his back. 

           He slowly looks up. In shock. Stares at the ball of flames 
           that used to be the HUMVEE. In disbelief. 

           A DULL WHIZZING SOUND.... Getting louder....

           BLAM! A HELLFIRE MISSILE SLAMS INTO THE ROOF OF THE HIDDEN 
           FACILITY. 

           The top of the facility explodes in flames, collapsing in on 
           itself. 

           Bob stares at the burning facility. Eyes wide. Mouth open. 

           He slowly crawls to his feet. He looks at the carnage all 
           around him. In total delirium. What the hell is going on?!  

           INT. THE CIA - DRONE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           The smoking ruin of the facility seen on the monitor. 

           PAN AROUND the room... Sandra... The other analysts... All 
           staring towards Bob-B in shock.

           Sandra turns back to Bob-B. He’s not paying attention to any 
           of this. Just staring at the facility as it burns. Calm. 
           Almost serene. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        Bob... What did you do?

           The door opens. Davis rushes in. Flanked by FOUR MEN IN 
           SUITS. In Davis’ hands is the anonymously mailed GPS 
           envelope. The men in suits circle Bob-B. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Bob... You need to come with us.

           One of the suits gently takes Bob-B’s arm, leading him away. 

           Sandra and the whole room watch silently. Shocked.  

           As Bob-B is taken off, he catches one last look at his 
           monitor. He sees a small moving dot... 

           A single survivor. Walking away from the burning facility...

           CAMERA POV allows the faces to drift by indifferently, until 
           it starts to slowly follow ONE FACE. Anna’s face. (Identical 
           to the opening shot of the film.)

           A few months have passed. Her hair a little longer. She seems 
           worn down. Sad. Alone. Our CAMERA POV continues following her 
           as she drifts down the street...

           Anna drifts among the crowd. Looking across the paintings but 
           not really looking at them. She notices a TV across the room. 
           A NEWS REPORT with the headline - “DRONE REPORT RELEASED”. 

           A melancholy comes over her. A reminder of Bob. 

           WIDE ON the room illustrating how Anna’s the only one 
           standing alone. Everyone else talking, laughing.

           INT. LOFT APARTMENT - BACKROOM - NIGHT

           Anna escapes into an empty back room. Sits on the bed. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Anna.

           She looks behind her and sees...

           Bob. The real Bob. Thinner and a little gaunt from his months 
           of imprisonment. Anna jumps to her feet.

                                 BOB
                        No, wait, wait. Please. 

           She’s half out the door. Staring at Bob in shock. Disbelief. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Anna... It’s me.

                        It’s me.

           Anna stays absolutely still. Fighting the instinct to run.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I can’t even imagine what you’ve 
                        been through. I can’t even begin to 
                        understand. Just please know... 
                        It’s me. The real me. I’m back. 

           He stares at her. Overcome with emotion at seeing her again. 
           He moves towards her. She backs away from him. He stops.  

                                 ANNA
                        Bob, I can’t...

                        Anna... It’s all over. The CIA. 
                        Everything. I’ve left it all. The 
                        only thing that matters is you. We 
                        can leave. Now. Like we always 
                        wanted too. Just the two of us. 

           He kneels at her feet. Anna’s fear starts to turn... She can 
           see something in him. Something she hasn’t seen in so long.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I love you Anna. I need you to help 
                        me put the pieces together.

           Her hand touches his face. He looks up at her.

                             (amazement)
                        I know. 

           She runs her hand across his features.

                             (tears in her eyes)
                        I can see it.
                             (looking into his eyes)
                        I know it’s you. 

           Bob, overwhelmed, wraps his arms around her waist.  

           They stay like that. Holding onto each other. 

           INT. LOFT APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob and Anna walk through the party hand in hand. They 
           disappear into the crowd of people. 

           PAN OVER to the TV... That no one’s paying attention to...

                        say for the most part this 
                        controversial program and those who 
                        run it, will continue to operate in

           INT. CIA PRISON - NIGHT

           Davis walks through dark, ominous halls, lined with cells. 

           INT. CIA PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Davis enters. Sits down at a table. Across from him...

           Bob-B.

           A far off, resigned expression. His eyes meet Davis’.

                                 DAVIS
                        Who are you?

           Bob-B just stares back for a moment. Then stoically...

                                 BOB-B
                        I’m Bob Neven.

           The two men stay locked in their stare. Davis opens a folder. 

                                 DAVIS 
                        I want to show you something. 

           Davis puts a photo on the table. It’s a still from a security 
           camera of what appears to be...   

           Anna. Boarding a plane in an airport. Bob’s eyes are 
           immediately drawn to Anna. Davis notices...

                                 DAVIS (CONT’D)
                        This is security footage of Anna 
                        Neven boarding a plane in Toronto. 

           Davis places another photo on the table. 

                                 DAVIS (CONT’D)
                        This is her boarding a connecting 
                        flight in Frankfurt.

                        Then exiting an airport in South 
                        Africa. Which is where we lost her.   

           Davis places one final photo on the table. 

                                 DAVIS (CONT’D)
                        The camera outside the airport 
                        captured this image of her 
                        meeting... This man.
                                      New Revision3

           Bob-B looks at the photo. Anna, hand in hand, walking out of 
           the airport with what appears to be... Bob.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT’D)
                             (taps the photo)
                        This is Bob Neven isn’t it? The 
                        real Bob Neven. 

           Bob-B tries to stay stoic but... Seeing Anna in the photo has 
           affected him. His poker face slipping. Davis sees he’s 
           getting to him. He pulls out the ZTS shipping manifests.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT’D)
                        We obtained a search warrant for 
                        ZTS but they suddenly decided to 
                        close all their US offices before 
                        we could execute it. It appears 
                        they were conducting illegal 
                        experiments at a facility in the 
                        Pakistani desert. A facility at the 
                        exact coordinates of your 
                        unauthorized drone strike. 
                        Experiments with... Advanced 
                        genetic replication.

           Bob-B hangs on Davis’ every word. He knows what he’s 
           suggesting. What Bob-B has understood on some level since he 
           saw that message written in the sand. 

                                 DAVIS
                        So... I’ll ask you one last time. 
                             (beat)
                        Who are you?

           With his shackled hands, Bob-B picks up the photo of Bob and 
           Anna walking out of the airport. Hand in hand. 

           Tears well in Bob-B’s eyes as he stares at Anna’s face. How 
           happy she looks. She’s with the right person. 

           Bob-B throws the photo back on the table. Wipes his eyes. 
           Stares back at Davis with a defiant, almost noble gaze. 

                                 BOB-B
                        I’m Bob Neven.

           Davis regards him for a beat. He knocks on the door. The 
           guard enters. Picks Bob-B up and leads him out of the room.

           Davis stays sitting at the table. Thinking. Disturbed. 

           Finally he stands up. Gathers his papers, then notices... 

           One of the photos is missing.

           INT. CIA PRISON - PRISON CELL - NIGHT

           Bob-B is lead into a small cell. He lies down on his bed. 
           From under his sleeve he pulls out one of the photos he stole 
           from Davis. He stares at it like it’s treasure. 

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        You’re not in love with the real 
                        Anna anymore, Bob.

           CLOSE ON the photo - Bob and Anna exiting the airport in 
           South Africa. Hand in hand. Happy. Together. Man and wife.  

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re in love with the memory.

           Bob-B smiles. Stares at Anna. He loves her so much. The woman 
           from his memories. Enough to let her go...

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re in love with this perfect 
                        picture of the two of you happy. 

           PAN AWAY from Bob-B... Along the walls of the cell to...

           Bob and Anna’s symbol. Etched into the wall. 

           Like Bob’s prison cell in the facility... Like the lonely kid 
           stuck in the stall at school... Etched into the wall with 
           blood. And pain. And Love. 

           PUSH IN on one of the symbols... We hear WAVES CRASHING... 

           EXT. BEACH - TRISTAN DA CUNHA - NIGHT

           A dark, utterly deserted beach on the little island off the 
           coast of South Africa. A sign on the beach reads... “Tristan 
           Da Cunha. Population: 300”

           Bob and Anna, husband and wife, walk down the shoreline. 

                                 DR. CARTER (V.O.)
                        A picture that exists now, only in 
                        your mind. 

           As they disappear into the darkness, we PAN AWAY from them... 

           To the ground... To Bob and Anna’s symbol etched in the sand. 

           A wave washes it out of existence. 

                                    THE END
