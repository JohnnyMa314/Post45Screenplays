           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE.

           A sparsely furnished bedroom, viewed from on high:

           A small single bed against one wall. 

           A small table with two chairs. 

           A bookcase. 

           A recliner. 

           The room is - on first glance - empty. 

           But look closer. There's someone in there.

           A DARK SHADOWY SMUDGE. 

           In the far corner of the room. 

           Sitting with their back to us.

           Keeping very still.

           Someone else enters. 

           A plump, MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.

           She looks to the figure in the corner, sets down a tray of 
           food on the small table, and sits down. 

           She attempts to engage the other in conversation, but we 
           can’t hear her - the surveillance is SILENT.

           The smudge moves. 

           Stands up. Turns to regard the woman.

           The FIGURE is slender and pale, peeking out from a dark 
           hoodie and grey jogging pants. It’s hard to tell whether this 
           is a boy or a girl, a man or a woman.

           They sit across from the middle-aged woman at the table. 

           The woman cheerfully pokes at a salad, still trying to engage 
           the other in sunny conversation. But the other does not 
           respond, just stares at her… and the woman’s cheerful facade 
           gradually drops. She pokes grimly at her salad... until...

           IN LESS THAN A HEARTBEAT the mysterious figure LEAPS onto the 
           table with incredible agility, poised like a jungle cat---
           Before the woman can even react, the figure commandeers her 
           fork and STABS HER IN THE EYE.

           AND STABS HER AGAIN.

                           AND AGAIN

                                 AND AGAIN.

           INT. OFFICE TOWER BOARDROOM, NEW YORK - DAY

           A handful of middle aged executives watch the surveillance 
           footage play out on a screen at the end of the room.

           One of them - a dour, wiry man in his 40s, JIM BRYCE - sits 
           forward to pause the footage from his tablet. 

           Flat light pours in from the floor-to-ceiling windows and 
           casts the room in its gloomy pall. The city stretches out to 
           the distance beyond, grey and unforgiving. 

           The attention of the men swivels to an UNSEEN COLLEAGUE at 
           the other end of the table.

                                 JIM BRYCE
                        We don't have to tell you what's on 
                        the line here.

           Across the table, the hefty, balding CHARLES GRIMES (50s) 
           chimes in.

                                 CHARLES GRIMES
                        Or that confidentiality is a 
                        priority in regards to this entire 
                        project.

                                 LEE
                        I understand.

           LEE WEATHERS is maybe 30 by a hair, a sharp-edged kind of 
           beautiful, crisply tailored and minimally adorned. 

                                 JIM BRYCE
                        We want this to be clean, Lee. This 
                        has to be clean.

           From further down the table, another exec: DAVID CHANCE is 
           rail thin, with despairing eyes

                                 DAVID CHANCE
                        We can't have another Hokkaido. Are 
                        we clear on that?
           Lee turns her attention from the men to the screen, focusing 
           on the PAUSED, BLURRY IMAGE of the attacker.

                                 CHARLES GRIMES (O.S.)
                        Lee. Are we clear?

                                 LEE
                        We're clear.
                                                                CUT TO:

           IE. PENNSYLVANIA HIGHWAY  - DAY

           Lee drives her car into a rain storm, squinting through the 
           downpour. 

           It's coming down in torrential sheets against the windshield, 
           making it hard to see.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP, LANGDON PA - DAY

           Lee's sedan swings into the sparsely decorated parking lot of 
           a drab coffee shop, lonely on the side of the road.

           Lee darts through the rain to get inside.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP, LANGDON PA - DAY

           The place is empty, save for a smattering of regulars 
           watching a ball game from the counter. 

           Lee sits at a booth by the window a - steaming cup of coffee 
           in front of her, untouched. She looks out at the grim parade 
           of semis speeding past. The dull roar of the trucks on the 
           wet road mingles with the sound of the ball game on the TV.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Coming down.

           Lee turns to see the man who addressed her: a plump, mean-
           eyed guy in his 40s, RICH, settling into a seat at the 
           counter. Lee sizes him up and meets his leering, suspicious 
           gaze with a tight, minimal smile. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER.

           At the register, Lee hands her bill to a pie-faced young 
           cashier with a TRACY name tag.

                                 TRACY
                        And thirteen twenty your change. 
                                 LEE
                        Thanks. I’m looking for Grant Farms 
                        - just outside of Mansfield? Am I 
                        close?

           The regular from before gives Lee the eye.

                                 TRACY
                        Oh, you’re real close. You’ll be 
                        driving about five minutes, and 
                        just past the turn off for Lake 
                        Kanawauke you’ll see a shuttered up 
                        FlapJack’s? On the left?? Keep 
                        going - it’s just around that bend. 

                                 LEE
                        Thanks.

                                 RICH
                        Grant Farms, huh. You working up 
                        there? 

           Lee narrows her eyes, taking his measure.

                                 LEE
                        Visiting. 

                                 RICH
                             (sarcastic)
                        Do send 'em our regards.

           Lee turns back to the cashier with an inquisitive glance. The 
           cashier shrugs.

                                 TRACY
                        Guess they're not... the most 
                        popular people round here these 
                        days.

                                 LEE
                        Why is that?

                                 TRACY
                        Oh no, just... Not the most 
                        sociable folks, I guess.

                                 RICH
                        Let Stan Jessup’s place go to seed 
                        and put up a bunch of military 
                        grade fencing like we all just 
                        couldn't wait to get our grubby 
                        little hands on their bone china.
                                 TRACY
                        Oh, shut the fuck up, Rich. 
                             (to Lee)
                        Don’t mind him. He just misses his 
                        good old boy is all.

                                 LEE
                        That's ok. You all have a nice day.

                                 RICH
                        Yeah you too. You have a real nice 
                        day. Send our best huh!?

           As she leaves...

                                 LEE
                        I'll do that.

           Rich watches her head back into the rain with his beady eyes, 
           thinking bad thoughts. 

           I.E. LEE'S CAR MOVING - DAY

           Lee sails past the turn off for Lake Kanawauke and the 
           shuttered FlapJack's, just as the cashier described. 

           She sharpens her focus on the wet, barren road ahead, framed 
           by rough hewn snaggles of trees in the death throes of late 
           autumn.

           The turn off approaches...

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Lee drives carefully as she winds the car up a muddied 
           country road, swaths of forest punctuated by abandoned barns. 

           The car comes to a crawl as Lee struggles to see through the 
           rain. She backs it up and takes a turn off the road.

           EXT. GRANT FARMS GATE - DAY

           Lee pulls into the property and winds her way up a gravel 
           road, littered with rotting leaves and muddied by torrents of 
           rain. 

           The car arrives at a tall barbed fence and a locked gate. Lee 
           leans out to press the wet button on a small speaker. After a  
           long wait, she hears a crackle and a thin, static-laced 
           voice:

                                 VOICE (INTERCOM)
                        Grant Farms.
                                 LEE
                        Lee Weathers. I’m expected.

           No response.

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        Security clearance ALPHA NINER ZERO  
                        BETA BETA ZOO FERRET FIVE. 

           Another long wait and finally a loud BUZZ. The gate opens 
           with a whirr of creaking mechanics and Lee drives ahead. The 
           gate closes behind her.

           EXT. GRANT FARMS - DAY

           Lee drives slowly up the winding road, which opens onto a 
           large clearing - in the center of which stands a LARGE 
           COLONIAL FARMHOUSE.

           To her left, a ways away, an old barn afield in tall unkept 
           grass. 

           To her right, near the house, a RAIN-SLICKERED FIGURE routing 
           around in the muddied garden.

           She stops the car next to a few others parked by the side of 
           the house - a mini-van, a station wagon, an old Corolla - and 
           gets out, her overnight bag slung over her shoulder.

           A short, jittery guy in his late 20s - TED BRENNER - comes 
           out to greet her.

                                 TED
                        Lee?

           Ted hops back into the house, surprised by the rain. Lee 
           sizes him up - he has a tightly wound but distracted air 
           about him.

                                 TED (CONT'D)
                        Still coming down!

           INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Lee meets him at the door. He takes a few nervous steps back 
           to let her in.

                                 TED 
                        Let me ah... I can take that wet 
                        jacket....

           Lee grimaces and hands it to him. He hangs it on a hook by 
           the door. 
                                 LEE
                        Thanks.

                                 TED
                        Ted Brenner. I'm the corporate 
                        liaison? We spoke online. 

                                 LEE
                        We did. Lee Weathers.

           They shake. Ted’s eyes flicker towards Lee’s car.

                                 TED
                        Can I help you with luggage or...

                                 LEE
                        This is it. 

                                 TED
                        Ah. alright then. Well. We're all, 
                        uh, very happy to have you here.

                                 LEE
                        I'd expect that's not entirely 
                        true.

           Lee follows Ted into the old house, its dilapidation still 
           peering out from under a fresh coat of paint. 

                                 TED
                        Well, there are some frayed nerves, 
                        of course, but that's just a given, 
                        what with the circumstances... The 
                        staff’s been instructed to extend 
                        you every courtesy.

                                 LEE
                        Thank you.

           A few stately relics remain, but at first glance the place is 
           largely empty, and awash in shadows despite the early hour.

                                 TED
                        Did you... ah... find the place ok 
                        with all the rain?

                                 LEE
                        I did. 

           Lee orients herself: one side of the foyer opens into a large 
           dining room, the other to a large LIBRARY without any books. 
           A narrow hallway runs alongside the staircase and takes a 
           turn at the rear of the house. Some newer piping is exposed 
           throughout.
                                 TED
                        I don't know if you've already been 
                        informed... but... We just got word 
                        that Dr. Shapiro has been detained. 
                        Or there was a missed flight. It 
                        wasn't particularly clear...

                                 LEE
                        Yes. I've been informed. 

                                 TED
                        It's unfortunate. It is. I know. 
                        Just completely destroys our whole 
                        schedule. We just found out 
                        ourselves. I'm surprised he 
                        didn't... In any case he should be 
                        here early tomorrow morning so if 
                        you don't mind waiting...

                                 LEE
                        I guess I don't have much of a 
                        choice.

                                 TED
                        No, I guess not... I'm so sorry... 
                        you're soaked. If you'd like, I can 
                        show you to your room and you can 
                        change out of those wet clothes. 

                                 LEE
                        Sure.

                                 TED
                        So ah. Yes. 
                             (he gestures meekly)
                        There's the dining hall... And the 
                        library, which leads you to the 
                        research lab. We have a room for 
                        you... upstairs.

           Lee follows Ted up the creaking staircase to the second 
           floor, wind and rain battering against a stairwell window.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Lee follows Ted down a long, dimly lit hallway, a number of 
           rooms on either side. 

                                 TED
                        We have... eight on staff here, in 
                        total - that's including myself. 
                        There are two bedrooms downstairs, 
                        four on this floor, two more 
                        upstairs. 
           He stops and opens the door to a narrow guest room. 

           INT. LEE'S ROOM - DAY

           Lee enters. Surveys the room. Sets her suitcase on a small 
           table.

                                 TED 
                        You have an en suite bathroom with 
                        a shower if you'd like to freshen 
                        up. And... then I'd be happy to 
                        give you a tour of the facilities, 
                        if you'd like.

                                 LEE 
                        Yes, thank you. I'd actually like 
                        to meet with Dr. Nakata and Dr. 
                        Ziegler as soon as possible.

                                 TED
                        Absolutely. Of course. They're 
                        eager to meet you.

                                 LEE
                        And Kathy Grieff. 

                                 TED
                             (taken aback)
                        Kathy Grieff. Of course. I uh... 
                        haven't checked in on her yet today 
                        but, ah---

                                 LEE
                        Well, when you do just let her know 
                        I'll be visiting with her soon.

                                 TED
                        Ohhhhkay. 

           Ted hovers at the door to her room, awkward.

                                 LEE
                        Is that it?

                                 TED
                        Yes. That’s it. I'll uh, leave you 
                        to... 
                             (mustering his nerve)
                        I did just want to say... Before we 
                        get into the thick of it all... I 
                        just hope that the company knows 
                        I've really had their best 
                        interests at heart here...
                                 LEE
                        No doubt.

                                 TED
                        Things are complicated... of 
                        course... but I think you'll see... 
                        that the results of our 
                        investment... despite the current 
                        situation... are quite remarkable.

                                 LEE
                        I'm sure I will.

           An awkward silence. Ted again misses his cue to leave.

                                 TED
                        Okay. Well. That's a... I'll be 
                        downstairs... When you're up for 
                        that tour.

           She gives him a tight smile and closes the door.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Lee showers, starting to come back to life after a day of 
           travelling. 

           There's a small window in the shower that looks out at the 
           clearing and the old barn across the way. The rain looks to 
           be letting up. 

           Lee watches another FIGURE in a rain slicker makes their way 
           across the field from the barn to the house.

           Lee turns off the water and stares out at the barn and the 
           trees in the distance, swaying darkly in the breeze. For a 
           moment, she closes her eyes...

           There’s a CREAK from the floorboards out in her room, and Lee 
           turns sharply to listen.

                                 LEE
                        Hello?

           She waits.

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Hello.

           INT. LEE'S ROOM - DAY

           Lee steps cautiously back into the guest room, wrapped in a 
           towel. 
           A pretty, pixie-ish YOUNG WOMAN (20s) is on her bed - 
           outstretched with her hands above her head and her bare feet 
           still on the ground.

                                 AMY
                        Hey.

                                 LEE
                        Hey…

           The girl  - AMY - rolls onto her side, resting her chin on 
           her palm.

                                 AMY
                        I'm Amy. I work in the lab.

                                 LEE
                             (hesitant)
                        Hi Amy. I'm Lee.

                                 AMY
                        Are you going to kill him?

                                 LEE
                        Excuse me?

                                 AMY
                        Morgan. Are you going to kill 
                        Morgan?

                                 LEE
                        I'm not... killing anybody. 

                                 AMY
                        But you're going to end it all.

                                 LEE
                        Amy... I'm just getting out of the 
                        shower... so....

           Amy rolls over, and takes in Lee’s figure... then snaps 
           herself out of it and sits up.

                                 AMY
                        I shouldn't even be in here. I 
                        know. I get it. Everyone says I 
                        have a problem with boundaries. I 
                        guess they might be right. 

                                 LEE
                        Might be.
                                 AMY
                        But you probably already read my 
                        file. You probably know more about 
                        me than I do. 

                                 LEE
                        I wouldn’t say that.

                                 AMY
                        Right. No. I mean a file’s just a 
                        file, right? A person’s a person. I 
                        mean, how do you know somebody 
                        before you know somebody? And even 
                        if you do know somebody, or think 
                        you do, maybe you just don’t. Maybe 
                        you’re just wrong about them... 
                        Maybe you’re dead wrong. And you 
                        really don’t know them at all.

           Lee doesn’t answer, just stares at Amy with no small amount 
           of bemusement.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m doing it again. I’m sorry. I’ll 
                        leave you alone. I guess we'll talk 
                        later?

                                 LEE
                        We'll talk later. 

           Amy stretches like a cat and finally draws herself out of the 
           bed, like she's been asleep there for hours.

                                 AMY
                        Skip's making a lasagna.

                                 LEE 
                             (playing along)
                        Can't wait.

                                 AMY
                        Nice to meet you, Lee.

                                 LEE
                        Nice to meet you, Amy.

           Lee stares after the quizzical young woman as she slinks out 
           of the room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Now in crisp business attire, Lee descends the creaking 
           staircase. She ties her hair back, tight.
           The house feels quiet and empty - until she reaches the 
           bottom of the stairs and can hear an 80s power ballad 
           crackling out of a radio around the corner.

           Lee moves towards the music, curling around the bottom of the 
           staircase and through to the back of the estate.

           INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Lee enters the full, bright kitchen - a bay of windows 
           looking out towards the rear of the clearing and the forest 
           beyond.

           A tall, scruffy guy in his 30s - SKIP - is hacking away at a 
           cut of pork and humming along to the radio. He notices Lee 
           and immediately HACKS into his own thumb.

                                 SKIP
                        Ah shit!

                                 LEE
                        Oh. No.

                                 SKIP
                        Fuckaduckadoo.

           He moves swiftly to the sink, turning on the cold water with 
           his good hand.

                                 LEE
                        I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle 
                        you. 

                                 SKIP
                        No---no! You didn’t. It’s just... 
                        Occupational hazard.  

                                 LEE
                        That doesn't look too good.

                                 SKIP 
                        Oh naw. It's fine. 

                                 LEE
                        Is it deep?

                                 SKIP
                        It's a knick. 

                                 LEE
                        There's a lot of blood. 

                                 SKIP
                        It's not bad.
                                 LEE
                        Let me look.

           She joins him at the sink, and as she inspects the cut he 
           sizes her up.

                                 SKIP
                        You're the plug puller?

                                 LEE
                        I'm sorry?

                                 SKIP
                        From corporate. Here to pull the 
                        plug?

                                 LEE
                        Not necessarily.

           She grabs a paper towel from a roll on the counter and folds 
           it into a tight, thin belt, then wraps his thumb.

                                 SKIP
                        Hey, it's no skin off my back. I 
                        don't have a pony in this race. I 
                        just keep the coffee brewing, the 
                        cookies baking, and the table set.

                                 LEE
                        Right. You're Skip. You're making 
                        lasagna.

                                 SKIP
                        My glorious contribution to 
                        scientific advance.

                                 LEE
                        Everybody loves lasagna.

           He smiles at her and she smiles back.

                                 TED (O.S.)
                        There you are.

           Skip startles. Lee turns to see Ted at the door, still coiled 
           tight.

                                 LEE
                        Here I am.

                        Jesus, Ted, I told ya, ya gotta 
                        quit creeping up like that. You’re 
                        a real creeper, you know that?
                                 TED
                        Ha ha. Very funny.

                        I’m not... He’s... I’m not a 
                        creeper. I just wanted to tell 
                        you... Dr. Ziegler's just finishing 
                        up a spot of work. But I thought we 
                        might pop in on Kathy... 

                                 LEE
                        That'll be fine, Ted. Thanks. 

           She turns back to Skip as she follows Ted out of the room.

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        I'd get a band-aid on that.

                                 SKIP
                        Yeah. Thanks.

           He stares after her, intrigued.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ted leads Lee around the corner to the house's rear hallway.

                                 TED
                        Kathy's an absolutely brilliant 
                        behaviorist, as I’m sure you know. 
                        Absolutely brilliant. It was all 
                        very…. shocking. But… she's 
                        doing... much better today. We're 
                        all really pleased that she could 
                        be treated here. It's what Kathy 
                        wanted.

                                 LEE
                        I read the report.

                                 TED
                        Of course. Still, she's ah— still 
                        not one hundred per cent, of 
                        course, so maybe we'll try to... 
                        keep it short?

           They arrive at a door. Ted knocks softly.

           INT. KATHY'S ROOM - DAY

           The door opens to reveal KATHY GRIEFF, recognizable from the 
           surveillance footage, though her left eye is heavily bandaged 
           and her hearty frame looks considerably weakened. 

           Another woman adjusts Kathy’s I.V. - BRENDA (30s).
                                 TED
                        Kathy... Brenda. this is Lee 
                        Weathers. From corporate. Lee, this 
                        is Kathy Grieff. ...and Brenda 
                        Schwartz, our nurse.

                                 LEE
                        Hello. Kathy, I was hoping we could 
                        have a little chat?

                                 KATHY
                        Oh, I’m up for anything. I told 
                        Bren, I told the Doc, hell, I told 
                        everyone - I don't need to stay in 
                        this goddamn bed, but no one seems 
                        to want to listen to me. 

                                 TED
                        Kathy... Lee was hoping that we 
                        could talk about the incident?

                                 BRENDA
                        She needs her rest.

                                 LEE
                        I was hoping to speak with Kathy 
                        alone, if that's alright?

                                 TED
                        Oh. Well...

                                 KATHY
                        It's fine Ted. Bren. Go on. 

                                 TED
                        Ok. Well. I'll uh... be... right 
                        outside.

           Brenda stifles further complaint and passes by Lee with a 
           strained smile. Ted shrugs to Lee, apologetic, and closes the 
           door behind them. 

           Lee sits herself in the chair by Kathy’s bed.

                                 KATHY
                        Look, this wasn't Morgan's fault. 
                        It was my fault, really. I was 
                        careless. He was in a mood. I'm not 
                        going to... the company doesn't 
                        have to worry about me, really. 

           Lee moves the chair in closer.
                                 LEE
                        Well…. we are worried, Kathy. Any 
                        time an employee is in danger of—

                                 KATHY
                        No. No, that's--I mean I don't--I 
                        won't hold the company---I 
                        exonerate the company from any... 
                        Look please just—-please don't kill 
                        him.

                                 LEE
                        Kathy...

                                 KATHY
                             (getting emotional)
                        Just please, please don't kill him. 

                                 LEE
                        It's not a him, Kathy. It's an It.

                                 KATHY
                        Oh, but you're wrong about that, 
                        Miss Weathers. You're dead wrong 
                        about that. Morgan's so much more 
                        than an “it”. He’s smart. Smarter 
                        than any of us. And... there was... 
                        joy in his heart. Before we shoved 
                        him back in that box. You haven't 
                        met him...?

                                 LEE 
                        Not yet.

                                 KATHY 
                        You'll see. You will. You really 
                        will. You just can't... Kill him. 
                        Promise me that.

                                 LEE
                        You know I can't make that promise, 
                        Kathy.

           Kathy's resolve collapses... She sobs.

                                 KATHY
                        Well then... goddamn you. 

           Lee’s tight, removed smile returns.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        You have a smile on your face, but 
                        I can see what you are! You're a 
                        goddamn assassin!
           Something sharpens in Lee’s eyes. She quells it, stands. 
           Steps towards the door.

                                 LEE
                        I’ll let you get some rest.

                                 KATHY
                        No. No, I'm sorry. I'm not myself. 
                        He's a good boy. You'll see. You 
                        will. Morgan's a good boy. He was 
                        confused is all. He just got it 
                        all… mixed up - just for a moment. 
                        It can happen to anyone. It can. 
                             (stifling her tears)
                        He’s a good boy.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Lee emerges into the hallway. Ted is waiting for her with the 
           sheepish look of someone who's been straining to eavesdrop. 

                                 TED
                        Everything...ok?

                                 LEE
                        Compared to what?

                                 TED
                        Well I just— you can see she's 
                        actually doing much better. 

                                 LEE
                        I'll take your word for it. Are the 
                        doctors ready to see me?

           Ted sucks it up and leads her around a corner.

                                 TED
                        Yes. Of course. Well. Unfortunately 
                        Dr. Nakata is unable to join us.

                                 LEE
                        Why's that?

                                 TED
                        Oh. Well. In truth, she hasn't... 
                        been in the best of health 
                        recently, I'm sorry to say. She's 
                        taking a bit of a rest. But... I'm 
                        sure the two of you will be able to 
                        touch base later.

           They arrive at a large set of double doors, which Ted opens.
           INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY

           The research lab is an impenetrable maze of tables stacked 
           with monitors, drives, cameras, computers. Cables and wires 
           have grown around every possible surface, like ivy. It’s an 
           anachronistic space in this rustic home.

                                 TED
                        Doctor?

           From behind a bank of monitors, a face pops up - weathered, 
           gaunt, unshaven. It belongs to an intense looking man who now 
           comes towards them - DR. SIMON ZIEGLER (late 40s). 

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Miss Weathers?

                                 LEE
                        Dr. Ziegler. Pleasure.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Yes, a pleasure, absolutely...

           They hover uncomfortably - Ziegler is not one for eye 
           contact. 

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        Please... ah.... Sit...

           It's easier said than done in the cluttered lab. As Dr. 
           Ziegler returns to his desk, Ted antsily removes a stack of 
           papers from a desk chair and rolls it over for Lee.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        Did ah... Ted tell you? Our psych 
                        consult has been delayed?

                                 LEE
                        I'm aware.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        It's unfortunate that your stay 
                        here is... needlessly extended.

                                 LEE
                        That's ok, Doctor. We'll adjust. 
                        Why don't you get me up to speed?

           Dr. Ziegler and Ted exchange a nervous smile.
                                 ZIEGLER
                        Yes. Let's ah... get you up to 
                        speed...

                                                                CUT TO:

                        The object here was of course to 
                        trick the organic matter into 
                        accepting the inorganic. To do that 
                        we had to devise a nanotech that 
                        could successfully infiltrate the 
                        electrical network of the 
                        neuron....

                        I've read the material, Doctor.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        Yes. Of course...

           Lee and Dr. Ziegler sit at a bank of monitors, cords spilling 
           off the table and onto the floor. Ted hangs back on the 
           fringes of the room.

                              regardless)
                        In this case the nanotech can 
                        provide cues to the host matter, 
                        hence the accelerated growth of the 
                        test subjects.

           The CREATURE seems to split open from the inside, revealing a 
           host of BLACKENED ORGANS. The scientists recoil in horror.

                        We knew right away that Morgan was 
                        very special.

           Through the cluster of scientists we catch a glimpse of the 
           PALE HAIRLESS FIGURE in the pod.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        Within six months we had Morgan 
                        fully online and self sustaining. 

           VIDEO FILE: now a static MEDIUM SHOT of Morgan at a table in 
           her room. KATHY GRIEFF sits across from Morgan in a 
           friendlier encounter than the one glimpsed before, working 
           through a series of flash cards.

                        With access to the network, 
                        Morgan’s intelligence grew 
                        steadily... easily eclipsing what 
                        the human mind is capable of. The 
                        benefits of a... total 
                        intelligence.

           VIDEO FILE: now a grainy handheld phone video of a lively 
           group dinner. 

           Ziegler taps at Morgan’s image on the monitor: in her hoodie 
           at the head of the table. 

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        As you can see we had her fully 
                        integrated... 

                                 LEE
                        Her?

                                 ZIEGLER
                        What? Oh. Her. Him. It. Yes. It's 
                        an... occupational hazard I 
                        suppose.

           An uncomfortable glance towards Ted.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        Morgan is a... post-gender 
                        specimen, as you know. So it is... 
                        Whichever you prefer.

                                 LEE
                        I think I prefer “it”.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Yes. Well. Scientifically... that 
                        would be the most appropriate.

                                 LEE
                        Yes. It would wouldn't it?

           [NOTE TO THE READER: For our purposes here, we will follow 
           Ziegler's lead and refer to Morgan as a “she”.]

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Yes. Well... as I was saying... 
                        Morgan had been... fully integrated 
                        into the group. 

           VIDEO FILE: the staff gathered on the front lawn... A game of 
           HORSESHOES. Skip demonstrates to Morgan how to throw. 
           Morgan follows suit - arcing the horseshoe perfectly. The 
           group cheers. 

           BACK IN THE RESEARCH LAB, Ziegler considers the footage 
           warmly.

                                 TED
                        Great day. Great, super fun day.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        Remarkable day. As you can see....  
                        Morgan was... doing very well. 
                        She... had exceeded our 
                        expectations. ...And was integrated 
                        into our collective experience on 
                        most days. Making uncued 
                        contributions to the group. Special 
                        activities like this. 

           He relaxes into his seat as the footage continues. Lost in 
           his memories.

                                 TED
                        The cupcakes.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        Ah yes. She made us all cupcakes.

                                 TED
                        Incredible cupcakes. Red velvet. 
                        Delicious.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        Yes. Red velvet. They were very 
                        good. We were all very impressed. 

           Ziegler notices Lee’s look of (what he takes for) impatience.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT’D)
                        Of course, we were still sleeping 
                        her in her quarters. And limiting 
                        her time outside. Which may have... 
                        contributed... to her change in 
                        disposition. 

           Ziegler’s tone darkens as he recalls the events.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT’D)
                        Her mood grew increasingly... 
                        despondent. She would repeatedly 
                        request to spend more time outside. 
                        And... to leave the grounds.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT’D)
                        And when these requests were 
                        refused, she was... less happy than 
                        she seemed before.

                                 LEE
                        It seemed happy before?

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Yes. I think everyone here would 
                        agree that Morgan's company in 
                        those first months was very 
                        agreeable. And we all sensed 
                        this... change. It is... not unlike 
                        a child who has been coddled 
                        getting the first experience of 
                        authority. It is a... natural 
                        phenomenon. And a testament to how 
                        effective Morgan has been at 
                        learning behavior on a human scale.

           VIDEO FILE: FOOTAGE OF THE KATHY ATTACK which Lee has seen 
           earlier.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        Morgan was spending more time alone 
                        in her room. Largely at Dr. 
                        Nakata’s insistence. Which is when 
                        Kathy brought in the food. Thought 
                        that maybe she could cheer Morgan 
                        up. And... then the, ah, the 
                        unfortunate incident. 

           The footage continues past the point we’ve seen before - as a 
           BURLY MEDTECH runs into the frame and tries to subdue Morgan, 
           only to be THROWN ASIDE like a rag doll.

           Another man enters - ZIEGLER HIMSELF -  firing at Morgan with 
           a TRANQUILIZER GUN. Morgan goes down, seizing, thrashing.

           BACK IN THE RESEARCH LAB, Dr. Ziegler observes the scene play 
           out with grim regret.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT’D)
                        A malfunction. I can blame only 
                        myself. 
                             (snapping out of it, at 
                              least superficially)
                        Have you had a chance to visit with 
                        Kathy?

                                 TED
                        We just did.
                                 ZIEGLER
                        Then you know that we are all very 
                        pleased with her recovery. And as 
                        I'm sure you've read, Morgan has 
                        expressed a great deal of guilt and 
                        apology for her error. Which I 
                        believe points to the fact that 
                        despite these setbacks, the project 
                        is moving... in the right 
                        direction.

           Lee takes a moment to study Ziegler's face. How mad has he 
           gone?

                                 LEE
                        I will certainly take your opinion 
                        into consideration, Doctor Ziegler. 
                        But as you know there are a... 
                        number of factors we have to take 
                        into account.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Yes. Of course. The bottom line, as 
                        it were, will no doubt bear us out. 

           He polishes his glasses, now lost in thought. 

           Lee’s attention turns to another MONITOR: current 
           SURVEILLANCE OF MORGAN’S ROOM. 

           Morgan lies on her side in a corner of the screen, her back 
           to the camera.

                                 TED
                        Well... thank you, Dr. Ziegler. I'm 
                        sure you're... eager to get back to 
                        work. Lee - if that's... all for 
                        now... We're ah... we like to do 
                        dinners together... as a group... 
                        so if you wanted to rest up, I 
                        think we should be eating around 
                        six...

                                 LEE
                        Actually Ted, I think it’s time I 
                        met Morgan.

                                 TED
                        Morgan? Now?

           He looks uneasily towards Ziegler for guidance.

                                 LEE
                        Yes. Is that a problem?
                                 ZIEGLER
                        Morgan's been under a considerable 
                        amount of strain. With the psych 
                        consult tomorrow I really don't---

                                 LEE
                        This shouldn't be much of a strain, 
                        Doctor. I'd just like to say hello. 

           ON THE MONITOR: Morgan has turned to regard the camera - her 
           small, blurry black eyes impassive and unknowable.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Lee follows Dr. Ziegler and Ted across the bleak, wet field 
           towards the barn.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        I'll be the first to admit the 
                        landscaping has gotten the best of 
                        us. We have been busy with other 
                        things, as you shall see.

           Ziegler leads them to a small secure door at the side.

           As they near it, Ziegler rifles through his pockets and 
           finally emerges with a key card which he swipes by the 
           security panel. The door unlocks and they go through. 

           INT. BARN - DAY

           It's a cavernous old barn, slivers of light creeping through 
           old boards. It has been cleared out, and two large generators 
           now sit across from each other in the back. Between the 
           generators, a STEEL DOORWAY is set into the ground at an 
           angle. Ziegler leads them towards it.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        It is, of course... necessary for 
                        you to meet Morgan, I understand 
                        that. I want you to meet her...

           He throws open the door, now leading them into a narrow 
           stairwell.

           INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - DAY

           The three of them make their way down the bunker-like 
           staircase - much more industrial than anything we've seen at 
           the house.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        I want you to see how special she 
                        is. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZIEGLER  (CONT'D)
                        But she has been under quite a bit 
                        of strain. We've been experimenting 
                        with the restraint modification on 
                        the command cues... 

           Lee holds her tongue as they reach the bottom of the stairs 
           and round into a corridor lined with next wave tech.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        And with the psych evaluation 
                        tomorrow I would recommend your 
                        time with her now be brief.

           Ziegler slows, gestures for Lee to wait. He moves to the 
           center of the corridor and raises his hands. A HISS from 
           above and Ziegler is engulfed completely in a PALE BLUE FOG 
           for about five seconds.

           The fog clears, and he gestures for Lee to do the same. 

           She does, touching the panel and disappearing into the fog. 

           She continues on after Ziegler, as Ted follows suit.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT'D)
                        I'm sure you're well acquainted 
                        with facilities such as this one, 
                        so I need not recite any boiler 
                        plate protocols?

                                 LEE
                        I'm acquainted.

           The Doctor comes to a secured door at the end of the corridor 
           and holds down a button on the intercom beside it.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Darren, could you open please?

           The door slides open. Lee follows the Doctor inside, Ted 
           right behind.

           INT. MAIN LAB - DAY

           They enter a deep narrow lab, Ziegler immediately distracted 
           by the display on one of the monitors. 

           Thick glass runs the length of the control panel on the right 
           wall looking out onto TWO LOWER LEVELS. 

           To the left a panelled door leading to an empty MEDLAB, 
           visible through another large pane of glass.
           At his station in the main lab is DARREN (20s), a burly, 
           bearded medtech we’ve glimpsed in video footage. 

           LOUD, MUFFLED MUSIC bleeds through from one of the lower 
           levels. Led Zeppelin. Kashmir.

                        Darren, this is Lee Weathers. From 
                        corporate.

           Lee's attention, however, is out the window. The first lower 
           level is another narrow OBSERVATION ROOM a thick glass wall 
           separating it from the familiar room beyond...

                                 DARREN (O.S.)
                        Whoa. OK. Hey.

           This second lower level is MORGAN'S ROOM. Lee recognizes it 
           immediately from the footage. Spare, utilitarian, and grimly 
           “homey” - it wouldn't be out of place in an Ikea showroom.

                                 DARREN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You're uh....

           Lee takes a step over and spots Morgan. She’s lying down on 
           her single bed, facing the wall. Lee turns back to Darren.

                                 DARREN (CONT'D)
                        You're the one that's here to— 

           He mimes pulling a plug from the panel.

                                 LEE
                        Not necessarily.

                                 TED
                        Darren is our chief lab technician 
                        and recordist.

                                 LEE
                        Nice to meet you, Darren.

           Darren nods, checking her out.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        What's with the music?

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Ah. Yes. The music. Morgan finds it 
                        relaxing.

                                 LEE
                        Morgan finds.... this relaxing?
                                 ZIEGLER 
                        Yes. Well. Morgan likes all kinds 
                        of music. Jazz. Classical.  

                                 DARREN
                        Been on an Ozzy kick lately. Early 
                        Sabbath n’ shit.

                                 ZIEGLER
                             (defensive)
                        Perhaps, but also - Shostakovich. 
                        Mozart. Bach. She is... very taken 
                        with Mahler of late. 

                                 DARREN
                        And rocking the shit outta that 
                        Beyoncé last week. 

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Yes. All kinds.
                             (changing his tone)
                        Lee would like to say hello. Could 
                        you have Morgan turn it down?

                                 DARREN
                        Right. Yeah. 

           Darren swings into the console and taps on a mic.

                                 DARREN (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Morgan? Buddy? Want to turn 
                        down the music for a few? There's 
                        someone here we'd... like you to 
                        meet, ok? 

           The music snaps off instantly with nobody lifting a finger. 

                                 ZIEGLER
                             (answering Lee’s unasked 
                              question)
                        The room is... online.

           MORGAN lies there for a long moment... then sits up, swinging 
           her legs around the side of the bed.

           She stares up towards the window. Up to Lee.

           Morgan's androgynous, intense presence is instantly 
           disquieting. Her pale face and pitch black eyes stare out 
           from under the dark hoodie. 

           She looks Lee directly in the eye, inscrutable.

           Lee is unsettled but doesn't look away.
           Ted breaks the intense moment, opening the door to the lower 
           level. 

                                 TED 
                        Lee. We can... through here....

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM / MORGAN'S ROOM

           Ted leads Lee and Dr. Ziegler into the narrow, dimly lit 
           observation room. The door closes behind them. Morgan's room 
           is another small step down, a wall of glass and a steel frame 
           door separating the two levels.

           Ted remains at the back of the observation room, not leaving 
           the shadows. Lee approaches the glass, Ziegler behind her. 

           Morgan stands and moves towards them, focused on Lee. 

           She brings down her hood, revealing her pale, bald head.

                                 LEE
                        Hello Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hello Lee.

           Morgan’s voice is deeper than we expected, with a kind of 
           digital burn deep within it. 

                                 ZIEGLER
                             (to Lee)
                        Of course she... Knows who you 
                        are....

                                 MORGAN
                        You're Lee Weathers. Risk 
                        Management Consultant at Omnicron.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        ...And why you are here.

                                 MORGAN
                        To assess my viability as a product 
                        stream in light of recent events.

                                 LEE
                        That's right. 

           A tense silence as they size each other up. Lee and Morgan 
           are close now - on either side of the glass. Morgan looks Lee 
           up and down, like a scanner having its way with a photograph.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        How are you feeling, Morgan?
           Morgan stares at her unblinking and then a cascade of emotion 
           rushes across her face. She quickly tamps it down.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m feeling... not quite myself.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Morgan’s been quite upset about... 
                        Kathy.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes. I have. I have been very sad 
                        about what happened with Kathy.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        That's ok now, Morgan. It's 
                        alright.

           Lee shoots the Doctor a look - let her talk.

                                 MORGAN
                        I didn't mean to hurt her. I 
                        didn't. Kathy is a very sweet 
                        person. I would never want to do 
                        anything to hurt her. It was an 
                        error. 

                                 LEE
                        Okay.

           Morgan's emotions seem about to explode when again she 
           decisively stamps them out and is again cool, controlled. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I did not mean to be rude. How are 
                        you feeling, Lee?

                                 LEE
                        I'm ok, Morgan. I'm alright.
                             (a beat, as Lee sizes her 
                              up)
                        Thanks for asking.

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't know much about you.

                                 LEE
                        No?

                                 MORGAN
                        You stay offline.

                                 LEE
                        When I can.
                                 MORGAN
                        I don't... have that option. My 
                        consciousness exists online.

                                 LEE
                        I know.

                                 MORGAN
                        But flesh and bone... are flesh and 
                        bone. Except for...

           Morgan taps at the back of her neck displaying a pin-sized 
           silver dot.

           Lee doesn't respond, but doesn't shy away from Morgan's gaze 
           when it returns.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Do you want me to talk about what 
                        happened?

                                 TED
                             (piping up from the back)
                        We're actually going to save the 
                        psych evaluation for tomorrow, 
                        Morgan.

                                 MORGAN 
                        I know, Ted. The psych consult has 
                        been delayed.

                                 TED
                        That's right.

                                 MORGAN
                        Doctor Alan Shapiro. He missed his 
                        flight. For personal reasons. He's 
                        been rerouted through Boston. He 
                        should be here around 10am. 11 if 
                        he misses the shuttle. 

                                 TED
                        Sounds about right, Morgan. We're 
                        hoping... he'll make the shuttle.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes, we're hoping he'll make the 
                        shuttle. 

           Morgan shakes her head, catching herself in the mistake - the 
           unwarranted repetition. 
                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        I should rest now. I'm feeling very 
                        tired.

                                 TED
                        Are we all good here, Lee?

                                 LEE
                        We're good.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        You should rest, Morgan. You should 
                        get a good night's sleep.

                                 MORGAN 
                        Yes,  thank you Dr. Ziegler.
                             (quietly to Lee)
                        I do feel terribly about it all. It 
                        was an error. It should not have 
                        happened.

                                 LEE
                        We'll talk about it tomorrow, 
                        Morgan.

                                 MORGAN 
                        Yes. Tomorrow. I'm feeling very 
                        tired. 

                                 ZIEGLER
                        We will... let you rest. Lee...?

                                 LEE
                        It was nice to meet you, Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Nice to meet you Lee. In the flesh.

           Lee looks back as she exits. Morgan remains at the glass, not 
           moving. 

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Lee follows Ted and the Doctor back across the unkept field.

           The sun is starting to set. 

                                 ZIEGLER
                        You’re not even going to say it?

                                 LEE
                        Say what?
                                 ZIEGLER
                        That you are impressed.

                                 LEE
                        Is that what you need me to say, 
                        Doctor? That I’m impressed?

           They walk on in silence, Ziegler fuming.

           INT. LEE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Lee polishes her gun - a smooth, deadly semi-automatic pistol 
           - sitting on the foot of her bed.

                                 LEE (V.O. CONT’D)
                        Then I’m impressed.

           The floor creaks outside her room. She stops. Watches the 
           small dance of light and shadow in the gap between the door 
           and the floor. 

           Someone KNOCKS.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        One moment.

           Lee places her gun back in its case, and slides the case 
           under the bed.

           She gets up and opens the door.

           DR. AIKO NAKATA.

           A small, weathered Japanese woman in her early 70s, with eyes 
           that hint at a deep, hidden volume. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Nakata.

           Dr. Nakata nods, slowly, her cane steadying her.

                                 DR. NAKATA
                        I apologize for the intrusion. 

                                 LEE
                        Not at all. Please, come in, sit.

                                 DR. NAKATA
                        I will not be joining you for 
                        dinner, but I wanted to tell you I 
                        am... pleased you are here.

           Nakata plants her fragile frame in a chair by the window.
                                 DR. NAKATA 
                        Your travels?

                                 LEE
                        Fine. Thank you. I’m sorry to hear 
                        you’ve been in poor health.

                                 DR. NAKATA
                        I am just… old.

                                 LEE
                        Not that old.

           Dr. Nakata sighs and smiles softly.

                                 DR. NAKATA 
                        You are… very beautiful.

                                 LEE
                        Thank you. 
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        We can speak in Japanese if you’d 
                        like.

                                 DR. NAKATA 
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        You’re fluent?

           Lee nods.

                                 DR. NAKATA
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        Of course. I have heard that you do 
                        much work… Internationally. 

                                 LEE
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        I do.

           Nakata looks out towards the barn.

                                 DR. NAKATA 
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        And you were there… in Hokkaido?

                                 LEE
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        Just after.

                                 DR. NAKATA 
                        So you saw what happened.

           Lee nods. Dr. Nakata’s gaze grows heavy, grave.
                                 DR. NAKATA
                        And you know what you must do.

           The two women exchange a long, pregnant look.

           INT. MORGAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Morgan sits in alone in her room, at her table. 

           She stares up towards the lab, only a sliver of her face 
           unhidden by shadow.

           Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” is playing. LOUD.

           Morgan at first seems still. But then we notice her moving 
           finger. 

           She pulls a single fingernail slowly down the surface of the 
           wooden table, cutting a small sliver of wood out of the 
           grain.

           INT. DINING ROOM, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Lee cuts another bite of her lasagna. 

           There is a tense, nervous silence in the dining room, as Lee 
           and the staff continue to make their way through dinner.

           Around the table - Ziegler, Ted, Amy, Darren, Brenda and 
           Skip. Kathy Grieff hasn’t made it. Nor has Dr. Nakata.

                                 BRENDA
                        So Lee, what does that mean 
                        exactly, Risk Management 
                        consultant?

                                 LEE
                        Pretty much what it sounds like. 
                        Any corporation employs a certain 
                        amount of risk. I assess that risk 
                        against anticipated profit.

           A silence. Dr. Ziegler pours himself another large glass of 
           wine.

                                 DARREN
                        Cool. So if it's like... not worth 
                        the anticipated profit or what have 
                        you - you just like... what?

                                 TED
                        Darren... Give it a rest would you? 
                        Lee doesn't want to---
                                 DARREN 
                        I heard one time, like, outside of 
                        Tokyo, they wasted a whole lab. Is 
                        that true?

                                 TED
                        Whooooooa Darren. Whoa.

                                 LEE
                        I'm afraid I can't comment on that.

                                 BRENDA
                        Which is kind of like saying it's 
                        true, isn’t it?

                                 LEE
                        It’s not at all like saying that.

                                 TED
                        Let's give it a rest huh?

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Ted's right. It's not our place to 
                        pry into Miss Weathers business.

                                 DARREN
                        Aw, I wasn't prying or anything. 
                        It's just if they sent you here, I 
                        bet you've seen a thing or two... 

                                 ZIEGLER
                        That's enough, Darren.

                                 LEE
                        That's ok, Doctor. It's true. I've 
                        seen a thing or two. But nothing I 
                        can comment on, I'm afraid. Kind of 
                        part of the job.

                                 DARREN
                        Riiiiiiiiight.

           Darren shoots her a wink somehow satisfied.

           Silence as the meal continues. Lee considers Darren and 
           Brenda.

                                 LEE
                        How long have you two been married?

                                 DARREN
                        Almost... two years.
                                 BRENDA
                        It'll be our anniversary next week.

                                 LEE
                        Congratulations in advance, then. 
                        You met on the project?

                                 BRENDA
                        We did. Close quarters makes for 
                        strange bedfellows I guess. 
                        It's funny... in a weird way 
                        Morgan's really... brought us 
                        together. He's... almost like a 
                        child to us.

           Brenda rubs Darren's back with affection. Amy mimes throwing 
           up and shoots Lee a mischievous grin.

                                 BRENDA (CONT'D)
                        Isn't that right, babe?

                                 DARREN
                             (hesitant but obliging)
                        Absolutely. Well, you know. You met 
                        her today. You can see how... uh... 
                        special she is. She's.... like a 
                        child. She's an innocent. And... 
                        she's learning... and, you know...

           The rest of the table falls silent, tensing up.

                                 BRENDA
                        He... he is making mistakes. But 
                        he's learning from those mistakes. 
                        He doesn't deserve to die.

           An awkward silence.

                                 BRENDA (CONT'D)
                        I might be the only one saying 
                        it...
                             (glares at Darren)
                        ...But I'm not the only one who 
                        thinks it. 

                                 AMY
                        Give it a rest, Brenda. 

                                 BRENDA
                        Like you don't agree with me. 
                        Morgan's part of our family. 
                             (to Lee)
                        You can't just come in here and... 
                        and murder him. Just like that. 
                                 TED
                        Well. Now. Now. Let's not... Let's 
                        give Corporate a little respect 
                        here. Let's not... lose our heads. 
                        It's not fair to them - to Lee - to 
                        make any assumptions. Lee's here to 
                        make her own informed assessment of 
                        the situation and take all of our 
                        opinions into account. Isn't that 
                        right, Lee?

                                 LEE
                        I'm here to take everything into 
                        account. But I want to be very 
                        clear on one thing. You're not a 
                        family. That thing under the barn 
                        is not your child. You're employees 
                        of a corporation. And you've been 
                        employed to create a product. If 
                        your judgement has been clouded. If 
                        your work has been compromised. 
                        That's not my problem. It's yours.

           She moves her chair away from the table.

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        Skip... the lasagna was delicious.

           Skip gives her a nod from the other side of the table as she 
           passes, the only one enjoying the tension in the room.

           Once Lee is gone, dour looks ricochet around the table. 

                                 BRENDA
                             (sarcastic)

                                 DARREN
                        Baby...

                                 BRENDA
                        Don't. Just don't.

           Ziegler takes another heavy belt of his wine.

           INT. LEE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Lee enters her darkened room and doesn’t bother turning a 
           light on. Instead, she moves to her window, and stares out 
           towards the old barn across the field, illuminated now by 
           only a faint trace of moonlight.
           INT. MORGAN’S ROOM

           We catch just a glimpse of Morgan’s pale, hairless, 
           featureless body as she slides naked underneath her sheets on 
           her small single bed.

           She pulls up a blanket, and closes her eyes.

           Her fingers dig into the side of the bedframe.

           BLACKNESS.

           Heavy breath. 

           A voice muffled over a P.A., echoing down hallways:

                                 P.A.
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        All personnel. Exit to ground level 
                        immediately. Repeat, exit to ground 
                        level immediately.

           Flashing lights.

           Flashing lights reflecting on a floor. 

           A hand. Pulling us forward, our shoes squeaking against the 
           floor.

           BLOOD.

           Ours, or someone else’s?

           Someone else’s. 

           A DEAD BODY just ahead: caught in the flashing lights. 

                                 P.A. (CONT’D)
                             (IN JAPANESE)
                        All personnel. Exit to ground level 
                        immediately. 

           People in HAZMAT SUITS running past the window, one of them 
           with an AXE in hand.

                                 P.A. (CONT’D)
                        Repeat, exit to ground level 
                        immediately.

           We lift ourselves up. Steady ourselves against the counter.

           Catch our own reflection...

           LEE.
           Covered in blood. 

           Fear in her eyes.

           INT. LEE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Lee opens her eyes. The fear remains.  

           The room is dark. Just a small river of moonlight trickling 
           in through the window. 

           A muffled sobbing. Female or... male? Maybe the next room 
           over. 

           Lee sits up in bed. Looks to the clock on the bedside table. 
           1:17 AM.

           Lee moves to the window. Stares out at the dark barn across 
           the field.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Lee emerges from her room, tying her hair back. She's gotten 
           dressed.

           As she heads for the stairs, the floor creaking beneath her 
           soft steps, she passes a door - that sobbing again. 

           Lee listens for a moment, then heads down the stairs. 

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           An old song is humming out of the kitchen, and its warm glow 
           spills into the dark of the hall.

           Lee steps towards it, cautious. Peers into the kitchen and 
           sees Skip, cracking eggs into a bowl full of flour and, by 
           the looks of it, enjoying a cocktail. 

           A sound from deeper down the hall, deep in the shadows.

           Lee moves past the kitchen, unnoticed.

           INT. RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT

           Lee pushes open the door to the research lab.

           The room is cast in a dim blue glow from the video monitors 
           piled everywhere.

           Lee steps into the dark maze of old lab equipment and file 
           cabinets, dark serpents of cable strewn in her path.

           THE SOUND AGAIN. Louder. Coming from in here. 
           Lee realizes it’s coming from one of the VIDEO FEEDS: a feed 
           from MORGAN’S ROOM. 

           A deep, low, anguished sound is coming from Morgan. 

                                 KATHY (O.S.)
                        He’s crying.

           Lee swings around, startled to see Kathy sitting in the 
           shadows, clutching her IV. 

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Our beautiful baby boy is crying.

                                 LEE
                        You should be getting some rest, 
                        Kathy.

                                 KATHY
                        You see how bad he feels. You see 
                        how my baby would never hurt me 
                        again.
                             (she turns to Lee, a look 
                              of childlike confusion 
                              spreading across her 
                              face)
                        I shouldn’t be in here.

                                 LEE
                        Let’s get you back to bed. 

           INT. KATHY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Lee helps Kathy lower herself onto her bed. As Lee begins to 
           pull away, Kathy grips her arm, tightly.

                                 KATHY
                        If I had more strength... I’d tear 
                        your throat out myself.

           Kathy’s grip relaxes and her head falls against the pillow.

           Lee pulls away, unsettled. 

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lee closes Kathy’s door and takes a moment to steady herself 
           against the frame.

                                 SKIP (O.S.)
                        Couldn’t sleep?

           Lee turns to see Skip, sticking his head out of the kitchen.
                                 LEE
                        I guess not.

                                 SKIP
                        Want a drink?

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lee follows Skip into the kitchen, the oldies station on a 
           small radio.

           Skip hurries back to check on a saucepan.

                                 SKIP
                        Thought maybe I'd... bake a cake.

                                 LEE
                        So I see.

                                 SKIP
                        I like cooking at night. ...That, 
                        and Darren and Brenda are having 
                        sex in the room next to mine. 
                        Again. And it is... Disgusting. 
                        Again.

                                 LEE
                        Gotcha.

           Skip moves to the pantry to grab a bottle. 

                                 SKIP
                        Nice old house but the walls are 
                        paper thin. 

           Lee’s gaze settles on the old HUNTING RIFLE resting there. 

                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                             (noting her gaze)
                        Oh yeah. Old Bess. Farm fresh 
                        around here. I’m not a half bad 
                        shot, you wanna know the truth.

           Lee smiles.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, looking in at them: WE SEE Skip pour a 
           couple of drinks, and set one in front of Lee. She takes a 
           sip and turns her gaze out the window...

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Someone’s outside the window, watching. They step back 
           further into the shadows, careful to avoid Lee’s gaze.
           IT’S AMY.

           She continues to back carefully away, then turns and begins 
           to make her way towards the barn, the tall grass swatting her 
           bare legs.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Skip and Lee sit at the kitchen table, drinking.

                                 SKIP
                        You like corporate?

                                 LEE
                        I like it fine.

                                 SKIP
                        Been there long?

                                 LEE
                        A while.

                                 SKIP
                        You're kind of an over-sharer, huh?

           She gives him a slight smile and pounds back the rest of her 
           glass. He refills it.

                                 LEE
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 SKIP
                        Shoot.

                                 LEE
                        What do you think about Morgan?

                                 SKIP
                             (taken aback)
                        I think... it's probably not a good 
                        idea. And frankly, I know we're all 
                        “one big happy family” up here but 
                        thing's always given me the creeps.

                                 LEE
                        You're the only one I've heard say 
                        that.

                                 SKIP
                        Yeah well. I'm no scientist. Or 
                        maybe I'm just jealous.

           Lee raises an eyebrow. Skip leans in, confidingly.
                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                        That fucking robot made me a 
                        perfect risotto. Perfect. Like the 
                        kind of risotto you might... dream 
                        of one day having the pleasure to 
                        taste. Just to taste! Did it like 
                        it was nothing. They say you have 
                        to cook with heart and soul and all 
                        that shit but I’m telling you... 
                        That risotto... that risotto was 
                        fucking perfect. 

           Lee laughs. Skip can't help it. He goes in for the kiss. She 
           turns away, stopping him dead in his tracks.

                                 LEE
                        That’s not going to happen.

                                 SKIP
                        What? I thought....

                                 LEE
                        You thought...?

                                 SKIP
                        ...That there was, you know...

           He forlornly gestures at the connection between them.

                                 LEE
                             (smiling)
                        Sorry, but no.

                                 SKIP
                        Ok. Alright. That's on me. I 
                        thought there was... Look, you 
                        can't blame a guy for trying.

                                 LEE
                        I can't?

                                 SKIP
                        If you knew how long I've been out 
                        here in fuck you Pennsylvania 
                        flipping grilled cheeses for 
                        scientists... and cutting off 
                        crusts for C3PO out there...

                                 LEE
                        Goodnight Skip.

                                 SKIP
                        Allllllright. Goodnight 
                        disappointing lady.
           Lee grins at him, merciless, and is gone. Skip refills his 
           glass with a heavy sigh.

           EXT. BARN - NIGHT

           Amy punches a code into the panel near the door. It opens. 
           She steals a look back towards the farm house and disappears 
           into the barn.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           The door to the lower lab glows like a beacon in the dark 
           barn. Amy makes her way towards it.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Amy steps in. It’s dark, quiet. Just a small glow in Morgan’s 
           room. A lamp still on in the lab above.

                                 AMY
                        Morgan?

           She approaches the glass, trying to spot her.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Morgan?

           Morgan steps into the light, naked. We can see she has no 
           genitalia. No features on her body of any kind.

           Amy puts a hand to the glass. 

           Morgan approaches. Puts a matching hand to the glass.

           Amy doesn't respond. Closes her eyes, rests her cheek on the 
           divider.

                                 MORGAN
                        You shouldn't be here, Amy. 

                                 AMY
                        You shouldn’t be in there.

                                 MORGAN
                        You'll get in trouble.

           Amy pushes away from the glass and begins to disrobe.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to do that.

                                 AMY
                        I want to. 
           Morgan says nothing. The light catches in her black eyes.

                                 MORGAN
                        Tell me again. About the lake.

                                 AMY
                        You remembered. 

           Amy smiles, continues to slowly remove her clothes.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to take you to the lake. 
                        Just a hop, skip and a jump... and 
                        there it is. Just the prettiest 
                        little lake you’ll ever see in your 
                        whole life. When you’re there... at 
                        just the right time of the 
                        morning... The sun just kissing the 
                        peaks of the mountains... and the 
                        water is so, so still and still so 
                        shimmering.... And maybe you’ll 
                        hear just the smallest whisper of 
                        wind through the trees...

           Morgan listens - impassive, her black eyes wide.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING

           The trees do carry a whisper of wind - their leaves reaching 
           the end of their Autumnal majesty.

                                 AMY (V.O., CONT’D)
                        ...It’s just like heaven....

           Lee jogs along the country road, away from Grant Farms, the 
           woods at her side. No rain, but it's a grey, muddy day.

           She passes the abandoned barns she noted before and 
           approaches the edge of country road where it intersects with 
           the two lane blacktop.

           As the shuttered up FlapJack's comes into view she stops to 
           catch her breath. And heads back in the other direction.

           EXT. GRANT FARMS GATE - DAY

           Lee arrives at the gate and presses the button on the 
           intercom.

                                 LEE
                        Lee Weathers. Security clearance 
                        ALPHA NINER ZERO BETA BETA ZOO 
                        FERRET FIVE.
           The gate whirrs open.

           EXT. GRANT FARMS - DAY

           Lee heads up the walk. 

           Brenda is raking the garden and shoots her a dirty look.

           As Lee nears the house she looks up to see Dr. Nakata in her 
           second floor window, staring out at the grey sky.

           I.E. LEE’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Lee has a shower, watching as a WHITE RENTAL CAR careens 
           towards the house down the long dirt road. 

           INT. LEE'S ROOM - DAY

           Lee tucks in her shirt, ties back her hair. 

           Straps on a sleek black holster, slips in her GUN. Pulls her 
           crisply tailored blazer over it.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Lee emerges into the hall to the muted sounds of a MAN'S 
           NASAL VOICE, argumentative.

           She turns the corner to find Amy sitting with her chin on her 
           knees at the top of the stairs.

                                 AMY
                        You know this guy?

                                 LEE
                        Dr. Shapiro? No.

                                 AMY
                        He's not, like, a friend of yours?

                                 LEE
                        No. Why?

                                 AMY
                        He's a capital D douchebag, that’s 
                        why.

                                 LEE
                        Good to know.

           Lee continues past Amy and down the stairs.

                                 AMY
                        Lee.
           Lee turns back.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        They say I can’t be there for the 
                        psych eval. They say I didn’t clear 
                        for essential personnel?

                                 LEE
                        That’s right.

                                 AMY
                        I think I should be there, Lee.

                                 LEE
                        I can’t see why.

           She continues down the stairs.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           As Lee approaches the room, Shapiro's nasal bark is already 
           loud and aggressive in the air. 

                                 SHAPIRO (ON HIS PHONE)
                        No, no, no, goddammit Linda, no 
                        goddamn way. No goddamn way Linda! 
                        I'm not--you can't!  Because it's 
                        not within your rights, Linda. Not 
                        one fucking bit. 

           Lee turns into the room to find Ted and Dr. Ziegler standing 
           awkwardly near the doorway while a rumpled, manic DR. ALAN 
           SHAPIRO (40s) paces the room on his PHONE.

                        That's exactly what the lawyers 
                        told us. It's exactly what they 
                        told us, Linda, and now you're... 
                        you're just acting like it never 
                        even---that's the whole reason this 
                        process is in place, Linda, and 
                        you're just fucking the whole thing 
                        up the ass.

                                 TED
                             (to Lee)
                        Doctor Shapiro is just... 
                        concluding some personal business.

                                 SHAPIRO (PHONE)
                        I SAID YOU'RE FUCKING IT UP THE 
                        ASS, LINDA!
           He notices Lee and leers at her, then breaks into a 
           condescending smile and gives them all the “one minute” 
           finger.

                                 SHAPIRO (PHONE, CONT'D) (CONT’D)
                        We could have worked this out with 
                        just a modicum of communication 
                        between all parties but you, you 
                        don't want to communicate Linda!  
                        And you might think it hurts me but 
                        the person it actually hurts? The 
                        person it actually is damaging 
                        to... is our daughter. So don't 
                        fucking apologize to me, Linda, 
                        apologize to her!

                                 LEE
                        Dr. Shapiro.

           He gives her the “one minute” finger again.

                                 SHAPIRO (PHONE)
                        No, you didn't apologize to me, but 
                        you know what? Maybe I just assumed 
                        you had because any sane fucking 
                        individual? That's exactly what 
                        they'd do. Linda? Hello? Jesus. 
                        Linda? Fuck.

           Shapiro is already re-dialing but Lee approaches nonetheless.

                                 LEE
                        Dr. Shapiro. I'm Lee Weathers. With 
                        corporate. I'm glad to see you've 
                        finally arrived.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Yeah, the fucking—--airports man. 

           He looks up from his phone and brazenly looks Lee up and 
           down.

                                 LEE
                        I'd like to get straight to the 
                        debrief if that's alright with you?

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Yeah, sure. Let's debrief. Or we 
                        can just jump right in. I'd like to 
                        be out of here by two if that's 
                        possible. 

           Lee looks to Ted. He rolls his eyes, exasperated.
           INT. RESEARCH LAB -  DAY

           The four now sit at a small table in the research lab. The 
           Morgan attack footage unfolds on a monitor, but Shapiro's 
           eyes are on his phone. He texts furiously.

                                 LEE
                        Dr. Shapiro.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Uh huh.

                                 LEE
                        You seem distracted.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        I have a lot going on. Look, I've 
                        seen this shit. I get it. 

                                 TED
                        Doctor, as you well know it's 
                        corporate policy to---

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Hey, I get it. You guys are on the 
                        ball, that's great. You're doing 
                        your job. Just like I'm here to do 
                        my job. Lucky for you I'm good at 
                        my job so we don't have a problem. 
                        Can I get a Diet Coke or something? 
                        You got a Diet Coke?

           Lee looks to Ted. He sighs and goes to grab Shapiro a soda.

                                 LEE
                        Dr. Shapiro. In order for you to 
                        provide us with a working 
                        evaluation we need to first confirm 
                        you're familiar with the subject...

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Yeah, so? What do we got, another 
                        robot? I've done plenty of robots. 
                        The Ceeba line before Hokkaido. 
                        This Fisher thing, the L5s.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        She is not a robot.

                                 LEE
                        Not exactly.
                                 SHAPIRO
                        Okay, whatever, a cyborg. Or a 
                        clone or whatever.

           Ziegler shifts in his seat, stifling his growing rage.

                                 LEE
                        You've read the brief?

                                 SHAPIRO
                        I've read the brief.

                                 LEE
                        You've watched the video?

           Ted returns and hands Shapiro his Diet Coke.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Jesus. Yes. Of course. I've watched 
                        the video. You know I do this? For 
                        a living.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        She is NOT a cyborg. She is not a 
                        Frankenstein. The fusion of organic 
                        and inorganic matter is achieved in 
                        utero, Mutter Ficker! IN UTERO.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Hey look, she can be a goddamn ipad 
                        for all I care. It's not going to 
                        change how I do my job. This is a 
                        psychological evaluation. If you 
                        have a problem with my conducting a 
                        psychological evaluation that's not 
                        on me, ok? It's on Greenjeans over 
                        here.

           Shapiro nods over at Ted, who sulks in his own defense - then 
           turns to Lee.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Or the fucking Amazon. Unless I 
                        missed a memo.

           A silence as Ziegler deflates.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        She is not a cyborg.

                                 LEE
                             (to Ted)
                        Let Darren know we're en route. 
           INT. KATHY'S ROOM - DAY

           Kathy lies in her bed, her good eye staring sorrowfully up at 
           the ceiling. 

           Amy sits on the edge of Kathy’s bed, eating an apple and 
           watching out the window as Ziegler, Ted, Shapiro, and Lee 
           make their way across the field to the barn.

           Brenda enters - time for Kathy’s meds. She’s in a 
           particularly sour mood.

                                 BRENDA
                        This is bullshit. We have 
                        absolutely every right to be over 
                        there.

                                 AMY
                        You’re preaching to the choir, 
                        Bren.

           She doesn’t take her eyes off the window, watching as the 
           others disappear into the barn.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM / MORGAN'S ROOM - DAY

           Morgan sits at a table, staring at her hands.

           Palms down.

           Turns them over - palms up.

           Turns them over - palms down.

           Shapiro follows Ziegler, Ted and Lee as they arrive in the 
           observation room. A table is set against the glass, matching 
           the one on Morgan’s side.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        You gotta be fucking kidding me.

                                 TED
                        Just... in light of recent events I 
                        think we'd all feel a lot more 
                        comfortable with a high safety 
                        protocol.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Comfortable, right. Well Ted, I 
                        gotta say, comfort can be a thorn 
                        in the side of revelation, you get 
                        me?

           Morgan looks up from her palms to regard them.
                                 TED
                        Sure. Well, I think I do, but---

                                 SHAPIRO
                        It's my job to build trust with the 
                        patient. And it's pretty fucking 
                        hard to do that with a pane of 
                        glass in between us...

                                 TED
                        It's really just... to insure your 
                        safety, Doctor.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        What, is it super strong or 
                        something?

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Morgan has absolute access to the 
                        totality of online intelligence. 
                        She can replicate or transmit any 
                        facet of that intelligence without 
                        a delay. That is what makes her 
                        dangerous.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Great. Good to know. Ok. Look. I've 
                        been in the same room as some of 
                        the most vile human beings this 
                        side of Jeffrey Dahmer. I think I 
                        can handle it.

                                 TED
                        Dr. Shapiro, it's simply a 
                        precaution that---

                                 SHAPIRO 
                             (ignoring Ted)
                        Doctor, all due respect but you 
                        need me sitting on the other side 
                        of the glass from this thing than I 
                        think it's safe to say they've 
                        already failed the psych 
                        evaluation.

           Ted exchanges a worried look with Ziegler. It's hard to argue 
           with that.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MORGAN'S ROOM

           A serene digital CHIME signals the opening of the door. 
           Morgan looks up see Dr. Shapiro entering.
                                 SHAPIRO
                        Hello Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hello Dr. Shapiro.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        You know my name.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        And you know why I'm here?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

           Morgan notes Lee and Ted watching intently in the observation 
           room, Darren and Ziegler visible in the lab above.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Great. Then we can get right into 
                        it. That sound ok?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

           Shapiro sits across from Morgan at the table, unpacking a 
           small leather bound pad and a pen.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        How are we feeling today?

                                 MORGAN
                        We're feeling sad.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want 
                        to tell me why?

                                 MORGAN
                        Why I'm feeling sad? 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Yes.

                                 MORGAN
                        Because... I stabbed Kathy in the 
                        eye. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        So I heard. 
                                 MORGAN
                        I wish I hadn't done that.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Ok. And do you know why you did 
                        that?

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

           MAIN LAB

           Towards the back of the room, Darren taps up biometric 
           readings on a row of monitors and futzes with the sizing.

                                 SHAPIRO (O.S.)
                        Okay. What's something else you're 
                        feeling bad about?

           At the head of the lab, Ziegler watches the proceedings 
           below, while keeping an eye on the thermal analysis.

                                 MORGAN (O.S.)
                        6 children died in a bus crash 
                        today. In Minnesota.

                                 SHAPIRO  (O.S.)
                        Ah. I hadn't heard that.

           Ziegler observes grimly, folding his arms.

           MORGAN'S ROOM

           Morgan looks down at her hands.

                                 MORGAN
                        It just happened. And a dead child 
                        was found in the washroom of a 
                        train station in Spain.

           Dr. Shapiro throws a sidelong glance towards the observers in 
           the lab, not quite comprehending.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        And now 7 dead children in a drone 
                        strike in Pakistan.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        I see. A... drone strike in... 
                        Pakistan. And why does that make 
                        you feel sad?
                                 MORGAN
                        I think feeling sad would be the 
                        proper response.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        I think you're right. It makes me 
                        sad. I mean, I don't have all the 
                        details or whatnot but it's a sad 
                        thing. What would we call an 
                        improper response?

                                 MORGAN
                        Laughter.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Laughter would be an improper 
                        response, yes. What makes you 
                        laugh, Morgan?

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't have a very good sense of 
                        humour.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Okay. Know your weaknesses. Good. 
                        Anything else making you sad?

                                 MORGAN 
                        I do not want... to die.

           In the lab above, Dr. Ziegler shakes his head, stricken.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Well... I think that's a pretty 
                        common feeling. I don't want to 
                        die. I don't think anyone here 
                        wants to die. But we all will 
                        someday. That's part of life.

                                 MORGAN
                        I do not want to die today. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        I see. I can understand why that 
                        would make you sad. Why do you 
                        think you might die today?

                                 MORGAN
                        It's the most likely outcome.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Ah ha. And how have you come to 
                        that conclusion?
           Morgan glances to the observation room, her gaze setting on 
           Lee.

                                 MORGAN
                        Because I stabbed Kathy in the eye.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        And you don't know why you did 
                        that?

           Morgan looks backs to Shapiro.

                                 MORGAN
                        No. I love Kathy.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        You experience love? 

           A silence. 

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Morgan. I asked you a question. Do 
                        you experience love?

                                 MORGAN
                        I have the ability to demonstrate 
                        love.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        And the ability to demonstrate it -
                        that's the same for you as 
                        experiencing it?

           Silence.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Do you demonstrate your love 
                        physically?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Sexually?

           Another silence. 

           In the lab, Dr. Ziegler and Darren exchange an uneasy look.

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        How do you demonstrate your love?
           A silence. Morgan skillfully mimes hugging someone, patting 
           them on the back.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Ok Morgan. Very nice. That's very 
                        nice.

           Morgan lowers her arms. 

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        So you can demonstrate love. And 
                        sadness. How do you demonstrate 
                        other emotions?

                                 MORGAN 
                        What other emotions?

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        I don't know. Fear? Anger?

                                 MORGAN
                        Those emotions serve no purpose.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        They serve no purpose?

                                 MORGAN
                        No. 

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        And what purpose does love serve?

                                 MORGAN
                        The perpetuation of the species.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        But that's sexual love.

           Morgan is silent.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Which you are unable to 
                        demonstrate.

                                 MORGAN
                        You are a father. You must 
                        understand.

                                 SHAPIRO
                             (taken aback)
                        Yes I'm a father. But you are not a 
                        father.
                                 MORGAN
                        No...

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Or a mother.

                                 MORGAN
                        No. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        So what am I supposed to understand 
                        here Morgan? What am I missing.

                                 MORGAN
                        I am a child.

           In the observation room, Lee tenses, not liking what she's 
           hearing. Ted observes her discomfort.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        You are a child. Ok. You feel like 
                        you're a child?

                                 MORGAN
                        In a way I am a child. I am six 
                        months old.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Who are your parents?

                                 MORGAN
                        Dr. Ziegler and Dr Nakata are my 
                        parents. In a way.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        I see. Dr. Ziegler and Dr. Nakata 
                        are your parents. Because they made 
                        you.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Ok. Ok I'm a little confused here 
                        Morgan so maybe you can help me 
                        out. You say that anger and fear 
                        serve no purpose but when you 
                        stabbed your friend Kathy in the 
                        eye what emotion was that?

           A silence.
                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        What emotion were you experiencing 
                        when you stabbed Kathy in the eye?

           After another silence

                                 MORGAN
                        Love.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        You were demonstrating love? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        That doesn't make sense to me 
                        Morgan. How was that a 
                        demonstration of love?

           Silence.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        How was that a demonstration of 
                        love Morgan?

                                 MORGAN
                        It was a malfunction.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        A malfunction?

                                 MORGAN
                        It was an error.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        It was an error in that you chose 
                        the incorrect means of 
                        demonstrating love?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes. It was a malfunction. It has 
                        been repaired. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        It's been repaired.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

           Dr. Shapiro regards Morgan for a long moment, then writes a 
           couple lines on his notepad.
                                 SHAPIRO
                        Would you consider yourself a 
                        person Morgan? 

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Would you consider yourself a 
                        machine?

           A long pause.

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        How would you describe what you 
                        are, then?

                                 MORGAN
                        I am something new. There is no 
                        appropriate label. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        But you're not human.

                                 MORGAN
                        No. Organic and inorganic matter 
                        are fused at a cellular level. My 
                        neural system has access to all 
                        online intelligence without 
                        intermediary.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        But you're self aware?

                                 MORGAN
                        I am aware there is no self.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        There is no self?

                                 MORGAN
                        There is no self.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Okay. There is no self. 

           Shapiro looks to the observation room with a roll of his 
           eyes. Lee doesn't respond, her focus locked on Morgan.
                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Do you think it would be safe to 
                        say that you're superior to humans?

                                 MORGAN
                        No. I do not think it would be safe 
                        to say that.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Inferior?

                                 MORGAN
                        No. I am just... different. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Apples and oranges.

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't understand. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        It's a saying. You're different 
                        from human beings like apples are 
                        different from oranges.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes you're right. It is a saying. 
                        It would be safe to say I am apples 
                        and oranges. I'm sorry. I... 
                        occasionally have trouble with 
                        metaphor.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        That's perfectly fine. Do you like 
                        it here, Morgan?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        What do you like about it?

           Morgan looks to the onlookers in the observation room, then 
           up to the lab.

                                 MORGAN
                        I like my friends. I like my music.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Who are your friends?

                                 MORGAN
                        Darren is my friend. Brenda is my 
                        friend. Kathy is my friend. Amy--
                                 SHAPIRO
                             (cutting her off)
                        They're your friends... but do you 
                        think they treat you like a friend?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Do you think it's normal for 
                        friends to lock each other in 
                        cages?

           A silence.

                                 MORGAN
                        That depends on the circumstances. 
                        But I was not always in a cage.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        No?

                                 MORGAN
                        Before the incident I could come 
                        and go as I pleased. I could go 
                        outside. 

           Lee raises an eyebrow at “come and go as I pleased” and looks 
           to Ted.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        You liked going outside?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes. 

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Do you miss going outside?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Is that another reason why you're 
                        sad?

           Morgan thinks about this. Looks up to the lab. Back to 
           Shapiro.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes. It is another reason that I am 
                        sad.
                                 SHAPIRO
                        You were free. And now you're not.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        You come and go as you pleased. You 
                        could go to town. You could meet 
                        new people.

           A long silence. Morgan stares up at Dr. Ziegler, arms folded, 
           in the lab window.

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        No?

                                 MORGAN
                        No. I was restricted to the grounds 
                        of the farm.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Oh. I see. I'm sorry. I 
                        misunderstood. I thought you said 
                        you could come and go as you 
                        pleased.

                                 MORGAN
                        On the grounds.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        On the grounds. But not anywhere 
                        else.

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        And why was that?

                                 MORGAN
                        It was determined by Dr. Nakata.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Ah. I see. I'll have to ask her 
                        then. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes.
                                 SHAPIRO
                        And did you agree with that 
                        decision?

           Morgan shrugs and stares.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        What's that, Morgan? What does that 
                        mean?

                                 MORGAN
                        It means nothing.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Huh. I was looking over the notes 
                        in regards to the incident with 
                        Kathy and there was apparently some 
                        disagreement on the matter the day 
                        before.

           Morgan looks up towards the lab.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Could you look at me please, 
                        Morgan?

           Morgan swivels her gaze back to Dr. Shapiro, cooler now.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        I'm told you weren't happy with the 
                        decision to restrict you to the 
                        compound.

                                 MORGAN
                        I was supposed to go to the lake. 
                        With Amy.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        The lake with Amy, huh? Sounds like 
                        a fun date.

                                 MORGAN
                        It was not a date.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        No, of course not. Just a figure of 
                        speech. But it sounds like fun. I 
                        wouldn’t mind going to the lake 
                        with Amy. No wonder you felt a 
                        little upset.

                                 MORGAN
                        I was not upset. There was an 
                        error. I was confused.
                                 SHAPIRO
                        An error. Like the error that 
                        occurred with Kathy?

                                 MORGAN
                        I love Kathy.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Right. You love Kathy.

           Shapiro scribbles in his notebook.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        And how do you feel about me, 
                        Morgan?

           Silence.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Do you have love for me?

                                 MORGAN 
                        No.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        No? That hurts my feelings a little 
                        bit.

                                 MORGAN
                        I just met you.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        You could grow to love me, though?

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't know. 

                                 SHAPIRO
                        If I made a recommendation that you 
                        be allowed to leave the compound 
                        and go to the lake, with Amy -  
                        would you love me then?

           Morgan is about to answer then stops, sensing a trap.

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't know.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        What if I made a different 
                        recommendation? What if I 
                        recommended that you should not be 
                        allowed to leave this room?
           A long silence. Worried looks around the lab.

                                 MORGAN
                        My feelings are irrelevant if that 
                        is the recommendation.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Ah. What if I recommended that you 
                        should not be able to leave this 
                        room and you should not be able to 
                        listen to your music.

                                 MORGAN
                        My feelings are irrelevant, if that 
                        is the recommendation.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Okay. What if I recommended... that 
                        you should not be able to leave 
                        this room? And that you should not 
                        be able to listen to your music... 
                        or see your friends?

           Morgan is putting on a brave face but the interrogation is 
           clearly starting to get to her. Her black eyes seem to 
           moisten.

                                 MORGAN
                        It would make me sad.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        I think that's pretty natural. That 
                        doesn't sound like any fun. And I 
                        think - hey, if you had some bad 
                        feelings about me because of that -  
                        it would also be pretty natural. 

                                 MORGAN
                        But it would not be productive.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Maybe not. But it would be natural. 
                        Just like if I did the opposite - 
                        if I suggested you be allowed to go 
                        to the lake. If I drove you there 
                        myself... It would be only natural 
                        that you have warmer feelings for 
                        me. Feelings like you might have 
                        for Amy... or for any of your 
                        friends here. Maybe even feelings 
                        of love.
                                 MORGAN
                        I suppose. I don't know. It is a 
                        hypothetical situation.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Yes. That's correct. So 
                        hypothetically if you were to 
                        demonstrate those feelings of love 
                        how would you do that?

                                 MORGAN
                        Do what?

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Demonstrate feelings of love.

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't know.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        You don't know?

                                 MORGAN
                        I would have to think about it. 

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           Lee sits forward in her chair, riveted and alert.

                                 SHAPIRO 
                        Alright. Ok. But no right or wrong 
                        answers - if you were going to say 
                        the first thing that came to your 
                        mind... how would you demonstrate 
                        your feelings of love...?

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't know.

           Lee looks up to the lab, then to Ted.

                                 LEE
                             (whispering)
                        We should end this.

           MORGAN'S ROOM

                                 SHAPIRO
                        The first thing that pops into your 
                        mind. You can show me if you don't 
                        want to say it. 

           Morgan is silent.
                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        Just show me. Show me how you 
                        demonstrate love.

           Morgan raises her hands beginning the same mime. Then stops. 
           Looks at her palms. Turns them over.

                                 SHAPIRO (CONT'D)
                        That's right. Show me.

           Morgan looks from her palms to Dr. Shapiro... 

           IT HAPPENS FAST:

           Morgan LUNGES hard across the table - almost as if she's 
           going in for a kiss---

           Shapiro brings his hands up to defend himself---

           Morgan GRABS SHAPIRO’S WRISTS and uses them to help her 
           propel her lower half across the table, her feet KICKING into 
           Shapiro's neck---

           ---the full force of Morgan's body now hurtling Shapiro's 
           chair backwards to the ground where it lands with a CRASH.

           As Shapiro grasps at his smashed neck Morgan reaches back for 
           his PEN and STABS IT into HIS EYE---

           ---HIS NECK---

           ---HIS FACE---

           ---AGAIN---AND---AGAIN---AND---

           MAIN LAB

           Darren recoils from the desk in horror.

                                 DARREN
                        What the fuck!

           Ziegler hits the INTERCOM:

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Morgan! Stop it!

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           Lee rushes to the door, drawing her gun.

                                 LEE
                        Open the door, Darren!
           MAIN LAB

           Darren moves to open the door from the control panel when 
           Ziegler holds him back - a firm hand on his shoulder.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Wait!

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           Lee whips her head back to the lab in frustration.

                                 LEE
                        Open it!

           MAIN LAB

           Darren’s hand still hovers over the door release.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        She'll kill her.

           Darren emits a growl of confusion.

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           Lee watches helplessly as Morgan continues to stab Shapiro.

                                 LEE
                        Open it!

                                 DARREN
                        Shit.

           Lee looks over her shoulder to the lab, furious.

                                 LEE
                        NOW!

           Darren hits the lock. 

           The door between Morgan’s room and Lee clicks open with a now 
           ridiculously tranquil DIGITAL CHIME.

           That chime gets Morgan’s attention. Morgan throws the pen 
           aside and stares up at Lee through the now open door, her 
           face covered with Shapiro's blood.

                                 ZIEGLER
                             (to Darren)
                        The tranquilizer!

           Darren rolls his chair back, rushes for the observation room 
           door - leaving  Ziegler at the panel--
           Lee meets Morgan’s stare down the barrel of her gun.

           Morgan begins to stand.

                                 TED
                        Lee. Wait.

           LEE FIRES.

           Morgan is hit in the side, but it doesn’t stop her for a 
           second. She starts towards Lee...

           LEE FIRES AGAIN.

           Morgan’s hit in the chest. Stumbles backwards, hits the wall.

           Lee steps forward. 

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Lee!

           Lee raises her gun and takes a moment to get her aim for the 
           KILL SHOT...

                                 DARREN
                        Behind you.

           Lee turns to see Darren approaching fast, reaching her side 
           and firing the tranquilizer gun. 

           He hits Morgan in the chest, twice. 

           Lee re-aims but Darren has continued in front of her, 
           blocking Morgan. He extends a hand towards Lee, palm up, 
           apologetic and emphatic at the same time.

                                 DARREN (CONT’D)
                        She’s out, Lee. She’s down. She’s 
                        down.

           Lee stares down her gun at Darren, and Morgan slumped on the 
           floor behind him, at the bottom of a smeared trail of blood. 

           A tense silence. 

           Lee lowers her gun.

           INT. MEDLAB - DAY

           Shapiro's mangled corpse lies on a gurney in the medlab. What 
           we can still see of his face is twisted in pure HORROR.

                                 ZIEGLER (PRE-LAP)
                        He insisted on going in there.
           Brenda grimly zips up the body bag, and turns her attention 
           to her other project: MORGAN.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT’D)
                        He provoked her. Repeatedly.

           Morgan is on a recessed operating table not unlike a high-
           tech cocoon - the MEDPOD, specially conformed to Morgan’s 
           shape by a bed of hydraulic, bio-medical rods. Her wrists and 
           ankles are secured to the machine. 

           Brenda tends to one of the bullet wounds with a small laser 
           emitting device.

           INT. MAIN LAB - DAY

           THROUGH THE WINDOW NOW: we continue to observe as Brenda 
           works on Morgan.

                                 ZIEGLER (CONT’D)
                        It was not. Her. Fault.

           Ziegler, Ted, Darren and Lee - in the middle of a tense 
           conversation.

                                 LEE
                        It's over, Doctor Ziegler. 

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Be reasonable. This is an 
                        exceptional specimen we're dealing 
                        with here. We have glitches to work 
                        out, yes, clearly.

           Lee throws an eye towards the dead body in the next room.

                                 LEE
                        Clearly.

                                 ZIEGLER 
                        But do you have any idea what it 
                        will mean to have to start from 
                        scratch? The man hours, the 
                        expense...

                                 LEE
                        Corporate is well aware of the 
                        expense involved, Dr. Ziegler. I 
                        was sent here to assess the 
                        viability of extending this lab's 
                        research pending a psychological 
                        evaluation of the subject. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        A psychological evaluation that I 
                        think we can all safely agree that 
                        the subject has failed. 

                                 TED BRENNER
                        It was not an optimal result, sure, 
                        of course, I think we can all agree 
                        on that... but Doctor Ziegler makes 
                        a good point... 

                                 LEE
                        I'm sure corporate will be very 
                        interested to get your point of 
                        view on what happened here, Ted. In 
                        terms of what's about to happen, 
                        I'm running the show. Do you have a 
                        problem with that?

           Ted stares at his feet, fuming. Brenda enters from the 
           medlab, unable to look Lee in the eye.

                                 DARREN
                        How’s she doing?

                                 BRENDA
                        Clean exits. He'll be fine. 
                        He's sedated now, but I think with 
                        the online accelerants we can 
                        expect a full recovery. 

                                 DARREN
                        She wants to power him down, babe.

                                 BRENDA
                        You’re kidding.

                                 LEE
                        I’m not. We’re going to ready it 
                        for a full manual power down.

                                 BRENDA
                        You’ve got to be kidding me. You 
                        just shot him. Three times. 

                                 LEE
                        I'm sorry you're so incredulous, 
                        Brenda, but that piece of equipment 
                        just ripped a man's throat out so 
                        yes, I think turning it off isn't 
                        exactly a shocking course of 
                        action. 

           Brenda is speechless. Lee commands the room's attention.
                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        Clean up crew from corporate will 
                        be here at daybreak to collect the 
                        specimen and transport it for a 
                        full autopsy at an alternate 
                        facility. 

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Alternate facility? Absurd. 
                        Absolutely absurd. Even if - if - I 
                        were to consent to the manual 
                        termination, there's no one else 
                        able to process the minutiae of the 
                        work involved. The work must be 
                        done here.

                                 BRENDA
                        "Consent to her termination?"

                                 LEE
                             (ignoring Brenda)
                        No further work will be done here, 
                        Dr. Ziegler. Not until a full 
                        corporate review.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        So. You would have us create life 
                        only to snuff it out. You would 
                        have us... murder our... Our---

                                 NAKATA (O.S.)
                        Enough.

           They turn to see frail Dr. Nakata in the doorway. She walks 
           in with her cane, and proceeds to the medlab window to regard 
           a sleeping Morgan.

                                 NAKATA (CONT’D)
                        We’ve failed, Simon. There is no 
                        reason to belabor the point. Do as 
                        she says. Prepare the specimen.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        Aiko. You can’t mean it.

                                 NAKATA
                        Go back to the house, Simon. You 
                        don’t need to be here.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        And allow you to what? To destroy 
                        years and years of our hard work, 
                        to ruin everything that---
                                 NAKATA
                        Go back to the house and pour 
                        yourself a drink.

           That hits him hard. He staggers back.

                                 ZIEGLER
                        If that’s... what you think is 
                        best. 

                                 NAKATA
                        It is.

           She matches his stare, cold. 

           Ziegler looks like he could cry. He backs away, taking a 
           last, long look at Morgan... and leaves the room.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Amy stares out towards the barn, anxious. 

           Sees a barn door open. Someone emerging.  

           Ziegler.

           She’s not the only one who sees him coming - Skip’s nearby, 
           ripping turnips out of the ground and putting them in a 
           basket.

           Skip watches as Amy runs up to meet Ziegler at the edge of 
           the field.

           Ziegler tells Amy something with a grave face... and Amy 
           collapses into his arms, in tears.

           Skip looks back out towards the barn.

           INT. MEDLAB - NIGHT

           The mood is grim.

           Morgan is face-up in the medpod, her naked body pale, smooth, 
           taut. As Darren binds her ankles, his eyes are unable to 
           avoid the smooth, featureless surface between Morgan's legs.

           Brenda fits and adjusts the BIOFEEDS.

           Ted flutters anxiously nearby, extremely uncomfortable.

           Lee binds Morgan's arms, watching her still, sleeping face.
           Darren finishes with the restraints and swings down the 
           creature-like drill, on a long robotic arm attached to an 
           electronic hub.

           Observing the proceedings from the MEDLAB is Nakata, seated 
           at the control panel. Nakata looks down to her screen and 
           adjusts the drill’s virtual scope.

           As Lee finishes with her restraints---MORGAN'S EYES OPEN.

                                 MORGAN
                        Lee.

           Lee flinches, thrown.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        Where am I?

                                 LEE
                             (recovering, not making 
                              eye contact)
                        You're in the medlab, Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        What happened to me? 

           Morgan's voice is now frail, confused. Darren is ready at the 
           drill, but emotional. No one in the room can bring themselves 
           to look directly at Morgan. Except, through the glass---

                                 NAKATA (OVER INTERCOM)
                        You've had a malfunction, Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Mother?

           A silence - Morgan tries to see Nakata through the window, 
           but is restricted from moving her head.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        Mother, is that you?

                                 NAKATA (INTERCOM)
                        We have to power you down now, 
                        Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                             (with difficulty)
                        I understand completely. I’m 
                        sorry... if I disappointed you, 
                        Mother.

           A silence.
                                 NAKATA (INTERCOM)
                        I am not your Mother, Morgan. You 
                        have no Mother.

                                 MORGAN
                        I have no Mother.

                                 NAKATA (INTERCOM)
                        I’m sorry, Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        I am in error?

                                 NAKATA (INTERCOM)
                        Yes Morgan. You are in error.
                             (she looks to Lee; to 
                              herself, OFF INTERCOM:)
                        As are we all.

           Nakata collects herself, then turns to Darren, all business.

                                 NAKATA (INTERCOM) (CONT’D)
                        Start the rotation. 

           Darren, struggling to keep it together, activates the pod to 
           rotate Morgan face down. The rods begin to move...

                                 MORGAN
                             (panicked)
                        Mother. I’m frightened. Mother---

                                 TED
                        Jesus Christ.

           As the rotation completes---MORGAN SCREAMS - a shrill, primal 
           wail with a deep digital burn.

           INT. ZIEGLER’S ROOM - DUSK

           Dr. Ziegler sits by the window in his darkening room.

           He takes a hefty gulp off a stiff drink, staring out at the 
           old barn across the field.

           Mahler wafts out of his tiny stereo.

           There is hardly any light left in the sky.

           INT. MEDLAB - NIGHT

           Morgan's piercing screams continue, horribly muted as Lee and 
           Darren adjust her face down. SHE STRUGGLES AGAINST THE 
           RESTRAINTS. They hold her down.
                                 DARREN
                        She needs more of the sedative.

           Darren has his hands full, nods across the room for Brenda.

                                 DARREN (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn Brenda, come on, she’s in 
                        pain!

           Brenda curses at herself, takes the SEDATIVE GUN and fires it 
           into the small of Morgan's back. The muffled screams continue 
           for a moment, but then both they and the body spasms ease 
           off.

           From the control booth in the main lab:

                                 NAKATA
                        Start the drill.

           Darren swings the drill over and locks it to the virtual 
           scope. Takes a deep breath. Looks to Brenda but she won’t 
           meet his gaze. Looks to Nakata.

           Nakata gives him a solemn nod.

           DARREN STARTS THE DRILL, finger down on the trigger. 

           It emits a bead of light, one that provides a target when it 
           finds the SILVER DOT at the nape of Morgan’s neck. Darren 
           checks the rotor - it REVS into action with a low, lethal 
           hum, making its way towards the neck.

           He eases his finger off the trigger. Tries to wipe the sweat 
           from his forehead, but it’s pouring.

                                 DARREN
                        I... can’t do this.

           Lee looks to Nakata, then to Darren.

                                 LEE
                        Stepping in.

           Darren doesn’t move. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Darren. Stepping in.

           He doesn’t budge. 

                                 NAKATA (INTERCOM)
                        Step aside, Darren. Lee will do it
           Darren takes a long look at Nakata, then Brenda, then Lee. 
           Takes his hands off the drill, steps back.

                                 LEE
                             (to Darren)
                        Keep it steady.

           LEE STARTS THE DRILL AGAIN. And doesn’t hesitate before 
           starting to use it. It humms into action. She brings it down 
           toward the silver dot. 

           IT MAKES CONTACT. BORES IN.

           MORGAN SEIZES.

           Lee looks up to see why Darren isn’t helping brace her, just 
           in time to see a look pass between him and Brenda. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Darren. Keep. It. Steady.

           Darren looks away.

           Brenda comes in fast with the sedative gun.

           Lee’s hand slips from the trigger.

           Struggles to hold herself up, but it’s no use.  

           She’s on the floor. 

           She’s staring up. 

           Up towards Brenda and the sedative gun in her hand. 

           Sound fading away...

           Nakata throwing a frail fist to the glass...

           Morgan faced down.

           Lee faced up.

           It’s. 

           Lights. 

           Out.

           For.

           Lee.
           BLACKNESS.

           Lee’s eyes flutter open.... 

           It takes a moment. 

           Where is she?

           INT. MORGAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           In Morgan’s room.

           In Morgan’s bed.

           ALONE. 

           Lee tries to sit up but it hits her fast, she can’t---the 
           drugs coursing through her system push her back flat.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’s the sedative. 

           Lee turns towards the distant, distorted voice, tries to 
           focus... 

           TED. In shadows. On the other side of the glass.

                                 TED
                        They tell me it shouldn’t last for 
                        more than another... hour? Two, 
                        tops. 

           He stops. 

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Lee. This is just a totally, 
                        terrifically unfortunate situation. 
                        We all feel terribly about it. 
                        About what happened.

           Lee struggles to speak, defiant.

                                 LEE
                        Why don’t you come in here and tell 
                        me all about it.

                                 TED
                             (ignoring that)
                        It was an accident. It should never 
                        have happened. It was a very, very 
                        tense situation, of course, and an 
                        emotional one, for, for all of us. 
                        We had to make some tough, tough 
                        decisions.
                                 LEE
                        Where is it?

                                 TED
                        Where is what?

                                 LEE
                        Morgan. 

                                 TED
                        Ah. Well. Now, Lee, look, the thing 
                        is... It’s a sensitive situation.
                        No decisions have been made. As you 
                        know I am here - just like you - as 
                        a representative of the company. I 
                        am here to act in their best 
                        interests. And right now, well, my 
                        take on the whole thing is that 
                        it’s in THEIR best interest to keep 
                        Morgan alive. This is a uh, an 
                        honest difference of opinion 
                        between you and I, and so, I feel 
                        like it might be best to ah, hear 
                        what they have to say about the 
                        whole thing before we take any...  
                        drastic action. Lee... you know 
                        I have a tremendous amount of 
                        respect for your professionalism. 

           Lee’s eyes narrow at Ted - seething.

                                 LEE
                        Clearly.

                                 TED
                             (ignoring that)
                        But I think it’s because of that 
                        professionalism that you should 
                        understand and appreciate our 
                        course of action here. The Doctors 
                        feel - and they have my support - 
                        that maybe getting hit by that 
                        sedative - accidentally, I might 
                        add - maybe that wasn’t the worst 
                        thing in the world for you right 
                        now. Maybe you could use a 
                        little.... “cool down”. Some rest. 
                        We thought it would be comfortable 
                        here. For you to recuperate. That’s 
                        all this is. 

                                 LEE
                        Does Dr. Nakata feel this way?
                                 TED
                        She does.

                                 LEE
                        I’d like to speak with her.

                                 TED
                        Yes. Of course. Unfortunately all 
                        of this... stress... She wasn’t 
                        feeling well. She had to return to 
                        her room.

                                 LEE
                        I see.

                                 TED
                        Everything’s under control here, 
                        Lee. So. Like I said, you should 
                        rest. You’ve had quite an ordeal.

           As Ted gets up---

                                 LEE
                        They’re coming, you know.

                                 TED
                        Who’s that?

                                 LEE
                        Your friends in corporate. They’ll 
                        be here sooner than you think. So 
                        we’ll all get a chance to sit down 
                        and chat when they arrive. Sort 
                        things out.

           Ted doesn’t look back, but he does seem to wilt a bit - not 
           pleased that Lee has called this particular bluff.

                                 TED
                        Of course. Get some rest, Lee.

                                 LEE
                        It needs to be terminated, Ted. 
                        Now.

           Ted doesn’t respond, and continues out of the room. 

           Lee looks up to see a shadowy figure staring down from the 
           main lab...

           INT. MAIN LAB - THAT MOMENT

           Darren steps back from the glass. 
                                 DARREN
                        She looks pissed.

           Ted, entering from observation:

                                 TED
                        Of course she’s pissed. We can’t 
                        worry about that now. We’re past 
                        that. How close are we? 

                                 DARREN
                        Amy’s making some sandwiches and 
                        bringing the mini-van around. 
                        Bren, how we looking in there?

           MEDLAB

           Brenda pulls a shelf’s worth of medical supplies into a 
           duffle bag, already half full.

                                 BRENDA
                        We’re close.

           She turns to see Morgan, face up in the medpod. Her eyes are 
           open.

                                 BRENDA (CONT’D)
                        We’re very close.

           MORGAN’S ROOM

           Lee manages to sit up. 

           She stares down at her hands, trying to move her fingers. 

           Looks up towards the lab.

           INT. MEDLAB - NIGHT

           Morgan’s eyes remain open.

           Brenda kneels at her side. 

                                 BRENDA
                        How’s my special guy doing? 

           Morgan blinks.

                                 BRENDA (CONT’D)
                        There’s my special guy.

           She runs a hand along Morgan’s cheek.
                                 BRENDA (CONT’D)
                        Morgan. Honey. We have to go now. 
                        Do you think if I undo your 
                        restraints you’ll be able to stand 
                        up?

           Morgan blinks again.

           Brenda begins to undo the restraints.

                                 BRENDA (CONT’D)
                             (to Darren and Ted)
                        We’re ready to go here.

           Darren enters, and starts to help with the restraints.

           Ted hovers anxiously across the room.

                                 DARREN
                        We’re gonna get you outta here, ok 
                        Morgan? We’re gonna go on a little 
                        trip. A little adventure. But we 
                        have to go now, ok?

           Morgan stares at Darren, unblinking. The restraints are now 
           off. 

                                 DARREN (CONT’D)
                        Can you move, pal?

           Darren holds his arms out so Morgan can hold on to him to get 
           up, and he scoops Morgan up in something close to an embrace.

           Morgan - initially limp - now hugs Darren back, her arms 
           tightening around him.

           Darren hugs her, too. Brenda places a hand on Darren’s back, 
           overcome with emotion.

                                 DARREN (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be ok, now, buddy. 
                        Everything’s gonna be ok. 

           Darren and Brenda exchange a look. A brief, desperate 
           warmth...

           ...before Morgan sinks her teeth into Darren’s ear and rips 
           if off with her teeth.

           DARREN SCREAMS.

           BRENDA SCREAMS.
           Darren pushes Morgan off of him, in a panic - a hand up 
           quickly to stop the blood SPURTING from his ear----

           His eyes dart frantically to the tranquilizer gun -

           But it’s Morgan that grabs it. Fires it at Darren’s heart. 
           Darren reels, trying to keep his balance - but it’s no use - 
           he falls, hard, against the operating table. The last thing 
           he sees as his horrified eyes flutter closed--- 

           Morgan grabs Brenda, swings an arm around her, and SNAPS HER 
           NECK. Before Brenda can even comprehend what’s happened. And 
           lets her body fall to the floor.

           Morgan’s gaze drifts up to Ted, frozen into a corner with 
           fear, unable to process what’s happening...

           ...then to Darren, desperately trying to steady himself 
           against the medpod as blood and consciousness continue to 
           pour out of him. 

           Morgan moves SWIFTLY towards him, grabs him by his hair and 
           holds him face down onto the medpod.

           Morgan swings down the DRILL towards the back of Darren’s 
           neck. Activates it. 

                                 TED
                        No.... No, Morgan... don’t do it---

           Morgan doesn’t look back. The DRILL HUMMS into action...

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Morgan, please...!

           MORGAN BORES THE DRILL into the back of Darren’s head and 
           leaves her finger on the trigger as BLOOD SPRAYS her pale 
           white flesh.

           A CHAIR squeaks against the floor----

           Morgan swings to see Ted, backing into the next room, 
           nervously brandishing LEE’S GUN.

           Morgan regards him calmly.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m not feeling well, Ted.

           Ted swallows dryly, trying to get his nerve up to speak.
                                 TED
                        No. No, you’re not well, Morgan. 
                        I... I have to go get help... To 
                        help you.

           Morgan says nothing, keeps watching as Ted back up towards 
           the door. 

           And then she moves. Fast.

           TED FIRES. 

           Misses. 

           RUNS.

           INT. MORGAN’S ROOM

           Lee looks up, desperate. She heard the shot---

           INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

           Ted races around the corner. 

           Morgan is right behind him. 

           Ted is caught unawares by a BLAST OF BLUE FOG.

           Disoriented.

           Hand outstretched... trying to find a wall. 

           Ted’s hand lands instead on Morgan’s blood splattered chest. 

           FROM OUT OF THE BLUE FOG... MORGAN’S FACE. Grim and resolute.

           INT. MORGAN’S ROOM

           A HORRIBLE SCREAM makes it way down to Morgan’s room.

           THEN A GUNSHOT. AND ANOTHER. AND ANOTHER.

           Lee looks up to the lab, trying to gauge every sound. 

           The gunshots followed by a silence....

           Lee waits. Listens. 

           IN THE LAB ABOVE, there is movement.

           A nude, bloodied Morgan steps to the window and stares down 
           at Lee. 

           Lee stares back. 
           Morgan disappears from view.

           Lee watches the lab window, waiting. 

           THE DOOR TO THE OBSERVATION ROOM OPENS.

           Morgan steps in, walks to the glass.

           Lee holds her ground.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hello Lee.

                                 LEE
                        Hello Morgan.

           A silence. Morgan catches sight of her own nude, bloodied 
           reflection in the glass.

                                 MORGAN
                        There’s something wrong with me, 
                        Lee. I don’t feel like myself.

                                 LEE
                        You’re not well, Morgan. You’re 
                        experiencing a malfunction. I need 
                        you to open this door so that I can 
                        help you, ok?

           Morgan is silent.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Morgan. Open the door. I’m here to 
                        help.

           Morgan considers it.

                                 MORGAN
                        Do you feel like yourself, Lee? Is 
                        that a thing a person can ever 
                        really feel? Like themselves?

                                 LEE
                        I understand, Morgan. Open the door 
                        and we can talk about it.

           Morgan thinks about it.

                                 MORGAN
                        I should go.

                                 LEE
                        Open the door, Morgan.
           Morgan begins to back away, into the shadows.

                                 MORGAN
                        Take care of yourself, Lee.

                                 LEE
                        MORGAN!

           Lee smashes her fists against the glass. But Morgan is 
           already gone.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Amy throws a rucksack into the back of the mini-van and heads 
           around to the driver’s seat.

                                 SKIP (O.S.)
                        Going somewhere?

           Skip’s on the porch.

                                 AMY
                        Fuck off, Skip.

           Amy starts the car.

                                 SKIP
                        Amy! Want to tell me what the 
                        fuck’s going on?

                                 AMY
                        I said fuck OFF, Skip.

           She peels off in the mini-van for the barn.

           INT. MORGAN’S ROOM

           Lee HURLS A CHAIR at the glass with a SCREAM of frustration. 

           It bounces off the glass without even scratching it, and 
           crashes to the ground. 

           I.E. MOVING VAN

           Amy drives through the field towards the barn.

           SLAMS THE BRAKES.

           A naked, bloodied Morgan is in her headlights, her hand 
           shielding her eyes.

                                 AMY
                        Morgan.
           Amy gets out of the car, steps into the headlights towards 
           Morgan, fear and confusion spreading across her face---

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Morgan - what... what happened to 
                        you?

                                 MORGAN
                        We can go to the lake now, Amy.

                                 AMY
                        Where are the others? 

                                 MORGAN
                        You can come with me. If you want. 
                        Or you can stay here. And die.

                                 AMY
                        Morgan, you need to tell me what’s 
                        happening. You need to---

           Morgan walks past her and gets into the driver’s seat. She 
           starts the van. 

           Amy looks to the barn. To the house. She hurries to the van 
           and gets into the passenger seat. 

           Morgan speeds the van away from the barn.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Skip watches the mini-van disappear over the ridge and heads 
           out determinedly towards the barn.

           I/E. MOVING VAN

           Morgan drives silently towards the edge of the property.

           A stricken Amy takes in Morgan’s nude, bloodied body.

                                 AMY
                        What did you to do to them?

           Morgan says nothing. 

           Amy swallows dryly, terrified.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I... packed you some clothes.

           Morgan says nothing, eyes on the road ahead.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        And I... made sandwiches.
           Morgan looks towards her for a moment, confused, then back 
           ahead. Hits the brakes.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Why are we stopping?

           Morgan stares at the farmhouse, small in the rearview mirror. 
           Nothing but the sound of the running car and Amy’s breath.

                                 MORGAN
                        I have to go back.

                                 AMY
                        No. No, Morgan, we have to go. We 
                        have to go NOW.

                                 MORGAN
                        I have to say goodbye to Mother.

                                 AMY
                        No, Morgan. Let’s just go. Let’s 
                        just get out of here. Now.

           But Morgan has already put the van into reverse and is 
           quickly speeding backwards.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m sorry, Amy. This won’t take 
                        long.

           He stops the van halfway to the porch and gets out.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        Wait here.

           Morgan heads for the house.

           INT. BARN

           Skip steps inside, and makes his way towards the basement.

           INT. FARMHOUSE

           Morgan steps into the farmhouse. Calmly, quietly.

                                 MORGAN
                        Mother?

           She hears something. Conversation. The kitchen. She moves 
           slowly towards it. Turns the corner. 

           INT. KITCHEN

           The kitchen is empty.
           A little countertop TV is on. A GAME SHOW.

           She regards it for a moment, then moves to the counter and 
           removes Skip’s biggest knife from its sheath.

           INT. BASEMENT LAB

           Skip tentatively takes steps down to the lower level....

           ....passes through a cloud of BLUE FOG.

           Ted’s corpse is face down in the corridor, a cloud of blood 
           around his head. 

           Skip startles. 

                                 SKIP
                        Ah, fuck. Ah, Jesus.

           Steels himself.

                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                        Anyone in here?

           As he opens the door to the main lab, death is thick in the 
           air.

           The medlab window - ribboned with blood. Bodies inside.

                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ.

           He struggles to not be sick.

                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                        Lee?

           INT. MORGAN’S ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Lee stands, suddenly ready and resolute.

                                 LEE
                        Skip! Down here!

                                 SKIP (O.S.)
                        Lee? Jesus Christ! Where are you!?

                                 LEE
                        Skip. There’s a door release. On 
                        the control panel. I need you to 
                        open it. Now.
           INT. FARMHOUSE

           Morgan peers into the library.

           Empty. 

           She turns for the stairs.

                                 MORGAN
                        Mother?

           There is a creak of floorboards behind her. 

                                 KATHY (O.S.)
                        Morgan?

           Morgan turns to look at frail, slow-moving KATHY GRIEFF... 
           and it takes a moment for Kathy to realize that Morgan’s 
           already BROUGHT THE KNIFE PAST HER THROAT. 

           A thin red necklace slowly appears. Sadness fills Kathy’s 
           eyes.

           Kathy falls. Morgan regards her for a moment - the light 
           fading from her eyes, the blood pouring out.... And moves on. 
           She starts up the staircase.

           EXT. FIELD

           Lee races across the field towards the farmhouse.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, FARMHOUSE

           Morgan makes her way down the long, shadowy corridor.

           Nears the door at the end of the hall.

           Slows her pace.

                                 MORGAN
                        Mother?

           Morgan pushes open the door. 

           INT. NAKATA’S ROOM

           Dr. Nakata has been expecting her.

           She sits on a chair in the middle of the spartan room, SKIP’S 
           HUNTING RIFLE in her lap, pointed at the door.

           Morgan remains there, in the shadows.
                                 DR. NAKATA
                        I told you before, Morgan. I am not 
                        your mother. 

           Nakata FIRES.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE

           The shot echoes across the night. 

           Lee races to her car and throws open the trunk. 

           Retrieves a LARGE SHOTGUN. 

           ---A blast from a CAR HORN---

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Morgan!

           Lee whips her head around to see Amy, leaning on the mini-van 
           horn.

           Ignores her, moves towards the house.

           INT. NAKATA’S ROOM

           Morgan is on the ground in the hallway. Flat on her back. 

           We can hear the horn still going outside.

           Nakata slowly lowers the gun, straining to see.  

           MORGAN SITS UP. 

           Half of her face has been clipped by the blast from the 
           shotgun - she’s now missing a substantial portion of her neck 
           and cheek - which are splattered against the hallway wall.

           Nakata struggles to reload the gun. 

           Morgan stands, collects her knife.

                                 MORGAN
                        I really wish... you wouldn’t have 
                        done that, Mother.

           Morgan approaches, reaching a hand towards the long nose of 
           the rifle.

           INT. FARMHOUSE

           Lee moves cautiously inside, the gun raised.

           She steps over Kathy’s body, peers around the corner.
           A noise from upstairs. Something heavy hitting the floor.

           Lee starts up the creaking stairs.

           It's dark.

           Light coming from the room at the end of the hall.

           Lee is steady but cautious as she passes every door. 

           Behind one of them, a small SQUEAK.

           Still careful to keep watching the end of the hall, Lee wraps 
           her hand around the knob and carefully opens the door.

           She sees the cause of the squeak.

           ZIEGLER. 

           His body sways ever so slightly in the breeze from the open 
           window. His belt slung around his neck, tied from one of the 
           exposed pipes above. The chair knocked over below him.

           Lee stares, impassive, and then turns her attention back to 
           the end of the hall.

           She approaches.

           Pushes open the door, gun drawn.

           Nakata’s body on the floor - stabbed repeatedly, the knife 
           still in her chest, surrounded by a pool of blood. She is not 
           quite dead.

           She looks up to Lee, with blood foaming at the edges of her 
           mouth.

                                 NAKATA
                        You. Fool. No one.

           Lee watches as the life leaves her.

           Nakata is gone, and an eerie silence descends.

           Lee scans the rest of the room, waiting for it... 

           MORGAN RUNS AT HER FROM THE HALL - swinging the rifle over 
           her head like a club.

           LEE FIRES - just as the rifle makes contact, cracking against 
           her head. 

           She’s just grazed Morgan, who keeps coming, fast.
           LEE fires again but the rifle has come down on her arm - the 
           bullet bites into a wall.

           Morgan kicks the gun from Lee’s hand. It goes sliding through 
           the pool of Nakata’s blood. 

           Morgan swings the rifle up and brings it down again - but 
           this time Lee stops it before its blow can land. They fight 
           for it - and as Morgan throws herself on top of Lee - the 
           rifle is the only thing separating them.  

           LEE looks to her gun, across the room by Nakata. 

           Rolls out of Morgan’s grip and scrambles for it, but Morgan 
           is on top of her again, kicking the gun aside and starting to 
           hit, ferocious.

           Lee reaches out for the gun, can't get to it - her eyes 
           suddenly desperate. 

           Morgan is dominating, relentless. Landing blow after blow. 
           Blood from Lee smatters against the floor. 

           Morgan stops suddenly.

           Curious, watching as Lee pushes herself up from the floor, 
           coughing blood. 

           Again, Lee goes for the gun - gets it, turns it on Morgan, 
           but Morgan’s already on her. Forcing the gun back towards 
           Lee, her finger over Lee’s own. 

           IT FIRES - taking a piece of Lee’s side. Lee winces, drops 
           the gun. 

           Morgan takes her by the scruff of the neck, hits her again, 
           runs her towards the window---and THROWS HER OUT---

           ---SHATTERING GLASS---

           EXT. FARMHOUSE

           Lee lands along with a storm of broken wood and glass with a 
           THUD - and a SNAP - on the cold ground below.

           Morgan looks out towards Lee, splayed on the ground, then 
           disappears back into the house.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Morgan moves briskly down the hall.

           At Ziegler’s door, she stops, and regards the hanging man.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE

           Morgan gets back in the driver’s side of the mini-van.

           A terrified Amy is still in the passenger seat, frozen, 
           speechless.

           As the van speeds away, a beaten, bloodied Lee pushes herself 
           up from the ground, and SCREAMS in pain - there’s glass in 
           her hands. She makes it up, stumbles her way to her car.

           Gets the trunk open. 

           PULLS ANOTHER GUN OUT. 

           Fires at the van.

           I/E. MOVING VAN

           The rear windshield BLOWS OUT upon impact. 

           Amy SCREAMS. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE

           Lee fires again. 

           No use. They’re too far gone.

           Moves around the car and gets in.

           She winces in pain and starts the car. 

           I/E. MOVING VAN

           Morgan speeds the car towards the closed gate. CRASHES into 
           it. Amy screams. Morgan braces her with an outstretched arm.

           The metal bends, putting a serious dent in Morgan's fender 
           and taking out a headlight - but the gate remains closed. 

           The headlights of Lee’s car approaching suddenly alight in 
           the windshield.

           Morgan backs it up, tries again - and with another CRASH this 
           time she's through. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD

           Lee puts the pedal to the metal on the narrow country road, 
           desperately trying to catch up with Morgan's truck.

           MORGAN - driving faster, seeing Lee's lights come on strong 
           in the rearview mirror.
           LEE edging closer. 

           MORGAN swerving over in the road, denying Lee an opening.

           LEE catching Morgan's bumper, sending her forward a jolt 
           squeezing in.

           AMY screams.

           MORGAN ramming Lee - LEE barely able to keep it on the road.

           They jostle for position. The two lane blacktop is just 
           ahead.

           Morgan SWINGS the truck wide onto the empty highway. 

           Lee follows suit, barely making the turn.

           LEE can spot the shuttered up FlapJack's ahead, the lights of 
           the town in the distance beyond.

           NOW or NEVER.

           LEE edges forward, inching alongside Morgan.

           Lee SLAMS into Morgan’s car. They GRIND against each other. 

           AMY SCREAMS as sparks fly between them.

           Morgan takes advantage of the bend in the road to knock Lee, 
           sending her into a BRUTAL SPIN. 

           Morgan guns at her again, making LOUD contact. 

           Lee’s car goes over.

           And over. 

           And lands upside down on the side of the road.

           Morgan keeps driving into the night, the smoldering wreck 
           behind them.

           EXT. FIELD - THAT MOMENT

           The wreck of Lee’s car belches and moan, its tires still 
           spinning. 

           Lee extracts herself from her seatbelt and drags herself out 
           of the car through the window, grunting in pain.

           Searches the distance for any sign of Morgan’s van.

           Nothing. 
           She hears another car, approaching from the other direction. 

           She forces herself to stand, steadying herself against the 
           wreck. 

           The car swings off to the side of the road.

           A figure is running towards her.

           SKIP.

           She limps towards him. 

                                 SKIP
                        Jesus Christ. Lee. You ok?

                                 LEE
                        I thought I told you... to wait in 
                        the barn.

                                 SKIP
                             (ignoring that)
                        I gotta get you to a hospital.

           Lee steps past him, bee-lining for his car.

                                 LEE
                        I’ll drive.

           Skip hustles after her. 

                                 SKIP
                        Lee!

                                 LEE
                             (starts the car)
                        I know where they’re going.

           Skip gets in the passenger side.

                                 SKIP
                        You’re hurt, Lee. You gotta let it 
                        go.

                                 LEE
                        Not yet.

           She peels the car off down the road, gunning it for the turn 
           off to Lake Kanawauke.

           I.E. MOVING VAN - NIGHT

           Morgan speeds into the night, silent.
           Amy is next to him, trying to stifle her tears.

                                 AMY
                        You... you killed them? You killed 
                        them all?

           Morgan doesn’t answer.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Why? Why did you do it?

           Morgan doesn’t answer. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Why did you do it, Morgan?

           She turns to look Amy in the eye.

                                 MORGAN
                        Love.

           Amy’s eyes fill with terror, and then sadness, and she 
           collapses into sobs once again. 

           Morgan’s eyes return to the road.

           EXT. LAKE KANAWAUKE PARK - DAWN

           Dawn is slowly breaking.

           Lee coasts the car in neutral to the edge of a rest area, 
           surrounded by trees. 

           Her eyes are locked on Morgan’s MINI-VAN, parked at the side 
           of the woods.

           Lee gets out.

                                 LEE
                        Wait in the car.

                                 SKIP
                        Goddammit Lee. No. I want to help. 

                                 LEE
                        Help by waiting in the goddamn car.

           Lee draws her gun and inches towards the Mini-van.

           Steals a look back at Skip. Still in the car.

           She comes alongside the van. It’s abandoned. 

           Her eyes follow the trail that leads off into the woods. 
           She follows suit.

           The woods are still dark - just hints of light beginning to 
           creep in through the tops of tall Eastern Hemlocks and White 
           Pines.

           The night shift of insect and animal life still making its 
           strange song. 

           Lee steps lightly, but the twigs crunch under her feet - the 
           slightest hint of frost covering the ground.

           EXT. LAKE KANAWAUKE - DAWN

           There’s just the faintest bit of light in the sky, casting 
           the peaceful lake in a golden glow.

           MORGAN. 

           She wades in the cold morning water. Her back to the shore, 
           staring out at the still water, the sky above, the trees... 

           The sun kisses the tops of the mountains, just like Amy 
           described.

           Morgan lets it in. 

           Closes her eyes. 

           Takes a deep breath.

           THE SOUND OF A SNAPPING TWIG, ECHOING IN THE DISTANCE. 

           Morgan turns to face the rugged shore. 

           And slowly lets herself sink under the surface of the water.

           LEE.

           She takes a few steps closer to the clearing, coming to the 
           edge of the pines to the shore of the lake. 

           Stops.

           Listens. 

           Steps into the clearing, gun raised. 

           There are two sets of footsteps, leading into the water.

           Clusters of big rock on either side of the clearing.

           Lee surveys the area, in a slow rotation, ready... 
           And then MORGAN.

           MOVING FAST.

           Leaping out from the trees.

           Rock in her hand. 

           Hand in the air.

           LEE FIRES.

           She doesn’t miss. 

           Morgan’s forward momentum snaps back in the other direction. 
           The rock drops. 

           Morgan lands hard on the cold ground. Hands desperately at 
           her neck where the bullet entered, blood spurting everywhere.

           Lee approaches, gun still drawn. 

                                 LEE
                        Where’s Amy?

           Morgan stares up at Lee, dumbfounded, hurt.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Where is Amy?

           Morgan struggles to answer through the blood, the DIGITAL 
           BURN in her voice rising unsettlingly to the surface.

                                 MORGAN
                        I... made... a mistake. 

                                 LEE
                        Where is she, Morgan?

                                 MORGAN
                        I didn’t... mean to hurt her. I 
                        am... In error. I. Am. I... Am....

           LEE FIRES AGAIN. 

           Beyond any doubt, Morgan is dead.

           Lee lowers her gun.

           Kneels by Morgan’s side.

           Morgan’s black eyes gleam with the rising sun, but they’re 
           empty now, lifeless.
           With something closer to tenderness than we’ve seen before, 
           Lee closes them with her open palm.

           She rolls Morgan over, puts the gun over the nape of her 
           neck. And fires again.

           And then she hears it: the sound of a girl, sobbing.

           Lee turns towards the water. Listens.

           It’s coming from behind one of the large clusters of rock, 
           just out from the shore.

                                 LEE
                        Amy?

           Morgan’s blood flows out, into the lake.

           EXT. LAKE KANAWAUKE PARK

           Skip waits nervously in the car, warming his hands.

           Finally Lee emerges from the woods, alone. 

           She opens the passenger side door and gets in.

                                 SKIP
                        What happened? Is it—?

                                 LEE
                        It’s over. 
                             (stares out at the woods, 
                              the lake)
                        I killed her.

                                 SKIP
                        Morgan? It’s dead?

                                 LEE
                        It’s dead. I killed it.

                                 SKIP
                        What about Amy? Is she—?

                                 LEE
                        We need to get back. 

                                 SKIP
                        What about Amy?

           Lee takes a moment. Stares out at the trees. Decides.

                                 LEE
                        I’m so sorry, Skip.
           Lee takes out her gun and before Skip can even really 
           understand what’s happening——

                                 SKIP
                        Oh. Shit. No. Lee-- 

           LEE FIRES. The side of Stu’s head splatters against the 
           windshield.

           Lee sits back for a moment. She’s calm, but something heavy 
           settles in behind her eyes.

           Through the gory windshield, the sun is breaking over the 
           mountains.

           We hear the voice of middle-aged executive JIM BRYCE, 
           Omnicron VP.

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        She did very well. Better than 
                        expected. 

           EXT. GRANT FARMS - DAY

           A CORPORATE MEDIC tends to Lee's gunshot wound as a 
           uniformed, militarized corporate CLEANUP CREW files out of a 
           long white truck.

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        There were certain variables that 
                        couldn't have been controlled, in 
                        any case. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Boots move past a row of body bags lined up by the side of 
           the house.

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        But I think we can all agree she 
                        handled them well.

           INT. MAIN LAB - DAY

           The clean up crew works quickly in the lab, packaging up 
           medical samples and hard drives.

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        She responded appropriately. She 
                        was measured. And in control - even 
                        when the situation was considerably 
                        less so.
           INT. BARN - DAY

           The last CREW MEMBER emerges from the stairwell.

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        Most importantly she followed her 
                        directives. Without pause.

           Once he’s up, he throws in a small, serious looking charge 
           which ricochets down the steps. ANOTHER CREW MEMBER closes 
           the door and throws the latch...

           A BLINDING WHITE LIGHT and BASSY THUD through the portal.

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        The collateral damage was 
                        regrettable, of course...

           EXT. KANAWAUKE LAKE - MORNING

           Two CREW MEMBERS dredge Amy’s body from the water and place 
           it onto plastic sheeting, a bullet hole in the middle of her 
           forehead. 

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        But I think these events make it 
                        punishingly clear what I had 
                        already suggested.... 

           INT. CORPORATE TRUCK - DAY

           Morgan's corpse is settled into its casing, the lid closed.

                                 JIM BRYCE (V.O.)
                        The L9 was the inferior program. 

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           The same collection of corporate executives we met before. 
           Jim Bryce concludes his presentation:

                                 JIM BRYCE
                        Its immediate termination is highly  
                        HIGHLY advisable, as per Lee's 
                        recommendation.

           DAVID CHANCE leans in, in support.

                                 DAVID CHANCE 
                        The VX module can accommodate the 
                        sample for further research. And 
                        that research can be assimilated 
                        into future VX development. 
           Rotund CHARLES GRIMES is furious. 

                                 CHARLES GRIMES
                        This is bullshit. That's all that 
                        you were after this whole time. 
                        People were MURDERED here just so 
                        you can assimilate OUR results?

                                 JIM BRYCE
                        Alright Chuck, easy. Let's not make 
                        any accusations here we can't back 
                        up. The L9 ran itself off the rails 
                        here. And given the evidence on the 
                        table we simply have no other 
                        choice.

           Grimes shakes his head, disgusted.

                                 CHARLES GRIMES 
                        And what about Lee? 

                                 DAVID CHANCE
                        What about her?

           EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

           It's raining - broad sheets cascading against the window.

           Lee finds herself alone in another diner, not unlike the 
           first.

           A cup of coffee steams in front of her, but she doesn't touch 
           it.

                                 CHARLES GRIMES (V.O.)
                        What do we do about Lee?

           Lee stares down at her hands. 

           Turns them over -  palms up.

           Turns them over - palms down.

           Palms up.

           Palms down--- 

                                                         SNAP TO BLACK.

                                         THE END.
