           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The place is dark, save for the soft glow of the street lamps 
           seeping in. It’s a lived-in place: dishes in the sink, the 
           bin over filled.

           A body on the floor. 

           HARRY ORWELL, 34, sinewy, gaunt, and scratched up, stands 
           over the corpse. White as a sheet with red-rimmed eyes, he’s 
           as still as the woman who lies before him.

           Blonde hair, matted red with blood. She’s lying with her back 
           to us, we can’t see her face, but she is very dead. It’s a 
           messy scene. There’s an echo of the violence in the blood 
           spurt that streaks the wall. 

           Something in Harry kicks in; he collects the metal case 
           abandoned by the door. We catch a fleeting glimpse of “A.F.D. 
           Metropolitan Police” engraved into the front of it.   

           Harry sets the case down by her, inches from the congealing 
           pool of deep red. Mechanically he opens it: a hi-tech control 
           panel dotted with audiometers, input jacks, headphones. This 
           is the AMP.   

           With the speed of someone well trained, Harry places a 
           microphone near the body, another three are spread around the 
           room. He flicks a switch and a long tone cuts through the 
           room, then the audio meters spring to life:

           They sway in the silent room. 

           Harry pulls on the headphones, we hear what he does: a 
           cacophony of sounds, everything all at once.

           He pushes rewind, the sound squeaks backwards. Play: Harry 
           hears sobs, they are his own. 

           He holds rewind for longer. 

           Play: He hears a voice, her voice, tainted with fear.

                                 WOMAN (AMP)
                        Don’t do this-

           Harry listens on, he can hear a struggle. 

           The heavy footsteps as her attacker comes at her. Her 
           screams. The clatter as the two bodies crash to the floor. 
           The scratching of her shoes against the wood as she tries to 
           scramble away. The tearing of fabric as he pulls her back. 
           The thud of her head against the floor. Her choking as he 
           wraps his hands around her neck. 

           Harry listens to the attacker: to the short, sharp breaths. 
           His breathing matches it. 
           Her struggling is softer now. 

           He hears her murder. The slicing of the knife across her 
           throat. 

           The metallic thud as it falls to where it now lies.

           It’s all getting a bit to much for Harry. He looks like he 
           might throw up as he gropes around for the stop button. 

           He freezes when he hears her drag in a ragged breath. She’s 
           trying to say something. Harry listens harder. She speaks, 
           slow, raspy and thick.

                                 WOMAN (AMP)(CONT’D)
                            Harry-

           Dread seeps across his face. He grabs at the machine, 
           desperate to make it stop - his hand lands on rewind. The 
           sound squeals backwards.

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           Harry wakes with a start. Drenched in sweat, he lies adrift 
           in a sea of churned up duvet. Gone are the scratches on his 
           face, replaced with deep dark circles under his eyes. 

           Red eyes are blinded by the light of his phone as he checks 
           the time: 4 am. The light casts eerie shadows in the stark, 
           masculine room. It clicks off. 

           He lies awake in the darkness. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - MORNING

           The uniform Portland stone buildings give way to a 
           dilapidated car park. An OFFICER sits in the gatehouse 
           watching TV on his phone.  The officer doesn’t even look up 
           as Harry’s unmarked police car pulls into the car park. 

           Everything about Harry looks un-ironed. 

           He drags himself out of his car. He pulls his AMP out of the 
           boot and heads inside.  

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - MORNING

           There’s nothing soft about the hive of cubicles that sprawl 
           across the huge white room, it’s all hard edges and very 
           industrial. A mass of men bustle around in off-the-rack 
           suits, chatting and laughing. Metal AMP cases are shelved 
           against the wall. 
           Detective Inspector FRANCIS MALLORY, crisp, handsome, late 
           30s, but already a little grey, leans by the door to the 
           meeting room. Other officers orbit around him; back slapping 
           and shaking hands. Detective Sergeant GETTY is one of the 
           back slappers, early 30s, heavy, posh. 

           Harry drifts in past them, he shelves his AMP with the others 
           and heads towards-

           INT. HARRY’S CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS

           A measly two meters squared, no pictures of friends, no 
           trinkets. Every vertical surface is covered in violent crime 
           scene photos: Harry’s on-going cases. 

           He sits quietly and drinks his coffee, listening to the 
           conversations around him.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (O.S.)
                        ...Well okay, Thursday it is, as 
                        long as I don’t have to buy... and 
                        no one makes a fuss.

                                 GETTY
                            (Mocking)
                        Oh no fussing now...

           A boom of laughter follows. 

           Harry downs his coffee as his watch approaches nine am. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS  (O.S.)
                            (Commanding, powerful)
                        Right everybody.

           INT. MEETING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Detective Chief Inspector KATE REYNOLDS, Late 40s, fair, 
           straight-laced and angular. Leads the meeting from a little 
           podium. A massive white board behind her keeps track of the 
           ongoing cases; there’s over a hundred. 

           The whole department is gathered before her, all nineteen of 
           them. Harry’s sits on the fringe of the group.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Who’s on the stabbing over in 
                        London Fields?

           Harry raises his hand. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Right well, the victim pulled 
                        through surgery so it’s not our 
                        case anymore. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Package up the audio you’ve got and 
                        pass it over to the gang unit.

           Harry nods, a small smile tugs at his face. Kate flips 
           through a pile of folders, she pulls out two.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Kensal Rise or Brixton?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Kensal.

           She hands him the file, there is an ease between them.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Who wants Brixton?

           The room is quiet, eyes dart to the floor and people shift 
           uncomfortably. 

           Kate thrusts the file into the hands of the closest officer 
           to her: Detective Sergeant SIMMONS, late 20s, mousy, awkward 
           and lost in her masculine suit. A childish necklace with the 
           letter ‘E’ glints under the strip lights. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Simmons, thanks for volunteering. 

           Simmons’ face drops, her mouth opens to protest but there’s 
           nothing she can say. Francis moves forward and takes the 
           file. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’ll take it. 

           Simmons turns to Mallory, it is a look of sheer relief. 
           Francis flashes a reassuring smile at her. A comforting hand 
           pats her shoulder.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                            (To Kate)
                        If it’s okay with you? 

           Kate nods her consent and returns to her podium.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        That’s it.

           Someone in the crowd clears their throat, DIANE ALDER, 30s 
           bookish, brunette, and pretty, is the culprit. Kate smiles.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Right. Doctor Alder has mentioned 
                        that a large number of you are 
                        cancelling sessions. It is 
                        important that you attend these, 
                        aside from the fact they are 
                        mandatory; 
           Diane smiles warmly to the room, she lingers on Harry. He 
           smiles back. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        What we do is exceptionally 
                        stressful. We can’t afford anymore 
                        burnouts. See the doctor, talk 
                        about your problems. 

           Kate collects her files, she’s heading for the door when 
           Francis clears his throat loudly.  

           Kate turns quickly, she is not amused.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                            (Dry)
                        Apparently a promotion is not 
                        congratulations enough, so let us 
                        have a round of applause for D.I. 
                        Mallory.

           Kate is gone before the chorus of claps start up. Harry claps 
           twice and heads for the door. He lets Diane go through first. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Thanks Harry. 

           He smiles.

           EXT. KENSAL RISE FLATS - DAY

           Late autumn sun beams onto the tidy Victorian terraces, it 
           doesn’t look like the sight of a murder.

           Harry sits in his car eyeing the coroner’s van. His sense of 
           dread is palpable, and he’s clearly in no hurry. The file 
           lies open on his lap. The victim, Melanie Leah, 20s, 
           brunette, pretty once, stares up at him empty eyed.     

           He watches a little scene play out in his wing mirror: TWO 
           WOMEN with prams stand on the other side of the police tape 
           gossiping. Their children stare down the road.  

           Suddenly the two women stop and stare captivated. 

           Harry follows their glances: the Coroners: ERLAND, 50s 
           overweight, and GRAHAM, 20s, hyper, awkward and green, are 
           wheeling out a stretcher: a black body bag lies on top. With 
           ease and precision they load the van. 

           When the body is loaded, Harry gets out of his car. AMP in 
           tow, he heads towards the van. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        How long?
                                 ERLAND
                        Not more than twenty hours. 

           Harry nods a curt thanks and heads into the house. The 
           corners watch him go.

                                 GRAHAM
                        You couldn’t pay me to do that. 

           INT. KENSAL RISE FLAT - DAY

           Once a young woman’s flat, now a crime scene. The ghost of 
           her remains in the belongings: the shoes strewn around the 
           floor; the photos on the fridge door. 

           Then there are the remnants of violence: the broken coffee 
           table; the blood stains on the carpet; the dents in the 
           plasterboard.  

           Harry follows the trail of carnage around the room, he speaks 
           into the aether. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Fourth of November, Twenty 
                        Fourteen. Acting Detective 
                        Inspector Harry Orwell recording 
                        homicide of Melanie Leah, at 
                        suspected scene of crime: Victim’s 
                        flat.  

           Harry goes straight to work, setting up a microphone by the 
           blood stains on the carpet. He dots the others around the 
           room, near to the signs of struggle. 

           The AMP is on, a long tone sounds as it calibrates. Harry 
           pulls on his headphones, the sound of the outside world dies 
           away. Replaced with every sound ever made in that room all at 
           once. It is an assault of noise.    

           Harry hits rewind, after a beat he plays:

                                 HARRY ORWELL (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        Fourth of August, Twenty Fourteen. 
                        Acting Detective Inspector Harry 
                        Orwell recording homicide of 
                        Melanie Leah, at suspected scene of 
                        crime: Victim’s flat.

           Satisfied his AMP is working, he hits a long rewind. 

           A small clock runs backwards: 5 hours ago, 10 hours ago, 15 
           hours ago. Harry hits play, he can hear police sirens. Rewind 
           again: 17 hours ago, 18 hours ago, 19 hours - Harry hits 
           play. Silence.
           He adjusts a microphone, we catch a murmur form the 
           neighbour’s telly. He fast forwards in minute intervals until 
           suddenly he hears the key in the lock. 

           He listens as the door opens, and footsteps enter.  Two sets. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP)
                        I think there’s some wine... or 
                        tea. I definitely have tea...

           The door closes, no answer comes from the second set of 
           footsteps. 

           The fridge door opens.

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        Unless you take milk?

           The second set of footsteps move across the room. Harry’s 
           eye’s follow them as they move toward another microphone. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

           Harry hears her breath catching, her moving backwards and 
           bumping into the fridge. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        What are you do-

           A body slammed against the wall, it matches the dented 
           plaster board. Melanie choking and fighting for breath. Then 
           the heavy breathing of the Murderer. Deep long breaths as she 
           splutters and gasps.  

           Suddenly she gets in a deep breath and lets out a shrill 
           scream. 

           There’s sounds of struggle as she fights back. Harry, 
           knuckles white as he clenches his fists, is rooting for her. 

           But he knows how it ends. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (CONT’D)
                            (Screaming at the top of 
                             her lungs, trying in vain 
                             to reach the neighbours.)
                        Please somebody help me.

           Harry’s eyes follow the sound of Melanie being thrown into 
           the coffee table - a sickening crunch. Harry’s shaking, his 
           jaw clenched, riddled with the agony of inaction.  

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t-

           Harry listens as she gurgles and splutters. He stares at the 
           blood on the carpet. 
           Harry listens as the Murder lets out a long breath. 

           Harry does the same, not realising he’d been holding his. 
           There’s only one set of footsteps now. Harry listens as the 
           attacker laps the body, taking it all in. 

           Harry hits stop. He looks unsettled, this isn’t the run of 
           the mill murder. He opens the file and makes a note, one 
           word, ‘Silent.’

           He rewinds again and presses record. 

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Harry sets down his AMP and begins detaching the hard drive. 
           He looks drained.  

           Francis comes in at his back.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Alright Orwell?

           Harry nods politely, eager to get back to his desk. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        You dodged a bullet with Brixton: 
                        Arson... A Family, too.  

           Francis looks desperately sad.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Three kids. Dog and everything.

           Francis sets down his AMP.  

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        How about you?

           Harry pulls out the hard drive and heads off to his cubicle, 
           he’s not interested in a measuring contest.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Just one. 

           INT. HARRY’S CUBICLE - AFTERNOON

           Melanie’s photograph is pinned to his wall. Another dead face 
           staring out. 

           The AMP’s hard drive is plugged into the computer. Harry 
           sits, headphones on, transcribing Melanie’s murder. It’s 
           torturous. He plays it over and over; a repulsive endless 
           loop, as he notes down every detail of Melanie’s death. Every 
           clunk, every breath, is noted with precision.   

           His reaction to it is visceral; Harry detests it.   
           He pushes pause, but the recording keeps playing. 

           He hears Melanie chocking and spluttering.

           He pushes pause again, but she’s there: Gasping. 

           He pulls off the headphones.

           She’s still there, mingling with the sounds of the office, 
           the clatter of keys and the murmuring on telephones and 
           Melanie screaming. Dying. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP)
                        Don’t-

           He’s trying to get a grip of himself, but the sound won’t 
           stop until-

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Harry?

           Melanie’s voice evaporates and the air comes back into the 
           room. Harry turns to find Diane at the mouth of his cubicle. 
           The tension in him melts away. 

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        You look a bit peaky?

           Harry smiles, a quick and empty smile.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        There’s a bug going around.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You’re overdue; can we finally have 
                        a chat? 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I wouldn’t want to give you my 
                        bug...

           Diane frowns, she moves into his cubicle and sits on his 
           desk. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Please, Harry. 

           He’s torn, but he can’t refuse her.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        How about tomorrow?

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I’m free now. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Now then.  
           INT. DIANE ALDER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           An attempt at soothing: soft yellow on the walls, plants by 
           the windows, comfy chairs. 

           Harry slouches in a seat, he looks comfortable, at ease. 

           Diane collects herself behind her desk and gets a notepad.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No chaise lounge? 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Budget cuts. 

           Harry beams. 

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        So, how are you?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Great. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Great?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yeah.

           Diane looks at him for a long beat. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I guess that’s us done then.

           Harry’s smile falters. Diane closes her notepad.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        That’s it?

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        If you won’t be open with me, it’s 
                        a waste of both our time. 

           Diane stands, Harry stares at her, he doesn’t want to 
           disappoint her.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Okay, I’m not great.

           Diane hovers.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        But I am fine... I’m okay. 

           Diane sits.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Okay. That we can work with. 
           Harry grimaces.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Are you going to make me talk about 
                        my childhood?

           Diane smiles reassuringly, it’s like warm sun.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        God no. I’m more interested in how 
                        you feel now?

           Harry stares at her, but Diane is used to this, her voice 
           softens, she guides him.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        Are you stressed? 

           Silence as Harry considers how best to answer.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        Anxious?

           She lets it hang until he finally speaks.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I suppose I have the correct amount 
                        of stress, for someone who listens 
                        to murders.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        The correct amount. How much is 
                        that? 

           Diane smiles, she’s caught him out. But his shields are 
           instantly back up. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        A little. 

           Diane scribbles in her note book.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Do you have trouble sleeping, 
                        nightmares?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (Quickly)
                        No, nothing like that.

           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - EVENING

           The best office on the floor, which isn’t saying much. The 
           white walls are going a little grey. Dusty blinds shield the 
           semi-opaque glass that looks on to the floor. 
           Kate’s hunched over her large desk, deeply lost in her work. 
           A tap at the door pulls her out. The outline of Francis 
           hovers behind the glass.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You wanted to see me?

           Kate beacons him in, she nods towards the door, he shuts it.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Simmons is useless. 

           Francis stares at her, unsure of what to say.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        I wonder if you think I don’t 
                        notice; or if maybe you’ve got a 
                        thing for her- 

           Francis stammers a protest.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I don’t.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        If you don’t let her take cases she 
                        won’t get any better. 

           Francis takes this in.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        You’re not their friend. Not 
                        anymore, you’re their superior. Act 
                        like it. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I suppose I just need a slight 
                        adjustment period.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Well adjustment period over.  

           INT. HARRY’S CUBICLE - EVENING

           It’s dark and the office is empty when Harry returns to his 
           cubicle. There’s a lightness to him. 

           He quickly glances at his computer screen. Melanie’s murder 
           sits, ready to play again. He looks at it for a moment, all 
           the weight settles back on him.  

           Over the top of the cubicle he sees Diane lock up her office 
           and head for the door. He quickly grabs his jacket.
           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           AMP in tow, he catches up to Diane.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Where are you off to now?

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Home. 

           Harry opens the door for her.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I feel like all we’ve done is talk 
                        about me-

           Diane knows where this is going, she shuts him down.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        That is the point of all this. 

           INT. HARRY’S DREAM - NIGHT

           The room looks familiar; it’s the flat in Kensal Rise, or a 
           version of it. It’s very flat, like the memory of a 
           photograph. The sound track to the murder plays, identical in 
           every way to the one Harry recorded.   

           Harry reclines on a sofa, before him Melanie Leah fights for 
           her life.

           He watches passively as a FIGURE throws her around. It is a 
           messy fight. Melanie kicks and scratches and claws; but it is 
           no use. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH
                        Please somebody help me.

           Melanie falls into the coffee table, there is a sickening 
           crunch. She writhes, winded, as the Figure advances over her. 
           Her eyes turn to Harry.

                                 MELANIE LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t-

           The figure draws a blade: a vicious looking stanley knife. 

           Harry can’t tear his gaze away. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           Harry’s eyes dart open, he’s in his bed, 3 am glows from his 
           alarm clock. 

           He switches on the light, and tries to force Melanie out of 
           his mind. 
           His eyes fall on little smudges of blood by the light. He 
           quickly finds the source: four little crescents on his palm. 
           He makes a fist, the crescents line up with his nails. 

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           The windows are black caverns of darkness. It’s so early that 
           even the buildings opposite are empty and dark. The whole 
           office is silent. 

           A soft light glows from one of the hive of cubicles-

           INT. HARRY’S CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS

           Harry’s blood shot eyes stare at the monitor, following the 
           cursor as it runs along the peaks of the sound waves. 

           His headphones are on, the silence of the empty office is 
           gone. Invaded by the sound of Melanie’s murder. 

           The cursor reaches its crescendo. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP)
                        Please somebody help me.

           Harry’s pupil dilate, his breath quickens.

                                 MELANIE LEAH  (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        Stop-

           Harry is immersed in it. The whole world around him has 
           melted away into the darkness. 

           He’s holding his breath as Melanie gasps for hers. Every 
           splutter, every breath she manges to steal back is reduced to 
           a tiny blip on a line. The jagged peaks of the struggle have 
           become gentle squiggles. He looks ahead, he line grows 
           flatter.  

           Melanie has a minute left.     

           Harry can hear the click, click, click of the knife. A 
           stanley knife. 

           He can hear her thrashing as the knife grows closer.

           She’s got seconds now-

           A hand comes down on his shoulder. 

           Harry jumps out of his skin. He spins round, his eyes 
           refusing to adjust to the darkness. Melanie is spluttering in 
           his ears. He tears off his headphones as his eyes adapt.
           Kate stands before him with two cups of coffee. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                            (Trying not to laugh)
                        Sorry. 

           Kate sits a cup of coffee on his desk, and heads over to her 
           office. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        What’s this for? 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        It’s in lieu of overtime. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (After her)
                        I’m pretty sure you owe me more 
                        than a coffee. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’ll stick a hundred quid behind 
                        the bar tonight. How does that 
                        sound?

           Harry grimaces. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Be social. It will help when I 
                        upgrade you from acting detective 
                        inspector.

           INT. THE SPEAKEASY - NIGHT

           A cavernous maze-like basement pub. The mahogany soaks up the 
           light; music turned down low, no one is listening. The 
           punters are all a very specific type: all police officers. 
           Dotted around, drinking in little cliques. 

           A table of familiar faces is crammed in a corner. Francis 
           Mallory is holding court, the other officers and detectives 
           from the A.F.D., sit talking a little too loudly. Stacks of 
           empty glasses tilt precariously on the table, a pile of the 
           same newspaper is saturated with lager, we can make out a 
           headline: ‘FIRST MURDER CONVICTION THROUGH AMP TECHNOLOGY’

           Harry enters the bar, he’s come straight from the office. 
           Hair unkept, shirt wrinkled from sitting all day. A pretty 
           BARTENDER, 20s, brunette, pretty, toothy and fresh smiles at 
           him.  

           His eyes scan the place, he spots the others, there is a 
           flash of disappointment. He gingerly makes his way over. 
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Hi. 

           The conversation hits a low as they turn to Harry, a brief 
           flash of recognition on their drunk faces. It’s barely a 
           welcome, never mind warm, except from -  

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (pleased)
                        Orwell. Thanks for coming over. 
                        What are you drinking, let me get 
                        you a drink? 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ll get them in... Is Diane 
                        around?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You’ve just missed her.

           Harry glances at the door, he considers escape.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Is it important?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No. No... Do you want a drink?

           Francis stares dumbly at his glass, trying to work out what 
           he’s drinking. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Anything. Lager. No, Whisky. 

           INT. THE SPEAKEASY - LATER

           Population at the table has dropped, those who remain are 
           considerably drunk; Simmons is asleep on Getty’s shoulder. 
           Harry looks out from the group with a mixture of contempt and 
           a longing to be somewhere else; They are talking shop.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (drunk)
                        ... Complaining about the smell. 
                        The smell. 

           Francis takes a long gulp.

                                 GETTY
                        They don’t have a clue.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        And, get this, Mr-fucking-Crown 
                        Prosecution listens, tells me he 
                        can’t play this in court. Too much, 
                        too graphic.   
           A bitter laughter spreads around, Harry is immune. 

                                 GETTY
                        Did he even listen to the whole 
                        thing?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        He didn’t, I know he didn’t. He 
                        quit when the dog was yelping-    

           Harry gets up and heads to the bar, he’s not great on his 
           feet. Francis watches him go with a flash of concern that 
           instantly disappears.  

                                 GETTY
                            (a little haunted.)
                        They don’t even listen. 

           INT. THE SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS

           Harry walks until he can’t hear the drunken ramblings of his 
           co-workers. Finally out of earshot he braces himself against 
           the bar, slack jawed, looking a little tight. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Same again?

           Harry drags his eyes up and spots BARTENDER again. She looks 
           an awful lot like Diane. Harry smiles.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yes. 

           She moves off to make the drinks. Harry backtracks.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        No, wait. Just mine.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Are you the laphroig? 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        The lager. 

           Harry finds a seat as she pours his drink. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        So what’s your name?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Emily.

           She puts the lager in front of him. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Thank you, Emily.
           She smiles, an awkward silence falls. Emily searches in vain 
           for customers, Harry for something to say. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m guessing your not just a 
                        bartender?

                                 EMILY
                        Is there something wrong with being 
                        just a bartender?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (Quickly)
                        No. I wish I was a bartender. 

                                 EMILY
                        You could be, are you a good 
                        listener? 

           Harry’s smile falters for a beat.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        What?

                                 EMILY
                        Very funny. 

           He wasn’t joking. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        So what do you do? 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        What do I look like? 

           She looks round the bar. 

                                 EMILY
                        Shot in the dark: you’re with the 
                        police? 

           Harry considers as he takes a long swig of his pint.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No. 

           Emily looks surprised. 

                                 EMILY
                        A lawyer.

           Harry shakes his head. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        A judge? 

           Harry laughs heartily. 
                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I give up.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m a scientist. 

                                 EMILY
                        You know, I was going to say that 
                        but I didn’t want to insult you.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Insult me?

                                 EMILY
                        Come on, no one wants to look like 
                        a scientist. 

           They both laugh, Harry finishes his drink. Emily starts 
           pouring another.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        So what kind of scientist?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        The kind that invents things. Well, 
                        a thing. 

                                 EMILY
                        A thing. Would I have heard of it? 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Probably. But for all the wrong 
                        reasons. 

           Emily looks at him queerly. Harry dives into his next drink. 
           In the background his colleagues sit, forgotten.   

           INT. HARRY’S DREAM - NIGHT

           He’s in the Kensal Rise flat again, but things have shifted, 
           colours have muted, the sofa is different, there’s a poster 
           on the wall of some generic movie. 

           Harry’s sitting on the sofa as Melanie hovers by the fridge. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH
                        I definitely have tea...

           Harry looks round, he’s braced for her attacker, but they are 
           alone.

                                 MELANIE LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Unless you take milk?

           Melanie addresses it straight to Harry, he doesn’t answer 
           her. 
                                 MELANIE LEAH (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

           Harry follows her eye-line to his hand. He’s holding a 
           stanley knife. The stanley knife. He stares at it 
           dumbfounded.

           Suddenly he’s advancing on her, it’s like a compulsion. 

           His hands tighten on her neck, She kicks and scratches and 
           claws. He doesn’t make a sound against her assaults. Her 
           nails land dangerously close to his eyes. He pushes her away, 
           she’s lifted off of her feet.  

           The coffee table crunches underneath her. 

           Inflamed he stalks over, pulling round the crumpled mass of 
           her body. 

           But she’s not Melanie anymore, she’s Emily, the bartender.

                                 EMILY
                        Please somebody help me.

           It throws Harry for a beat, long enough for Emily to land a 
           solid blow under his chin. Her ring breaks the skin, a deep 
           gouge.  

           Dazed, he holds her down as his vision clears, his knee on 
           her chest, crushing her. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Stop-

           His hand finds the blade.

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           Harry’s eyes open, instantly he winces: The room spins. 

           He’s on his feet, heading to the bathroom. He stumbles over 
           something broken, he’s not got the energy to look at what it 
           is. 

           INT. HARRY’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Harry sticks his head under the cold tap. He reaches for his 
           toothbrush, he catches his own reflection. 

           He freezes. 

           On his chin a cut weeps blood.
           INT. HARRY’S FLAT- MOMENTS LATER

           Harry makes his way out of the bathroom. A small plaster 
           under his chin covers the cut. He takes in the carnage he 
           must of left last night on the way to bed. 

           Clothes discarded, shoes strewn, glass vase smashed to 
           smithereens, and a side table which is now little more than 
           kindling.  

           Harry stares in disbelief. He moves to clean it up then 
           catches the time. 8:20am. 

           In a flurry of panic he rushes to change. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - MORNING

           Hair still wet Harry sprints into the building. His AMP 
           batters off of his back as he runs.  

           He sprints past Diane’s room, she catches sight of him and 
           calls after.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Harry?

           Harry screeches to a halt and jogs back to her. 

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        I got your message.

           Harry looks at her blankly.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        The one you left last night?

           He goes red.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        We were all at the pub... if I said 
                        anything-

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        There were signs of intoxication... 

           Diane chuckles softly.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        But I have time tomorrow.

           A smile starts to spread across Harry’s face.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        For a... drink?

           Diane goes a little wide-eyed.
                                 DIANE ALDER
                        For another session.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Right. Of course. 

           There is an awkward beat. Harry starts to back away.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m really late.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        9am?

           Harry nods and resumes his jog.

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - MORNING

           The meeting is well underway, if a little understaffed. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        ...Assistance from the department 
                        with immediate effect, Mallory you 
                        were requested-

           Harry appears in the doorway. He stares at Kate 
           apologetically.

           She pauses her address as he gets to his seat. Harry looks 
           around the room, only about half of the department have 
           turned up. Those who have look a sorry state. A very tired 
           looking Francis throws a collaborative smile at Harry.  It’s 
           disarming and friendly.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                            (pointedly)
                        To recap, there has been another 
                        young, female victim. Homicide feel 
                        that there are similarities between 
                        this and the case in Kensal Rise.

           Harry’s focus snaps to Kate. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Harry, I’d like you to help 
                        Mallory. Discern if there are 
                        similarities to your case. Make 
                        this priority one. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - MORNING

           It’s cold and crisp. Harry and Francis zigzag in silence, 
           crossing the car park to- 
           I/E. FRANCIS’ CAR - MORNING

           An expensive car, top of the range but quiet about it. 
           Francis’ promotion must have came with a few perks.  

           Francis opens the boot with his key, completely empty, the 
           two AMPS fit in comfortably. 

           They get in, instantly Harry is struck by the smell, his 
           stomach tumbles. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        What is that?

           Francis looks round confused, his eyes fall on the jacket he 
           was wearing last night.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        That would be the whisky I spilled 
                        all over myself last night. 

           Harry rolls down his window.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        It smells like disinfectant. 

           Francis chuckles. The engine rumbles to life.

           I/E. FRANCIS’ CAR - LATER

           The car sits in gridlock traffic around St Paul’s. Francis 
           drums away on the steering wheel, filling the awkward 
           silence. 

           He looks over to Harry, who looks positively ill. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Do you want to stop and get some 
                        food in you before we get over 
                        there? 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I don’t think food would be a good 
                        idea...

           Francis’ phone vibrates on the dashboard, we catch Diane’s 
           name on the caller ID. Francis quickly cancels it. 

           The awkward silence returns.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Do you want to fill me in on the 
                        other case? I’ve not had time to go 
                        through the file.

           Harry doesn’t.
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Melanie Leah, twenties, throat 
                        slit. She knew the guy, they enter 
                        the flat together. She talks about 
                        making him drinks. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Boyfriend, or one night stand kind 
                        of thing? They have sex?

           The car inches forward. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No, he gets right to it. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Did you get a voice sample?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        He doesn’t say anything.

           Francis looks at Harry, his interest is piqued. Harry nods to 
           the road in front, the light is green. They cross the 
           junction. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Nothing? 

           Harry shakes his head.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        You can hear breathing, panting.

           Francis’ knuckles go white on the wheel.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (sickened)
                        He enjoys himself.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Sounds that way. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        But he’s silent?

           Harry nods. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Do you think he knows we’re 
                        listening?

           They both seem unsettled by this. 

           EXT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT - MORNING

           A block of trendy warehouse conversions. Police cars and 
           incident vans have taken over the forecourt. 
           Francis’ car pulls up, a uniformed officer opens the cordon 
           and points them to a space.

           Outside of the cordon a crowd have gathered, waiting 
           morbidly. 

           INT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Warm and modern, the hallway looks homely.  

           Francis and Harry call the lift, the doors open on the 
           Coroners and a gurney carrying the remains; all awkwardly 
           wedged into the lift.  

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Hello lads.

           Erland and Graham smile at Francis. They extend it to Harry, 
           who stares at the body bag. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Congratulations man.

           Francis rolls his eyes humbly. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Leave it. 

           Francis and Harry hold the lift doors as they try to close. 
           The Coroners extract themselves and the gurney. 

                                 ERLAND
                            (To Harry)
                        It’s like the other one. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Is she like the other? 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Have a look.

           Graham reaches for the zip, Harry isn’t in the mood, he gets 
           in the lift.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Have you got an approximate time? 

                                 ERLAND
                        Eight to ten hours. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ll get set up. 

           Graham draws the zip back, Harry smashes in the door close 
           button, willing it to close faster. 
           INT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT. 

           A sparse flat, kitchen-less and small, cheaply furnished from 
           Ikea. The movie posters on the wall and the tatty tan couch 
           give it a student vibe. Harry’s eyes catch a full bottle of 
           whisky on the counter, his gut churns.

           Blood has warped the cheap laminate flooring. Broken glass 
           from a mirror crunches under foot as Harry fires up the AMP. 

           He rewinds back through the hours, the little clock reaches 
           10, Harry presses play. 

                                 VICTIM
                        -UT NOW.

           Harry pushes pause and rewinds a little further. 

                                 VICTIM (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT NOW.

           Harry’s blood runs cold. He pauses and rewinds.

                                 VICTIM (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT NOW.

           Again.

                                 VICTIM (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT NOW.

           He recognises the voice.

                                 EMILY
                        GET OUT NOW. 

           EXT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT - DAY

           Harry strides purposefully out of the flat, his AMP and 
           jacket abandoned back at the scene. 

           He heads straight for the-

           EXT. CORONER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Francis is still chatting to Erland and Graham as they 
           prepare to load the body. They stop when they see Harry 
           making a beeline for them.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Are you alright?

           Harry goes straight for the body bag, he locates the zip.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Orwell, I wouldn’t-
           Before Francis can finish his protest Harry whips down the 
           zip. 

           The pale, twisted features of the bartender, Emily, stare 
           empty-eyed at the sky. 

           Harry reels away from the body. Graham and Erland rush to 
           cover the dead girl again. There’s a crowd looking on, and 
           they’ve got their phones out. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        For Christ’ sake. What the fuck is 
                        wrong with you?!

           World spinning, Harry braces himself against the gurney. 

           He throws up. 

           Francis goes to comfort Harry, then spots the crowd snapping 
           away. He makes a beeline for them, grabbing phones. 

           Some of them are gone before he can get the attention of the 
           nearby uniforms, having tea in their car. 

           Francis, shocked at what’s just happened turns back to Harry. 
           Who is now sitting on the ground. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        What the hell-

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (Cutting him off)
                        I know her. 

           Francis stares at him in shocked silence.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        We both know her, she works at the 
                        Speakeasy. She served us last 
                        night. 

           Francis sits down next to Harry. 

           INT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT. - LATER

           The AMP is set up, untouched since he walked out. 

           Harry stands alone in the flat, he stares at the poster on 
           the wall, there is something sickeningly familiar about it. 

           The door opens and breaks the spell.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        ...Of course. Look we get it, air 
                        tight - Orwell, this is Edwards.
           EDWARDS, 40s, a sharp woman with piercing eyes, extends a 
           hand to Harry. Her eyes linger on the plaster under his chin. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Harry Orwell.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Right, I’ll get started on the 
                        hallway.

                                 EDWARDS
                        This should be quick - Did you know 
                        the victim?

           Francis closes the door softly.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I knew her from the bar.

           Edwards isn’t writing anything down. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Where were you last night?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        The bar...

                                 EDWARDS
                        With your colleagues... What time 
                        did you leave?

           Harry thinks hard.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m not sure.

           Edwards eyes him reservedly.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Try to be.

           Harry shakes his head.

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        Well how did you get home? Tube?

           Harry stares at her, he’s pulling a complete blank. He can 
           feel his heart beating faster.

           Edwards takes out her notebook, she begins writing things 
           down. It’s making Harry sweat.

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        Did you get home?

           Harry nods.
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yeah, of course.

                                 EDWARDS
                        What time?

           Edwards’ demeanour has become increasingly less friendly.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I had an awful lot to drink.

                                 EDWARDS
                        How did you cut your chin?

           Harry stares at her, panic envelopes him.

           INT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Francis has set up his AMP in the stairwell and is gathering 
           the sounds of the night before. 

           Harry walks past, Edwards is at his back, barely a pace 
           behind.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Where are you going?

           Harry doesn’t look at Francis.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Further questioning. 

           Francis laughs.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Don’t be ridiculous-

           Edwards moves Harry on.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Wait a second and I’ll come with 
                        you.

           Harry heads for the lift, Edwards stares at Francis.

                                 EDWARDS
                            (sotto)
                        D.I. to D.I. - I’d distance myself 
                        from this.

           Francis watches in disbelief as the two get into the lift. He 
           reaches for his phone. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - AFTERNOON

           A windowless square, with a table and four chairs. 
           Harry sits with a veneer of patience, but the sweat pooling 
           at the back of his neck betrays him. 

           Edwards, and a SERGEANT sit opposite reading through their 
           notes. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Let’s just go through it one more 
                        time. 

           Harry sighs. 

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        You go to the bar to celebrate with 
                        your friends, but you spent the 
                        evening talking to the victim. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        She was serving me drinks.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Whilst talking to her you lied 
                        about your profession.

           Harry closes his eyes against the embarrassment. 

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        Were you trying to sleep with her?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No.

           Edwards has stepped up the aggression, she’s going for him. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        It’s just in my experience when a 
                        man speaks to a young, attractive 
                        girl all evening, and lies about 
                        his profession, he’s usually trying 
                        to sleep with her. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I wasn’t trying to sleep with her.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Is she not your type?

           Harry stares blankly, unsure how to answer.

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        So, you went home, but you are not 
                        sure how or when you got there.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I was wasted.
                                 EDWARDS
                        Are you sure you didn’t go home 
                        with her?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yes.

                                 EDWARDS
                        How can you be sure?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I was too drunk.

                                 EDWARDS
                        To get it up?

           Bang-bang-bang. The door to the interview room is battered 
           loudly. Edwards nods to the Sergeant to investigate. Before 
           he can protest the door is barged open by Kate. 

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        We’re in the middle of an 
                        interview.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Not anymore. 

           INT. HOMICIDE OFFICES - LATE AFTERNOON

           Slicker and clearly better funded than the Audio-Forensics 
           Department's offices. 

           Harry sits stewing, Francis sits next to him trying to 
           appease the situation as Edwards and Kate go toe to toe. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        -And half the bloody force drink in 
                        that dive. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        He’s got no alibi, little 
                        recollection of the evening, two of 
                        my guys saw him talking to the 
                        victim.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Ordering drinks!

                                 EDWARDS
                        Look, it is my job to find out 
                        where he was last night.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        It’s your job to catch a murderer, 
                        not bother my people.
                                 EDWARDS
                        A woman was killed, he doesn’t know 
                        where he was -

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I put Harry in a taxi. 

           Harry stares at Francis with something like awe. Francis has 
           just put all of the air back in the room. Harry relaxes. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Convenient. 

           Kate clenches her jaw, she’s about to lose it. 

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        When?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Before they called last orders.

                                 EDWARDS
                        How do you know he didn’t double 
                        back?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        He was wasted - I had to give the 
                        taxi driver an extra twenty to just 
                        take him. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Did you get the cab number?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        No.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Why not?

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’d hazard they didn’t expect the 
                        bartender to get murdered. 

           Edwards is not at all pleased. 

                                 EDWARDS
                            (to Francis)
                        You were drinking, how can you be 
                        sure?

           Francis rolls his eyes.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Were your two guys at the scene 
                        sober? 

           Edwards bites her tongue. 
                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Clear him.  

                                 EDWARDS
                        Not until- 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Clear him or every case you work 
                        after this will be handled by the 
                        laziest idiot in my department, 
                        I’ll hire someone special, just for 
                        you. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - NIGHT

           It’s raining as Kate walks Harry to his car. He’s left his 
           jacket somewhere, the perfect end to the perfect day.  

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Cheer-up, bad things come in 
                        threes. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        This is only the second.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Here’s the third: I want you at 
                        that crime scene first thing 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ve got an appointment with Diane.

           Kate grimaces. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        After your session then. 

           Harry gets in his car, Kate taps on the glass.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Eat something, you look like shit. 

           INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Neon and primary colours. It’s the kind of place that sells 
           fried chicken, or more likely pigeon. No sober adult should 
           eat there. 

           Harry sits, shirt wet from the rain alone in the shop waiting 
           for his order. 

           The heat causes the windows to fog up, it’s also getting to 
           Harry. He starts to nod off. 
           A crash from the kitchen rouses him. Bleary eyed he stares 
           out of the steamed up window. 

           Two girls walk by arm in arm. He catches their faces in the 
           neon glow: Melanie and Emily.  

           He watches as they pass the window, he turns to follow them, 
           they link arms with another girl. 

           Harry’s on his feet, he follows them outside. 

           EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Light flows out the shop windows that line the street.  
           They’ve got a quite a lead but he’s running to catch them.

           Chasing them, hunting them, through the crowd.

           He bumps into a PASSER BY.

                                 PASSER BY
                        Hey

           Harry’s lost them, he’s angry.

                                 PASSER BY (CONT’D)
                        HEY

           INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           He opens his eyes. He’s still sitting in the restaurant. 
           Harry gets his bearings.

                                 FAST FOOD GUY
                        HEY! Your meal. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           The key goes into the lock and Harry, food in hand, opens the 
           door onto the carnage of last night.  Untouched since he ran 
           out late this morning.

           He lets out a long sigh, and traipses over the smashed glass 
           into the kitchen. 

           He eats over the sink. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - LATER

           The glass is swept and bagged. Harry struggles to rebuild 
           what once was his sideboard. 
           From a cupboard he pulls out a tool bag and roots through it 
           for a screwdriver. He comes across a stanley knife, the one 
           from his dreams. 

           He drops it back in the bag.  

           EXT. HARRY’S FLAT - LATER

           Harry dumps the remnants of his sideboard by the bin, the bag 
           of tools are dumped with it. 

           INT. HARRY’S DREAM - NIGHT

           The place has become a fusion of Melanie and Emily’s 
           apartments. A collage of the striking things in each flat. 

           Harry stands by the door. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH
                        I definitely have tea...

           The knife is already in his hands, he stares at it.

                                 EMILY
                        Unless you take milk?

           Harry looks up to see Emily.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

           Harry closes his eyes, when he opens them his hands are on 
           Melanie’s neck.

           He throws her across the room, the coffee table crunches 
           underneath her.  

           Inflamed he stalks after her, pulling round the crumpled mass 
           of her body. 

           She’s Emily again. She screams loudly, it invades his brain. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT NOW.

           She lands the blow under his chin. Her ring breaks the skin. 
           Before his vision can clear his knee is on her chest.   

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Stop-

           His hand finds the blade.
           INT. DIANE ALDER’S OFFICE - MORNING

           A very tired looking Harry grips a pen tightly, clicking it 
           on and off as Diane returns with two cups of tea. 

           Harry looks down at it.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Did you say coffee?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No, tea. Tea is fine. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You did say coffee.

           Harry shakes his head and puts the cup to his lips. 

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. 

           She pulls out a note book and presses on.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        Right. Second session. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        A milestone.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        So what do you want to talk about? 

           Harry lets out a little nervous breath that’s trying to be a 
           laugh.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        It’s daft.

           Diane softens she motions for him to continue.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I lied before... when I said I 
                        wasn’t having nightmares. 

           Diane pauses to see if he will go on. He doesn’t.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Are they a common occurrence?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yes.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Every night?

           Harry suddenly looks incredible vulnerable.
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yes. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        How long have you been having 
                        these?

           It’s like pulling teeth.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        About a year. 

           Diane is a little shocked.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You’re not alone. 

           He feels alone. 

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        Is it always the same dream?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No. Not until recently.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Tell me about the most recent one?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m sitting on a couch or I’m 
                        waiting. And a girl, Melanie Leah, 
                        she is a victim from a case of 
                        mine. 

           Diane bites her lip.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        She’s there. And she’s attacked. 
                        And I can’t stop...

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You’re helpless? Watching on?

           Harry stares at her, he lies.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yes. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Have you considered that this 
                        nightmare is your subconscious 
                        playing out your day... You’re job 
                        is to listen as someone is killed. 
                        You’re helpless to prevent it, it’s 
                        already happened. But you don’t 
                        deal with the aftermath, you deal 
                        with the moment it happens.

                        Your head is playing out this 
                        moment, trying to make sense of it. 
                        Trying to make sense of your 
                        feelings of inaction...

           Harry is very quiet.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a stress response. 

           Harry is shaking ever so slightly.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I dreamed the girl was Emily, the 
                        bartender.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You’re subconscious adapting to new 
                        information. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I dreamed it was her, before she 
                        was killed.

           Diane looks a him for a long moment. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        The mind can play tricks, Harry. It 
                        can go back and fill in faces after 
                        the fact. The stress of seeing 
                        Emily, a girl you were speaking to 
                        only hours ago, dead. Well that’s 
                        exactly the kind of thing that 
                        would trigger an episode, a massive 
                        release of chemicals in the brain, 
                        twisting in your subconscious. 
                        Convincing you, you foresaw her 
                        death... 

           Harry sits back, he seems convinced. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ve been trying to stay awake.

           Diane grows serious.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        That is the worst thing you could 
                        do. You need time. Rest. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        So, how do I stop them?

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        It’s not so much stop as prevent.
                        You’re experiencing trauma daily. 
                        It’s piling up faster than your 
                        mind can process it.  
           Harry knows where this is going.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        We’re already understaffed.

           Diane nods.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Hear me out- 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m not going on the sick.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        It wouldn’t have to be for long-

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m on a contract. People that go 
                        on sick leave aren’t exactly 
                        candidates for full time 
                        employment.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Is that what you want?

           Harry’s not sure.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I at least want the option. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You can’t go on like this much 
                        longer.

           Harry stares at Diane, she underestimates him. He stands. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’d prefer if you didn’t speak to 
                        anyone about this. 

           Diane stands, she heads him off at the door. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I couldn’t if I wanted to. Come 
                        again next week, just speak to me. 

           Harry’s hand is on the door.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                            (desperate)
                        I am paired with a GP, I can have 
                        sedatives prescribed for you; To 
                        help with the nightmares.

           Harry considers.
           INT. HARRY’S CUBICLE - LATER

           Harry goes for his coat, he blinks at his cubicle in 
           disbelief. 

           Every one of his photos has been covered with photographs of 
           him throwing up at the crime scene.  

           He’s everywhere.

           Snickers start to escape from near by cubicles.  Simmons 
           pokes her head up, barely able to contain her laughter. Getty 
           booms with laughter, The other emerge and look on.

           Harry’s face is stone. He slips on his jacket and heads for 
           the door.

                                 SIMMONS
                            (after him)
                        Don’t be like that, it was only a 
                        joke!

                                 GETTY
                        Orwell? 

           Harry leaves.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Shit. He’s going to tell Reynolds. 

                                 GETTY
                        He won’t.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Humourless prick.

           Getty laughs, Simmons drops back down to her computer.  

           Getty heads round and pulls the photos off of the walls. His 
           eyes land on the crime scene pictures underneath. His face 
           crunches into disgust.

                                 GETTY
                        Did you put these up too?

           Simmons peers over.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Nope. They are all his.

           Getty shakes his head sadly. 

           EXT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT - MORNING

           Harry’s car pulls up outside the flat, Francis’s car is 
           already there. 
           He heads inside. 

           INT. SPITALFIELDS FLAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry wanders into the empty flat, he spots his AMP, it’s 
           been all packed up. The TV is on, mid-morning telly is an 
           eerie juxtaposition against the crime scene markers and the 
           bloodstains.  

           Behind him a toilet flushes. Francis exits. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        There you are, Reynolds said you’d 
                        be late. I thought I’d wait around. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        You’re done?

           Francis throws a hard drive over to Harry.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        It’s all on that.

           Francis switches off the TV.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Does he speak?

           Francis shakes his head.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        It’s a weird one...

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        What do you mean?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        It sounds like there was more than 
                        one woman.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        A witness?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Two enter, one leaves, and there’s 
                        not a peep in here before they come 
                        in.

           Harry looks around the room perplexed.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        You’re better at it than me, I’ve 
                        probably made a mistake. 
           INT. HARRY’S CUBICLE - EVENING

           The puking photographs lie crumpled in his bin. Harry’s sole 
           focus is on the screen in front of him. With his headphones 
           clamped on the sounds of the office around him are gone. 

           A flashing cursor hovers over a sound wave. Harry hits play. 

           The sounds of the door swinging open, two foot steps. Harry 
           recognises the second: The heavy feet, crisp on the wood 
           floor. 

                                 EMILY (AMP)
                        It’s a bit tragically hip. Or at 
                        least that’s what my brother 
                        says...

           A bottle hitting the counter.

                                 EMILY  (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        I swiped a bottle of the stuff you 
                        liked.

           Cupboards opening, the tinkle of glasses. 

           The heavy footsteps move towards her. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Get away.

           A little gasp and then the glasses tumble to the floor and 
           smash.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT NOW!

           A heavy choke of breath, not hers. She’s fighting back.  

           Running now, to the front door. He hears the squeak of the 
           handle, the creek of the hinges, the echo of the hallway in 
           her -

                                 EMILY (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        HELP!

           Slam - the door shutting as her body is thrown against it. 

           A clatter as she’s thrown back, she crunches some of the 
           broken glass. 

           Harry can hear her scrambling to her feet. The whipping of 
           her clothing as she punches.  

           A heavy blow, a kick. She’s winded. He hears her drop to the 
           ground. 

           Another kick, a thick sound this time: A blow to the head.
           The air wheezing out of her lungs as she’s held down.

           A scream. 

           Harry looks confused, but he lets it play on. 

           He can hear the sounds of her struggling under the attacker, 
           shifting, trying to push him off. She’s gasping for breath. 

           She’s being pushed down so hard, he can hear the laminate 
           flooring crack and squeak under the weight.  

           A scream. The exact same as before.  Harry’s brow furrows.

           A sudden shift, Emily claws in a breath. She howls, a primal 
           terrified scream.

           Harry hears something crack, her murderer coming down on top 
           of her. 

           Then a scream again, the same one. 

           Harry hears the attacker sighing, it’s sickeningly filled 
           with delight. 

           That scream, again.

           Then clicking - the stanley knife being unsheathed. 

           The sounds of Emily trying in vain to struggle. 

           A gurgling. Harry’s gripping the desk. 

           That scream again. 

           Harry’s eyes go wide. 

           He frantically opens another window and searches through his 
           files. 

           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - LATER

           They sit behind Kate’s desk. Harry operates her computer as 
           she listens to the headphones.

           She is visibly affected by the sounds of Emily’s murder. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        There is a scream - 

           He plays it for Kate, she winces. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        It’s recurring, exactly the same 
                        each time.

           Kate looks at him, waiting for an explanation. 
                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        It can’t be Emily’s - it happens 
                        after she’s just been winded, then 
                        when she’s being choked, then after 
                        she’s had her throat slit...

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Someone else was there?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No -

           Harry moves Kate to one side while he operates the computer.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        This is the Melanie Leah murder. 

           He searches through the recording, satisfied he hits play.

           A scream fill’s Kate’s headphones. Kate’s eyes go wide. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        It’s identical. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Not possible. 

           Kate furrows in concern. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Unless-

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                            (firm)
                        Not possible.

           Kate stares at him.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        It is.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Harry, the killer can not have an 
                        AMP. Christ, it’d be easier to get 
                        anthrax. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        He could have made one.

           Kate shakes her head.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I made one...

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        As part of a whole team of people 
                        and with millions of pounds in 
                        military grants. 
           Harry lets it go.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Why, why would someone want to do 
                        that.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        He enjoys their terror. He’s 
                        conducting it.   

           Kate shudders.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        He has to have gone in after 
                        Melanie Leah’s murder and before 
                        Emily’s. I need to go back to the 
                        first crime scene. And we need to 
                        check Emily’s. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        She won’t be the last. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        No. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’ll send Francis. 

           EXT. KENSAL RISE FLATS - DAY

           Gone are the police cars and the cordons. The street has 
           returned to a nice neighbourhood.  

           Harry, AMP in tow, pushes the buzzer. Without an answer the 
           door opens. 

           INT. KENSAL RISE FLAT - DAY

           Harry opens the jarred door and takes in the flat. Shards of 
           light escape the curtains, catching the dust motes in free 
           fall. A bath mat has ben laid over the blood stained floor. 
           Failed efforts to erase the violence. 

           A woman sits at the dining table: MRS LEAH, 50s, but aged 
           beyond her years, thin, dirty, but pretty once. Her hair is 
           greasy, loosely tied, she’s not wearing make-up. Her clothes 
           look slept in, in fact her tee shirt looks like something her 
           daughter would wear to bed. The most striking thing is her 
           lips, they are dry and cracked and bleeding. She’s forgotten 
           to drink, she’s forgotten to live.  

           Mrs Leah sits vacantly as Harry hovers by the door way. He 
           can’t tell if she can even see him.
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Mrs Leah? I’m Detective Orwell, I 
                        believe you were told I was coming?

           No answer. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll set up this device. With your 
                        permission?

           Harry holds up the AMP. Mrs Leah doesn’t look.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if you know what it 
                        does?

           No signs of life.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        It allows me to hear any sounds 
                        made in this room at any given 
                        time... To collect them, as 
                        evidence. 

           Harry pulls out a hard drive.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll record the sounds made around 
                        the time of Melanie’s murder onto 
                        this... We’ll analyse it and use 
                        the sounds to catch who did this. 

           Harry casts his eyes around the room, temporary shrines have 
           popped up: one is just a collection of hair swept from the 
           floor, left in the shovel, unable to be thrown away.  

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I may have to move some things?

           Harry begins, slowly and with reverence he sets up his AMP. 

           He glances at Mrs Leah, her dead eyes are leaking tears. She 
           doesn’t seem to notice. Harry looks like a prisoner. 

           He plugs everything in and prepares to switch on.

                                 MRS LEAH
                            (Her voice cracking, the 
                             first time she’s spoken 
                             in days)
                        I’d like to hear it.

           Harry is still, considering how to handle this.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        That’s not allowed.
                                 MRS LEAH
                        I’ll hear it in court... I want to 
                        hear it now. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I wouldn’t ever listen to it. 

           Mrs Leah turns to him, it’s the first time she’s looked at 
           him. Her eyes are haemorrhaging tears.

                                 MRS LEAH
                        I want to know if she suffered.

           Harry suddenly can’t seem to swallow.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        She did. 

           Mrs Leah disappears before his very eyes, utterly lost. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        7th November 2014. Acting Detective 
                        Inspector Harry Orwell. Second 
                        recording of Melanie Leah homicide 
                        at confirmed scene of crime: 
                        Victim’s flat.

           Harry switches on the machine. The start-up tone fills the 
           room. Mrs Leah doesn’t react.

           The cacophony of sound fills his headphones. He hits rewind. 

                                 MRS LEAH
                        I want to hear her.

           Harry visibly sinks.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (forcefully)
                        Not with me. 

                                 MRS LEAH
                        I want hear her happy.

           Harry stares at Mrs Leah in disbelief. 

                                 MRS LEAH (CONT’D)
                        That thing can hear any sound ever 
                        made. I want to listen to her 
                        happy. You can do that?

           Harry nods.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        When? I just need to know when she 
                        was happy. A time. 
           Mrs Leah thinks for a long time. A little smile forms on her 
           face, it looks haunted.

                                 MRS LEAH
                        Play me her birthday.

           Harry looks at the file in front of him - 30/7. He pushes 
           rewind, the hours on the AMP clock fly backwards. 

           INT. KENSAL RISE FLAT - LATER

           Mrs Leah is crouched next to Harry. She’s wearing the 
           headphones. Rocking back and forth she’s utterly enrapt in 
           what she’s hearing. Harry sits in silence, wondering.

           A little laugh escapes her. 

           A long breathy smile, then her eyes go again. Rivers down her 
           cheeks. 

           She grips the bath mat she kneels on, inert with anger.  

           Mrs Leah breaks, she heaves with grief. Crying without care 
           for how she looks; primal, ugly, reckless, crying that 
           damages the body with its ferociousness. 

           Harry watches on helpless. 

           Mrs Leah slips off the headphones. He thinks she might hug 
           him but she pulls herself to her feet. 

           She walks to her daughter’s bedroom and closes the door. 

           Harry listens as she howls. 

           She doesn’t stop. 

           He pulls on the head phones, drowning out Mrs Leah and 
           catching the end of something. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP)
                        ...never, never, never!

           He listens as a group of girls erupt into giggles. 

           Harry fast forwards. 

           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Kate is plowing through paperwork, half listening to Diane, 
           who sits opposite. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        ...a rota system. With cases graded 
                        in terms of, well for want of a 
                        better word, horror. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT'D)
                        One listener shouldn’t be working 
                        more than say, two highly numbered 
                        cases at a time. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        It’s not that I don’t value your 
                        opinion, it’s that I don’t have the 
                        luxury to do what you recommend.  
                        This is a pilot programme. Alder, 
                        if we don’t yield results we won’t 
                        survive.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Part of the programme is assessing 
                        the mental impact on your team. We 
                        don’t know the repercussions of 
                        this work, the field is barely two 
                        years old. You’ve already seen 
                        swathes of your guys taking time of 
                        because they are rendered mentally 
                        ill. 

           Kate’s mouth goes thin.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        And that is partly due to you 
                        recommending they take time off... 
                        Sick leave is full pay and zero 
                        work. I’d like to go on sick leave 
                        for a few months.

           Diane looks uncomfortable.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        No one is saying this job is a walk 
                        in the park - it’s difficult, 
                        unpleasant work-

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        It is traumatising. Your team are 
                        suffering from a sort of P.T.S.D.. 
                        They are over worked, they do not 
                        have the time or the help to 
                        correctly process the things they 
                        confront daily. We’ve got no idea 
                        what the fallout could be. They 
                        could become a danger to 
                        themselves.

           Kate shakes her head, Diane launches her point home.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        How will you feel when you’re 
                        listening to one of their suicides? 

           Kate shuts her files, she stares at Diane, alive with rage.
                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        What are you insinuating? 

           Diane doesn’t answer.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        If I had all my listeners I could 
                        have enacted some sort of rota 
                        system. I could have implemented 
                        your ideas. But you have convinced 
                        over half of my staff to go on 
                        extended holidays. Your actions 
                        have put pressure on the remaining 
                        staff. Your actions Doctor Alder.   

           INT. KENSAL RISE FLAT - EVENING

           Harry is still working by his machine. The soft glow from the 
           monitors are the only thing illuminating the room. His 
           headphones are on, the whole world is dead to him. All he can 
           hear is Melanie’s murder:

           The sound of the key in the lock, the two people entering.

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP)
                        I think there’s some wine... or 
                        tea. I definitely have tea...

           The front door closing.

           The fridge door opens.

           Harry wracks up the volume, listening desperately. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        Unless you take milk?

           He tries to hear behind her voice.

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

           The footsteps move towards her.

           Her breath catching, her moving backwards, bumping into the 
           fridge. 

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        What are you do-

           Her body slammed against the wall.

           Her choking and fighting for breath. 

           His heavy breathing. Deep long breaths as she splutters and 
           gasps.  
           A shrill scream. That scream repeated in Emily’s murder. The 
           hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. 

           There’s sounds of struggle as she fights back.

                                 MELANIE LEAH  (AMP) (CONT’D)
                            (Screaming at the top of 
                             her lungs, trying in vain 
                             to reach the neighbours.)
                        Please somebody help me.

           The sickening crunch as she hits the now gone, coffee table

                                 MELANIE LEAH (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        Stop- 

           Harry listens as she gurgles and splutters. He stares at the 
           bath mat.

           Harry pulls out the file, he makes notes. 

           As the AMP plays on he can hear the murderer straighten 
           himself out. His footsteps as he laps the corpse. The front 
           door opening and shutting on the still warm Melanie. 

           Silence. 

           Harry listens as the minutes fall away. The silence is so 
           relaxing after the assault of sound. 

           Harry closes his eyes, everything about him relaxes. The 
           silence stretches on.  

           A loud tone cuts through the air. Harry’s eyes split open, he 
           stares at the machine in disbelief. 

           He can hear soft breaths. Someone is in the room.

           He hits rewind. 

           He listens to the tone again. 

           Rewind. 

           Tone. 

           Rewind. 

           Tone. 

           There’s no mistaking it. 

           Harry hits record. 
           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Kate sits behind her computer, Harry stands at her side. Both 
           look sick.

           Harry plays it again.

           The very recognisable tone fills Kate’s headphones.

           She goes white.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Are you sure it isn’t your own tone 
                        from when you set up?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        This is thirty-six minutes after 
                        the murder. I didn’t get there for 
                        another 9, 10 hours. 

           Kate rubs her temples.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        He just sat in the room. I could 
                        just hear him breathing. He opened 
                        and shut the door, waited long 
                        enough that we would assume he’d 
                        left. He knows we record for an 
                        extra thirty minutes at the 
                        beginning and end. He doesn’t speak 
                        Kate. He knows we’re listening, he 
                        knows protocol. 

           Kate stands, she can’t really listen to this just now. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        So he built an AMP or got one on 
                        the black market. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Only our AMPs have the tone: 
                        privacy laws thing. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        They are all accounted for. 

           Harry sits. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ll be a suspect again.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        You’re all suspects.

           Kate picks up the phone.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ.
           Kate grits her teeth. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                            (Down the phone)
                        I need to speak to Edwards, in 
                        Homicide. 

           Harry stands and heads for the door. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Leave the files.

           He nods, he opens his bag and leaves them on her desk. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t give a rat’s arse where you 
                        were, I don’t care how embarrassing 
                        it is. Drugs, prostitute, male 
                        prostitute. Out with it. 

           Harry stares at her.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Kate, I can’t remember.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Work it out.

           Her hand lands on the AMP.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                         I don’t care how. 

           Message received, Harry nods.

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Harry has set up the AMP in his own flat. We can see from the 
           clock he’s listening to the night of Emily’s murder. 

           The clock is showing after midnight now, the minutes tick by. 
           Finally Harry hears his door open and close. 1 am. Relief 
           floods his face as he listens to himself stumble along his 
           hallway. It’s vaguely amusing to hear himself.

           He waits for the crash to come, the fall that would 
           obliterate his furniture.

           It doesn’t. 

           He hears the door to the bedroom pushed open, left open. The 
           sounds of him fumbling around trickle down into the hallway. 

           Harry listens with a growing horror as he hears himself walk 
           back down the hallway.

           He looks ill as the front door opens again. 
           He listens as his feet grow faint on the staircase. 

           He’s perfectly still, waiting for those steps to come back. 

           Nothing. 

           After a long beat Harry begins to fast forward, 15 minutes 
           increments disappear in silence as he searches for sounds of 
           himself. 

           Finally he catches a smash. His table being destroyed. 

           He rewinds a little and hears his door open. 4:37 am blinks 
           on the display. 

           He listens to himself stumbling and smash up the place. 

           Harry switches off the machine. He pulls the sedatives out of 
           his pocket, he takes one. 

           INT. HARRY’S DREAM - NIGHT

           The room around him lies in disarray, Harry pins down 
           Melanie. His knee on her chest.  

           Behind a closed door he can Hear Mrs Leah howling.

           Melanie wont stop screaming. It’s the same scream every time. 

           Over and Over. 

           He tries to get her to stop, his hands grow tighter round her 
           neck. 

           INT. HARRY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Melanie’s screams become Harry’s alarm. 

           He’s awake. Grey and exhausted, he looks terminal. 

           He picks up his phone and looks for Diane.

           He pauses before dialing, trying to summon up some courage.

           It rings on to answer machine.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        It’s Harry. Orwell. I’d like to 
                        speak to you, if you have time 
                        today? I’m... well, they’re not 
                        working. The pills. I’d like to 
                        talk. 
           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - MORNING

           Harry’s car pulls into a space, he’s getting his stuff 
           together in the front seat when he spots Diane by the door 
           way. A glimmer of a smile plays on his face as he watches her 
           through his rainy windshield.  

           He puts a little bit of speed on, hoping to catch her. 

           As he’s reaching for the door handle Francis strides up to 
           Diane. 

           They kiss. 

           Harry watches until the rain blurs them out. 

           He starts up the engine, the wipers clear the glass, Francis 
           and Diane have gone inside. 

           Harry drives away. 

           EXT. HARRY’S FLAT - DAY

           Harry pulls up in front of his flat, grabs his AMP and heads 
           inside. 

           He passes the heap that used to be his side table. He pauses 
           for a second. The bag of tools he threw out is gone. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - AFTERNOON

           Harry sits on the sofa, eyes closed he’s trying to relax, but 
           everything around him is so loud. 

           The tap dripping, the people in the flat upstairs, his own 
           heartbeat, thundering in his ears. 

           A siren streaks past his flat, it sets off a chain reaction. 
           Melanie starts screaming. 

           He turns on the TV and puts the volume on max. She’s still 
           screaming. 

           He can hear the sounds of a struggle now: Emily’s fight.

           Banging which becomes knocking. 

           His front door. 

           They stop and Harry is left with the blare of the TV. He 
           mutes it and hears the knock again.

           Harry opens it. Kate stands in the hallway. 

           She stares at him with genuine concern.
                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        People look guilty when they don’t 
                        turn up for work. 

           She walks past him and heads for the living room, familiar 
           with the layout for the flat. 

           Kate takes in the place, it’s a mess. She helps herself to a 
           glass and pours in water. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Want one?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Shouldn’t I be offering you? 

           Kate pushes his laundry off of the end of the sofa and sits 
           down.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Edwards wants you in for further 
                        questioning. She suggested you 
                        contact your union adviser and have 
                        him provide a lawyer... I told her, 
                        well, I told her a couple of 
                        things, but I stressed you did not 
                        need a lawyer.

           She watches as Harry stares at the floor.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                            (panic rising)
                        Do you need a lawyer?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I listened to the flat the night 
                        the bartender was killed. I got in 
                        around one a.m.

           Kate smiles.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        That clears you!

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I went back out.

           Kate’s mouth drops open a little, she’s got nothing to say.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                            (afraid, quietly)
                        I didn’t come back until after 
                        four. I don’t know where I went. 

           They sit in a heavy silence.
                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        You’d have gone for food, or more 
                        booze. Or cigarettes. Jesus, Harry 
                        it could be anything.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Or, I could have-

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        No. 

           Kate moves closer to him, she stares him in the eye.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        You would know if you went out and 
                        killed a girl. I think something 
                        like that might stick out. You look 
                        ill when you’re listening to a 
                        murder. Do you actually think you 
                        could commit one? 

           Harry can’t look at her.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I don’t know.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I do. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        If they listen to this place...

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        They can’t. Not without due cause.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Harry sits opposite Edwards. There’s a gleam in her eye: 
           she’s out for blood.

           Harry looks exhausted.

                                 EDWARDS
                        I’d like you to start again, from 
                        the top. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        We keep going over and over this. 
                        What are you expecting to have 
                        changed?

           Edwards sneers.

                                 EDWARDS
                        I’m hoping something jogs your 
                        memory. 
           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

           Francis and Edwards sit opposite. Edwards is a different 
           creature here, she treats Francis with reverence, respect.

                                 EDWARDS
                        He’s got no alibi for the Melanie 
                        Leah murder. At home, in bed. As an 
                        officer, doesn’t that ring alarm 
                        bells?  

           Francis watches her with interest. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        People tend to be at home, in bed, 
                        at 3 am.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Haven’t your superiors asked you to 
                        go over Harry’s work with a fine 
                        tooth comb...

           Francis nods.

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        Strange thing to ask. Unless they 
                        had concerns he was perverting 
                        evidence. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You can’t pervert sound evidence, 
                        it’s incorruptible. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Then why check it?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        To make it air tight.

           Edwards treads lightly, she tries a different tact. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        How long had you been drinking for? 
                        They night the bartender was 
                        murdered.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Since we finished work.

                                 EDWARDS
                        So, for over five hours when you 
                        put Orwell into the taxi. 

           Francis sighs loudly.
                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        After five hours of drinking I 
                        can’t even tell my arse from my 
                        elbow. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        So, you’re a cheap date.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Please take this seriously.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I put Harry Orwell into a taxi, 
                        what more is there to tell you? 

                                 EDWARDS
                        But you don’t know where he went?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I told the taxi driver Harry’s 
                        address; the driver made me pay the 
                        fair in advance since Harry was so 
                        inebriated. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Then why won’t Harry give us access 
                        to his flat. We could listen, 
                        confirm when he arrived home? 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Why won’t he give you access to 
                        completely and utterly invade his 
                        privacy? Especially when you have 
                        been so nice and understanding? I 
                        have no idea.

           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Francis taps lightly on Kate’s door. She waves him in.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        How did it go?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        They just want to tie it to someone 
                        outside the force.  They’re gunning 
                        for him because he’s not one of us.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        He is one of us. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You know what I mean. He wasn’t 
                        ever a uniform.

           Kate lets it go. 
                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Have you gone through his work in 
                        the Melanie Leah case?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I didn’t see anything concerning. I 
                        asked Simmons to double check it.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Simmons? Would you not prefer 
                        someone more experienced. Getty?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        If I don’t give her cases she’ll 
                        never get any better. 

           Kate smiles.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                            (tentative)
                        If you’re satisfied with his work, 
                        I’d suggest you use him. No one 
                        understands the machine better than 
                        him. I trust him.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I do too. 

           EXT. HARRY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           The headlights of Harry’s car sweep the front of his building 
           as he pulls up. The catch a figure, HELEN TEMPLETON, petite 
           and brunette, waiting by his door.

           She approaches him as he collects his things from the boot.

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON
                        Detective Orwell? 

           Harry keeps his head down.

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been trying to reach you 
                        through your office. It’s 
                        important. 

           Harry pauses, hearing her out. He looks at her for a beat, 
           she reminds him of Emily.  

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON (CONT’D)
                        I want to interview you. A source 
                        of mine in the military tells me 
                        you were part of the team that 
                        developed the AMP.

           Harry puts his head down, tries to walk past her but she gets 
           in his face.
                                 HELEN TEMPLETON (CONT’D)
                        It would be in The Times. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Not interested.

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON
                        Would you prefer New Scientist? I’m 
                        freelance so you could have your 
                        pick. 

           He side steps her but she’s right back in front of him before 
           he can get away. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Please get away from me. 

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON
                        Okay, but you were in the team that 
                        developed the AMP? 

           Harry pushes by her but Helen’s not having it. She grabs him, 
           forcefully holding him.

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON (CONT’D)
                        A simple yes or no-

           She grabs at Harry’s AMP it digs into his back. 

           He pushes her away, it’s more violent than he expected, she 
           goes right over. Harry looks at her crumpled little form in 
           shock.

           She’s winded. Harry drops his stuff and goes to help her up.

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON (CONT’D)
                        Fucking hell.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (bumbling)
                        I’m sorry. I-

           Harry pulls her up. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m really sorry. I didn’t 
                        realise...

           Helen straightens herself out. She rubs the elbow that took 
           all of the impact.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        Can I call someone? 

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON
                        You can give me an interview.

           Harry backs away. He picks up his stuff. 
                                 HELEN TEMPLETON (CONT’D)
                            (after him)
                        You know I could have you done for 
                        that. 

           He heads straight for his door.

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Harry is slouched on the sofa, the TV blares in front of him. 
           Empty cans of energy drink lie around.  

           His head lolls, he fights to stay awake.. 

           INT. HARRY’S DREAM - NIGHT

           Emily is running for the front door, Harry catches her as she 
           reaches the handle. He slams her body against it. She 
           screams. He wraps his hands around her throat, trying to make 
           it stop. 

           She keeps screaming. 

           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - MORNING 

           Kate sits rigidly behind her desk. Before her stands 
           Commander MASON, late 50s, uniformed and severe. There is no 
           love lost between them.  Francis sits opposite Kate. He looks 
           like he’d rather not be there, but can’t quite look away. 

                                 MASON
                        We simply can’t have it tied to the 
                        force.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        The issue with that, Sir, is that 
                        it is. The killer is using our 
                        technology... 

                                 MASON
                        He’s in your team. Edwards is 
                        telling me it’s Harry Orwell. 

           Kate opens her mouth to protest.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Homicide want you to keep your 
                        distance, and I want you to get rid 
                        of him. Terminate the contract. 

           Kate snorts, it’s bitter. Mason over inflates, about to 
           launch into a dressing down when - 
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        If I may sir, that is a huge 
                        mistake. 

           Mason turns on Francis, Francis picks up his pace. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Homicide have little understanding 
                        of the technology, they don’t know 
                        how to look for the nuances. The 
                        only reason we know he’s using our 
                        tech in the first place is because 
                        of our skills. Because of Harry 
                        Orwell. 

           Mason considers.

                                 MASON
                        Close ranks, limit access to the 
                        investigation. Offer Homicide full. 
                        Full. Co-operation.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                            (smugly)
                        I already have. Mallory is heading 
                        it up.  

           Mason glares at her. 

                                 MASON
                        Let me be clear. When this gets 
                        out, and it will get out, Kate. 
                        There will be regime changes. 

           Kate stares back at him, she’s not intimidated.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Hopefully it will be out with the 
                        old. 

           Mason turns on Francis.

                                 MASON
                        Make or break, Mallory. Don’t fuck 
                        it up.  

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’ll do my best, sir. 

                                 MASON
                        I want updates. 

           Mason leaves without any pleasantries. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        If it gets to the press, we’re dead 
                        in the water. 
           Francis shares her worried look. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - MORNING

           Harry pulls up in his car. He’s parked next to Simmons. He 
           forces a smile at her. 

           She catches him out of the corner of her eye. She stares 
           straight ahead. She won’t look at him. 

           Harry gets out of his car, he hears Simmons lock her doors. 
           He heads into the office.

           INT. HARRY’S CUBICLE - MORNING

           Harry sits at his desk. No one will sit within ten feet of 
           him. Previously occupied cubicles are empty. A zone of 
           exclusion. 

           The meeting room is being turned into a make-shift incident 
           room. Harry watches as Francis and Kate confer in silence. 
           White boards are filled in. Large photos from the crime 
           scenes are pinned up.

           Simmons enters the room. Harry watches on as they discuss. 

           Simmons glances over at him, they all do. 

           After a beat the blinds are drawn on the room. Harry’s locked 
           out. He stares at his empty screen, penned in by his crime 
           scene photographs. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Harry?

           He doesn’t look round, doesn’t answer her.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        You never came. 

           She steps into his cubicle. He remains a statue. Diane stands 
           for a beat, but it’s obvious to her there’s no way to him. 
           Not now.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be here, if you feel 
                        differently. 

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Simmons is slaving away at a desk on the opposite side of the 
           office to Harry’s.  The Melanie Leah and Emily Kinsella case 
           files lie on her table. She’s listening to Melanie’s death. 
           Getty walks in, he taps her on the shoulder and plonks 
           himself down next to her. He’s a different person with her, 
           softer, gentle. 

           Simmons is confused, she looks around edgily.

                                 SIMMONS
                            (sotto)
                        What?

           Getty brandishes an office memo.

                                 GETTY
                        I’ve been asked to provide details 
                        of my whereabouts on the nights of 
                        the murders...

                                 SIMMONS
                        So?

                                 GETTY
                        I don’t have any witnesses for the 
                        second.

           Simmons looks at him, urging him on.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Can you get to the point, before 
                        people see?

                                 GETTY
                        I don’t have an alibi for the 
                        second... And you are my alibi for 
                        the first.

           Simmons bites her lip.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Oh.

                                 GETTY
                        I know you don’t want Reynolds to 
                        know, but well I don’t want to be-

                                 SIMMONS
                        Suspected of murder. Yeah. 

           Getty nods. Simmons doesn’t say anything. 

                                 GETTY
                        I guess I could just say I was 
                        alone for both. I mean, they can’t 
                        really suspect one of us.

           Simmons grows very grave.

                                 SIMMONS
                        They don’t suspect you. 
           Getty laughs.

                                 GETTY
                        I should hope not. 

           Simmons hushes him.

                                 SIMMONS
                        They do have a person in mind.

           Getty stares at her in disbelief.

                                 GETTY
                        One of us?

           Simmons nods.

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        You’re messing with me... Who?

           Simmons shakes her head, she’s said enough.

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        We’re not just talking murder we’re 
                        talking torture... then listening 
                        to it again. None of us even want 
                        to listen to these things once... 
                        No one here is capable of that. 

           Simmons isn’t listening. He puts his hand on her arm. 

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        None of us are killers.

           She doesn’t pay him any attention. He sits looking at her for 
           a long time. He swishes the memo through the air.

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        I have to answer this today...

           Simmons turns to him.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Speak to Francis. He’s heading the 
                        investigation, he’s the only one 
                        that has to know where you were. 

           INT. DIANE ALDER’S HOUSE - EVENING

           A beautiful open-plan minimalist place, calming, with lots of 
           plants. 

           Diane sits at her kitchen table reading, Francis is by the 
           sofa not really watching the TV. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I spoke to Getty.
           Diane makes a little noise, she’s not listening.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Him and Simmons.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Saw that a month ago.

           Francis laughs, he watches her, picking his moment. She turns 
           the page.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        What do you think of Orwell?

           Diane looks up.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I don’t think he’s seeing anyone.  

           She goes back to her book. Francis is still watching her.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Not that, what do you think of him?

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        He’s pleasant. Quiet.  

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Are you worried about him?

           She closes her book.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I can’t and won’t discuss him with 
                        you.

           She walks over to the sink and busies herself with dishes.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        If you had to pick one of us. One 
                        of the team who could do that... 
                        who would it be?

           Diane doesn’t answer him.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Who’d fit that profile?

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I don’t put any stock in profiles.

           Francis purses his lips. He looks a little petulant.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Who could do something like that?

           Diane continues to wash.
                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Anyone is capable of atrocities. 

           Francis sits forward, he chooses his words carefully.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Has anyone ever brought anything up 
                        with you... in a session?

           Diane turns to him, she’s not pleased.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I am sure you are not asking me to 
                        break patient-doctor 
                        confidentiality. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Not in an official way. 

           Diane grows very quiet.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Diane.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Get out. 

           Francis grows frustrated.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        What?

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        If you are not going to stop 
                        questioning me you have to leave.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’m trying to stop someone getting 
                        killed. Commander Mason is on me 
                        for updates and there’s nothing.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You are so out of line, asking me-

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        To help me catch a murderer. How 
                        dare I.

           Francis walks out.

           EXT. HARRY’S FLAT - EVENING

           Harry arrives home from work, he’s dead tired. He downs the 
           rest of his energy drink and gets out of the car. 

           A blue sedan catches his eye. Two men sit in the front, their 
           eyes follow him. 
           One of them is the Sergeant from his first interview. He’s 
           being watched.  

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - EVENING

           Harry gets in and shuts the door, he locks it. He’s caged. He 
           turns the TV on loud. 

           He sits alone. He looks scared. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - MORNING

           Early morning cartoons blare from the TV. Harry’s eyes are 
           open but he doesn’t look with it. 

           Francis is standing in his apartment.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (Over the TV)
                        Harry!

           Harry comes to, he stares at Francis confused. Francis turns 
           off the TV.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Bloody hell. 

           Harry is still confused. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Would you consider locking your 
                        door? I know I would sleep a lot 
                        better... 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Have I to go in?

           Francis mutes the TV.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’ve been calling you.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        What’s happened?

           Francis puts the kettle on to boil.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Nothing yet.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        There’s a surveillance team 
                        watching me.

           Francis frowns.
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Yeah, I heard about that. They 
                        weren’t here long...

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Kate?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You wouldn’t want to be on her bad 
                        side.

           Francis puts a cup of coffee in Harry’s hand. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        What are you doing here? 

           Francis sits down opposite him. He pulls out the case files. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You’re in this with me.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m a suspect.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (warmly)
                        Who isn’t?

           Harry smiles, it’s a relief to be treated normally. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - MORNING

           Getty reverses his car into a space. Simmons is sitting in 
           the passenger seat, she’s wearing the same clothes as 
           yesterday.

                                 SIMMONS
                        I’ll go first, you wait a few 
                        minutes and follow.

           Getty smiles at her.

                                 GETTY
                            (Only half joking)
                        You have a way of making me feel 
                        very used. 

           Simmons smiles playfully.

           She pops open the door, then quickly catches Francis and 
           Harry walking in together. She stalls in her seat, watching 
           them go. 

                                 SIMMONS
                            (serious)
                        Why is Francis with Orwell?
           Getty clocks them as they disappear through the door.

                                 GETTY
                        Why wouldn’t he be?

           Simmons turns to him.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Orwell is...

                                 GETTY
                        That’s who you suspect?!

           Getty laughs.

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        No way.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        They’ve got me checking over 
                        everything he’s done on this case.

                                 GETTY
                        Orwell isn’t the guy. Look at him, 
                        he’s built like the side of a 
                        fiver.

           Getty laughs again.

                                 SIMMONS
                        He gives off something, he gives me 
                        the creeps.

           Getty isn’t really pay attention, he looks at her watch. 

                                 GETTY
                        If you don’t leave now, I’m going 
                        to be late. 

           He leans over to kiss her, she’s gone before he can get 
           there. 

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - EVENING

           The meeting room has become a make shift incident room. Time-
           lines of Melanie and Emily’s last days cover white boards 
           Gruesome photos adorn the walls. 

           Francis and Harry sit round a table, they are pouring over 
           the files. 

           A tap at the door draws them both out. Diane hovers on the 
           other side of the glass.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Give me a minute. 
           Harry watches them through the blinds. Now he knows they’re 
           not strictly professional he picks up the little moments of 
           intimacy between them. Her hand brushing his arm; how close 
           together they stand, the way they mirror each other. 

           Harry smiles sadly. 

           Diane catches Harry’s eye. She tenses slightly. They break 
           apart. Francis comes back inside, he sits down.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        You’re lucky.

           Francis considers lying. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (changing the subject.)
                        We need a break. A pint.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m not drinking.

           Francis throws Harry his coat.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (playful)
                        Shut up. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I can’t.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Just the one.

           Harry smiles. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - NIGHT

           Harry and Francis cuts their way across the car park. A 
           figure is running after them.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Francis!

           She’s catching up to them when she spots Harry. She slows. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        What is it?

           Simmons catches her breath.

                                 SIMMONS
                            (cautiously)
                        It’s about... 

           Her eyes dart to Harry, he infers her meaning.
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ll get us a table.

           Harry continues through the carpark, Simmons waits from him 
           to be out of earshot.

                                 SIMMONS
                        I’ve got something... well, I think 
                        I have.

           Francis moves closer to her, willing her on.

                                 SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                        I’m not one hundred percent-

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (serious)
                        Simmons, what is it?

                                 SIMMONS
                        I think there’s a vibration. A 
                        phone call, during the second 
                        murder... And well, I can pinpoint 
                        the exact time of the call. We just 
                        need to get Orwell’s phone records. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        A phone vibration. That’s a tricky 
                        pick up. It could be anything. It 
                        could be the motor in the fridge...

           Simmons gets a burst of confidence.

                                 SIMMONS
                        It’s a repeating pattern... I’m 
                        sure it’s a phone. I’ll clean it 
                        right up, take out the background 
                        noise where I can. 

           Francis smiles approvingly.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Right. I’ll come find you after I 
                        get a bite. 

           Simmons smiles, she strides back towards the office.

           INT. PATRICK’S BAR BOOTH - NIGHT

           A bright little Irish bar, lots of green and orange. A 
           massive mural on the wall depicts St Patrick driving away 
           snakes. Empty whisky bottles and broken fiddles line the 
           shelves that tower up behind the bar. It’s not a police bar, 
           and the regulars don’t look too pleased with the sudden 
           intrusion of officers dotted around. 
           Francis and Harry are jammed into a booth picking at the last 
           remnants on their plates. A few of empty pint glasses dot the 
           table in front of Harry. 

           Familiar faces come in from the rain: Diane and Getty. 
           Francis lights up, he waves them over.  

           They cram past the regulars and jam into the booth. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Well how was your first shrink 
                        session? 

           Getty mock grimaces.

                                 GETTY
                        Allegedly I have authority 
                        issues... and I use humour to mask 
                        my pain. 

           Francis laughs. Diane smiles.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Humour? I’ve never seen you be 
                        funny once.

           Getty pushes Francis playfully. Diane goes to the bar. 
           Francis and Harry watch her go.  

                                 GETTY
                        It’s not The Speakeasy, that’s for 
                        sure. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Jesus, give it a chance.

                                 GETTY
                        I am, it’s just an awful shame. 
                        That was a great pub... 

           Harry looks a little disgusted. He slips past Getty and heads 
           for the bar.

           INT. PATRICK’S BAR - CONTINUOUS

           The barman is busy looking at his phone. Diane waits 
           patiently to be served. Harry approaches the bar, it’s so 
           little he has no option but to stand next to her. 

           No pleasantries are exchanged, both look unhappy in the 
           silence. 

           After a beat Diane caves.
                                 DIANE ALDER
                            (sotto)
                        You really shouldn’t drink with 
                        those tablets... You could-

           Harry walks away.

                                 DIANE ALDER (CONT’D)
                            (to herself)
                        Black out. 

           INT. PATRICK’S BAR BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Harry walks back to the booth, he extracts his coat from 
           under his colleagues. Francis looks at him questioningly.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m going to head back over. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Stay and have another. 

           Harry shakes his head.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s call it a day, it’s after 
                        nine. 

           Harry finally frees his coat.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ll do another hour.

           He’s gone before Diane gets back to the table with their 
           drinks. 

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Harry walks back through the dark and practically empty 
           office. 

           INT. MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He pushes the door open. 

           Simmons jumps, positively startled. She stares at him, eyes 
           wide. Harry can tell she’s afraid. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Sorry.

           She doesn’t say anything, her eyes long for the door.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to press on. 
                                 SIMMONS
                            (a hint of fear)
                        Did Francis say anything to you-

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (Quickly)
                        No.

                                 SIMMONS
                        -about when he’ll be back?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I don’t know if he will. 

           Simmons gets up and heads straight for the door. 

           INT. PATRICK’S BAR BOOTH - NIGHT

           Francis’ phone buzzes on the table, it’s unnoticed by them as 
           they chat away. Diane sits close to Francis, the empty 
           glasses on the table have grown in number. All are quite 
           drunk. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Stop going on about The Speakeasy. 
                        It’s morbid. 

                                 GETTY
                        At least we had a good last night 
                        there!

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Getty, a girl died.

                                 GETTY
                        Well not that bit obviously. And my 
                        morning was almost as bad as hers.

           Francis looks incredulous.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You are sick. You need some 
                        professional help. 

           Getty turns to Diane, he winks at her.

                                 GETTY
                        I would say I don’t need your help, 
                        but you’d only tell me I am wrong.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You are wrong. 

           Francis howls.
                                 GETTY
                        I needed help that night! When I 
                        got home I fell asleep in the 
                        bloody shower. 

           Diane snorts with laughter, she instantly chastises herself.

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        That’s not even the worst of it. I 
                        must of shifted in my sleep and my 
                        fat arse plugged up the drain... I 
                        flooded my bloody bathroom!

           Diane and Francis can’t help but laugh. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        The human plug.

                                 GETTY
                        Well there is enough of me!

           They laugh again.

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        Christ knows how you got me into a 
                        taxi that night. 

           Diane and Getty are still laughing. Francis isn’t.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                            (laughing)
                        God, how many people did you put in 
                        taxis that night?

           Francis has sobered.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Just the one.

           Diane and Getty don’t sense the weight of this.

           EXT. PATRICK’S BAR - LATER

           A sober Francis helps Diane and Getty out of the bar. He 
           looks for taxi’s. 

           A voicemail beeps on his phone. He drifts a little bit away 
           from them and listens. 

                                 SIMMONS (TELEPHONE)
                        Francis, it’s Simmons I’m sure this 
                        is a ring-tone, or a vibration-
                        tone. I’ve cleaned it all up and 
                        I’ve got the recording. I was going 
                        to leave it for you but Harry is 
                        in... 
           Diane has flagged down two taxis. Getty is in and away.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Francis.

           He turns his back on her, engrossed in the message.

                                 SIMMONS (TELEPHONE)
                        I’ll take it with me. I’m not going 
                        to wait. I don’t want to be alone 
                        with him. Okay.   

           Francis jogs over to the Taxi, Diane is already inside.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Hurry up.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’ve got to go back over and check 
                        on something. 

           Diane moves back towards the door.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        I’ll come.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Don’t be daft.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Don’t be long.

           Francis closes the door and watches until she disappears. 

           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Francis walks through the deserted department. Simmons is 
           gone. 

           He pushes the door to the meeting room open. 

           Harry is gone too. 

           He calls Harry’s mobile. It rings out.

           INT. HARRY’S DREAM - NIGHT

           Everything looks familiar, it’s a fusion of the crime scenes. 
           It’s incredibly real, everything is here. It doesn’t feel 
           imagined, it is recalled in perfect detail. 

           Somewhere a phone is ringing, but Harry has no intention of 
           answering it. 

           He’s too busy trying to make Melanie to stop screaming. His 
           hands clamping on her mouth. But she won’t. 
           He tries shaking her but she’s resolute. Before he knows it 
           his hands are round her throat. 

           The soft chime of glasses and a bottle hitting the counter. 

           Harry looks up to see Emily holding a bottle of nice whisky. 

                                 EMILY
                        I swiped a bottle of the stuff you 
                        liked.

           He moves towards her, taking in every detail of her 
           expression as she makes a little gasp. He can feel the knife 
           in his had, he knows she’s seen it. 

           The glasses smash on the floor. He can smell the whisky, it’s 
           like disinfectant. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Get away.

           Melanie scream again. It confuses and terrifies Emily.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT NOW!

           Harry is inches from her, she kicks him hard. He chokes out a 
           breath, as she dashes by him. 

           She’s almost at the front door, he turns and advances on her, 
           his eyes wild. 

           He hears the squeak of the handle, the creek of the hinges, 
           sees the hallway through the gap-

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        HELP!

           He slams her into the door and shuts it. She thrashes around 
           trying to break his hold. He throws her clean across the 
           table. She slides into the broken glass.  

           Melanie screams again. Harry looks at her, lying prostrate 
           and empty-eyed on the sofa, her throat seeping red 
           everywhere. She still screams. 

           Emily slams into Harry, she catches him off guard. She lands 
           a few punches. Harry can hear the whipping of her clothes as 
           her arms flail. She goes for his eyes, trying to scratch and 
           gouge. He pushes her away but she keeps coming.  

           He kicks her, a heavy boot to the abdomen. She drops quickly.  

           He kicks again and again. His savagery given free reign.

           Melanie screams again as he pushes his knee onto Emily’s 
           chest. 
           She gasps for breath beneath him. There’s a glint in his eye, 
           he feels powerful, he enjoys this. 

           Harry pulls out his knife. 

           Emily claws in a breath. She howls, a primal terrified 
           scream. Her eyes don’t look at the blade, they look into his. 
           Harry sighs contentedly. He wanted this.  

           He clicks the knife open. 

           Emily thrashes, squirms and screams under him. 

           Melanie screams again. 

           The knife slips into her throat. Blood flows out it pools 
           along her clavicle, it swirls around a necklace, a little 
           gold ‘E’ is drowned in blood. 

           He watches as Emily’s eyes slow, settling into emptiness. 

           Harry pushes off the corpse, he sits and looks at the two 
           girls, necks scarlet and dripping, as they gaze towards the 
           ceiling. 

           The silence is wonderful. 

           They both draw in ragged breaths. 

           They scream.

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - MORNING

           Harry’s fully clothed on his sofa, his shoes are even still 
           on. The plaster has come off of his chin. The cut underneath 
           looks infected. 

           His phone is ringing, he reaches for it just as it cuts off. 
           He checks the screen - 13 missed calls. 

           EXT. BAYSWATER FLAT - MORNING

           Green and leafy, the white stucco buildings reflect the blue 
           flashing lights that line the street. The windows are alive. 
           Neighbours watch on, enrapt.  

           Harry pulls up and abandons his car in the street. He hasn’t 
           changed. He walks straight to the front door. 

           All eyes are on him.

           He passes Getty sitting on the stoop, his head in his hands, 
           utterly distraught.

           He goes for the door way when Edwards comes out. She looks at 
           him with pure hate. He side steps her and moves inside.
           INT. BAYSWATER FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           A youthful flat. Living greens line the windows, bright 
           colours pop on the white walls. A large photo of Simmons with 
           her family beams out from the wall. 

           It’s full of people, camera’s flash, before Harry can cross 
           the threshold he’s handed a bunny suit and boot covers.

           Harry dons the suit and heads inside: Furniture is knocked 
           around; Blood darkens on the floor. Harry makes his way over 
           to Erland and Graham. They’re standing above Simmons. 

           She lies on the ground. Throat slit. Blood is drying along 
           her clavicle, The necklace she’s wearing is swimming in red. 
           The ‘E’ necklace. 

           Harry reels. 

           It’s a beat before he notices Francis, looking at him. 
           Watching him.  

           Francis walks up to Harry, he grabs him by the arm and drags 
           him outside. 

           EXT. BAYSWATER FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           Francis tows Harry away from the crowd of police.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Where were you?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Home.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I called you.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I was sleeping.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I called you last night, I came 
                        back to the office, you weren’t 
                        there, I called you.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I went home, I crashed out. 

           Francis is staring at Harry, there’s and edge to him.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I was at home.

           Francis doesn’t seem appeased. He storms away. 
           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Kate sits behind her desk, she’s pale. She isn’t doing any 
           work, just staring out into the office. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        She told me she thought she had 
                        something. Something I had missed 
                        on the recordings.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        What?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I don’t know exactly... But when 
                        she approached me I was with 
                        Harry... He knew she was looking 
                        into his work. She told me on the 
                        phone she was taking whatever she 
                        found home... They haven’t found 
                        anything at the scene.

           Kate doesn’t say anything. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        She was gagged. They said she was 
                        gagged. Someone didn’t want her 
                        speaking.

           Kate’s a million miles away.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Kate? 

           She stands.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I have to go down. They’re 
                        expecting us at three-thirty. 

           EXT. SCOTLAND YARD - AFTERNOON

           A throng of reporters have gathered at the entrance. Helen 
           Templeton is at the front. A general hubbub goes through the 
           crowd. Francis stands to the side, not wanting to get 
           involved. 

           They erupt when the front doors open. Kate and Edwards step 
           out, flanking Supt Mason, who’s just shy of enjoying this.    

                                 SUPT MASON
                        It is with great regret that I now 
                        confirm the body discovered in 
                        Bayswater this morning was that of 
                        Detective Inspector Elizabeth 
                        Simmons.   
           Questions are shouted at him but none can be clearly made 
           out. 

                                 SUPT MASON (CONT’D)
                        Questions will not be addressed 
                        until after my statement. 

           The questions die down. Mason continues.

                                 SUPT MASON (CONT’D)
                        I can also confirm that evidence 
                        discovered at the scene links 
                        Detective Simmons’ murder to two 
                        others. Melanie Leah, and Emily 
                        Kinsella. 

           The reporters shout again, a barrage of questions assaults 
           them. 

                                 SUPT MASON (CONT’D)
                            (Shouting over them)
                        As this is an on-going 
                        investigation certain details will 
                        be withheld. I will pass you over 
                        to the officer in charge of the 
                        investigation. D.C.I. Edwards, who 
                        will be taking questions.

           Mason retires back. Edwards can barely make it to the podium 
           before the questions are screamed at her. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Are these murders the work of one 
                        person?

                                 EDWARDS
                        Yes. 

           A symphony of shouts. She points at another reporter. 

                                 REPORTER 2
                        ....Serial killer?

                                 EDWARDS
                        I’m sorry I can’t hear you.

                                 REPORTER 2
                            (shouting)
                        Are you hunting a serial killer?

                                 EDWARDS
                        We are looking for only one suspect 
                        at the moment. 

                                 REPORTER 2
                        So a serial killer?
                                 EDWARDS
                        One question each.

           Edwards points at another reporter.

                                 REPORTER 3
                        Yes or no, are you hunting a serial 
                        killer?

                                 EDWARDS
                        Yes. 

           Edwards looks uncomfortable as camera flashes burst around 
           her.

                                 REPORTER 4 
                        Are people in danger? 

                                 EDWARDS
                        The Metropolitan Police are working 
                        round the clock to catch the 
                        killer, and keep people safe. 

           The reporters don’t seem to be growing any quieter. Edwards 
           looks through the crowd, she points at another reporter, a 
           hapless looking young woman: Helen.  

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON
                        Can you confirm reports that one of 
                        your own officers is the primary 
                        suspect? 

           A hush falls through the crowd. 

           Edwards glances at Kate. They’ve been caught off guard. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        I cannot comment on this aspect of 
                        the case.

                                 HELEN TEMPLETON
                        Can you confirm that the AMP 
                        technology has been involved in the 
                        killings? 

           The reporters go into a frenzy.

                                 EDWARDS
                        One question only. 

           Edwards points at another reporter.

                                 REPORTER 6
                        Her question.

           Edwards points to yet another reporter. 
                                 REPORTER 7
                        Is the police AMP being used by the 
                        killer?

           Edwards stares at the crowd.

                                 EDWARDS
                        I’m afraid we don’t have any more 
                        information for you at present. 

           The reporters continue to shout. Edwards and Kate retreat 
           inside. 

           INT. BAYSWATER FLAT - EVENING

           Simmons’ flat has emptied. Only Harry and a few SOCOs are 
           still around. Harry looks exhausted. 

           The AMP is all set up around the blood stain. Harry sits next 
           to the control panel. Through his headphones all he can hear 
           is screams. Emily’s and Melanie’s. 

           A muffled gagging, and sobs. He knows they belong to Simmons. 

           He pushes pause, slumping under the weight of himself. 

           A SOCO with a camera hovers by the door.

                                 SOCO
                        Are you going to be much longer? 

           Harry glares at the Soco.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ll be here as long as she was. 

           Soco shifts awkwardly.

                                 SOCO
                        Don’t suppose I can get an 
                        estimate. 

           Harry stands, he feels his blood boiling. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I don’t know how much longer it 
                        will be, he’s still torturing her. 

           Harry is right up in the guy’s face.

                                 SOCO
                        Sorry. 

           Harry sees the fear in the Soco’s eyes. It sobers him. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Go ahead.
           Harry walks away.

           INT. BAYSWATER FLAT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Harry walks into the bathroom, trying to get away from the 
           flashing camera. He moves to splash water on his face. He 
           stops himself when he see’s the blood stains on the sink.  

           The killer cleaned himself off here. 

           Harry stares at it for a long moment. He shakes it off and 
           heads for the door, something on the ground in the corner 
           catches his eye. 

           A plaster.

           Harry’s hand instinctively goes to his chin. He feels nothing 
           but scab.

           Harry stares at the plaster in disbelief. 

           His plaster. 

           He reaches for it when the door swings open, Soco steps in. 

                                 SOCO
                        Just in here, then I’m out of your 
                        hair.

           Harry stands dumbfounded as Soco snaps away. He snaps the 
           area the plaster is in. Harry stands perfectly still. 

                                 SOCO (CONT’D)
                        Thanks. 

           He walks out of the bathroom. Harry moves over to the 
           plaster. He picks it up.

           He catches himself in the mirror. He looks guilty. 

           INT. BAYSWATER FLAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry walks out of the bathroom, he’s shell shocked. The 
           plaster is in his hand. 

           Francis stands in the living room next to Harry’s AMP. 

           Harry’s fist closes on the plaster. Francis stares at him. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Are you finished?

           Harry can’t quite get words out. 
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the hard drive? I want to 
                        analyse it myself. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Not yet. It’s long... He took his 
                        time. 

           Francis can see Harry isn’t doing well.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        What is it?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Nothing.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Did you hear something?

           Harry shakes his head. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I need a break. 

           Harry starts to pack up his AMP.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (incredulous)
                        What?

           Harry is having trouble packing up, he can’t open his hand 
           without revealing the plaster.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’ll get the rest tomorrow. 

           Francis moves to stop him. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Leave your AMP and take mine. I’ll 
                        do the rest of the recording. 

           Harry collects Francis’ AMP with his free hand. He heads for 
           the door. 

           Francis follows him out.

           EXT. BAYSWATER FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           Harry heads towards his car, he can feel Francis watching 
           him. He opens the boot and slides in the AMP. As he gets in 
           the car he opens the glove box. He drops the plaster in it.

           Francis watches Harry from the front door and Harry drives 
           off. 
           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           It’s the small hours and the office is deserted save for 
           Francis. 

           He sits at his desk listening to Simmons’ murder. It’s a 
           symphony of screams. 

           Francis eyes are drawn over to Diane’s office door.

           He leaves Simmons’ sobbing and walks towards the door. 

           He produces a key, opens it and goes inside.

           INT. DIANE ALDER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           The desk lamp is the only light source. An AMP is all set up, 
           ready to listen. 

           Francis sits behind Diane’s desk going through her diary. 

           He finally finds what he’s looking for: Harry’s last 
           appointment - 9am Wednesday 15th.   

           Francis walks over to his machine. He starts rewinding, as 
           fast as it can go.

           The hours drop away, the date turns back to 15. The clock 
           goes to 9 am. Francis hits play.

                        A milestone.

                                 DIANE ALDER (AMP)
                        So what do you want to talk about? 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (AMP)
                        It’s daft.

           Francis listens hard, willing a confession.

                                 HARRY ORWELL  (AMP) (CONT’D)
                        I lied before... when I said I 
                        wasn’t having nightmares.

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           The TV blares, and all the lights are on. Every effort has 
           been made to make this place hostile to sleep.  Harry sits in 
           an uncomfortable chair, he stares at the screen.
           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - MORNING

           The morning light cuts through the blinds, Kate enters and 
           walks to her desk. She stops dead when she spots Francis, 
           waiting for her. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I need you to listen to this. 

           There is a seriousness to him that makes her comply without 
           question. She sits and pulls on headphones. Francis hits 
           play.

                                 DIANE (AMP)
                        -playing out this moment, trying to 
                        make sense of it. Trying to make 
                        sense of your feelings of 
                        inaction...

           Kate looks at Francis confused. 

                                 DIANE ALDER (AMP)
                        It’s a stress response to what you 
                        have to deal with daily. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (AMP)
                        I dreamed the girl was Emily, the 
                        bartender.

                                 DIANE ALDER (AMP)
                        You’re subconscious adapting to new 
                        information. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (AMP)
                        I dreamed it was her, before she 
                        was killed.

           Kate pulls off her headphones. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        What is this?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Orwell’s sessions with Doctor 
                        Alder.

           Kate is livid.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Kate, he dreamed of killing Emily 
                        Kinsella before she was murdered.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                            (disbelief)
                        You listened to private sessions 
                        with a psychologist...
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Diane records them on tape.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Jesus Christ, and she just lets you 
                        listen? You have to come off of the 
                        investigation. 

           Francis stands.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You won’t even consider him!

           Kate grows stern.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Detective-

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Kate, I don’t want to believe 
                        either, but how much longer can we 
                        deny the evidence. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Detective Mallory. Go home.  

           Francis stares at her, he’s livid. But he can see she won’t 
           budge. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I haven’t done anything wrong.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’m afraid you actually believe 
                        that. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - MORNING

           Harry, zombie-like, but still awake is sitting in front of 
           the TV. His phone rings - Kate. He looks for the remote and 
           mutes the TV.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Hi.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (V.O.)
                        I need to put you on leave. 

           Harry stares at the silent TV screen.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Right.  
           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Just until we can clear this up.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (V.O.)
                        Of course.

           Kate can hear his fear.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’m sorry I got you into this.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (V.O.)
                        I was the one that asked for the 
                        job.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I will make it right, I will get 
                        you cleared and re-instated.  

           Harry doesn’t reply.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        Are you still there?

                                 HARRY ORWELL (V.O.)
                        Yeah.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Are you okay?

                                 HARRY ORWELL (V.O.)
                        Yeah.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’m sorry.

           He’s gone before she can say anything else. Kate sits down 
           the phone. 

           She pulls on her headphones and hits play.

                                 DIANE ALDER (AMP)
                        Tell me about the most recent one?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m sitting on a couch or I’m 
                        waiting. And a girl, Melanie Leah, 
                        she a victim from a case of mine. 

           Kate looks ill.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        She’s there. And she’s attacked. 
                        And I can’t stop...
           INT. AUDIO FORENSICS DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Francis gathers up the files on his desk. A photo of Simmons 
           stares up at him. He stares down at it. 

           Francis quickly flips the photo, as Getty’s voice breaks a 
           little. 

                                 GETTY
                        Have you listened to it?

           Francis shakes his head sadly.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        We’ve not finished collecting it.

           Francis puts his hand on Getty’s shoulder, Getty is 
           crumbling. 

                                 GETTY
                            (breaking, horrified.)
                        Is it long?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        When we have it, you can do what 
                        ever you want.

           Getty stares up at Francis.

                                 GETTY
                        I don’t ever want to hear it. It 
                        will ruin her. 

           Francis reaches into Getty’s jacket pocket. He pulls out 
           Getty’s car keys. 

           Getty grabs Francis’ arm, he’s incredibly strong.

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        She thought Orwell was the 
                        killer... Do you? 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Go home. Sober up.

           Getty lets him go.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           INT. COMMANDER MASON’S OFFICE RECEPTION - AFTERNOON

           A grand and regal reception room. Tall windows and marble 
           floors.  

           A uniformed RECEPTIONIST is busy on the phone. Francis sits 
           in a waiting chair. He’s growing impatient. 
           Receptionist, 20s  brunette, pretty, finishes her call and 
           Francis leaps at the chance. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Do you know how much longer?

           She looks at him haughtily.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        No. If you had an appointment, I 
                        would. 

           Francis stares at the her darkly.  He sits back down. 

           The doors open, Commander Mason arrives back from lunch.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        Sir, I have a couple of telephone 
                        calls you need to return.

           Mason spots Francis, he sighs.

                                 SUPT MASON
                        Mallory.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Hello Sir. I wondered if I might 
                        speak with you.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        The calls are urgent sir.

           Francis stares at the girl with malice.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’ll be brief. 

           Mason beacons Francis to follow him. 

           INT. COMMANDER MASON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A grand office that puts Kate’s to shame. An expanse of desk 
           sits in the middle of the room. Three massive windows flood 
           it with light. It’s the kind of room the Empire was planned 
           in. 

           Francis waits for Mason to sit before he begins.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’m sorry to take up time 
                        unscheduled like this-

                                 MASON
                        Get on with it, suspects? Have you 
                        got someone in custody?
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        No, well, We’ve hit a bit of a 
                        roadblock. Sir, it’s with my 
                        superior. 

           Mason smiles, there’s malice in it.

                                 MASON
                        What about her?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I am concerned that she isn’t 
                        capable of being objective with 
                        regards to the recent murders... 
                        Evidence is mounting up against a 
                        suspect. She refuses to see reason. 

           Mason laughs, it’s a little forced.

                                 MASON
                        Are you here to make a formal 
                        complaint? 

           Francis shakes his head.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        No, sir. Nothing formal. It’s just 
                        that last time I was in the room 
                        with both of you, you mentioned a 
                        régime change...  

           Mason eyes up Francis, carefully evaluating him. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I wondered how I might earn my spot 
                        in the new world order.

                                 MASON
                        Reynolds has firm supporters. And 
                        to be frank, you have bigger things 
                        to worry about than who your boss 
                        is. 

           Francis looks worried, he’s played his hand and has nothing 
           else. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I understand sir, it’s just. Three 
                        women have been killed. One of them 
                        was my friend. And I can’t 
                        investigate. I’ve been removed from 
                        the case by her, because she 
                        doesn’t like where the evidence 
                        points.

                                 MASON
                        What do you want from me?
           Francis chooses carefully.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I was hoping for your guidance... 
                        How could I be reinstated on the 
                        case?

                                 MASON
                        Look for support outside of your 
                        department. 

           Francis beams, it is exactly what he wanted to hear.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Have someone from homicide approach 
                        me with a request. I’ll push it 
                        through. 

           INT. DIANE ALDER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Diane sits at the kitchen table, trying to read, but the 
           sound of her buzzer keeps cutting through the flat. 

           She grits her teeth and ignores it. 

           It buzzes again, for longer this time. It’s driving her to 
           distraction.

           She stands and walks to the handset. It buzzes constantly. 
           About to rip it off of the wall when it stops. The silence 
           washes over her. The aggression fades out of her with a deep 
           exhale. 

           She walks back to the table. 

           The phone rings. 

           Her anger rises again, but she ignores it’s incessant 
           ringing. It clicks over on to answer machine.  

                                 DIANE ALDER (TELEPHONE)
                        You’re through to Diane, sorry I 
                        can’t speak right now, please leave 
                        a message. 

           Diane turns the page refusing to let the machine steal her 
           concentration.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (TELEPHONE)
                        Di... Please speak to me. I know 
                        you’re in. I can see your shadow on 
                        the blinds... just speak to me...

           Diane can’t help but be drawn in.
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I’m worried. I’m worried something 
                        is going to happen to you. I don’t 
                        what I would do if anything 
                        happened to you... I just want to 
                        explain, I’ll leave you alone 
                        after, just please let me in.

           She walks over to the door, she buzzes him in.

           She listens as he bounds up the stairs. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                            (out of breath)
                        Thanks.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You broke into my office.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        It was open. 

           Diane walks away form him, she’s angry.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        It wasn’t. You’ve destroyed any 
                        trust I had with the whole 
                        department. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Nobody has to know.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Of course they do. 

           Francis follows her.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’m not sorry.

           Diane wheels round, she’s livid. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        That’s the worst of it. You don’t 
                        think you’ve done anything wrong.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’m trying to stop people getting 
                        murdered. If I had of listened 
                        before Simmons, I would never of 
                        left her alone with him.

           Diane pales a little at the ‘him’

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        You don’t know-

           Francis grabs her arms.
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        No I don’t, but tell me he’s 
                        incapable of that. 

           She can’t.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I need you to talk to Kate. Tell 
                        her to just consider it. She’ll 
                        listen to you. 

           Diane pushes him away. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        She won’t.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        It’s only going to get worse. You 
                        need to do this.

           Diane won’t look at him.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        You’d be helping him too you 
                        know... 

           Diane won’t budge, Francis heads for the door, disappointed. 

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Where are you going? 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Where do you think?

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Harry’s head is drooping, he’s nodding off. Empty energy 
           drinks lie everywhere. Suddenly he comes too. He stands, 
           clumsy on his feet from the lack of sleep. 

           He puts his head under the kitchen tap.

           EXT. HARRY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Francis’s car sits with the lights out. Francis is watching 
           Harry’s front door. 

           The sound system plays Harry’s therapy sessions.

                                 DIANE ALDER
                        Tell me about the most recent one?

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I’m sitting on a couch or I’m 
                        waiting. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT'D)
                        And a girl, Melanie Leah, she’s a 
                        victim from a case of mine...
                        She’s there. And she’s attacked. 
                        And I can’t stop.

           INT. HOMICIDE OFFICES - DAY

           The office is a buzz. Francis enters and spots Edwards. She 
           looks older, stressed, as she collects files from the wall. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        We need to speak.

                                 EDWARDS
                        I’m not touching anything from your 
                        department with a twenty foot pole. 
                        The investigations are separate.  

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        It’s not from my department...

           Edwards is intrigued, she drops the folders on her desk, and 
           waits for what Francis has to say. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        I’ve not got time to waste.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Somewhere private. 

           INT. SCOTLAND YARD CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Edwards struggles with a coffee vending machine as Francis 
           looks around anxiously.

                                 EDWARDS
                        What is it?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Is this your idea of private?

                                 EDWARDS
                        The coffee is terrible, no one 
                        comes down here.  

           Francis has another scan.

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        Mallory, for fuck’sake.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        What if I made a mistake on my 
                        earlier testimony?

                                 EDWARDS
                        What mistake?
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’m not sure I put Orwell in a 
                        taxi.

           Edwards forgets the rotten coffee, she concentrates on 
           Francis.

                                 EDWARDS
                        How are you not sure?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I was, until the other night, Getty 
                        told me I put him in a taxi...

                                 EDWARDS
                        You need to recant your statement.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I want on the case.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Not a chance.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I’m not sure, and I’m not going to 
                        blindly hand him over to you. You 
                        just want to close it.  

           She can’t deny it.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Recant your statement. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Not without a place on the 
                        investigation.

           Edwards is frustrated.

                                 EDWARDS
                        To give your pal a fair shot; or to 
                        get your name in the paper? 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Fuck you.

           Francis walks away.

                                 EDWARDS
                        Wait, I’ll speak to Mason. But I 
                        can’t make any promises. In the 
                        mean time recant so I can hold him. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I need to be sure. 
           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - DAY

           Harry paces his flat, the blinds are drawn and all the lights 
           are on. Music plays in every room, the TV is on full volume. 
           It is a mess of sound. 

           Out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of Simmons. 
           She’s lying dead on the floor. 

           When he turns to look at her she’s gone. 

           Amidst the sound his phone is going; ringing on the table. 

           Harry pick it up, the sound drowns out the caller.

           He can’t find the remote, he pulls the plugs - silence. He 
           sits.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yeah?

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (TELEPHONE)
                        Just checking in.

           Harry looks around, he spots a clock, it’s 4 am.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Why are you calling so late?

           Kate’s pause filters down the line.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (TELEPHONE)
                        Harry, it’s the afternoon. 

           Harry looks back at the clock, he stares at the light gapping 
           through the blinds. It makes sense. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll come by after work, get food?

           Harry’s eyes dart wild, he’s afraid.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                            (quickly)
                        No. I don’t want to go out. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’ll bring something. 

           Emily’s body lies by his foot. He blinks it away.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I don’t want anyone here.

           Sitting is making him drift.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I’m trying-
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        I know. I’ve got go.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Call me later. 

           Harry hangs up and pulls open his blinds. Light floods the 
           room. Outside he can see Francis’ car. 

           Harry walks away from the window. He’s getting so heavy. He 
           forces his eyes open.  He walks to the bathroom and runs the 
           shower. 

           I/E. FRANCIS’ CAR - HARRY’S FLAT - EVENING

           It’s growing dark, Francis stares through the ever building 
           condensation on his car windows. Harry’s lights are on. 

           Francis’ eyes strain in the twilight as he looks at the crime 
           scene photos from Simmons’ house. 

           He thumbs through them and reaches the ones form the 
           bathroom. He stalls over one: in the mirror he can see the 
           reflection of Harry; staring at the ground. 

           Francis sorts out the other bathroom photos. In all of them 
           Harry is staring at the same spot. Francis turns on the 
           interior light, he pours over the bathroom photos. 

           He stops. He’s found it. 

           Francis looks at the photograph, in it you can clearly see a 
           plaster. 

           He looks up at Harry’s flat. There’s triumph on his face. He 
           starts his engine, he pulls away. 

           INT. HOMICIDE OFFICES - MORNING

           Edwards drags herself into the office, a massive cup of 
           coffee in hand. 

           Francis is already there, waiting for her. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Tell me you’re recanting.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Better. 

           He pulls out the crime scene photograph of the bathroom. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Have that plaster analysed asap, 
                        it’ll have his DNA on it. It will 
                        place him at the scene. 
           Edwards looks at the photograph.

                                 EDWARDS
                        There was no plaster.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        What?

                                 EDWARDS
                        I’ve been through the evidence 
                        logs, no plasters, nothing like 
                        that. 

           Francis looks frustrated. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        He took it, I knew he had 
                        something.

                                 EDWARDS
                        He shouldn’t have been at the scene 
                        in the first place.

           Francis is lost in thought.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        No. 

           INT. HARRY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Harry lies on top of his bed, there’s blood on the pillow; a 
           dried wound on the side of his head. Everything in the house 
           is on. Music and TV sounds drift in from the living room. 

           The shower is still going. 

           He slowly comes too, the blood is all he sees. 

           He backs off of the bed, there’s too much sound he can’t 
           think. 

           He heads for the bathroom.

           INT. HARRY’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The whole room is steam. There’s blood on the shower wall. 
           Blood in the sink. Harry wipes the mirror, his hairline at 
           the side is caked with dried blood, it’s going black and 
           blue. 

           Harry stares around the room. There’s a lot of blood, more 
           than just his. 
           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - LATER

           Harry washes he dried blood off, he pulls open the blinds. 

           No one is outside. No one has been watching him. 

           He’s starting to hyperventilate.

           EXT. HARRY’S FLAT - LATER

           Harry’s pulled on the first clothes that have come to hand, 
           he’s heading for his car when he spots her. Helen Templeton 
           is sitting in her car. 

           He stalks over to her, she spots the gash on his head, she 
           looks concerned. 

           She won’t roll down her window. Harry talks through it.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Were you here last night?

           He looks wild. Helen instinctively goes for her phone, he can 
           see she’s calling 999. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        I just want to know if you were 
                        here? 

           Helen doesn’t answer him. He hits the glass. 

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        Did I leave?

           She’s speaking on the phone now. His panic rises.

                                 HARRY ORWELL (CONT’D)
                        Did I leave?

           He’s not going to get an answer, he turns and heads back 
           inside. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER

           His phone is ringing, Harry jogs back into the flat, and 
           searches for it.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Kate?

           There is a pause down the line.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (TELEPHONE)
                        Orwell. It’s Francis.

           Harry feels the blood draining out of his head.
                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Yes?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (TELEPHONE)
                        There’s been another girl found.

           Harry sinks to the floor. Francis waits, listening for a 
           reaction.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY  (TELEPHONE) (CONT’D)
                        We don’t know if it’s the same as 
                        the others. I want you to on the 
                        scene.

                                 HARRY ORWELL
                        Why?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (TELEPHONE)
                        I’ll text you the address. 

           Harry lets the phone slip down. He can’t seem to get up. 

           EXT. NOTTING HILL STREET - MORNING

           Harry’s car pulls up to the scene, he’s in pieces and not 
           quite managing to hold it all together. 

           It’s quieter than normal, no coroners van. He’s the first of 
           rank on scene. 

           He pulls his AMP from the passenger seat and heads towards 
           the UNIFORM at the door. 

           Harry flashes his ID and is shown inside. 

           INT. NOTTING HILL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house is cluttered, over filled with women’s clothes. A 
           uniform hangs on the back of the door. She’s an officer. 
           Harry takes it in. Furniture up ended, blood on the floor.   

           The body is still there. A pretty brunette, no more than 25. 
           Gagged, throat slit. Tears have dried on her face leaving 
           rivulets of mascara down her temples.  

           Harry stands over her, helpless. 

           He cracks open his AMP and begins to set up. 

           Francis is there before Harry finishes. 

           He blows into the room, there’s a ferocity to him. 

           He looks at the girl, his eyes grow cold.
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Don’t you recognise her? 

           Harry can barely look at Francis.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        She works with us. 

           Francis turns, he kneels down to be on Harry’s level. Francis 
           spots the gash on Harry’s head. 

           He walks out. 

           EXT. NOTTING HILL STREET - DAY

           Francis stops a team of SOCOs on their way into the scene. He 
           points to Harry’s car.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Get into the glove box. 

           INT. NOTTING HILL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Harry scans through the last twenty-four hours. He’s getting 
           nothing but screams. So many, he can’t tell who they belong 
           to anymore. A whole symphony has been composed of them. 

           He pulls off the headphones, somewhere a car alarm is going 
           off. 

           His car. 

           He walks over to the window. The door to his car is being 
           slim-jimed open. A team of SOCOs in bunny suits are all over 
           it. 

           Harry watches on as Francis points to the glove box.

           A commotion has kicked up near the boot. Edwards watches as a 
           bag is pulled out. It’s the tool bag Harry threw away days 
           ago. Harry pales. 

           The sweat is pooling at the back of his neck as a hand 
           reaches in to the glove box: the plaster is retrieved.  

           Francis turns and looks towards the house. He spots Harry in 
           the window. He’s coming for him.

           Harry’s breathing hard, he grabs his AMP, shoves it into it’s 
           box. He can hear Francis’ heavy footsteps on the stoop. 

           Clunk, he shuts the AMP. He’s halfway to the back door when 
           he hears the front door swing open. It’s fight or flight, and 
           Harry is flying.  
           EXT. BACK GARDEN NOTTING HILL HOUSE -  CONTINUOUS

           Harry’s over the wall, AMP scraping and clunking as swings 
           over. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (O.C.)
                        He’s over there.

           Harry runs through the stranger’s garden, pure instinct 
           leading him. He rushes along the hedge, stray branches 
           leaving him with a few nasty scratches.

           He boots in a rotting wooden door to-

           EXT. LANE - CONTINUOUS

           He goes left, blood pumping as he takes great strides over 
           the cobbles. 

           He can hear officers in the garden near to him. The buzz of 
           walkie talkies. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (O.C.)
                            (out of breath)
                        I want cars on that lane-

           Sirens are closing in, it’s impossible to tell what direction 
           they’re coming from.  

                                 EDWARDS (O.C.) 
                        Air support to my location. 

           Harry’s about to round the corner when he hears the rotting 
           door slam open.  

           He’s gone as Francis pauses on the cobbles.  

           Francis looks from left to right. He goes right. 

           EXT. NOTTING HILL ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Harry bounds across an intersection, on the road parallel he 
           can see crowds of people and buses.  

           He takes the next road leading over to it. Slowing his pace 
           as he reaches - 

           EXT. BUSY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A busy, tourist ridden street. Portobello on a Saturday; 
           packed and slow moving. Harry works to control his panting as 
           he skims past people. 

           He scans the road behind him. Uniformed officers have 
           arrived, they cut channels through the crowds. 
           Harry’s phone is ringing, but the sound is swallowed by the 
           crowd.  

           He searches for an escape route, but blue lights are filling 
           up the streets that lead away.  

           Helicopters pump overhead.

           Black police hats bob around in the crowd. 

           Harry’s eye darts to a bus.

           He pushes forward to the bus stop. 

           Two police hats are heading towards it from the other 
           direction. Harry can see them through little gaps in the 
           crowd.

           He stands at the bus stop, dropping his AMP to his feet, he 
           puts his back to the officers and becomes a statue, sipping 
           in breaths to his burning lungs.  

           They’re getting closer, moving against the flow of people. 
           Eyes searching faces. 

           Harry watches as the bus clicks on it’s indicator. It slowly 
           pulls in. 

           He resists the urge to look at the uniforms. Slowly he 
           collects his AMP and steps up onto

           INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

           The door close behind him, he takes care to hold his AMP low, 
           keeping it out of the eye level of people on the street.  

           There are empty seats but he goes upstairs. 

           Harry sits near the back, AMP under his seat. He stares 
           straight ahead and takes deep breaths. 

           He can hear a helicopter over head, the other passengers peer 
           out with interest. Harry doesn’t look. 

           His phone rings, it’s Kate. He puts it on silent.

           The bus pulls away. 

           EXT. HARRY’S FLAT - LATER

           An incident unit is massing outside of Harry’s flat. Edwards 
           is in charge, Detective Getty stands next to her, withdrawn 
           and quiet.
                                 EDWARDS
                        I want to concentrate on the nights 
                        of the murders in particular. I 
                        want the times he leaves and the 
                        times he returns. To. The. Second.

                                 GETTY
                        Yeah.

           Kate approaches, Getty stares through her. 

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        Getty. 

           He turns and heads into Harry’s house without uttering a 
           word. 

           Edwards turns to Kate, smug. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        This is a closed scene.

           Kate hands Edwards a key.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS
                        I came to give you this, save you 
                        putting the door in.

           Edwards doesn’t take it.

                                 EDWARDS
                        No thanks. 

           Edwards moves off to bark more commands. Kate checks her 
           phone again. Nothing.

           Francis arrives, he blows right past Kate without a word. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        We lost him on Portabello, I’ve put 
                        out a description. The press are 
                        hungry, will I give it to them too?

           Edwards nods to Francis.

           Kate is riddled with despair, she turns and walks away. 

           INT. HARRY’S FLAT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Getty is paused outside Harry’s front door, he looks ill. 
           Francis thunders up the stairs behind him. 

           He looks at the paralysed Getty. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Innocent people don’t run. 
           Getty is the shell of a man, he stares at Francis. Francis 
           gives the go ahead to the SOCOs, they begin to batter down 
           Harry’s front door.  Getty winces at each bang, Francis 
           stares on coiled and angry.  

           The door cracks off of it’s hinges and splits. The SOCOs move 
           in, Francis is right behind them. Getty still won’t move.

                                 GETTY
                        I just can’t see how...

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        We will never understand it. But we 
                        can get the fucker. 

           Getty nods, a grit of his teeth and he’s though the door. 

           I/E. BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

           Harry’s head rocks gently against the window. He’s asleep.

                                 DRIVER
                        ALL CHANGE. 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Harry disembarks the bus on a quiet street. AMP in tow, he 
           picks a direction and walks in it.  

           His phone is buzzing, calls from numbers he doesn’t 
           recognise. 

           He’s got a heft of voicemails. He hits play on the first one.

                                 GETTY (TELEPHONE)
                        Orwell. We need to speak. I need 
                        you to call me. I want to know wh- 

           Harry cuts it off.

           He sees voicemails from Kate. 

           He plays one.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (TELEPHONE)
                        It’s me. You need to come in. The 
                        longer you’re out there the worse 
                        it gets. I can help you, we’ll sort 
                        this. Even if you did- Come in. Or 
                        come to the house. 

           Harry looks at his phone for a long time. He switches it off 
           and drops it down a drain. 
           Harry pulls out his wallet. His travel card, credit cards, 
           licence and an expired military id follow his phone down the 
           drain. He looks in his empty wallet. He’s got £20.

           INT. HOMICIDE OFFICES - EARLY EVENING

           The strip lights make everyone look like hell. All bustle; 
           the man-hunt is in progress. Francis takes it all in. 

           An officer walks over to him.

                                 OFFICER
                        Can you tell Edwards we’ve got 
                        Orwell’s voicemail open.  

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Where is it?

                                 OFFICER
                        On the server.

           Officer goes back to work. Francis slides over to Edwards’ 
           computer.

           He’s straight into the server. Headphones on he scans down 
           the list of voicemails. He catches a number he recognises.

           Play.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (TELEPHONE)
                        It’s me. You need to come in. The 
                        longer you’re out there the worse 
                        it gets. I can help you, we’ll sort 
                        this. Even if you did- Come in. Or 
                        come to the house. 

           Francis smiles. 

           EXT. KATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A well-to-do street, leafy and quiet. A little newsagent’s 
           window floods the dark street opposite with light. Harry 
           crosses over he wants to remain in the darker side.  He’s 
           shivering in just his shirt, arms tired from carrying the 
           AMP. He’s been walking for hours. 

           He slows as he looks for Kate’s house. A couple exiting the 
           newsagent startle him, they’re in their own world and walk 
           off with out looking at him.

           He spots Kate’s place, the lights are off. He slips open the 
           gate and quietly heads towards the door. 
           INT. KATE’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry pushes the kitchen door open. He drops his AMP. 

           He can’t do anything to stop the choked sobs that wheeze out 
           of him. 

           We’ve been here before. It’s the kitchen from the opening 
           scene.

           Everything is exactly the same: dark, save for the soft glow 
           of the street lamps seeping in; dishes in the sink; the bin 
           over filled.

           The body on the floor. We can see the face now, her face.

           It’s Kate.

           Harry walks over to her slowly, white as a sheet with red-
           rimmed eyes, his world collapsing. 

           Kate’s blonde hair, matted red with blood. She’s very dead. 
           It’s a messy scene. There’s a blood spurt that streaks the 
           wall. 

           Something in Harry kicks in; he collects the AMP abandoned by 
           the door.    

           Harry sets the AMP down by her, inches from the congealing 
           pool of deep red. Harry places a microphone near the body, 
           another three are spread around the room. He flicks a switch 
           and a long tone cuts through the room, then after a beat the 
           audio meters spring to life:

           They sway in the silent room. 

           Harry pulls on the headphones, we hear what he does: a 
           cacophony of sounds, everything all at once.

           He pushes rewind, the sound squeaks backwards. Play: Harry 
           hears sobs, they are his own. 

           He holds rewind for longer. 

           Play.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (AMP)
                            (tainted with fear)
                        Don’t do this-

           Harry listens on, he can hear a struggle. 

           Her screams. The clatter as the two bodies crash to the 
           floor. The scratching of her shoes against the wood as she 
           tries to scramble away. The tearing of fabric as he pulls her 
           back. The thud of her head against the floor. Kate choking as 
           he wraps his hands around her neck. 
           Harry listens to the attacker, to his short, sharp breaths. 

           Harry’s breathing matches it. 

           Her struggling growing softer. 

           He hears her murder. The slicing of the knife across her 
           throat. 

           The metallic thud as it falls to where it now lies.

           It’s all getting a bit to much for Harry. He looks like he 
           might throw up as he gropes around for the stop button. 

           He freezes when he hears her drag in a ragged breath. She’s 
           trying to say something; he listens harder. She speaks, slow, 
           raspy and thick.

                                 KATE REYNOLDS (AMP) (CONT’D)
                            Harry-

           Dread seeps across him. He listens as she tries to form more 
           words, but her voice has given out. Harry stares at her still 
           lips.

           He hits the button. Everything stops.

           Harry sits in the muffled silence his headphones offer. 

           Behind him another door opens: the bathroom.  Francis emerges 
           into the half light. He takes in the scene.

           Francis moves into Harry’s eyeline. The two look at each 
           other silently. 

           Francis takes out his handcuffs. Harry puts his arms behind 
           his back.

           He stares at Kate’s lifeless form, waiting on the snapping of 
           the cuffs.

           Francis bends down behind him. He picks up the stanley knife.

           He slits Harry’s throat. 

           Harry sees the blood cascading down his shirt. His hands go 
           to the wound. 

           Harry tries to speak but blood is pouring out of his mouth. 
           It forms shapes but there’s no air, no sound. 

           He’s heading towards the ground. Harry’s eyes find Francis, 
           who stares down at him with something that looks like 
           victory. 
           The last little bit of life seeps out of Harry, as his blood 
           stretches across the floor. 

                                                            HARD CUT.

           INT. OLD BAILEY COURTROOM - DAY

           A COURT AIDE hits stop on a large audio player. The JURY sit 
           quietly, reeling from what they’ve just heard. 

                                 COURT AIDE
                        DCI Francis Mallory expert witness 
                        for the prosecution. 

           Francis gets on the stand. A BARRISTER, late 30s, austere and 
           strict. Greets him with a nod.

                                 BARRISTER
                        Detective Chief Inspector Mallory. 
                        Can you please explain to the jury 
                        what we’ve just heard.

           He turns to the jury, he’s quite magnetic. It’s packed with 
           press. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Yes, you were listening to audio-
                        forensic evidence. That is, sound 
                        evidence of a murder, gathered 
                        after the crime. 

                                 BARRISTER
                        So we are hearing the crime?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Yes. You are listening to the 
                        crime. 

                                 BARRISTER
                        And you are qualified in audio-
                        forensics?

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I am the head of the Metropolitan 
                        Police Audio-Forensics Department. 

           INT. KATE’S OFFICE - DAY

           All of Kate’s personal touches are gone, they’ve been 
           replaced by Francis’ things. It’s Francis’ office now. 

           Francis sits behind the desk, outside, in the hive the 
           department bustles at full strength. Francis watches on, he 
           looks utter bored. 

           A new DETECTIVE passes his window. A pretty, young, brunette. 
           His eyes follow her, with dark eyes. They trail her all the 
           way to the door and out of sight. He looks like there’s an 
           itch he can’t scratch.

           The boredom returns. Francis gets up and closes over his 
           door. There’s a lightness to his step as he moves back behind 
           the desk. He unlocks his desk drawer and pulls out an AMP 
           hard drive. He plugs it in. 

           He pulls on his headphones.

           Play. 

           A symphony of screams fills his head. Everyone is there: 
           Melanie, Emily, Simmons, The Receptionist.

           Francis’ pupils dilate, the rest of the world has fallen 
           away. The smile practically splits his face, he’s in ecstasy. 

           He looks above his screen to see Edwards standing in front of 
           him. She watches him.

           Her lips move, he can’t hear her.

           He pulls off his headphones.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Pardon?

                                 EDWARDS
                        I said, what are you doing?

           Francis observes her, trying to determine how much she’s 
           seen.

                                 EDWARDS (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t tell me Getty has been 
                        on to you.

           Francis eye’s dart up to Edwards. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        About what?

           Edwards rolls her eyes. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        Simmons heard a phone vibrating 
                        during the Emily Kinsella murder, 
                        she phoned Getty, left a message 
                        about it the night she was killed. 
                        Harry’s phone records don’t show a 
                        call that matches...

           Francis sighs.
                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        So he had another phone and dumped 
                        it too. 

                                 EDWARDS
                        That’s what I said... Have a word?

           Francis plasters a smile on his face. Edwards stands and 
           heads for the door. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Will do. 

           Edwards leaves. Francis stares out at the office, thin lipped 
           and angry. Detective Getty isn’t there.  

           The pretty, brunette detective walks by again, his eyes 
           devour her.

           INT. FRANCIS’ FLAT - NIGHT

           A stunning, yet cold flat. Open plan, everything has a place 
           and there are no personal touches.  The only thing which 
           stands out is the Amp, set up in the centre of the room. 

           Keys twist in the lock, Francis swings the door open and 
           walks in. He stalls when he catches the Amp. 

           Getty is sitting watching the door, perfectly still. Francis 
           clocks him. After a beat he reacts.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Bloody hell. What are you doing?

           Getty stares at him. Thinner, paler, dark bags under his 
           eyes, Getty looks like he caught whatever Harry had. 

           Francis shuts the door and drops his coat. He walks over to 
           the kitchen. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Do you want something to drink? 

           Getty still doesn’t speak. 

           Francis pours himself a glass of water. His glance falls on 
           the block of kitchen knives. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Diane spoke to me about you. She 
                        said she was concerned. You might 
                        not be very well... 

           Francis positions himself next to the knives.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        She thinks you need time off...
           Getty shakes his head.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        A couple of months to get yourself 
                        right? 

           Francis mask of calm is slipping.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t say something soon 
                        you’re going to make me awfully 
                        nervous. 

           Getty rises up, he’s still a large, powerful man. Francis 
           sizes him up.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Harry was the killer.

                                 GETTY
                        He was in his flat for the first 
                        murder. I could hear him sleeping.

           Francis smiles sadly.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        He knew how to play the machine. He 
                        left the TV on loud to cover up his 
                        movements. He could have been 
                        playing a recording of someone 
                        sleeping.  

           Getty rubs his head with his hands, trying to get himself 
           together.

                                 GETTY
                        You lied about your alibi for the 
                        murders. You weren’t here. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        I was with Diane. 

           Getty shakes a little to violently.

                                 GETTY
                        I checked that too... 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        You’re not well.

                                 GETTY
                        After each of the murders you came 
                        back here, and you’re happy. You 
                        shower and you scrub and bin bags 
                        rustle and I can hear you.

           Getty moves a little towards Francis. 
                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        I see you. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        Tell it to Edwards, if you’re so 
                        sure I’m a murder tell her... Or 
                        have you already?

           Getty stares at him darkly.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Let me guess Edwards told you to 
                        drop it? 

           He doesn’t answer.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry but you’ve lost the 
                        fucking plot, and it’s time to go. 

           Francis points to the door.

                                 GETTY
                        I’ve seen your phone records. 

           Francis stops still, he looks at Getty. 

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got you. 

           Francis considers for a long beat.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                            (Goading)
                        You’ve lost touch with reality, 
                        what is your plan here, to arrest 
                        me? Go ahead.

           Getty smiles, it’s more a bearing of teeth. Utterly primal.

                                 GETTY
                        I’m not going to arrest you. 

           Francis reaches up to the butchers block and extracts a 
           knife. He’s not hiding what he is. He looks evil. 

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        You’ll only get that in once. 

           Getty advances on Francis, Francis rams the long blade home, 
           aiming for Getty’s throat, but missing and driving it down 
           into his chest.  

           Getty keeps going at him, he throttles Francis, crushing his 
           neck. 

           Francis twists the blade handle. Getty’s grip on Francis’s 
           loosens.
           Francis twists it the other way. Getty drops to his knees. 

           He coughs up blood. 

           Francis wheezes in a breath, he smiles down at the wounded 
           Getty. 

                                 GETTY (CONT’D)
                        They will listen to this and they 
                        will know that you are a murderer. 
                        That you killed Simmons.

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY
                        They’ll never listen to this.

           Francis smiles. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        They won’t even find your body.  

           Francis pulls the blade out of Getty’s chest, blood spurts 
           everywhere. 

                                 FRANCIS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                            (evil)
                        Out of all of them, I like 
                        listening to Simmons the most. That 
                        gag, the way she kept screaming 
                        through it... Really did something 
                        to me... 

           Getty harnesses his hate and tackles Francis to the ground, 
           They fall behind the kitchen island. Obscured from our view.

           We can hear as Getty savagely beats Francis. Getty is 
           screaming, full of hate and despair.  

           His bloodied hand reaches up on the counter top, it snatches 
           the glass, we listen as it crunches into Francis. 

           Getty keeps stabbing him with it, screams turning into sobs. 

           He doesn’t stop. 

           INT. HOMICIDE OFFICES - LATER

           Edwards sits by her desk, mountains of paperwork neglected as 
           she reads an article about herself on line. The by line 
           reads: ‘by Helen Templeton’. Edwards is clearly very pleased. 

           Her phone rings, she ignores it. 

           The door to her office is pushed open, she’s caught a little 
           off guard. Sergeant stands in the door way.

                                 EDWARDS
                        What?
                                 SERGEANT
                        Double homicide just called in. 

                                 THE END.
