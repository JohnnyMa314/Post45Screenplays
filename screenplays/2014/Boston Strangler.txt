           INT. 77 GAINSBOROUGH ST. - BACK BAY, BOSTON - DUSK 

           Rust-stained water splashes into a tub and down the 
           drain. The pipes CREAK, SHUDDER, MOAN and the water runs 
           clear--the red water diffuses, the clean water STAINS. 

           ANNA SLESSERS (55)--dark-haired, youthful, looks intact--
           sits on the tub, rolling her STOCKINGS down, one by one. 
           Checking for runs, she hangs them on a rack by the door.  

           TIME STAMP: JUNE 14th, 1962. 

           A spring breeze lifts a set of cheesecloth curtains and 
           carries in the SOUND of CHILDREN playing nearby. Under 
           the window, a needle is carefully placed on a hi-fi and-- 

           Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde begins to play. 

           Humming, hugging her robe about herself, Slessers closes 
           her eyes and dances--and abruptly stops, as if HEARING...  

           TAP-TAP-TAP...

           Slessers places an ear to her DOOR--TAP-TAP-TAP--and 
           cautiously slides the CHAIN onto its hook. Cracking the 
           door, something’s said to her and she nods, agreeably. 
           Slessers removes the chain and guides her visitor into--

           THE BATHROOM

           -and shuts off the water. The faucet drips rhythmically 
           into the tub. Slessers turns back to her visitor and--

                                 ANNA SLESSERS
                        See, this is the problem--

           -is SMASHED OFF THE HEAD with a LEAD WEIGHT. She’s yanked 
           off her feet into the hall, a pair of legs scissor-locks 
           hers, a green-jacketed arm wrapping around her throat. 
           She gags, horribly--the muscles in her neck straining, 
           the veins sticking out--and her eyes roll back into her 
           head. They turn pink--the vessels popping one by one. 

           LATER

           A gloved hand pulls Slessers’ stockings off the rack and 
           winds them around her throat--TIGHT, enough so to cut 
           skin. They’re tied off in a DOUBLE-HALF HITCH with a BOW. 

           Slessers robe is thrown open and her blue taffeta 
           housecoat is ripped at the breast, pulled up at the 
           waist. Her panties are torn off, revealing a dark bush. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Slessers’ eyes flutter and despite the garret, her breath 
           still WHEEZES by her lips. Her head begins to loll and 
           her body thrust. She is alive while she’s being raped. 

           LATER

           The hi-fi is turned down and the SQUEALS of the 
           neighborhood kids float back through the window with the 
           breeze. The STRANGLER, silhouetted by the sunset, strips. 

           LATER

           Clad in a LADIES TRENCH COAT, the STRANGLER--black hair; 
           well-built; face never seen--pulls up a chair to 
           Slessers’ ravaged body. At the end of the hall, a breeze 
           turns the curtains and the OLD HANCOCK BUILDING can be 
           seen. The Strangler sits and quietly admires the view. 

           1962 MAGNAVOX CONSOLE TV: CBS EVENING NEWS

           Walter Cronkite looks up from the CBS news desk.

           INT. PARLOR - APARTMENT - EGLESTON SQUARE - DUSK

           A small BOY in OVERALLS walks in front of the TV and 
           takes up post next to his Sister (9) at a bay window. 

                                 JOHN F. KENNEDY (O.S.)
                        ...the enemy of the truth is very 
                        often not the lie: deliberate, 
                        contrived...but the myth...

           They quietly watch a nattily-dressed BLACK MAN flee 
           across the square--and be SHOT six times in the back. 

           INT. BOSTON POLICE HQ - BACK BAY - DUSK

           A PENCIL sketches a body outline on a CRIME SCENE MAP. 
           Writes in the width of doors, windows; labels evidence. 

           DET. BOBBY FARRON (30s)--wire-strong, cold gaze, boyish 
           face--is seated at a wooden desk, painstakingly detailing 
           the map. He never blinks, his concentration fixed, but 
           his lips move silently, as if he were talking to himself.

           He slips. Wincing, he backs off and considers the map. 
           It’s only a slight error. But it clearly bothers him. 
           Furiously, he scrubs the mistake until it’s OBLITERATED. 
           He blows crumbs off the paper, grabs his pencil and--

           The phone rings. Dammit. Farron punches it off the hook.

                        Farron, Homicide. 

           EXT. EGLESTON SQUARE - NIGHT 

           Farron opens the door on his UNMARKED CRUISER, double 
           checks his gear--gold badge, notebook, .38--and climbs 
           out. DET. FRANCIS SULKO (30s)--big, built, good-looking 
           in survivor’s fashion--escorts him through the Square.

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Typical. Got a nigger. 27. DOA. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Negro got a name? 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Yeah. And ya should prepare yaself 
                        for this: Franklin J. Del Pappa. 

           Farron gives him a look, genuinely shocked.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Mayor of Scollay Square?

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Dooley’s been talkin to his queer 
                        informants there in Ward 3. 
                        They’re saying the Mayor’d put a 
                        white boy onna street. Only Opey 
                        hadda admirer, wasn’t keen on it.  

           They arrive at a body covered in a dirty sheet. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Mayor employed Caucasians, huh?

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Oh yeah. He’s an equal opportunity 
                        violator. Practically a civil 
                        rights leader around here. 

           Sulko pulls back the sheet on the body. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Well, like the man said: show me a 
                        hero, I’ll show you a tragedy. 

           Farron kneels, his eyes working over the body, picking up 
           details: six bullet wounds, a single alligator loafer 
           laying in the street, a hole in Del Pappa’s sock...

           DET. TOM DOOLEY (40s)--gut, slick hair, short sleeve 
           collared shirt--walks over. Sulko looks at him. What?

           Sulko glares at Dooley, fighting a smile. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Ya got anything for us, wise ass?

           INT. FARRON’S UNMARKED CRUISER - NIGHT

           Farron and Sulko watch the front of the NAKED I, a club 
           with a neon sign of two spread legs with an EYE over the 
           crotch. A blond-wigged TRANNY walks out, lights a smoke. 
           They watch Dooley cross Washington St. and brace him. 

           EXT. THE NAKED EYE - COMBAT ZONE - CONTINUOUS

           Farron and Sulko cross Washington toward Dooley. 

                                 TOM DOOLEY
                        Georgette says he’s upstairs. Says 
                        He looks like the Presley kid. 

           BACK ALLEY ENTRANCE

           A LOOKOUT (17), talking to a leggy DANCER, sees the three 
           cops coming and tears open the BACK DOOR. But Sulko 
           catches him by the hair and throws him up against a wall. 
           Sulko frisks him, and Farron and Dooley stride into--

           THE NAKED EYE

           Farron and Dooley enter a dark back hall. Ahead, they can 
           see a mob inside watching a REDHEAD on stage dance to--

           Sam Cooke’s “Twisting the Night Away.” 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Farron nods at a darkened alcove and a Bouncer (25) turns 
           a bulb in the ceiling. Stairs are lit up but the Bouncer 
           bars the way. Then Dooley jams a .45 into his crotch.

           LATER

           Farron leads Dooley down a second-story hallway, climbing 
           over a trio of black men nodding out and passing a fat 
           WHORE leaning in a doorway, smoking a spliff, draped in a 
           beaded curtain. At the end of the hall, they find a door 
           outlined in yellow light. Farron eases the door in and-- 

           An ELVIS-looking man (20s) holds a gun to a MAN blowing 
           him. Dooley gently places his .45 against Elvis’s ear. 

                                 TOM DOOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Move and I blow your brains out 
                        all over this cocksucker’s face. 

           Elvis nods, slowly--then books for the REAR WINDOW. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Dooley!

           Farron grabs Dooley’s arm. The .45 goes off into the 
           ceiling and Elvis bolts, crashing out the window onto--

           FIRE ESCAPE

           Farron jumps out after him, scaffold shaking, and watches 
           Elvis land in the alley below. Farron shimmies down the 
           escape ladder and Sulko--.38 drawn--rushes up behind him. 

           WASHINGTON STREET

           Farron and Sulko cut their way through stalled Combat 
           Zone traffic, stalking Elvis down the opposite sidewalk. 
           They see him quickly dart left at the PARAMOUNT and into-- 

           AN ALLEY

           Elvis flings a dumpster in his wake. But Sulko shoulder-
           rams it, spinning it out of the way, and Farron squeezes 
           between the dumpster and the wall. Ahead, Farron sees--

           Elvis rushes out of the alley onto TREMONT STREET and 
           into RUSHING traffic. HORNS HONK. TIRES SCREAM. And--

           Sulko stalls. But Farron, without breaking stride, hits 
           the street. A ‘59 Dodge barely misses him, the Driver 
           HOLLERING. Sulko, catching up now, jabs his gun at him.

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Boston Police, shut the fuck up.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           20 yards ahead, Farron chases Elvis out of the LIGHTS of 
           Tremont and into the darkness of BOSTON COMMON. Huffing, 
           their feet silent on the grass, Farron watches Elvis’ 
           SILHOUETTE break for the EXIT onto CHARLES STREET and-- 

           Farron glides into the street after him, Sulko at his 
           heels. But to their left, a WALL OF TRAFFIC closes in 
           fast. Farron makes the sidewalk but Sulko’s rolled up 
           onto the hood of a Ford. He watches Farron disappear into-

           THE PUBLIC GARDEN 

           Elvis looks back, sees Farron closing and cuts off the 
           foot path. But Farron keeps moving forward. He sprints up 
           the FOOT BRIDGE, finds Elvis hurtling through the knee-
           high SWAN POND, runs up the bridge’s side and leaps, but--

           Elvis ducks his landing. Farron stumbles, and Elvis uses 
           the lead to climb a wrought-iron fence onto Arlington St.

           Farron hurtles over the fence and watches Elvis sprint 
           into an alley to the right of the Arlington St. Church. 
           Farron pulls his .38, lopes across the street and into--

           THE ALLEY

           Panting, Farron turns into the alley and finds it empty. 
           But he spots a low hanging FIRE ESCAPE, and without 
           pause, jumps, pushes off the wall, and pulls himself up.

           THE ROOF

           Farron swings a leg over the side and gently steps onto 
           the gravel. He spots an ENTRY DOOR at the far-side of the 
           building, and raising his .38, approaches cautiously, 
           trying to control his breath. TRAFFIC is the only SOUND.

           Farron reaches the DOOR and finds a lock and chain busted 
           at his feet. Hand shaking, he reaches out and rips open 
           the door--but the inside is empty: just another lock and 
           chain. Defeated, Farron turns and looks out the door onto-

           THE PRUDENTIAL CENTER CONSTRUCTION PROJECT

           A giant hole, a scar of urban renewal, and Elvis fleeing 
           across Boylston St. and lowering himself into the maw.  

           GIANT HOLE IN THE GROUND

           Sulko, gripping his side, finds Farron crossing Boylston 
           St. They walk up to the edge and stare into the darkness.

           INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - BOSTON POLICE HQ - LATER

           Farron sits at his desk and cracks a case file. Somewhere 
           behind him a TELETYPE pounds. Farron looks over, curious.

           LATER

           Farron scans through the TELETYPES, scanning. He stops.

           “MULLEN, MARY. 85. White. Fem. 1435 COMMONWEALTH AVENUE.”

           Curious, Farron checks his file:

           “SLESSERS, ANNA. 55. White. Fem. 77 GAINSBOROUGH...”

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Farron looks back at the teletype: “C.O.D.: Cardiac.” 

           He puts the teletype aside and keeps looking.

           INT. 77 GAINSBOROUGH ST. - BACK BAY, BOSTON - DUSK

           Farron stares at a Rorshach blot of a BLOOD STAIN at the 
           center of a chalk-outlined head, comparing it to a B&W 
           evidence photo of Slessers in the same position. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        At first we thought it was some 
                        sort of abortive suicide, ya know?

                                 FRAN SULKO (O.S.)
                        Lot of people you familiar with 
                        die, whipping themselves in the 
                        back of the head, a blunt object?

           Sulko and a Patrolman (20s) are in the KITCHEN. 

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Thought maybe her noose broke... 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Good ya got to use ya imagination. 
                        Don’t want ya, get bored onna job. 
                        But after ya did ya deductions, 
                        what the real detectives tell ya?

           Farron looks up, his eyes wandering around the apartment. 
           He spots a GOLD WATCH on the bathroom sink down the hall, 
           a RED “ON” LIGHT on the hi-fi, a muffin pan on the table. 

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Said it was a B&E, got outta hand. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        He came to rob her then why’d he 
                        leave her watch in the bathroom?

           Sulko, curious, moves to the john. There is a watch. 

                                 PATROLMAN
                        I musta missed that--

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        -was she expectin someone?

           The Patrolman’s confused. Farron nods to the PAN. 

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Oh. Maybe her son? He found her.

                                 PATROLMAN
                        No. Didn’t say much. 

           Farron nods, figures, and pulls a tailor’s tape from his 
           pocket. He measures doorways, the hall width, etc. The 
           Patrolman looks to Sulko. The fuck is this? Sulko shrugs.

           INT. ONE ROOM APARTMENT - LEXINGTON, MA - NIGHT

           JURIS SLESSERS (30s) is seated at a two-top table in a 
           near-dark kitchenette, covering his mouth, eyes downcast.

                                 JURIS SLESSERS
                        ...not since she divorced my dad 
                        ‘fore they came here after the 
                        war. No. No men that I know of... 

           Farron sits across from Slessers, elbows on his knees, 
           watching him. Sulko is leaning against the door jam. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        And you used to live with her?

                                 JURIS SLESSERS
                        Yeah. Just moved out. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        How come you left her all alone?

           Slessers glares up at Sulko. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You talk to her a lot? Juris?

           Farron puts a gentle hand on Juris’s arm. Juris breaks 
           his look from Sulko, turns apologetically to Farron. 

                                 JURIS SLESSERS
                        I talked to her. She don’t talk 
                        about much though. Church, work...

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You know, I talk to my mother, she 
                        don’t really wanna talk? I get her 
                        complainin bout somethin, then she 
                        don’t want to shut up. Ya ma, she

           INT. HALLWAY - 77 GAINSBOROUGH ST - BACK BAY - NIGHT

           Sulko knocks on an APARTMENT F. Farron leans into him. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Land on him just as hard. 

           Sulko nods. The door opens into--

           APARTMENT F

           OLD MAN, in an undershirt, rocks in a tattered recliner. 

                                 FRAN SULKO (O.S.)
                        Talked to the beat cop bout you. 
                        Hadda lot to say. Says he’s got a

                        ‘em...and now this thing upstairs.

           Sulko stands over him. Farron sits on a couch in front of 
           him, watching him. The Old Man just rocks, non-plussed. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        I don’t know nothin bout upstairs.

                        Not what I hear. 

           The Old Man shrugs. Farron leans forward, smiling.  

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Honest, ya try with her upstairs?

                                 OLD MAN
                        None. She wouldn’t talk to nobody.

           Farron and Sulko are the last two in the pen, seated 
           across from each other at adjoining desks. Sulko, glasses 
           on, pecks away at his typewriter. Farron details a 
           comprehensive crime scene map. They’re both exhausted.   

           LATER

           Sulko stands, yawning. It’s dawn.

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Then what?

                        Go home, see my wife. 

           Sulko nods, takes his jacket off the back of his chair.

           WENDY FARRON (20s)--black hair, olive skin, gorgeous--is  
           at her table in a housecoat, across from FR. COLO (20s).

                        ...he doesn’t want me to work,

                        Speak of the devil. 

           Farron trudges through the back door.

                                 FATHER COLO
                        Well, I should be goin. Got one of

                        Thanks, puttin up with a mooch.

           Colo smiles at Farron and Farron nods goodbye. The door 
           closes. Farron looks to Wendy. S’that all about? 

                                 WENDY FARRON
                        Thinks we should have kids.

                        How was work? 

           Silence. She sees his eyes wander, leans into his vision.

           a wooden set of stairs, suitcases in either hand, toward--

           HER APARTMENT

           Nichols unpacks, unfurling and folding clothes, her 
           suitcases on the bed. A phone’s tucked into her shoulder. 

                                 NINA NICHOLS
                        ...what time ya gonna eat, Margie?

           TAP-TAP. Nichols steps into her hall, looks to the door.

                        Hold on. Someone’s at the door...

           Nichols puts the phone down on her bed, walks out.

           The phone echoes, the line dead, in a now-darkened room.

           Farron walks into the apartment and looks to the door--
           it’s clean, lock’s unbroken. He points this out to Sulko.

           Down the hall, DR. LUONGO (40) comes out of the bedroom, 
           eyes down, and walks by Farron, dazed. Sulko stops him.

           Farron and Sulko stand at the threshold of the bedroom.

           Farron kneels by the body and spots THREE PEARL BUTTONS 
           on the floor. He turns to Nichols. His eyes move over:

           STOCKINGS dug deep into her neck, cutting the skin. Bite 
           marks--on her large breasts, nipples, the belly down to 
           her waist. A single blue shoe hanging off her left foot. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Double-half hitch... 

           Farron looks to the BOW in the stockings. He nods.

           Farron drops in behind his desk, throws his gun in a 
           drawer, slams the drawer, pulls out a TRACT of paper and 
           sharpens a pencil. A SECRETARY places a file on his desk. 
           Farron doesn’t look up. Sulko leans over, grabs the file.

           Farron slides into the bedroom and stands against the 
           wall, well out of the way of two LYNN DETECTIVES (40s). 

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        Those spaces on her fingers,

                        Write it up--robbery. 

           Farron points out the BOW on her neck to Sulko. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        The fuck are you two ghouls?

                        three, four buttons on the floor. 

                                 DETECTIVE 2
                        ...I found two.

                        Housecoats got four buttons up the 
                        front. He raped her on the floor, 
                        dressed her up on the bed. Seems 
                        like a lotta work, a robbery...

           The Detectives exchange a look. Sulko grins at them.

           Sulko, squinting, pecks at the keys on his typewriter. 
           Farron’s drawing another map. Farron looks up and--

           At the front of the bullpen is a corkboard with photos of 
           Slessers and Nichols. Above them, labelled with their 
           names, are lengths of rope tied in DOUBLE-HALF HITCHES. 

           LATER

           Farron ties a KNOT for Blake and hangs it on the board.

           Farron drags himself out of his cruiser. Walking up his 
           FRONT PORCH, he finds a BOSTON GLOBE and unfolds it.

           Farron turns off the sink faucet but spots a line of dirt 
           under his well-trimmed, wet finger nails. He hits the 
           faucet again, scrubs hard. But can’t seem to get it out.  

           LATER

           Farron sits at his table, cracks a beer, and BREATHES. He 
           takes off his .38, puts it on the table, and stares out 
           the back door at the sunrise, fighting his eyes open.

           Farron, carrying three cups of coffee, finds Sulko at the 
           bar, cracking an egg into his beer. Farron hands a coffee 
           to Sulko and to the Bartender, who nods his thanks. 

           On the TV above the bar, COMMISSIONER EDMUND L. MCNAMARA 
           (41)--big, long face, hollow eyes--is being interviewed.

           McNamara pulls down his tie and collapses, groaning, into 
           a chair behind his desk. He holds up a RECORD-AMERICAN. 

                                 COMMISSIONER MCNAMARA

           Farron pulls up outside of MASS. GENERAL HOSPITAL and 
           Wendy climbs in wearing a full NURSE’S UNIFORM. Farron 
           pulls out and passes a loading MTA BUS. There’s a line of 
           women, all NURSES, climbing on--all of them bare-legged.

           INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - BOSTON POLICE HQ - DAY

           S. AGENT WALTER MCLAUGHLIN (40s) stands at the head of a 
           bullpen, next to a green-chalkboard labelled: PERVERSION.

                                 AGENT MCLAUGHLIN
                        ...some of you may be familiar 
                        with the DSM from your military 
                        service and the Medical 203. But 
                        one subject that document fails to 
                        mention is a routine problem with 
                        investigators: that though your 
                        deviant may be psychotic, he may 
                        not always look like what one 
                        would term as “crazy.” Often 
                        times, these are people who seem 
                        sane, might even feel guilt about 
                        what they’ve done, who are racked 
                        with obsessions and compulsions...

           Farron, one of 50 cops, watches McLaughlin intently.

                        taking a drink, the more you take, 
                        the more you need. The same with 
                        the deviant. His acts typically 
                        get worse, more demonstrative.

                        victims #4 and #5, Ida Irga and 
                        Jane Sullivan, saw an increase in

                        Irga’s body was laid out in such a 
                        fashion that the first person 
                        through the door would be forced

           Agent McLaughlin looks to the wings. DR. SOLOMON (60s), 
           seated next to Commissioner McNamara, clears his throat.

                                 DR. SOLOMON
                        The consensus at Boston City is 
                        that the killer is a man between 
                        the ages of 25-45, highly 
                        intelligent, most-likely Catholic 
                        and with a deep-seated hatred and 
                        attraction to his mother figure...

           Dr. Solomon glances back at McLaughlin. 

                                 AGENT MCLAUGHLIN
                        And most likely, he will kill 
                        older women until he’s stopped.

           BEVERLY SAMANS (23)--short cropped hair, high cheek 
           bones, pretty--plays a piano, fingers moving lithely over 
           the keys. But there’s NO SOUND--all that can be HEARD is 
           a steady HEART BEAT, a DULL ECHO. Samans stops playing. 
           She reaches up to her ear and FINGERS a HEARING AID.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Samans comes to in a concussed haze, NO SOUND in her head-
           -only her HEART BEATING progressively louder and a dull 
           roar like the tide coming in. She finds herself on the 
           toilet and a dim form of a MAN watching her take a piss.

           Samans climbs cautiously into her bed, lays down. 

           Samans limbs are tied to the bed. Her clothes are torn 
           off, her ample body completely exposed on the top sheet. 

           Saman’s crying, being jockeyed, SCREAMING soundlessly.

           A knife is drawn. Samans pleads, soundlessly. A gloved 
           hand cups her breast, puts the tip of the knife to it and-

           Farron’s standing over Saman’s bed. His eyes pick up the 
           details: concentric stab wounds around the breast, her 
           left leg dangling off the bed, a DOUBLE-HALF HITCH KNOT.

           Farron turns, Sulko’s stands next to Dr. Luongo watching 
           him swab the sheets. Luongo looks to Farron. Farron nods.

           Sulko turns away, restrained. Farron watches him look 
           over her belongings, over her desk. He picks up a pad.

                        “What did I do to deserve this?”

           Farron squints. Sulko hands him the notepad. Written in 
           the margins in feminine cursive: “What did I do to...?”

           Sulko shakes Farron, laid out on a cot, and hands him a 
           coffee. Farron, eyes black with exhaustion, sits up and 
           takes it. Sulko sits on the cot across the way, sipping 
           his own, smoking. Farron stares into the bullpen, yawns.

           A DRUNK (40s) chained to a bench, is weeping to himself.

           series of empty liquor bottles out of the way of her door

           Sulko flies into WINTHROP SQUARE and they prowl its park, 
           scanning row after row of interconnected, brick buildings 
           and their alleys. The neighborhood’s quiet, deserted. 

           They take a right, up hill, and come under the shadow of 
           the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT. Gliding past Monument Ct.--

           Sulko slams on the breaks and tosses the car in reverse--
           but the court’s empty. They take the next right, turn 
           right again, and catch sight of a MAN slipping into an 
           alley down the block. Sulko drops into NEUTRAL and 
           cruises up to the alleyway. Angling inside, Farron sees--

           A short, wide-built man in a GREEN JACKET with a black 
           pompadour--ALBERT DESALVO (33) walking away. Sulko 
           POUNCES ON THE GAS and aims right for DeSalvo’s back.

           DeSalvo hears the cruiser’s ROAR, turns, sees it coming 
           and bolts for the end of the alley. He dives into the 
           street and the Cruiser breaches the alleyway, tires 
           squealing and knocks a row of trash cans into the road. 

           DeSalvo, horrified, pushes up and races up the block. 
           Sulko straightens out the cruiser and follows DeSalvo 
           into an alley between two apartment building, only--

           DeSalvo leaps over a railing and into a basement divot.

           Sulko breaks and skids head-first into the cut out. The 
           cruiser rocks, and Farron’s out of the car and racing out 
           of the alley. He sprints down the block and turns left

           Boots a REAR DOOR until the rust gives and it flies open. 
           .38 up, he cautiously enters a long trash-strewn hallway 
           that runs the length of the building. He can hear the 
           KENNEDY FUNERAL MARCH booming out of every apartment. 

           SULKO

           Rushes up a dust-laden staircase, .45 at his side, and 
           reaches a platform. Carefully, he leans over the railing 
           and looks up to the ROOF DOOR--it’s closed, no DeSalvo. 
           Shoulder to the wall, Sulko rises to the next floor, eyes 
           up. He can HEAR a steady echo of the FUNERAL MARCH.

           FARRON 

           Eases his way down the hall, his eyes on the open hall 
           door at the end. He passes an APARTMENT DOOR and peers 
           in: two WHITE KIDS in ill-fitting clothes look away from 
           their TV to him. Farron gestures, shhh. They could care.

           SULKO

           Quietly reaches the next platform and again sticks his 
           head over the railing to see up to the ROOF DOOR. Still 
           closed. Shoulder back to the wall, he moves to the next 
           flight, eyes still up. His shoulder brushes a hall door--

           And the door creaks open. Sulko looks down, there’s a ray 
           of light on the floor. He traces the light up the seam, 
           the funeral DRUMS building to CRESCENDO, and sees a FACE 
           staring back at him. Sulko swings his gun arm up and--

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The door’s kicked open, knocking Sulko onto his back. 
           DeSalvo flees over him and Sulko empties his clip. 

           FARRON

           HEARS the GUNSHOTS. SCREAMS of TERROR. He raises his .38, 
           in a combat stance, aiming at the far end of the hall and 
           waits. The funeral PIPERS whine to an ear-aching pitch. 
           Then--FOOTFALLS. Suddenly, DeSalvo appears, sees him and 
           freezes. Farron has him dead to rights--but doesn’t fire.

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                        Sulko!

                                 FRAN SULKO (O.S.)
                        Shoot the fuck.  

           Farron squeezes back on the trigger and-- 

           DeSalvo bolts. FUCK. Farron immediately takes off after 
           him, crashes through the door at the far end of the hall 
           and jumps down the stairs to the basement. He climbs out 
           the divot into the alley, dives over their cruiser and 
           darts into the street. He sees DeSalvo, two blocks ahead. 

           LATER

           Breathless, Farron pursues him down four blocks of empty 
           sidewalk. He gains, closes their gap to one block, only--

           DeSalvo ducks into an alley ahead. Farron cuts into the 
           alley before it, sprints to the end, hurtling piles of 
           garbage and sleeping bums. He comes out the other end and-

           Farron runs right into DeSalvo crossing the alley mouth. 
           They tumble into the street, a HORN HONKING. But DeSalvo 
           rolls onto his feet and keeps going. Right behind him--

           Farron keeps pace. He watches DeSalvo slice down a side 
           street and rush to the end, hitting a 7’ brick wall. 

           LATER

           Farron comes over the wall, into the woods, and at the 
           back of an 18th century CEMETERY. He sees DeSalvo, just 
           ahead, dodging around brittle tombstones, fleeing into--

           INT. BASEMENT - ST. FRANCIS DE SALE CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Farron peers inside, framed by the doorway, and finds the 
           cellar in complete darkness, silent save for the WOOSH 
           and HUM of a MASSIVE TWO-BURNER FURNACE at the far end. 
           Steam hisses out of one burner--the other burner dead.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           In the distance, an echo of the FUNERAL can be heard. 

           .38 in front of him, Farron eases his way in, feeling his 
           way along with his feet, moving towards the broken 
           BURNER. Holding out a shaking hand to its slats, face 
           slick with sweat, Farron takes a steadying breath and--

           Farron TEARS IT OPEN. But inside is nothing--darkness. 
           Farron peers into the abyss and a set of EGG WHITE EYES 
           SCREAMS back at him. Farron freezes. DeSalvo lunges out.   

           LATER

           Farron comes to. Sulko’s shaking him, terrified.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL - DUSK

           Farron sits on the edge of a bed, embarrassed, a gash 
           over his right eye being stitched. Wendy--in uniform--
           slides onto the bed next to him. Farron won’t look over. 
           Wendy watches him, shaking her head, smiling gratefully.

           stands on a stool, fitting onion paper onto her shelves.

           TAP-TAP-TAP...

           Sullivan pads toward the door in BARE FEET, pops it open.

           LATER

           The Strangler stands in her kitchen looking around absent-
           mindedly, as if he forgot why he came in. He spots a New 
           Years card on the table. He picks it up, looks it over.

           LATER

           Mary, seated up in a bed, three stockings wound around 
           her throat, tied off with  DOUBLE-HALF HITCHES, stares 
           off into nowhere, eyes black with eight ball hemorrhages. 
           The Strangler props up the card on her BARE left FOOT.
           INT. FARRON’S UNDERCOVER CRUISER - NIGHT

           Farron pulls up at the edge of a growing crowd outside of 
           a CHARLES ST. THREE STORY WALK UP. Police HORSES, noses 
           steaming, ring the mob. Reporters sit on the fringes. An 
           ambulance, lights flashing, attempts to wade through.

           INT. 44A CHARLES ST. - BEACON HILL - LATER

           Farron and Sulko stand in the bedroom doorway staring in 
           at Mary Sullivan. Farron moves in slowly, as if 
           respectfully, and squats by the bed. His eyes wander to-

           A fruit knife in her hand. A pink scarf knotted at her 
           throat. The eight ball hemorrhages. The card on her foot. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        She’s just a fuckin kid...

           Farron takes a deep breath, and nods. 

           EXT. 44A CHARLES ST. - BEACON HILL - LATER

           Farron and Sulko escort the BODY BAG, born on a stretcher 
           between two FIREMEN, down an interior staircase and into 
           the ROARING CROWD on the street. But the crowd sees the 
           BODY and suddenly falls SILENT, REVERENTIALLY STILL. 

           An AMBULANCE backs up to the door and Farron and Sulko 
           clear a path to it. The stretcher’s slid in. Farron 
           pounds on the trunk, and they watch the ambo roll off.

                        3 district attorneys working on

                        This is an abnormal and unusual

                        ...in the final analysis, we have 
                        found that “Mr. S” is a boy who 
                        grew up to feel women were a 
                        fearful mystery, and that each 
                        killing is an exorcism of that 
                        fear by degrading an overwhelming 
                        and fearsome mother figure. But 
                        this obsession has yet yielded no 
                        release and as such each 
                        subsequent act becomes more 
                        violent. It is our conclusion that 
                        “Mr. S“ will continue to murder 
                        until he achieves satisfaction--
                        which in this case will most 
                        likely mean his own destruction...

                        Any luck?

           Farron shakes his head. Bottomly nods and crosses his 
           legs, demurely. He says nothing. It distracts Farron. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        There somethin I can do for ya?

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        I just had one question: I was 
                        reading over your case files--very 
                        impressive by the way, neat--and 
                        noticed a report about a Langham.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Was a former boyfriend of one of 
                        Sophie Clarke’s roommates. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Didn’t get much out of him?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Didn’t want to talk. Didn’t have 
                        anything to charge him with. Hadda 
                        let him go. Then the next day...

           Farron gestures with his eyes to his DESALVO WOUND.

           CONTINUED:

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Reason I ask is I’ve been trying 
                        to run Clark’s roommates to ground 
                        but they seem to have... vanished. 
                        I’m subpoenaing their bank records 
                        but that takes time. So I was 
                        wondering if you’d be willing to 
                        take another whack at Langham, see 
                        what you can’t find out from him.  

           Farron looks back at his MUGS. Bottomly claps his arm. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY (CONT’D)
                        I know you have a suspect--and 
                        it’s a good lead. But the way 
                        you’re going about it--you know 
                        how many mug shots are in the 
                        county files, state files--and 
                        what if he’s never been arrested? 
                        I know I’m new, but I think the 
                        way to go about this is to look at 
                        the victims, who they knew. Then 
                        use your description on them. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        What’d you work on before this?

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Eminent Domain. Real Estate.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        So this is ya first killer?

           Bottomly looks down, smiling, as if he expected that. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        You know, I looked you up a bit. 
                        Read you got into a little bit of 
                        trouble last year--gangland in 
                        Somerville? James “Buddy” McLean?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        McLean gunned a man down in the 
                        street, broad daylight. 150 people 
                        saw him. And no one’d testify. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Must’ve driven you crazy trying to 
                        prove the obvious some other way.

           Farron stares at Bottomly.

                        Look, I’m not trying to get in 
                        your way--I’m just asking you to 
                        maybe look at this differently. 
                        You know when I was in Germany, 
                        after the war? I had to sort out 
                        who to take to trial, who to let 
                        go--make recommendations to that 
                        effect. Now, nobody kept better 
                        records than the Third Reich...
                                 (Points to mugs)
                        But that didn’t tell the whole 
                        story--not by far. And it didn’t 
                        help us find them--even when we 
                        had names. What did was talking to 
                        people at the camps--the victims.

           Farron looks away, nodding, catching Bottomly’s point. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY (CONT’D)
                        Now maybe you’re right. Maybe I’m 
                        full of it. But maybe this Langham 
                        ends up being a copy cat, we knock 
                        Clark off the books. Who knows? 

           INT. FARRON’S UNMARKED CRUISER - NIGHT

           Sulko and Farron cruise the parking lot of the CHALET 
           SWISS BOWLING ALLEY and watch Langham shoot pool inside. 

           LATER

           They surveil Langham escorting a light-skinned BLACK 
           WOMAN up an exterior staircase to a GARAGE APARTMENT. 

           DAWN

           Farron smokes, sips coffee, still watching. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        How’s Lois Lane doin?

           Farron looks over. Sulko, beat, ashes into an empty cup.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Ah...she’s miserable.

           Farron tries to find the words. Can’t. Sulko watches him.

                                 FRAN SULKO (CONT’D)
                        ...you all right, Farron?

           Farron looks over, surprised he’d ask. Bobby nods. Yeah. 

           MIDNIGHT

           Farron and Sulko surveil a LOW END DIVE. Farron suddenly 
           winces, as if struck by something. He throws his door. 

                                 FRAN SULKO (CONT’D)

           Farron slams the car door and crosses the street. 

           INT. BAR - LAWRENCE, MA - NIGHT

           Farron squeezes between two black women at a crowded bar 
           and saddles right up against Langham. Junior turns and...

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Remember I said I’d find you? 

           Junior bolts. Farron grabs him by the collar.

           INT. OFFICE - BPD HQ - NIGHT

           CHARLES ZIMMERMAN (30s) watches the lines on a POLYGRAPH 
           MACHINE, Junior Langham seated next to him, strapped in.

                                 CHARLES ZIMMERMAN
                        Did you ever have consensual sex 
                        with Ms. Sophie Clark?

                                 JUNIOR LANGHAM
                        No. 

           Junior kneads his hands in his lap. He looks over at the 
           machine and Zimmerman. Zimmerman watches still lines. 

           OUTER OFFICE

           Farron and Sulko watch the test through a glass wall. 
           Farron lights a PALL MALL. Sulko bounces a squash ball.

           INSIDE

           Zimmerman marks the still lines on the machine.

                                 JUNIOR LANGHAM
                        No. 

           The lines jump. Zimmerman marks this, emotionless. 

                                 CHARLES ZIMMERMAN
                        Did you kill Sophie Clark?

                        No. I didn’t kill no Sophie Clark.

           Zimmerman’s stares at him over the rims of his glasses.

                        So he’s lying?

           Zimmerman shakes his head, reading a POLYGRAPH READ OUT. 

                                 CHARLES ZIMMERMAN
                        No. Not necessarily. He just knows 
                        more than what he’s telling us.

                        going in--fucking Walpole. LIFE.

           Langham looks to Zimmerman, terrified, and finds his face 
           impassive. He looks to Farron outside the glass, who 
           watches him like an insect. He looks back to Sulko. He 
           sees an electricity in Sulko’s eyes, a need. He grins. 

                                 JUNIOR LANGHAM

                        done. Fuck you. And fuck that box. 

           Sulko looks out the glass wall. Farron shakes his head.

           DeSalvo mashes the BUZZER BOX. Waits. The door CLICKS.

           DeSalvo peers into the MAINTENANCE OFFICE and spots a 
           coffee cooling on the desk and a paycheck envelope. 
           DeSalvo grabs the check, reads the name, and pockets it.

           DeSalvo taps gently on an APARTMENT door.

                        It’s Mr. Bruce to check ya pipes. 

           A LOCK SLIDES. A CHAIN DROPS. The door cracks and DeSalvo 
           forces it open, slams it shut behind him. Mrs. LEBLANC 
           (30s) stares at him, stunned. DeSalvo’s holding a KNIFE. 
           Mrs. Leblanc backs up--never turning her back to him--and 
           feels her way into a PARLOR with both hands, weeping. 

           LATER

           DeSalvo binds Mrs. LeBlanc’s hands, feet on her couch.

           LATER

           He unbuttons her housecoat and pulls open her bra. Her 
           bust falls out. DeSalvo kisses them, gently. She mewls. 

           EXT. DESALVO HOUSE - MALDEN, MA - NIGHT

           DeSalvo’s Chevy pulls up to a small one family home. 

           LATER

           DeSalvo washes his dick in the bathroom sink. 

           INSIDE

           DeSalvo walks through a darkened kitchen towards the BLUE 
           GLOW coming from the parlor. He finds IRMGARD (30s)-- 
           brunette, lithe, beautiful--watching “The Fugitive,” his 
           two kids--Judy (8), Michael (3)--laying on the floor. 

           DeSalvo kisses Irmgard and leans against the passageway 
           between the two rooms. Albert watches TV with his family.

           DeSalvo walks into Judy’s pink-and-white princess-themed 
           bedroom and finds her sitting on the comforter, waiting.

                        How was the pain today?

           Judy shrugs. DeSalvo frowns, sympathetically, and lays 
           her back. He undoes the BOWED DOUBLE-HALF HITCHES on her 
           FROG LEG BRACE and yanks it off. Her legs reflexively 
           shut. But he kneads her thighs, opening them. She cries.

           INT. BATTLE GREEN MOTEL - LEXINGTON, MA - NIGHT

           PETER HURKOS (53)--big-eared, Vaudeville-looking, Dutch-- 
           puffs like a train on a small cigar, seated next to one 
           of two twin beds, staring at stacks of PHOTOS placed 
           picture down on the comforter. Hurkos slaps one, hard. 

                                 PETER HURKOS
                        Uh huh! Phoney baloney!

           Sulko flips over the stack--they’re photos of a dead man. 
           Sulko looks at Farron seated on a couch next to JIM CRANE  
           (40s)--6’4, shit-house-wide cowboy. Sulko gestures at 
           Farron with the photos. You do this? Farron shrugs. 

                                 PETER HURKOS (CONT’D)
                        Irishman thinks Hurkos is full of 
                        the shit, eh? Okay, okay. You see.
                                 (to Crane)
                        Jeem. Medicine...

           Farron watches Crane stab out a Lucky Strike on a coffee 
           table, grab a bottle of Walker out of a Pan-Am bag and 
           pour Hurkos a snoot. Hurkos relights his cigar, sips his 
           Scotch and paces around the bed and the photos. Suddenly--

           Hurkos throws back his Scotch, tosses Crane the empty 
           tumbler and dives for the bed. He stabs at a stack, 
           rubbing his hand over the photos--then he punches 
           another. His eyes widen. He raps his knuckles on it. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 (Mimics big breasts)
                        She die like this--like this, see?

           Hurkos drops onto the other twin bed, arms splayed, 
           leaving one leg off, a toe on the floor. Sulko looks to 
           Farron, to Crane. He grabs the stack and flips through 
           them. He hands them to Farron. The pictures reveal:

           Joann Graff, leg hanging off a bed--one toe on the floor.

           LATER

           Farron and Sulko watch Hurkos tear through a manila 
           envelope, feverishly pulling out stockings, scarves, a 
           broken belt--he can’t get at the evidence fast enough. He 
           chomps on his cigar and shakes the envelope on the bed.

           Hurkos trails his fingers over the evidence, squinting, 
           as if something were bothering him. He kneels next to the 
           bed, as if in prayer, and takes up a pair of stockings. 
           He runs them in the space between his fingers, concerned.

                                 PETER HURKOS (CONT’D)
                        Ah huh! This your man...I see him. 
                        He...he loves shoes--lady shoes. 
                        He don’t wear shoes... no...he 
                        take the lady shoes and he goes 
                        like this, and he-he-he...

                        Into shoe. He make love to shoe...

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        The fuck was in that Scotch?

                                 PETER HURKOS
                        And he talk like this...
                                 (female voice)
                        Queer...like Castilian but not 
                        Spanish...no, he Irish or Italian-- 

           Hurko’s eyes widen. 

                                 PETER HURKOS (CONT’D)
                        Jeem! A map--bring me map!

                                 JIM CRANE
                        Do you have a map?

           Farron doesn’t move--just stares at Hurkos. Sulko rolls 
           his eyes and pulls open a series of drawers. He finds a 
           tattered road map and frisbees it to Crane. Hurkos tears 
           it open and traces a huge perimeter around Chestnut Hill.

                        Yes. You find him. Hurkos knows. 

           Hurkos flops onto the bed and signals for more Scotch.

                        ...so’s that it?

           They all look to Hurkos. He eyes Dooley.

           They all look to Dooley.

                        times ya wouldn’t get a neighbor-
                        hood to turn on a guy--even if he 
                        was a killer; wouldn’t get his 
                        worst enemy to rat on him in this 
                        city. Remember? I told ya that: 
                        s’not how this city works. Should 
                        look up the Latin for that: “not 
                        how this city works.” I still went 
                        along with you though--then. But I 
                        won’t watch you tunnel vision 
                        this. Strangler might not be Jimmy 
                        Durante. Might be more than one 
                        guy. Might not be. Just don’t lose 
                        the forest through the trees...

           Farron stares at him. He slowly starts to nod. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Ya right. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Yeah?

           Farron nods. 

           INSERT: OCTOBER 27th, 1964.

           INT. CAFE - CAMBRIDGE, MA - DAY 

           DeSalvo sips a coffee at a stand-up, window counter. He’s 
           focused on something across the street--a BROWNSTONE.

           INT. BROWNSTONE - CAMBRIDGE, MA - LATER

           WENDY TIMILTY (20s) comes to and looks at the clock. 6 
           a.m. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She frowns and rolls back over--only to find DESALVO in 
           her doorway. She blinks--then it hits her. She bolts 
           upright. DeSalvo holds a stilletto to his lips. Shhhh.

           LATER

           DeSalvo drags a gloved hand over Timilty’s lip and pulls 
           the bottom away from her teeth. He opens his mouth. She 
           opens hers and he gently feeds her her own silk panties. 

           Breathing through her nose, Timilty watches DeSalvo pick 
           up a MAN’S PAJAMA bottoms. He rips them in half and she 
           flinches. DeSalvo takes one pant leg, ties her hands to 
           the headboard. He takes the other, ties up her right leg.

           Eyes widening, Timilty watches him run his hand down her 
           breasts, stomach and stop at her waist. He gathers the 
           elastic in her drawers with both hands and rips down. She 
           cries and he pulls her drawers off her loose left leg.

           Timilty whimpers through her panties and DeSalvo shoves 
           her top over her breasts, covering her face. He coos...

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Ya gonna be all right, honey. I’m 
                        only going to make love to you...

           Timilty wails, and DeSalvo kisses from her breasts down 
           her stomach to her thigh and down her leg to her foot. 
           Horrified, Timilty watches him over her bunched-up top. 
           DeSalvo slowly tongues her navel. He sees her watching. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look, honey...

           LATER

           Timilty, eyes wet and vacant, watches DeSalvo rock on the 
           edge of her bed, his hands between his thighs--sobbing. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Oh God, I’m sorry. 
                        Please--please don’t say nothin...

           She won’t look at him. DeSalvo watches tears drip out of 
           her eyes. Pained, he wipes them off her cheeks with a 
           gloved hand and contemplates her wet face. Slowly, his 
           hands lower to her throat. Timilty looks up at him and--

           DeSalvo squeezes. Timilty struggles--and DeSalvo lets go. 
           He stares at her, trying to breath, and reaches for her 
           again. Timilty flinches. But DeSalvo just unties her. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        Forgive me...
           INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE - STATE HOUSE - LATER

           Farron hunches over his desk, phone to his ear. A 
           Secretary tries to get his attention. He waves her off.

                                 SECRETARY
                        ...it’s a near miss. 

           Farron immediately throws down the phone. 

           EXT. AMBULANCE BAY - EMERGENCY ROOM - MASS GENERAL - DUSK

           Farron and Sulko rush over watching the EMTs haul 
           TIMILTY’s stretcher from the back of the ambo. Farron 
           badges the EMTs and he and Sulko follow them inside. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Can she talk?

                                 EMT
                        Give it a try. She’s in shock. 

           Farron leans over Timilty, trying to make eye contact.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Hon, can ya hear me? Can ya hear 
                        me, sweetheart? Did you know him?

           Timilty’s eyes rest on Farron but she doesn’t speak. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Is she there?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I don’t know...
                                 (to Timility)
                        Honey, can you hear me?

                                 EMT
                        She’s not responding...

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Yeah. I can see that. 

           A DOCTOR and team of NURSES rushes to meet the EMTs--
           Wendy with them. The EMTs back off. Farron doesn’t. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                                 (to Timilty)
                        Sweetheart, I need you to talk to--

                                 DOCTOR
                        She can’t hear you.

                        Bob, you gotta let her go now. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Just one second--

                        Mrs. Timilty, what did he--

                        Wendy, I gotta know. 

           The Doctor leans over the rushing stretcher. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Detective, I think you should--

                        Hey--who asked you? The guy’s 
                        doing his job. Do yours, Fred. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I gotta know if it’s him.  

           Wendy stares at him. She nods and pulls him away from the 
           stretcher. The rest of the team moves off down the hall. 

                                 WENDY FARRON
                        Whattya needa know? 

           LATER

           Through a glass wall, Farron and Sulko watch Wendy lean 
           over a RESPONSE TEAM and talk to Timilty. They can see 
           Timilty talking. Wendy nods. They watch her come out. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        What did she say?

                                 WENDY FARRON
                        Just talked in tongues. Sorry.

           Farron winces. Wendy frowns, moves back into the room. 
           INT. BROWNSTONE - CAMBRIDGE, MA - NIGHT

           Farron and Sulko walk through the crime scene. Farron’s 
           eyes rove, pick up details: torn pajamas, the gag, stains 
           on the bed. A Patrolman behind them reads off a report. 

                                 PATROLMAN
                        The victim, Wendy Timilty, awoke 
                        at around 6 a.m. to find--

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        What’d you say her name was?

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Timilty. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Her first name. 

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Wendy... 

           Sulko looks at Farron. Farron shakes his head, quick. 

                                 PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
                        Like I said, Wendy Timilty awoke--

           INT. ICU - MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Farron, smoking, stands outside a room. Sulko sleeps in a 
           chair next to him. Wendy slides out of the room and 
           closes the door gently behind her. Farron shakes Sulko 
           awake. She stands aside. Farron kisses her and rushes in. 

           LATER

           Farron stands over a SKETCH ARTIST seated next to 
           Timilty’s bed. Timilty’s sitting up, surrounded by COPS. 

                                 WENDY TIMILTY
                        The hair was combed like a 
                        pompadour, very neat...he had dark 
                        brown eyes, almost looked black. 
                        And he had a big nose, hawk nose--

                                 COP
                        -that’s the Measuring Man. Jesus.

           The room stops and looks to a UNIFORM COP. He’s pointing 
           at the ARTIST’S RENDERING--it looks like Albert DeSalvo.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Who?

                        their homes, sayin he was a 
                        modeling agent. He’d take their 
                        measurements then get grabby.

                        ...do you remember a name? 

           INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE - STATE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Farron tears across the WAR ROOM and assaults a row of 6’ 
           high filing cabinets. He yanks one open, searches, slams 
           it shut, and yanks open another. Sulko walks in. He 
           watches Farron find a file, pull it and flick on a lamp. 
           It’s DeSalvo’s arrest record, mug shot. Farron winces. 

           EXT. FLORENCE STREET - MALDEN, MA - DAWN 

           Farron and Sulko watch DESALVO’s HOUSE from behind a row 
           of willows at the end of the road. The street is still, 
           quiet. A wind stirs the trees, leaves dance up the block. 

           DESALVO HOUSE

           DeSalvo, in a GREEN maintenance uniform, walks out of his 
           house with lunch pail and Thermos. Hustling down his 
           front porch to his Chevy, he notices a PATROL CAR parked 
           up the block, two silhouettes sitting in the front seat.

           INT. 1958 CHEVY COUPE - CONTINUOUS

           DeSalvo climbs in, and watching the PATROL CAR in the 
           REARVIEW, backs down his drive. He pulls out in the 
           opposite direction of the cruiser, eyes still on it. Then-

           LIGHTS FLASH. SIRENS BLARE. And two PATROL CARS ROAR onto 
           the block in front of him. Horrified, DeSalvo slams on 
           his breaks and throws the Chevy into reverse--but the 
           Patrol Car behind him swerves into his path. DeSalvo 
           smashes into it, throws the Chevy back into drive, but--

           Farron and Sulko are marching up the street towards him, 
           flanked by the patrol cars, SHOTGUNS aimed at his face.

           DeSalvo sees them and lets out a deep breath. He slowly 
           turns off the ignition and cops surround his car, .38’s 
           drawn and aimed. He watches Farron jerk open his door. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I will blow ya fuckin head off.

           CONTINUED:

           DeSalvo nods, holds up his hands and climbs out. He 
           kneels and Farron pins him to the tar, cuffing him. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MALDEN PD HQ - DAY

           Sulko sits across a table from DeSalvo. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        How ya been Al? Been keeping

                        Been trying. Hey--ever met you two 
                        before? Can’t remember, ya know?

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Briefly. I’m Det. Sulko, this is 
                        Det. Farron. Ya’ll recognize him.

           DeSalvo squints at Farron standing in the doorway. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        ...oh yeah.

                        by any chance? About 6 a.m.?

           Al smiles weakly, looks down at his hands. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Al, you know what’s happening to 
                        you right now, right? 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Can I talk to my wife, first?

           LATER

           Irmgard, wringing her hands, leans her head next to her 
           husband’s. DeSalvo whispers softly to her but there’s a 
           hushed edge to her responses. DeSalvo gently paws her 
           back with both cuffed hands. But Irmgard slaps them away. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        ...I need to, hon. 

                                 IRMGARD DESALVO (O.S.)
                        Tell them whatever you want, Al. 

           Irmgard storms out of the room, eyes watering.

                        guys don’t know about.

           A Sergeant reads off a TELETYPE to Farron and Sulko.

                                 SERGEANT
                        I put his name out 20 minutes ago. 
                        He’s got warrants in every state 
                        in New England besides Vermont. 
                        Rape. All of them. In one day, it 
                        says he raped four women in 
                        Connecticut. One day. Four broads.

                        One afternoon. 

           They turn. DeSalvo’s sitting non-chalantly cuffed to a 
           desk in the CAPTAIN’S OFFICE. He’s smiling, foolishly.

           Bottomly, coat folded over his arm, feverishly locks the 
           door to the men’s john and wheels on Farron and Sulko.

                        I’m getting on the phone with the 
                        Middlesex Prosecutor right now. I 
                        want him charged with rape--just 
                        get him in front of a grand jury 
                        and indict him. He’s got a record--
                        rape alone will put him away for 
                        life; which is probably why he 
                        gave you that belt in the face 
                        when you chased him. Strangler 
                        aspect we’ll figure out later...

                        Oh yeah. Lawyer denied it out of

           INT. LIVING ROOM - FARRON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Farron walks out of his kitchen into the blue glow of his 
           living room. He finds Wendy asleep in her uniform, a test 
           pattern on the TV. Farron turns off the tube and sits 
           down next to her. He puts his arm around her, reclines. 

           Wendy’s head lolls onto him and she stirs, nuzzling him. 
           Farron smells her hair, kisses her head--and stays there.

           Wendy, sipping coffee in her housecoat, sleep still in 
           her eyes, watches LBJ’s infamous “Girl with a Daisy” ad.

                        These are the stakes: to make a

           The PHONE RINGS--LOUD. Wendy’s startled, spilling coffee.

           Wendy listens on the other end of the line. She BEAMS.

           Wendy smiles knowingly, watching Farron sleep. 

           INT. OFFICE - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - DAY 

           An INTAKE DOCTOR (60s)--German accent, rotten teeth--has 
           to squint against an EYE TICK to read an INTAKE FORM.

                                 INTAKE DOCTOR 
                        ...now, tell me your first sexual

                        First? Well geez, I don’t know 
                        so’s I can remember that far back. 
                        I do remember my brother Joe once 
                        catching me unna the covers, a 
                        girl. She was doin me French.

           DeSalvo is seated across from him, arms on the table, 
           leaning over like a kid playing with a Lionel train. 

                                 INTAKE DOCTOR
                        How old?

                        I think she was 12. I was 9.

           The Doctor nods, writes this down, reads the form. 

                                 INTAKE DOCTOR
                        Do you ever have the homosexual 
                        experiences when you were child?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Oh yeah. Yeah. Plenty of em. 

                                 INTAKE DOCTOR
                        Yes? Many homosexual experiences?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Well, you gotta unnastand, Doc: 
                        where I come from? They was always 
                        somebody, teach boys bad things 
                        about fuckin, ya know? Faggots; 
                        funny old men; Greeks; older 
                        women, weren’t getting their kicks 
                        from guys--they’d fool around with 
                        kids. Was even a queer cop over in 
                        Eastie useda go under the pier and 
                        blow us. He’d get a kick outta it, 
                        we came on his uniform. Also, ya 
                        know, I’m the type, I can come and 
                        like 5 minutes later, I’m, ya know-
                                 (Snaps)
                        Stand and deliver. Queers loved 
                        that. Pay a lot for it, too. 

                                 INTAKE DOCTOR
                        You like this then, the, uh, the 
                        homosexual experiences?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Nah. I mean, never minded gettin 
                        sucked off by a faggot for dough. 
                        But nah, being queer’s the least 
                        of my problems--believe me. I like 
                        Woman. To the point that I don’t 
                        even care what she looks like, how 
                        old she really was, just if--

                        Just if she is the woman? 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Yeah. Like when I was a kid, this 
                        woman in my neighborhood, Mrs. 
                        May? She was married. Hadda few 
                        kids. Was way over thirty. Wasn’t 
                        even real good looking, ya know?

                        “My God, Albert,” she’d say. “Ya a 
                        regular gang fuck all by yaself.” 

           The Intake Doctor lets out a plume of smoke, nodding.

                        Have you ever had--do you have sex

                        Didn’t feel I could help it.

                        You feel it vas wrong to do this?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Uh, you know, doctors always ask 
                        that: do ya think it was wrong? Do 
                        you think what ya did was right? 
                        But ya gotta understand: right or 
                        wrong’s had nothin to do with it. 
                        Right, wrong--I couldn’t stop.

                                 INTAKE DOCTOR
                        A man who knows he’s wrong, he can 
                        act, he can not do these things--

                        Hey look, all I know, Doc, is that 
                        when this thing I got--when it 
                        comes on me? I gotta do it. Could 
                        be three cop cars comin downa 
                        block--I gotta do it. I could 
                        think about it, I could say, “ya 
                        know this is wrong, Al. Ya 
                        shouldn’t do it.” I could wish I 
                        wasn’t like this--and I did. But I 
                        could not stop. Somethin would 
                        snap inside’a me, don’t know what 
                        that was, but--I hadda do it.

                        You are a sick man.

           handing her MUG SHOTS. She’s shaking her head, again and 
           again. He looks to Sulko and slips her one last mug. 
           Timilty’s face goes slack. She winces back tears, nods. 
           Farron flashes the mug to Sulko. It’s Albert DeSalvo. 

           INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE - STATE HOUSE - DAY 

           Farron and Sulko take their seats at their respective

           Across the yard, DeSalvo spots TEDDY SERACEN (40s)--

           The entire group, including Seracen, turns to DeSalvo.

                        Yeah, ya know, women’re all about

                        make $30-40 an hour modeling sun 
                        dresses. They always let me in 
                        after that. And once inside? BING-

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Oh yeah. I’d walk over, early in 
                        the morning, there’d be three or 
                        four of em just waking up. I’d 
                        say, “Let’s go, angels! Wake up! 
                        I’ll go down, get the doughnuts!” 
                        Then I’d come back with a dozen. I 
                        was enjoying myself. One girl’d 
                        lead me to another. I’d measure 
                        her, play with her--BING! BING! 

           The group CRACKS up. Robey leans toward DeSalvo.

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        -what’s that mean?

                                 DR. AMES ROBEY
                        They were willing, to have sex. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Oh, yeah. Most of em. 

           The laughter dies down. Across the room, Seracen LAUGHS.

           EXT. YARD - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - DAY

           DeSalvo and Seracen walk the perimeter. 

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        You really bought em doughnuts?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Yeah. Dunks. I didn’t cheap out.

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        Jesus, ya outta ya mind.  

           DeSalvo sees Seracen shaking his head, laughing.  

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Ya wanna hear somethin real funny? 
                        I’m about the biggest thing since 
                        Brinks and no one fuckin knows it. 

           Seracen looks over at the DeSalvo, smirking. 

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        ...you don’t mean...do ya?

           DeSalvo grins and nods.

           INT. LAWYER ROOM - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           F. LEE BAILEY (32)--tobacco voice; pensive, almost pained 
           glare--leans back in his chair across from DeSalvo, 
           regarding him like a freshly-stepped in piece of shit. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        ...now let me just say I’m here 
                        because Mr. Seracen, a client that 
                        has my trust, has informed me you 
                        have matters of importance you 
                        wish to discuss. No doubt there 
                        are a lot inmates with matters of 
                        importance they’d like to discuss. 
                        I’m sure a lot of them could tell 
                        me exactly who shot JFK and why-- 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Nixon and Pepsi-Cola--guy in the 
                        yard said that just the other day.

           Bailey smirks, patiently. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        I’m here with you though. Al. So 
                        before I begin, why don’t you tell 
                        me what ya think I can do for you?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Well for one, I need you to get me 
                        inna a good hospital, place where 
                        I can get help. Not some fuckin 
                        garbage dump, this place. Two, I 
                        wanna sell my life rights and get 
                        Irmgard some money for the kids. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        That would have to be a big story-- 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        -the biggest. And that’s what I 
                        got: I’m the Boston Strangler. 

           Bailey stares at him. And nods. He calmly takes a legal 
           pad out of his suitcase and puts on his reading glasses. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        Anticipating this from my 
                        conversation with Mr. Seracen, I 
                        took the liberty of drawing up a 
                        list of facts with the help of the 
                        Boston Police Department--a list 
                        withheld from the newspapers. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Gimme ya best shot. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        What was in Sophie Clark’s mouth?

           Bailey looks up from the list. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        The cigarettes in Sullivan’s--

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        -Salems. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        Do you smoke? 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        No. Never touched em. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        How do you know they were Salems 
                        then? How did you notice that?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Well, I saw ‘em, the ashtray, on 
                        the bedside table there. Kind of 
                        turned me off a little, ya know?
                                 (Silence)
                        Hey, you got any more, those 
                        questions? Here--how bout this: 
                        I’ll save you the trouble. There’s 
                        two more, cops don’t know about. 

           Bailey stares at him over the rim of his glasses. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        Two more women?

           DeSalvo gestures, 2. Bailey nods, pulls out a recorder. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s start again, Mr. DeSalvo...

           INT. BOTTOMLY’S OFFICE - A.G.’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bailey hits stop on a tape player and looks up to find 
           Brooke, Bottomly, Farron, Sulko and Dooley, wide-eyed. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        Obviously the voice’s been altered 
                        but the facts haven’t. My client’s 
                        also supplied a number of 
                        materials to support his claims...  

           Bailey opens his briefcase and passes out a file. Farron 
           cracks it: a series of HAND DRAWN CRIME SCENE MAPS.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        I think he’s pretty convincing. 

                                 A.G. BROOKE
                        So what do you want from us, Lee?

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        Well, here’s what my client and I 
                        are willing to do: he’ll confess 
                        to the crimes of the Boston 
                        Strangler, plus two more murders 
                        he claims you’ve failed to find. 
                        In return, a grateful Commonwealth 
                        spares him the electric chair.

           Farron watches Brooke and Bottomly think. 

           LATER

           Bottomly leads Farron out of the office, leans in close. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY 
                        Look, we know it’s DeSalvo. Bailey 
                        doesn’t think we know--but we 
                        know. Now we need to build a case. 
                        We need you to talk to his family, 
                        see if they’ll cooperate now.  
                        Bailey’s stashed them in Denver.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Denver? Jack, I put the cuffs on 
                        him with my own hands. I’ve been 
                        waiting months to interrogate-- 

           Bottomly puts a hand on him, looks him in the eye.

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        No one will question him before 
                        you get back, okay? I swear it. 

           LATER

           Farron puts together a file at his desk, phone in ear. 

                                 WENDY FARRON (O.S.)
                        Why tonight? Why now?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Something just broke. 

                                 WENDY FARRON (O.S.)
                        What is it--is it him? Oh Je-sus. 
                        Well don’t drag ya feet out there, 
                        I have some news to tell ya...

           Farron looks up. He sees Bailey, Brooke and Bottomly 
           still talking, smiling, inside Bottomly’s office.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Yeah-sure, hon...

           INT. BOEING 707 - NIGHT

           Farron at a window, his dome light on, carefully looks 
           through DeSalvo’s hand-drawn maps--the childish, unsteady 
           scrawl, the crudely drawn bodies. He devours each one.

           INT. BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - BRIDGEWATER, MA - NIGHT

           Bailey walks DeSalvo into a LAWYER ROOM. Sulko’s standing 
           at the door. Bottomly’s waiting for him at the table. 

           EXT. DESALVO HOUSE - DENVER SUBURBS - DAY

           Farron climbs out of a taxi in front of a two-family home 
           with a small front yard. JUDY and MICHAEL DESALVO play 
           LAWN DARTS by the walkway. Farron smiles. They don’t.

           INT. KITCHEN - DESALVO HOUSE - DENVER SUBURBS - LATER

           Irmgard sits at a small table across from Farron. 

                                 IRMGARD DESALVO
                                 (Thick GERMAN ACCENT)
                        ...I don’t know what you think I 
                        tell you about my husband. 

           Farron nods, as if he understands. He ashes a Pall Mall.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Ya know, ya got beautiful kids. 

                                 IMRGARD DESALVO
                        ...thank you. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I don’t have any. Wife wants them. 
                        I worry though, ya know? Think if 
                        I had them, I’d never stop. 

                                 IRMGARD DESALVO
                        You always worry. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Then how come you let them live 
                        with a murderer for 3 years?

           CONTINUED:

           Irmgard smiles. She can’t believe she walked into that.

                                 IRMGARD DESALVO
                        I want to tell you something, 
                        okay? When Albert goes to jail? I 
                        don’t hear from him, weeks. Then I 
                        get call one day from a man who 
                        says he’s Albert’s lawyer now and 
                        that I have to go away. I say, I 
                        have no money to go away. He says, 
                        no worry--it’s taken care of. Now 
                        all my life, I never met a man so 
                        generous. So I think and I ask you 
                        what I ask myself: why would he be 
                        so generous, he don’t think he can 
                        make the money back--make more 
                        money? Now Al’s a thief--he loves 
                        money. If lawyer senses money, you 
                        think Albert doesn’t? Did you ever 
                        consider why Albert confesses now?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You think he’s capable of murder?

           Irmgard shakes her head, as if Farron’s missed the point. 
           She looks beyond him to a window looking onto the yard.

                                 IRMGARD DESALVO
                        You see that girl? When she was 
                        born, doctors say she never walk. 
                        If she does it’ll be because of 
                        him, attention Al gave her.... 
                                 (Sipping)
                        But now they tell me he molested a 
                        girl her age. So what do I know.

           Farron looks out the window. He notices the knots in 
           Judy’s frog brace--double-half hitches with a bow. 

           INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE - STATE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Farron, suitcase in hand, arrives at his desk to find 
           Sulko putting together a line up of LADIES TRENCH COATS.

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        What’d the wife have to say?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        She thinks he’s the Music Man. 
                        That he’s full of fucking shit. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Well, Bottomly seems like he’s 
                        getting ready, buy a bridge then.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Farron stops unpacking and stares at Sulko. 

                                 FRAN SULKO (CONT’D)
                        He cut a deal so DeSalvo’d talk to 
                        him. Some kinda legal maneuver. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        ...that why he sent me to Denver? 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        ...what?

           Sulko looks at Farron as if he’s lost his mind. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Why would he send me there unless 
                        it was to get me outta the way?

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        ...pal, are you all right?

           Farron ignores him and storms over to Bottomly’s office. 

           LATER

           Farron is seated in a chair looking up at Brooke, who 
           leans on the lip of Bottomly’s desk, Bottomly behind it.

                                 A.G. BROOKE
                        Bob, it’s not a discussion. This 
                        is how this has to be done.  

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        We have no corroborative evidence 
                        here. All DeSalvo is doing is 
                        letting us know he’s the guy, so 
                        we can stop chasing our tails--we 
                        can’t use any of this against him. 
                        And as lawyers we can hear the 
                        confession to cut a deal. You 
                        can’t. You’re a cop. You hear it, 
                        you could be called to the stand--

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        -ya’ve never done this before. 

                                 A.G. BROOKE
                        Bob, do you want to know if he did 
                        it? Do you want to know if Albert 
                        DeSalvo is the Boston Strangler? 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Yeah. Of course I do.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Then this is how we’re doing it.

           LATER

           Farron sits at his desk, pouring over his CRIME SCENE 
           MAPS, comparing them to DeSalvo’s. Lighting a Pall Mall, 
           he looks up and sees Bottomly take a series of TAPES from 
           his briefcase and load them into his OFFICE COMBO-SAFE. 
           Bottomly puts on a coat, waves to his Secretary, leaves.

           LATER

           Farron watches the Secretary get up and throw on her 
           coat. He rushes over with DeSalvo’s MAPS and gestures 
           inside Bottomly’s office to his safe. The Secretary 
           audibly sighs, but opens the safe and stands aside.

           Farron leans in to put the maps away and drops them, 
           scattering them everywhere. He looks up, bashful. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        What, ya need me to pick em up?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        No. I can get it. You can go. 

           Farron watches her walk out and he grabs a DECK OF TAPES. 

           INT. FARRON HOUSE - QUINCY, MA - MIDNIGHT

           Farron sets up a reel-to-reel on his kitchen table.

           LATER

           Farron, seated, stares at a pile of tape boxes. He takes 
           out his Pall Malls, lights one, places the pack on the 
           table within reach, and hits play on the reel-to reel. 

           INT. LAWYER ROOM - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           A TAPE RECORDER spins at DeSalvo’s elbow. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        ...now you gotta understand that I 
                        been to this place before. Been in 
                        there coupla-three times on B&Es, 
                        made good money--which is why I 
                        was there that day. Didn’t expect 
                        to find anyone at home. But I open 
                        the door and there’s this sound--
           INT. 515 PARK DRIVE - BOSTON - DAY

           A lock POPS on the front door and DeSalvo eases in--only 
           to shake a SLEIGH BELL ORNAMENT on the knob. Al freezes. 

                                 PATRICIA BISSETTE (O.S.)
                        Yeah? Who is it?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Uh, it’s Al--Al from upstairs. I 
                        came down to see one’ya roommates.

                                 PATRICIA BISSETTE (O.S.)
                        Well, there’s no one here but me. 

           PATRICIA BISSETTE (23)--tall, brunette, pretty--walks 
           into the hallway in leopard pajamas, putting up her hair. 

           LAWYER ROOM

           DeSalvo earnestly looks Bottomly in the eye. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        She was nice to me, ya know? 
                        Obviously, I thought of doin her 
                        but I talked myself outta it. I 
                        wanted to get out. I could feel if 
                        I didn’t--see ya later. So I go-

           515 PARK DRIVE 

           DeSalvo pulls open the door. But Bissette grabs his arm.

                                 PATRICIA BISSETTE
                        Hey--ya don’t have to go. I’ll put 
                        on some coffee. Come sit down.

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        I’ll go get us some doughnuts. 

           DeSalvo opens the door again. But she pushes it shut. 

                                 PATRICIA BISSETTE
                        No need to go out. It’s cold out. 

           LAWYER ROOM

           Bailey watches Bottomly. Bottomly’s rapt. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Now, I tried to go--I really 
                        wanted to get outta there. I don’t 
                        want to do anything to her. She 
                        has been nice to me and I don’t 
                        wanna hurt her.

                        But I can feel the urge, I can 
                        feel it coming down on me like a 
                        big rig on the Tobin Bridge, and 
                        it is AFTER ME. But I’m tellin ya, 
                        I tried to leave. But she didn’t 
                        want me to go...

           Bissette drops the needle on a hi-fi player. 

           “Do You Hear What I Hear?” by Gloria Shayne Baker plays.

           She and DeSalvo sip coffee in front of a fire and a 
           Christmas tree. She talks and DeSalvo watches her foot 
           dangle over a crossed knee. Suddenly, DeSalvo puts down 
           his MUG and kneels in front of her and grabs her ankles.

                                 PATRICIA BISSETTE
                        Hey Al--take it easy will ya?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Look where I am. In two seconds I 
                        can have my tongue on ya clitoris. 
                        Ya ever had a man find ya clit? 

           LAWYER ROOM

           DeSalvo shakes his head, as if at himself.  

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        Then she stood up and turned her 
                        back on me. And before you know it-

           He sweeps a hand through the air. 

           FARRON’S KITCHEN

           Farron stares out his back door into a moonless night. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        But I am sorry about that one. 
                        Real sorry. I mean, why did I have 
                        to do that? She treated me nice, 
                        like a man. Why’d I have to do it?

           LAWYER ROOM

           Bottomly watches DeSalvo look off, thinking. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Are you asking me or yourself, Al?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        She treated me like a man. One of 
                        the few...but I remember pulling 
                        those things tight around her neck 
                        and how her face was swelling 
                        up...why would I do that? Why?

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        What do you mean, one of the few?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Women. All of them. My wife. Treat 
                        you like a fuckin animal, make you 
                        think ya dirty, wantin to do the 
                        things I did. Wife gave me an

                        Why didn’t you throttle her?

           DeSalvo glares at Bottomly. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY (CONT’D)
                        You never hit her?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Never touched her.

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        How come if she upset you?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Well, cause when I was a kid I 
                        watched my father kick in my ma’s 
                        face. Kicked her teeth right in.

           Bottomly and Bailey exchange a look. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        Said I was never going to do that, 
                        mother of my children. I mean, how 
                        can you respect ya father he goes 
                        around, does something like that?
                                 (Shrugging)
                        Guess I became that anyway though.

           Bottomly and Bailey watch DeSalvo shake his head at that. 

           FARRON’S KITCHEN

           Farron watches the TAPE run out on the player. 

                                 DR. AMES ROBEY (O.S.)
                        He’s an asshole...
           INT. BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - BRIDGEWATER, MA - DAY

           Farron is seated across a crowded desk from DR. ROBEY. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Whattya mean?

                                 DR. AMES ROBEY
                        He’s just very feminine. Overly 
                        sensitive. Likes to draw a lot of 
                        attention. Like I said, in a woman 
                        it’s normal. But in a rapist...?

           Dr. Robey shrugs, turns back to writing a report.  

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Did you hear his confessions?

           Dr. Robey drops his pen, shakes his head. 

                                 DR. AMES ROBEY
                        Oh yeah, “biggest thing since 
                        Brinks?” There’s just no way...

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        How so?

                                 DR. AMES ROBEY
                        He’s just not capable of it. You 
                        want to see some homicidal 
                        maniacs? Plenty of them here. 
                        That’s just not Albert DeSalvo.  

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Then how would he know as much as 
                        he does about what he’s saying? 

                                 DR. AMES ROBEY
                        He could’ve heard it from someone 
                        he met outside. Someone he met in 
                        the Charlestown lock-up. Could 
                        even be someone in here he met. 

           Robey turns back to his work. Farron stares at him.

                        ...met someone in here?

           Dr. Robey nods. Oh yeah. 

           INT. FARRON’S UNMARKED CRUISER - DAY 

           Farron stares out the window, thinking. Sulko’s driving.

                        We’ll bring him in. You pretend ya 
                        talking visiting two inmates. You 
                        don’t have to say anything...

                        Are there gonna be other men...?

           WENDY TIMILTY and MRS. LULKA are in the back seat. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Yeah but no one is going to know 
                        why ya there. Ya just visitors. 

                                 MRS. LULKA
                        You really think he’s the guy?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You tell us. 

           INT. VISITOR’S ROOM - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - DAY

           Mrs. Lulka and Timilty sit at two tables across from two 
           docile patients and their doctors, pretending to talk. 

           OUTSIDE THE ROOM

           Farron, Sulko and Bottomly watch through a wired-window. 

           VISITOR’S ROOM

           DeSalvo is brought in by a Bull and shoved into a bench 
           across from Dr. Robey. DeSalvo glares at the Bull, Robey. 

           OUTSIDE THE ROOM

           Farron watches Mrs. Lulka. She turns to him and shakes 
           her head. Nope. Farron looks to Timilty. She’s staring 
           deliberately right at Albert, squinting--conflicted.

           VISITOR’S ROOM

           A Guard walks a shackled Seracen into the room and seats 
           him in front of a tall, attractive BLACK WOMAN. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY (O.S.)
                        Who is this now?

                                 FRAN SULKO (O.S.)
                        His name’s Seracen. He was 
                        scheduled, have a visitor today. 

           OUTSIDE THE ROOM

           CONTINUED:

           Farron sees Seracen, sees him throw a look to MRS. LULKA 
           and SMILE. Lulka’s not paying attention. She’s talking to 
           her patient. But Timilty is. She’s squinting at Seracen. 
           Farron watches Seracen look away from Timilty, GRINNING. 

           LATER

           Farron and Sulko sit across from Lulka and Timilty. 

                                 MRS. LULKA
                        Wasn’t him--man you brought in. 
                        Other man looked familiar. Feel 
                        like I maybe seen him before.

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        He’s been on the news. Executed 
                        two people in a gas station. 

           Lulka nods. That’s probably it. Farron watches Timilty. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You all right?

                                 WENDY TIMILTY
                        His picture in the hospital...

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Ya sure it wasn’t him?

           Timilty nods, tearing up, wiping at her eyes. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                        What about the other guy?

           Sulko looks over at Farron, curious. 

                                 WENDY TIMILTY
                        What other guy?

           INT. FARRON HOUSE - QUINCY, MA - DAY

           Farron, in his Sunday best, stares at the TV, waiting. 

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...the riot has engulfed Watts--

           Wendy walks in putting in earrings. She shuts off the TV. 
           But Bobby doesn’t move. He just stares off into space. 

                                 WENDY FARRON 
                        Hon, you ready? Bobby...

           She looks to the door. Farron nods, as if just coming to.

                        Whattya thinkin about in there?

           Farron shrugs as if it’s not important. 

           INT. MARY STAR OF THE SEA CHURCH - SQUANTUM, MA - DAY

           Farron and Wendy slide into the last pew, the Church 
           filling up. Wendy leans over, offers him her Pall Malls. 

                                 WENDY FARRON
                        You want these? I think I’ma quit.

                        Why do ya wanna quit now? 

           They sit and Wendy whispers to him...

                                 WENDY FARRON
                        Got knocked up, ya believe it?

           The MASS BEGINS. The Church rises. Wendy looks over. 
           Farron’s still sitting. She sees him smiling back TEARS. 
           With a grin, Wendy urges him to stand for the Priest’s 
           entrance, but Farron just takes her hand and kisses it.

           Bailey and Bottomly sit in armchairs flanking him.

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        I just want him spared the chair.

                        Jack, tell me this isn’t a rare 
                        case--even for Massachusetts.

                        If he’s indicted for murder, I can

                        Well, I could shelve the case 
                        until after November. You really 
                        want to deal with a new A.G.?

           Farron and Sulko watch Brooke, Bottomly think.

                        ...what about the Green Man? 

           Brooke looks to Farron and Sulko.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        S’what the rape suspect was known 
                        as before DeSalvo was caught.

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        You have him tried on the rape 
                        charges. No death penalty. I’ll 
                        have him testify to the 13 murders-
                        -under oath, so it’s on record--
                        use that as proof of his insanity.

           Farron glares at Bottomly. Bottomly sees the look. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Uh, I don’t think that’s ethical--

                                 A.G. BROOKE
                        -how much time to prepare?

                        I’d take as much time as I could 
                        get. Six months? I think there’s a 
                        senate seat opening up, someone 
                        could use six months of publicity. 

           Bottomly leans forward to speak. Brooke holds up a hand. 

                                 A.G. BROOKE
                        I’ll push for six months. But let 
                        me be frank about this, Lee--
                        there’s NO publicity on this.

           Farron watches Bottomly wilt into his seat.

           Bottomly tries to walk away. Farron stops him.

                        criminal trial, the TV, a Senate

                        referred to as a Jekyl and Hyde-
                        type schizophrenic. At times he 
                        appears normal--even charming--
                        capable of guilt. But at other 
                        times, he is compelled by an 
                        absolutely insatiable compulsion 
                        that overwhelms his ability to 
                        distinguish right from wrong. 

                                 F. LEE BAILEY
                        Do you believe he was in control 
                        of his actions during his crimes?

                                 DR. MEZER
                        No.

                        What about the actions that Mr. 
                        DeSalvo took to get into these 
                        women’s houses to “uncontrollably” 
                        rape them, were these compulsive?

                        If he had, say, policemen at his 
                        elbow, would that have affected 
                        the way he treated these women?

                        As the law reads, Dr. Mezer, was 
                        DeSalvo sane at the time--

           Everyone in the court turns to Judge Moynihan.

                        I’m going to allow it. 

                                 DR. MEZER
                        No. He was not.

                        At Bridgewater, do you remember 
                        your fellow inmate, Mr. DeSalvo, 
                        discussing his conquests?

                                 RASSNER
                        He spent a lotta time braggin bout 
                        how he’d kept the cops guessing. 
                        He’d say alla time, “I am a pro--
                        you gotta unnastand I am a pro.” 
                        He said that a lot in the yard.

                                 A.D.A CONN
                        Did Mr. DeSalvo seem sane to you?

                                 RASSNER
                        He was sane enough to tally all 
                        the money he was going to make. 

                                 A.D.A CONN
                        What do you mean by that?

                                 RASSNER
                        Well he and his buddy there 
                        figured with the reward--$10k per 
                        victim--he’d clean up pretty well. 
                        He was sane enough for that math. 

           Farron watches Bailey wince and decline a redirect.

                        Maybe the Strangler just saw his

                        across the street, a Mrs. Colella, 
                        looks out her window and sees a

                        his business. He’s nobody--just a 
                        local nut. But Mrs. Colella sees

           Farron leans toward Sulko to make his point. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                        Now if you believe DeSalvo, he 
                        would’ve had to have entered 224 
                        Lafayette in a matter of minutes 
                        between when Molinario saw the 
                        Stranger and when the neighbor  
                        noticed Corbin hadn’t knocked on 
                        her door. But none of those people 
                        saw DeSalvo that day. Now imagine 
                        the precision it would’ve taken 
                        for him to break into, or talk his 
                        way past Corbin, a lady gettin 
                        ready to go to Mass, and not be 
                        seen by any body of those people.

                        That’s true. But that’s a question 
                        an experienced investigator woulda 
                        asked DeSalvo in an interrogation.

           DeSalvo rises, shoulders humbly bent, eyes on the floor. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Before they brought me in here 
                        last time, ya honor, back in ‘61, 
                        I said to the cop, “I think I got 
                        something seriously wrong with me, 
                        ya know? Can’t say what--I’m not 
                        well-educated--but I think maybe I 
                        could explain it to a doctor.” 
                        Now, I can tell you my whole life 
                        there’s been somethin building up 
                        in me. I can always feel it. And 
                        back in ‘61 I was gettin to a 
                        point--between the rough goin at 
                        home, my wife, and the easy locks 
                        in the thousands of apartments in 
                        Boston--I was gonna get to where 
                        somethin was gonna have to happen. 
                        So I asked for the doctor. And the 
                        doctor come, and I don’t remember 
                        his name, but he agreed, ya know? 
                        He said, “Al, you got something 
                        wrong with ya.” Psychopathic 
                        tendencies, he said. And he 
                        suggested to the last judge I 
                        shouldn’t just be put in jail. But 
                        that’s what happened. Judge put me 
                        in jail. Why--I don’t know. But I 
                        didn’t get no help in the County. 
                        I served 11 months in there...
                                 (Shuddering breath)
                        Then I came out in April, 1962. 
                        First “Strangler” murder was in 
                        June that year. Now, I’m not sayin 
                        it’s not my fault--I did those 
                        things. But by then it was too 
                        late for me, or any of those 
                        women. I wish it wasn’t like that.

                        did these things. I’m not a man 
                        who can hurt anyone. I’m very 
                        emotional. I break up at the least 
                        things...but here I am. I done 
                        them. And what I’m trying to say 
                        is, I know I’m sick. But I asked 
                        for help. I tried. And someone 
                        failed me. I’m not sure who. But 
                        someone failed everyone here...

           Farron leans against a wall staring at a mural of the 
           “Charge of the Mass. 7th Cavalry,” an officer’s rifle 
           pointing right at him. Farron moves, the barrel follows.

                        Bobby...Bob...

           Farron turns, and as if coming to, finds Sulko at his 
           elbow, handing him a cardboard cup of coffee. 

                                 FRAN SULKO (CONT’D)
                        How much ya think he gets?

                        ...nothing. He gets an acquittal.

           Down the hall, a Bailiff throws opens the Courtroom.

           COURTROOM

           DeSalvo rises before the Judge. 

                                 JUDGE MOYNIHAN 
                        Albert Henry DeSalvo, the Court of 
                        Middlesex County finds you guilty 
                        on all counts. And considering the 
                        severe and convincing outside 
                        testimony brought into this court 
                        by your own counsel, I sentence 
                        you to life in prison at the MCI: 
                        Walpole--with no chance of parole.

           The GAVEL BANGS. DeSalvo recoils. And Farron watches the 
           PRESS descend on Bailey and the BAR, FLASH BULBS POPPING.

                        Dumb fuck admitted it.

           Farron shakes his head in disgust, and they turn to go.

           looks around--every woman in the place has on STOCKINGS.

           DeSalvo is seated behind wire-threaded glass, his elbow 
           on the table and his head in his hand, covering his eyes.

                        on appeal. We’ve just started, Al.  

           Bailey, seated across from him, is earnestly trying to 
           look into DeSalvo’s eyes. But DeSalvo won’t look up.

                        into better care--I swear to you. 

           DeSalvo turns up his head, finally looks at Bailey.

                        You swore to me if I got on record-

                        What about the reward money?

           Bailey looks away, as if searching for the words.

                        The thing about that--it was 10k

                        don’t know where you got that.

           DeSalvo rolls his head in anguish.

           DeSalvo turns his back to Seracen, washes his genitals. 
           Seracen smiles at this and squirts water through his 
           teeth into DeSalvo’s ear. DeSalvo looks over. The fuck?

           The WAR ROOM is being taken apart. Secretaries strip the 
           PHOTOS off wall-length corkboards. Janitors wheel out 
           cabinets on dollies. Farron and Sulko clean out their 
           desks. A JANITOR arrives at Sulko’s side with a cart.

           DeSalvo’s tapes, copies of his MAPS, CRIME SCENE PHOTOS, 
           etc. He HEARS FOOTSTEPS and quickly upends the photos.

           Wendy forces a smile but kisses him and walks out. Farron 
           watches her disappear into the other room and turns back 
           to the evidence. He sorts through DESALVO’S MAP COPIES. 

           LATER

           Farron walks back into the kitchen with an ARCHITECT’S 
           TUBE and slides a roll of tract paper out of it. He 
           uncoils the elastic from around the tract and cautiously 
           lays his own HAND DRAWN CRIME SCENE MAPS on the table. 

           He sorts through DeSalvo’s maps and finds the one tagged, 
           ANNA SLESSERS. Farron lays it on his map and compares 
           details: lay outs; position of the body; evidence, etc.

           Farron rolls up his Slessers’ map and finds DeSalvo’s for 
           NINA NICHOLLS. He lays it out, again comparing it to his.

           Farron sets up his reel-to-reel and threads it with tape.

                        Ended up in Salem there. I see 
                        this space in front of a building--

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        You just saw a space? 

           INT. 1958 CHEVY COUPE - DAY

           DeSalvo drives, his leg pumping restlessly, cruising by 
           crowds of twos and threes--families in their Sunday best. 
           Somewhere in the distance, a Church bell peals 11 times. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (O.S.)
                        That’s all. All it took.

           DeSalvo parks in front of 224 LAFAYETTE ST. and through 
           his back window, he sees the ANDRUZZI kid riding off.

                        How did you get Corbin to open the 
                        door? This is nearly a year and a 
                        half into the Strangler’s spree...

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Well, it was foggy that day. 
                        Rained over the weekend. Said I 
                        was there bout a leaky window. 
                        Always had an answer for them... 

           INT. 224 LAFAYETTE STREET - SALEM, MA - DAY

           Albert leans into the door for apartment #3.

                                 EVELYN CORBIN (O.S.)
                        Can’t you come back another time? 
                        I’m just getting ready for Mass. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        I got a full time job, lady. I’m 
                        just here helping out the Super. 

           He waits. The door opens. EVELYN CORBIN (60)--very young 
           for her age, looks 45; well built--gestures DeSalvo in. 

                                 EVELYN CORBIN
                        Sorry to be so suspicious. But ya 
                        never know who’s knockin on ya

                        Boston Strangler?

           DeSalvo holds open the door.

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        I’ll leave, you want me to.

                                 EVELYN CORBIN
                        No. I’m just foolin with ya.

           LAWYER ROOM

           DeSalvo leans back in his seat. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Then Corbett--Corbin--leads me 
                        inna the bedroom, where a leak 
                        actually was, and that’s where I 
                        pulled the knife. She asks me what 
                        I want. I tell her I’m gonna fuck 
                        her. But she starts crying, says 
                        she’s under doctor’s orders--can’t 
                        fuck. So she says, I’ll do it the 
                        other way. I say, “ya’ll blow me?”

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        She offered to do that?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        I mighta suggested it. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        That was nice of you.

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        To be honest, I was gonna fuck her 
                        anyway, but she was all upset, so 
                        I suggested that. Jumped all over 
                        the chance--put a pillow on the 
                        ground next to the bed, kneel on; 
                        everythin. Knew what she was doin. 

           224 LAFAYETTE

           DeSalvo, laid out on the bed, watches Corbin spit into a 
           tissue, eyes tearing, her bust hanging out of her torn 
           shirt. He takes her and gently guides her onto the bed.  

                                 EVELYN CORBIN
                        You promised me...you promised...

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Ya gonna be all right, hon...

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Corbin’s head hits the bed. She gasps and DeSalvo leans 
           in, gesturing her quiet. He covers her face with a 
           pillow. He can hear her cry. Then he SQUEEZES her THROAT. 

           LAWYER ROOM

           DeSalvo shrugs, sighing. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        ...after I saw her spit?

           Brushes the top of the table.  

           INT. FARRON’S HOUSE - QUINCY, MA - NIGHT

           Farron, exhausted, thumbs FAST FORWARD. 

           LAWYER ROOM

           Bottomly flips a sheet on his legal pad. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Now tell me about Joanne Graff...

           DeSalvo nods, takes out a roll of Lifesavers. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Mint?

           Bottomly stares at him, incredulous. Al pops a mint. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (CONT’D)
                        Well, Graff...she was the one with 
                        the chest. Yeah. Her breasts were 
                        very large, 38, very smooth--
                        hefty, well-built, beautiful body, 
                        but no face. Was almost a shame...

           FARRON’S HOUSE

           Disgusted, Farron takes a last draw off his Pall Mall, 
           stabs it out in an ashtray and reaches for the STOP. Then-

           LAWYER ROOM

           DeSalvo chews his Lifesaver, loudly. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY
                        Do you remember the date?

           FARRON’S HOUSE

           Farron hand pauses at the STOP BUTTON. He hears SILENCE.

           Farron hits stop and plows through his notes, frantically 
           flipping pages. He finds JOANN GRAFF: died, 11/23/63. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        He lead him...

           Farron hits rewind, punches play.

                        He fucking lead him.

           Farron yanks the tape from the player, furiously winds it 
           up, and digs through his EVIDENCE BOX for another. 

           LATER

           Farron holds the earphones to his head, focused.

                        ...and you raped her?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (O.S.)
                        Her I raped. Definitely raped her. 

                                 JOHN BOTTOMLY (O.S.)
                        It seems strange, Albert, given 
                        your history, your prior victims, 
                        why you’d choose to rape an older--

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (O.S.)
                        That had nothing to do with it--

           Farron looks down at the MEDICAL REPORT: 

           BLAKE, HELEN. NO SIGN OF VAGINAL TRAUMA; RAPE.

           LATER

           Farron peels through an evidence report, listening.

                        Why did you put the wine bottle 
                        inside her, inside Nicholls?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (0.S.)
                        I don’t want to talk about that...

                        Why are you so reluctant? It is 
                        because you don’t understand it?

                                 BOBBY FARRON

           They both look up. A Guard places a letter on the sink. 

           CELL

           DeSalvo reads, mouthing the words. His finger runs over 
           the words: “...the truth.” And: “Sincerely, Det. Farron.” 

           INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - BOSTON POLICE HQ - DUSK

           Farron sorts through the mail on his desk, finds an 
           envelope marked “BRIDGEWATER STATE,” tears it open.

                        Here’s the story of the Strangler,

                        killed thirteen women, young and 
                        old...today he sits in a prison 
                        cell, deep inside only a secret he 
                        can tell. People everywhere are 
                        still in doubt. Is the Strangler 
                        in prison, or roaming about?

           The Captain rests his ass on the lip of his desk.

           Farron glances at two wraithlike I.A. MEN (40s).

                        They got a call. A guard down,

                        been trading letters with DeSalvo. 
                        Now, that ain’t you, is it? Please 
                        tell me that ain’t you, Farron...

           Farron looks away, deliberately, refusing to answer. 

           LATER

           Farron, in a patrolman’s uniform, stands at ROLL CALL.

           Bob laughs. A Cop walks by the CAFE, bangs on the glass. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Looks like I gotta screw.

           Farron nods and walks out into the rain on LOWER WASH.

           DeSalvo and Seracen are seated on a raised edge of stone 
           at the base of the hospital’s wall. A tall BLACK MAN with 
           a TROMBONE paces the yard playing Gershwin SHOW TUNES.

                                 TEDDY SERACEN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like being lied to. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        I heard ya--

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        -I’ll find out if ya lying.  

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        I know. I believe ya...

           Seracen smiles, claps DeSalvo on the knee and looks away 
           to light a smoke. Al looks at his hand--it’s shaking. 

           INSERT: FEBRUARY 24th, 1967.

           INT. CELL - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           DeSalvo stuffs his bed full of clothes, tucks it in. 

           LATER

           Albert crouches by his cell door. Behind him, it seems 
           there’s someone in the bed. Suddenly, the DOOR LOCK POPS. 

           LATER

           A FAT GUARD (40s) waddles the halls, spinning a BATON on 
           lanyard through his fingers. He rounds a corner and--

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           DeSalvo TOSSES a shirt over his face and pulls it tight. 
           Another Inmate grabs the Guard at the knees and ANOTHER 
           smashes the Guard in the TEMPLE with his own baton. 

           LATER

           Albert and the two other INMATES slink down a tiled, moon-
           lit corridor to an ELEVATOR SHAFT that’s blocked off and 
           plastered with “REPAIR” signs. They force the door open.  

           LATER

           Albert and the Inmates carefully lower themselves down a 
           CONSTRUCTION SCAFFOLDING inside the elevator shaft. One 
           Inmate slips and knocks a 2x4 out of the scaffolding. The 
           board clatters down the entire length of the shaft and--

           BOOM. It hits bottom. DeSalvo and his accomplices hold 
           on, breathless, and listen. NOTHING. They keep moving. 

           LATER

           Reaching the bottom, Albert and his crew carefully, 
           silently, slide a long 10’ plank out of the scaffolding.

           EXT. YARD - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - LATER

           From the shadow of a doorway, they watch a SPOTLIGHT run 
           across the brick wall and pass by. They dart out and--

           Albert leans the plank up against the outer brick wall 
           and an Inmate runs up it, the other holding it steady. 
           DeSalvo shimmies up the plank and the Inmate boosts him 
           onto the wall. Albert straddles it, pulls the Inmates up.

           LATER

           Albert lowers himself over, dropping into a SNOW BANK. 

           EXT./INT. BOSTON POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Farron marches past a massive PRESS CONFERENCE on the 
           front steps and into the foyer. He’s greeted by Duggan.

                                 CAPTAIN DUGGAN
                        Figured ya should be here, case he 
                        holes up, wants to make contact.

           Farron flashes the RECORD-AMERICAN: $5000, DEAD OR ALIVE. 
           INT. MASS. TRANSIT AUTHORITY BUS - DUSK

           DeSalvo leans on the window, a small radio to his ear. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...countless sightings at Logan...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Can you believe it?

           DeSalvo looks over. A UNIFORMED LYNN COP, tie undone, is 
           shaving with an electric razor, as if on his way to work. 

                                 COP
                        Called us all back, vacation cause 
                        of this cooch. Can ya believe it?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        No. I can’t.

           INT. SPORTING GOOD STORE - LYNN, MA - DUSK

           DeSalvo strolls in. Behind the counter, a Proprietor (40) 
           looks up from the paper. His SON’s (16) stacking shelves.

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        I use your phone?

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        Only for emergencies. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        ...I’d say this qualifies, pal. 

           LATER

           Farron rushes through the front door, BLUE LIGHTS 
           FLASHING outside, and finds DeSalvo drinking tea at the 
           counter with the Proprietor and his son, both smiling.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                                 (to his Son)
                        ...shouldn’t be listening to this.

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        ...worked my way through them 
                        Pollyannas right up to the Russian 
                        border--and the whole way back!

           Proprietor laughs, shaking his head. DeSalvo sees Farron. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You ready, Al?

           CONTINUED:

           DeSalvo, finishes his tea, shakes the Proprietor’s hand.

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        Been a pleasure, pal. Ya gotta 
                        fine establishment here. Now ya 
                        take care of that kid, all right?

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        You watch out, Al. 

           DeSalvo winks, walks over and slaps Farron on the back.

           INT. FARRON’S BOSTON POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

           Farron glances in the rearview at DeSalvo. DeSalvo’s 
           grinning, looking out the back at his POLICE ESCORT. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Whattya look so happy about?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO

                        now. I’ll be safe in Walpole. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON

                                 ALBERT DESALVO
                        No. I was on my way. I was. But 
                        then I thought, ya know, where am 
                        I gonna go? My kids are gone. 
                        Wife’s fucking some other guy now. 
                        I realized something, ya know? No 
                        matter where I end up? I’m still 
                        gonna be there. Fucked up. Crazy. 
                        Figured...the fuck’s the point?

           Farron watches him in the REARVIEW.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Can I ask ya somethin?

           INT. KITCHEN - FARRON’S HOUSE - QUINCY, MA - DUSK

           Farron, in uniform, is at the table, feeding an infant. 
           ARABELLA (7) is across from him playing with her food. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Just eat it for me, will ya?

           The PHONE RINGS. Farron groans, carries the baby to it.

                        Detective Farron? Albert DeSalvo--

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        -the hell d’ya get this number?

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (O.S.)
                        Please, don’t hang up. Sorry if I 
                        scared ya but I needa talk to ya.

           Wendy walks in, hair wrapped in a towel. She sees his 
           face, mouths, “who is it?” Farron hands her the baby. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        What the fu--hell do you want?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Scared of what?

           Wendy mouths, “who is it?” again. Farron waves her off. 

                                 ALBERT DESALVO (O.S.)
                        Him. He’s back in here. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON

                        I can’t say right now...but HIM. 

           Farron jerks his head, quick, as if dislodging a thought.

           INT. CELL - MCI: WALPOLE - NIGHT

           A door BUZZES. Two Guards enter DeSalvo’s cell. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Got a call, ya life’s in danger. 
                        Warden wants ya in the infirmary. 

           INFIRMARY

           DeSalvo comes to, the ward lit only with the light 
           seeping in from the hall. He looks around. Ward’s empty.  

           LATER

           DeSalvo comes to again, scared, as if having heard 
           something. He sits up and looks up the ward--empty beds-- 
           and back down--more empty beds. He looks to the HALL 
           DOOR. An unbroken beam of LIGHT wraps all the way around.

           DeSalvo tries the door. It’s locked. He yawns, turns and--

           DeSalvo’s pulled to the ground by an arm around his 
           throat, his head conking off the tile. He struggles to 
           get out of the headlock but two legs scissor lock his. 

           Chocking, gasping, DeSalvo swings his elbows back, 
           wildly. But a TOOTHBRUSH SHIV glints in the light and 
           sticks him under the ribs. Blood BURSTS out of DeSalvo’s 
           mouth and the SHIV sticks him, again and again--15 times.

           DeSalvo slowly stops fighting and the arm drops from his 
           neck. He glances up at his assailant and the SHIV is 
           jammed into his throat. Shocked, DeSalvo paws at his 
           jugular, as if to keep the blood inside, and parts his 
           mouth to SCREAM. But all that comes out is a wet cough. 

           Al’s left to die on the floor, clutching his own throat.

           INT. FRONT DESK - MCI: WALPOLE - DAY

           Farron flashes his BADGE to a Prison Screw (20s).

                        To see Albert DeSalvo. 

           The Screw looks up from the REGISTER, mouth open.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - MCI: WALPOLE - DAY 

           THE WARDEN (50s)--glasses, civil servant belly--is seated 
           at a desk in front of a window looking out onto a forest. 
           Farron sits in front of him, trying not to look upset.

                                 THE WARDEN
                        It was most likely a gangland 
                        execution. The report I have is 
                        that it was over a side of bacon. 

           Farron stares at the Warden, clenching his jaw. 

                                 THE WARDEN (CONT’D)
                        There are few luxuries in here, 
                        Mr. Farron. You’d be miserable to 
                        know it happens all the time.

           INT. FARRON’S HOUSE - QUINCY, MA - NIGHT

           Farron holds Arabella, the two of them watching Lee 
           Marvin be killed in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.  
           Wendy rushes in, breathless, the BABY CRYING, and places 
           her in Farron’s lap. Farron looks up, as if coming to. 

                                 WENDY FARRON
                        You try. I gotta go to work. 

           Farron yawns and tries to coax the baby quiet--rocking 
           her, cooing to her, pleading. But the Baby won’t stop. 
           Farron looks exhausted. The Baby SCREAMS in his face. 

                                 ARABELLA
                        What’s wrong with her, Dad?

                        I don’t know. I don’t know...

           LATER

           Alone at his kitchen table, Farron tears through boxes of 
           CASE FILES, exhaustively searching for something he can’t 
           find. He finishes with one box, tosses it, tears open 
           another and rifles it. Pulling a file, Timilty’s ARTIST 
           RENDERING slips out and drifts to the floor. Farron picks 
           it up. Curious, he compares it to DeSalvo’s mug shot... 

           It bares a resemblance. Farron pulls out the RENDERING 
           drawn from LULKA’s description. It also bares a 
           resemblance. Farron keeps digging. Then stops. He flips 
           back a few pages. It’s a picture of Seracen on the STAND 
           being questioned by Bailey, DeSalvo behind them at the 
           defendant's table. Farron holds up the POLICE SKETCHES.

           They kind of look like DeSalvo. Then he slides them next 
           to Seracen. They are Seracen. Farron FLASHES on Seracen 
           grinning at Timilty inside Bridgewater State Hospital.

                        Looks familiar...

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        He the guy you saw with Langham, 
                        when Sophie Clark lived upstairs?

           Miss Lulka stares at the photo, her eyebrows rise. 

           INT. BAR - LOCKE-OBER - BOSTON - NIGHT

           Farron leans on the rail, throwing back a martini. 

                                 FRAN SULKO (O.S.)
                        You all right, Bob?

           Sulko’s next to him in a tailored suit. Bob just stares.

                                 FRAN SULKO (CONT’D)
                        Just asking.

                        Didn’t realize ya did this well...

           Farron points out the POSH bar. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Did you need something?

                        In private practice ya got means

           Sulko gestures to the Keep for the check and throws his 
           American Express on the bar. Farron picks up the card.

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                        Thought you were private practice?

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        I got bought out.

                        Yeah? By who?

           Sulko stares at Farron, trying to read him. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Lee Bailey.

           Farron glares at Sulko and Sulko looks away, knowing he’s 
           fucked up. Farron drops the credit card and walks out. 

           EXT. ONE STORY RANCH - SPRINGFIELD, MA - NIGHT

           Farron pulls into the drive in a ‘67 El Dorado. 

           LATER

           JOANNA GEECHEE (30s)--black, straight hair, well-kept 
           figure--cautiously opens the door. Farron badges her.

                        How’d you find us?

           INT. ONE STORY RANCH - SPRINGFIELD, MA - LATER

           Farron sits in an armchair across from Geechee, who’s in 
           tears being consoled by her HUSBAND (40s)--a big man.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Gonna cost me season tickets, the

                        Why’d you do that? We got kids--

                        -I got two. And a wife. And if 
                        he’s still out there. If 
                        DeSalvo...I don’t know if I could 
                        sleep. Don’t know how you could.

           Farron hands her Seracen’s mug. Geechee hyperventilates.

                        You know him? Baby, do you know

                        ...friend of Junior’s. He called 
                        him Teddy Bear--Teddy Seracen. 

           Farron’s eyes glint. 

           INT. WARD F - BRIDGEWATER STATE HOSPITAL - DAY 

           Farron follows Robey down a hall of damp, rotting cells. 

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        He’s one terrific son of a bitch, 
                        I’ll tell you that much. He used 
                        to be an assassin--though that’s 
                        too romantic a word for what he 
                        was. Ever heard of Buddy McLean?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Yeah. I heard of him. 

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        Seracen killed people for him. He 
                        got sent to me cause what he did 
                        was so appallingly anti-social no 
                        one believed he could’ve been 
                        sane. He was close with DeSalvo. 
                        Showed up around the same time. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Just bout when the killin stopped. 

           Dr. Robey slows his stride and looks over at Farron. 

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        Look, I told you years ago--
                        DeSalvo wasn’t him, wasn’t capable 
                        of being the Strangler. No one 
                        listened then. Know why that is? 

           Dr. Robey stops walking, leans in confidentially. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DR. ROBEY (CONT’D)
                        Because that was the biggest trial 
                        in Massachusetts since we were 
                        burning witches. Can you imagine 
                        what would happen if someone 
                        proved they got it wrong? Every 
                        recidivist would want a retrial. 
                        Everyone that got rich: Bailey, 
                        Bottomly; all the cops that got 
                        promoted; the Senator that got 
                        elected, what would they do?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I don’t care about all that.

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        Well, you absolutely should. 

           Robey turns, starts walking again. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        D’ya think he’s capable--Seracen?

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        You ever had a point in your life 
                        where you didn’t think it could 
                        get any worse? Then it did and 
                        made you wonder how long a 
                        nightmare could actually last? 
                        That’s Seracen’s potential. He’s 
                        everything you imagine if you 
                        stare too long into the darkness. 

           Robey walks faster. But Farron grabs him. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Why didn’t ya believe DeSalvo?

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        Cause DeSalvo was an asshole. He’d 
                        do anything to make someone he 
                        liked like him. Seracen convinced 
                        him to take the blame, I’m sure. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Why would DeSalvo do that?

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        Because he was sick--and he knew 
                        he was sick. Most crazy people 
                        have the luxury of not knowing. He 
                        actually made a logical decision. 
                        Who would you think would get 
                        better care: the Boston Strangler, 
                        or Al the Shitbum from Malden?

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        The state went to a lot of trouble 
                        to put DeSalvo away for life. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        And you work for the State.

           Robey looks away and nods. He starts walking again.

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        And I’ll do my best to block it. 

           INT. PAROLE BOARD - MCI: WALPOLE - DAY

           A DOOR LOCK HUMS and POPS, and TEDDY SERACEN is escorted 
           in by two GUARDS. He’s placed within a grated CELL before 
           the PAROLE BOARD--two men (50s) and the CHAIRWOMAN (40s). 
           He glances over his shoulder and spots Doctor Robey and 
           Farron in the front row. Seracen grins, pleasantly waves.

           LATER

                                 CHAIRWOMAN (O.S.)
                        ...is there anyone who’d like to 
                        offer state’s testimony? 

           Dr. Robey stands, half raising a hand. 

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        Dr. Ames Robey, Bridgewater State. 
                        I administered to Mr. Seracen here 
                        for a number of years in the mid 
                        ‘60s. Back then, I found him to be 
                        of a classic psychopathic with--

                                 CHAIRWOMAN
                        -when was the last time you 
                        examined the inmate, Dr. Robey?

           Farron looks up at Robey. 

                                 DR. ROBEY
                        ...three years ago, ma’am.

                        transferred back to Walpole to 
                        commute his sentence? If he was so 
                        sick, why didn’t you keep him?

           Farron looks to Robey. Robey struggles for the answer. 

                                 CHAIRWOMAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s all, Doctor. Thank you. 

           The GAVEL BANGS. Farron winces. Seracen gets up laughing.

           INT. VISITOR’S ROOM - MCI: WALPOLE - LATER

           Farron sits behind the wired-glass, waiting, his eyes 
           drifting off, a Pall Mall burning down to his knuckles. 
           Suddenly, a lock CLANKS OPEN and a DOOR BOOMS WIDE. 
           Farron shakes his head, as if coming to, and watches--

           Seracen struts in and jauntily takes the chair across 
           from him. Seeing Farron glaring at him, Seracen smiles a 
           BIG SHIT-EATING GRIN and eyefucks Farron right back. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You know, pal...I know ya him.

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        Yeah? Prove it.  

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I will. Cause ya mighta had Robey 
                        wettin his drawers in there, but I 
                        know ya just a full of shit punk. 

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        And how’s that?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Ya left a witness alive--

           Farron’s face drops, realizing what he’s done.

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        You know, when I get out of here, 
                        buddy? Lot of people Ima have to 
                        get acquainted with. How old’s ya 
                        daughter now? She got tits yet? 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        ...Ima be waitin for you.  

           Seracen’s grins and Farron leaps up, punches the GLASS. 
           But Seracen doesn’t eve blink. Farron wheels, storms out. 
           EXT. HANCOCK BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Farron is seated on a bench looking out onto the OLD 
           HANCOCK BUILDING. The new building--a pillar of blue 
           glass--is half-built behind it. Sulko sits next to him.

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Remember when this was just a big 
                        fucking hole in the ground? 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Remember when it was a train yard.

                        Used to be all swamp. Then they 
                        filled it, a 100 years of garbage 
                        Built a whole new city on shit... 

           Farron lights a Pall Mall, sighs the smoke out his nose.

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        ...pal, you all right?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I hate to bug ya, Franny. But I 
                        got no one else. I need help.  

           Sulko stares at him concerned, waiting.  

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                        Seracen’s getting out. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        You been talking to Robey, 
                        listenin to his fuckin theories?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        He talked about my daughter, Fran. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        Who? Seracen?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Asked if she had tits yet. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        How’d he know ya had a family?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        How’d DeSalvo know about Clark? 
                        You work for Bailey. You know.

           Sulko shakes his head, looking at his shoes.

                        ...what can I do?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Tail him from Walpole. 

                                 FRAN SULKO
                        You remember the first time with 
                        DeSalvo? Ya know I can’t tail for 
                        shit. Lemme stay at the house. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Nah, if something happened, I’d 
                        never forgive ya. Can’t do that. 

                                 SULKO
                        Thought ya already did that. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Nah. Ya always been a pal, Fran.

           Sulko nods, smiling slightly. He appreciates that.   

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           The front gate of WALPOLE opens, and Seracen, in an ill-
           fitting sharkskin suit, walks out into a miserable, 
           drizzling RAIN and climbs aboard a WHITE PRISON BUS. 

           Sulko waits in a ‘67 MUSTANG outside a wooded ACCESS RD. 
           He smokes, watching the rain trickle onto the leather 
           inside of his cracked window. He spots the WHITE BUS 
           rolling by, flips his smoke out the window and follows. 

           Cradling the baby, Farron watches the NEWS on WATERGATE 
           from the couch. He keeps glancing at the PHONE. Wendy, 
           holding Arabella in her lap, watches Farron, curious. 

                                 RICHARD NIXON (O.S.)
                        ...and then--you destroy yourself.

           Inside a GREYHOUND STATION, Sulko lurks behind a 
           PAPERBACK STAND watching Seracen. A CALL RINGS OUT for 
           the next bus to Boston. Sulko spies Seracen getting up. 

           Farron, leaning on a door jam, watches Wendy tuck 
           Arabella into bed and sing, “Hush Little Baby.” He looks 
           out the door, down the hall, as if still waiting. 

           Sulko follows the GREYHOUND up Rt. 128 towards BOSTON.

           Sulko watches Seracen depart in a throng at SOUTH STATION 
           and blend into a large crowd crossing Atlantic Ave.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Sulko follows Seracen into the COMBAT ZONE, neon 
           glittering off a rain-slicked Lower Washington, and wades 
           through a sea of HUGGER-MUGGERS, SAILORS, and JOHNS. 

           Farron sits at his kitchen table, smoking, thinking. 

           Sulko sees Seracen step into the TEDDY BARE LOUNGE. Sulko 
           gives him a few seconds lead and follows inside. But 
           Sulko finds the lounge vacant, empty--Seracen’s gone. 

           Sulko bolts through the kitchen, holding an ID out at a 
           pursuing MANAGER, and crashes out the back door into an 
           alley. But the alley’s empty. Sulko rushes back inside, 
           tears open a bathroom, a walk-in freezer, a large pantry--
           all of them empty. Furious, Sulko kicks out a shelf of 
           pots and pans and sends them clattering all over. FUCK. 

           EXT. 315 HUNTINGTON AVE. - BACK BAY - NIGHT

           Seracen stares at the letters 315 embossed on the door of 
           a tenement squeezed between two store fronts. Grinning, 
           Seracen pulls the door. It’s locked. He hits a button on 
           the call box. Nothing. He hits another. The door BUZZES.

           INT. 315 HUNTINGTON AVE. - BACK BAY - LATER

           Seracen puts an ear to a DOOR and closing his eyes, can 
           HEAR the whisper of Johnny Carson inside. Taking a cut-up 
           piece of PLASTIC, Seracen jimmies the lock--pops it open. 

           Gently easing the door in, he finds the apartment dark, 
           quiet--the only light the glow of the TV down the hall. 

           Moving in slow, his feet silent on the CARPET, Seracen 
           slinks down the length of the hallway pressing his back 
           to the wall. Seracen peers around a corner into the 
           LIVING ROOM. It’s empty--a blanket left on the couch in 
           front of the TV. Seracen turns the tube off and looks up--

           He sees a short hallway and a closed door. 

           Carefully swinging the door open, Seracen stands in the 
           frame, waiting. He sees a bed, moonlight caressing a form 
           in the sheets. The room is silent, still. He walks in and-

           FOOTSTEPS. Seracen turns and Farron drills him in the 
           face with a butt of a shotgun. Seracen goes down--hard. 

           EXT. SQUANTUM AIRPORT (ABANDONED) - NIGHT

           A BPD cruiser rolls up to a rundown hangar, its break 
           lights flashing in the dark. A plane is HEARD overheard. 
           INT. ABANDONED HANGAR - SQUANTUM AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Farron watches Seracen come to in the light of a lantern 
           placed between them. Seracen’s duct taped to a chair--eye 
           socket, cheek, nose broken; face bloody. Farron, shotgun 
           in his lap, lights a Pall Mall and points it at Seracen.  

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Face’s all busted up there. Gotta 
                        hurt like a fuckin bas-tard...

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        Yeah. It don’t feel good...

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Should learn’a appreciate that. 
                        Friend of mine useda say that’s a 
                        reminder, ya human--pain, fear. I 
                        used to be terrified of you, ya 
                        know? Don’t know why, lookin at ya 
                        now. Musta been the not knowin-- 
                        not knowing who ya were, if ya 
                        were human. Whatta you afraid of?

                                 TEDDY SERACEN
                        Don’t know. Nothin, I suppose. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        You ain’t afraid now?

           Seracen shrugs. Farron blows smoke out his nose. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                        Good. Ya shouldn’t be. I ain’t 
                        gonna kill ya. I watched Ruby kill 
                        Oswald onna TV. Wife was happy, 
                        but all I could think about was 
                        how we’d never know, never know 
                        what happened. Couldn’t live with 
                        that--the not knowin. So all I’m 
                        doin here is offerin you a deal.

           Seracen waits, breath wheezing out his broken nose.

                                 BOBBY FARRON (CONT’D)
                        The first flight outta Logan. Ya 
                        get far away from here, never come 
                        back? You, me? We’re all set, pal.

                        Why? Why would you do that?

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Cause I’m not you. Ain’t a killer.

           Farron leans in. Overhead a plane descends--ROARING. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        I wanna hear you say it.

           Farron stares at him, stares right through him.

                                 TEDDY SERACEN (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I did it. I’m him...

                        The nigger. Coupla younger broads. 
                        DeSalvo killed the kid though. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON

                        Don’t know. I just stole the idea.

           Farron nods. He pulls a SWITCHBLADE. Cuts Seracen loose. 

                                 BOBBY FARRON
                        Now listen, ya can go. But I’m

                        ya--find ya just like I did 
                        tonight. And then I’ll kill ya. 
                        Then I’ll go up ya parents’ house, 
                        Nahant, kill them. Then I’ll go to

           the back door. He opens the Pall Malls with his teeth.  

           Tilting back in his chair, Farron lights a cigarette and 
           stares out the glass in the back door. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           There’s nothing there but darkness--an abyss. Farron 
           jerks his head quick, as if to dislodge a thought, and 
           leans his chair back on two legs--SQUEAK--and ashes. He 
           eases forward...

           Squeak...Squeak...Squeak...

                                                            SMASH TO BLACK

           EXIT SCROLL:

           “In 2013, DNA evidence finally linked Albert DeSalvo to 
           the 13th ‘Strangler Victim,’ Mary Sullivan...” 

           “...it was the culmination of 15 years of attempts by the 
           Boston Police Department to do so.”

           “The murders of 12 other women are still unsolved.” 

           “To this day, not a single charge has ever been brought 
           against a suspect in the case of the Boston Strangler.”
