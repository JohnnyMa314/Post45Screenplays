           INT. ED’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - DAY

           The kitchen of a drive-in restaurant outside St. Louis. It’s 
           1954. Traveling salesman RAY KROC (52) stands before a sample 
           MIXING MACHINE, making his pitch to the OWNER.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Now, I know what you’re thinking: 
                        “What the heck do I need a five-
                        spindle for? I barely sell enough 
                        shakes to justify my single 
                        spindle.” Right? Wrong.
                             (BEAT)
                        Mr. Paul, are you familiar with the 
                        notion of the chicken and the egg? 
                        I mention it because I believe it’s 
                        applicable here: Do you not need a 
                        Multimixer because you’re not 
                        selling enough shakes? Or are you 
                        not selling enough shakes because 
                        you don’t have a Multimixer? I 
                        firmly believe it’s the latter. You 
                        see, your customers, they know that 
                        if they order a milkshake from your 
                        establishment, it’s going to be a 
                        terrific wait. They’ve ordered one 
                        before, and by golly they’re not 
                        gonna make that same mistake again. 
                        But if you had, say, a Prince 
                        Castle five-spindle Multimixer with 
                        patented direct-drive electric 
                        motor, you could greatly increase 
                        your ability to produce delicious, 
                        frosty shakes fast. And before 
                        long, mark my words, dollars to 
                        donuts, you’d be selling more of 
                        those suckers than you can shake a 
                        stick at. Increase your supply, 
                        demand will follow. Chicken and the 
                        egg. You follow my logic? Of course 
                        you do--you’re a bright, forward-
                        thinking fella who knows a good 
                        idea when he hears it.
                             (BEAT)
                        So whaddaya say?

           ON THE OWNER-- pondering thoughtfully.

                                 OWNER
                        Nah. 
                             (BEAT)
                        Thanks anyway.
           EXT. ED’S DRIVE-IN - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc lugs the heavy Mulitmixer back to his car. He lifts it 
           into the trunk, wincing from his bad back.

           INT. KROC’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc sits in his car checking his APPOINTMENT BOOK. His next 
           sales call: DEE DEE’S DRIVE-IN - 1 P.M.

           He checks his watch. It’s 12:05. He turns on the car, pulls 
           into a customer spot in front of Ed’s Drive-In. 

           He looks at the MENU BOARD, taking in the vast, seemingly 
           random assortment of items: BBQ beef sandwiches, hot tamales, 
           peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chili dogs, etc.

           INT. KROC’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc sits in his car, waiting for his food. He looks at his 
           watch. It’s 12:50. He lets out a heaving, exasperated sigh.

           KROC’S POV, the view out his windshield: a rowdy TEEN-HANGOUT 
           SCENE. Rock-and-roll blasting from cars; female CARHOPS on 
           rollerskates dodging grabby male patrons; leather-jacketed, 
           cigarette-smoking hoodlums smacking each other around.

           Kroc is the oldest customer by a mile--and seemingly the only 
           one with anywhere to be. He HONKS his horn, summoning his 
           CARHOP. She comes skating over holding a tray of Cokes.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Miss, how much longer?

                                 CARHOP GIRL
                        Should be any minute.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You said that 20 minutes ago.

                                 CARHOP GIRL
                        I’m sorry, we’re real--

           She JUMPS/SQUEALS, startled. The tray of Cokes goes FLYING 
           into the car, SPILLING ALL OVER KROC’S LAP. Carhop Girl spins 
           around, sees a GUY behind her cracking up. He just pinched 
           her butt.

                                 CARHOP
                        Dennis!
                             (re: Kroc, soaked)
                        Look what you made me do!
                                 DENNIS
                        Sorry, gramps.

           Dennis scampers off toward his pack of laughing friends. The 
           carhop goes chasing after him, mad but not actually mad.

           ON KROC-- looking down at the pool of bubbly brown liquid in 
           his lap. He HONKS, leans out the window.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Could I get some napkins?

           No one hears him.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON the pants drying on the shower’s curtain rod.

                                 RAY KROC (O.S.)
                        It’s going great.

           CUT TO: the NEXT ROOM. Kroc sitting on the bed, on the phone.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Lot of good leads today. Real 
                        strong leads.

           Through the phone, a tiny passive-aggressive sigh.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                             (prickly)
                        What?

                                 ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
                        Nothing. That’s wonderful.

                                 RAY KROC
                        There’s a tremendous amount of 
                        interest.

                                 ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
                        I’m sure there is.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You don’t believe me?

                                 ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
                        Of course, Ray. Why shouldn’t I 
                        believe you?
           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc sits on the edge of the bed, roiling from the call. He 
           takes off his shirt, undressing for bed. His bare torso bears 
           numerous surgery scars: heart, gall bladder, etc.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc, in pajamas, stands before a PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH. He 
           drops the needle on a record.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc lies in bed in the darkened room, eyes closed. A 
           soothing baritone fills the air--

                                 RECORD (O.S.)
                        Nothing in the world can take the 
                        place of persistence. Talent will 
                        not; nothing is more common than 
                        unsuccessful men with talent. 
                        Genius will not; unrewarded genius 
                        is almost a proverb.

           ANGLE ON record sleeve next to the phonograph: “THE POWER OF 
           THE POSITIVE” BY DR. CLARENCE FLOYD NELSON

                                 RECORD (CONT’D)
                        Education will not; the world is 
                        full of educated derelicts. 
                        Persistence and determination alone 
                        are omnipotent.

           The sound of SNORING brings us back to Kroc. Out cold.

           INT. JOE’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - NEXT DAY

           The kitchen of another drive-in, Kroc pitching to the OWNER. 
           The scene is virtually identical to the previous day’s.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Increase supply, demand will 
                        follow. Chicken and the egg. You 
                        follow my logic? Of course you do: 
                        You’re a bright, forward-thinking 
                        fella who knows a good idea when he 
                        hears it. 
                             (BEAT)
                        So whaddaya say?
           EXT. PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc lugs the sample Multimixer back to his car.

           INT. KROC’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc is pulled up to a customer spot in front of Joe’s Drive-
           In. The scene before him is very much like the one at Ed’s 
           Drive-In, a riot of teenage rowdiness.

           He looks at his watch. It’s 12:45. He HONKS, shouting out to 
           no one in particular:

                                 RAY KROC
                        Could someone tell me when my...

           He trails off as a female CARHOP approaches with a tray. She 
           hooks the tray onto his car door.

                                 CARHOP
                        Enjoy.

           She heads off. He lifts the cover off his plate, primed to 
           dig in. His face falls at the sight of the hamburger beneath. 
           He leans out the window, honks.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I ordered the pulled pork!

           He’s shouting into the void.

           EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - LATER

           Another drive-in. Kroc heaves his Multimixer into his trunk.

           INT. PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER

           A pay phone across the street from Merriman’s. A dispirited 
           Kroc dials a long-distance number.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
                        Prince Castle, how may I help you?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Hi, June.

           INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - CONTINUOUS

           A modest office in a Chicago high-rise. At the reception desk 
           is secretary JUNE MARTINO. (Intercut as necessary.)
                                 JUNE MARTINO 
                        Ray. How’s it going down there?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Fine. Swell. Lot of interest.

                                 JUNE MARTINO 
                        That’s terrific. Hold on, I’ll 
                        fetch your messages.

           She grabs a pile of messages off the desk.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see... Gene Rafferty from 
                        United Aluminum, says he needs to 
                        reschedule Friday; Ed Nance calling 
                        again about the refund; a lady from 
                        March of Dimes about a donation; 
                        oh, and we got an order. Six.

                                 RAY KROC
                             (taken aback)
                        Six?

                                 JUNE MARTINO 
                        Some drive-in out in California.

                                 RAY KROC
                        One place? Are you sure?

                                 JUNE MARTINO 
                        I’ve got the slip right here.

                                 RAY KROC
                        That makes no sense.

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                        I’m positive.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You must have misunderstood. Maybe 
                        they meant six spindles.

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                        Mixers.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What the heck kind of drive-in 
                        needs six Multimixers?

                                 JUNE MARTINO 
                        Apparently this one.
                                 RAY KROC
                        Where’d you say they are?

                                 JUNE MARTINO 
                        California. San Bernardino. Not 
                        sure where that is.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Who’d you talk to?

                                 JUNE MARTINO 
                        The owner. A man named... 
                             (checks slip)
                        Mac McDonald.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc pours a few nickels into the pay phone, dials a number 
           off his wrist. It rings.

                                 YOUNG MALE EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        McDonald’s Hamburgers.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Mac McDonald, please.

                                 YOUNG MALE EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        Who may I say is calling?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Ray Kroc. Prince Castle Sales.

                                 YOUNG MALE EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        Hold, please.

           The guy puts the phone down, heads off in search of Mac. 
           Through the receiver, Kroc hears the sounds of an insanely 
           busy——and efficient——kitchen. “Order up!”... “I need six 
           fries!”... “Patties up!”

                                 MAC MCDONALD (O.S.)
                        This is Mac.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Hello, Mac. This is Ray Kroc. From 
                        Prince Castle Sales.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (not recognizing)
                        Alright...

                                 RAY KROC
                        The Multimixers.
                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Yes, yes, of course!

                                 RAY KROC
                        So I’m calling about your order...

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        How soon can we expect shipment? 
                        We’re desperate.

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’s actually why I was calling. 
                        I think there may have been a 
                        miscommunication between you and--

           In the background, someone shouts something to Mac.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        In the freezer! Top shelf, left!
                             (back to Kroc)
                        I’m sorry. Go on.

                                 RAY KROC
                        My secretary’s under the impression 
                        that you wanted six.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        You know what? I think that’s a 
                        mistake.

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’s what I said! There’s no way--

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Better make it eight.

           ON KROC-- flabbergasted. Another background shout.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        What’s that, Al? Use the ones from 
                        the store room! There’s a whole new 
                        box!
                             (to Kroc)
                        Listen, now isn’t the best time to 
                        talk. Just try to get those mixers 
                        out here ASAP, alright? Thanks!

           Click.

           Kroc stares at the receiver. What the hell was that? 

           His gaze drifts across the street. To a SERVICE STATION.
           INT. TEXACO SERVICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc is at the register, buying a U.S. road map.

           EXT. TEXACO STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc stands outside the station looking at the map. His eyes 
           roam California, searching. Finally, he finds it. There it 
           is, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles: San Bernardino.

           Kroc pulls back, looks at the whole country. He notices 
           something interesting. A road directly connecting St. Louis 
           to San Bernardino. Route 66.

           ON KROC-- staring at Route 66. A single, unbroken line 
           running from where he is now to that mysterious city out in 
           Southern California.

           EXT. ROUTE 66 - DAY

           Kroc driving west on Route 66. Cars, the open road, a 
           limitless horizon. The sky, the country, the whole world 
           seems to open up. 

           His heart swells with possibility. The vastness excites his 
           brain. This must be how Lewis & Clark felt. And then--

           EXT. SAN BERNARDINO CITY LIMITS - ROUTE 66 - DAY

           Kroc arrives in San Bernardino. A drab, dusty little town on 
           the edge of the desert. Hardly the pot of gold at the end of 
           the rainbow he was expecting. He continues along Route 66, 
           heading toward the center of town.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc driving. He sees the line before he sees the restaurant. 
           A long line, hundreds of people, snaking toward a HAMBURGER 
           STAND in the distance.

           ON KROC-- taking in the strange sight of people out of their 
           cars, queued up in a line leading toward a self-service 
           window. It’s a distinctly family crowd, lots of parents with 
           their children. Not a teenage delinquent in sight.

           He parks, gets out. Unsure what to do, he gets in the line. 
           He looks off at the restaurant, checks his watch. It’s 1:15.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Don’t worry. It moves fast.
           ANGLE ON the WOMAN in front of him. No sooner does she say 
           this than the line moves. Kroc shuffles forward 10 feet.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc in line, significantly further along. He looks at his 
           watch. It’s 1:19.

           EXT. MCDONALD’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc at the front of the line. He checks his watch. 1:23.

                                 CASHIER (O.S.)
                        Welcome to McDonald’s, may I take 
                        your order?

           Kroc looks up, sees a CASHIER looking at him with a friendly 
           smile. Like all the other cashiers, he’s male and wholesome 
           as apple pie.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Um, yes...

           He looks up at the MENU BOARD. It has just four items: 
           BURGERS, FRIES, SHAKES, and COCA-COLA. A radical departure 
           from the typical sprawling drive-in menu.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Hamburger, fries and a Coca-Cola.

                                 CASHIER
                        That’ll be 45 cents, please.

           Kroc hands him two quarters.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                        Five cents is your change.

           Kroc barely has time to put the nickel away when--

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                        Here you are, sir.

           The cashier hands him a paper sack. Kroc looks at it.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What’s this?

                                 CASHIER
                        Your food.
                                 RAY KROC
                        I just ordered.

                                 CASHIER
                        And now it’s here.

           Kroc peers into the bag, confused. Inside is a hamburger, 
           fries, and a Coca-Cola in a paper cup.

           Kroc lingers awkwardly at the register, unsure what to do.

                                 RAY KROC
                        So now I bring it back to my car?

                                 CASHIER
                        Most folks do. Or you could eat it 
                        in the park. Or home. Anywhere you 
                        like, really.

           Kroc nods. This is all bizarre to him.

           INT. KROC’S CAR - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc sits in his car, McDonald’s bag in his lap. Out the 
           corner of his eye in a nearby car, he sees a GORGEOUS BLONDE. 

           KROC’S POV: The blonde, biting into a hamburger. As she 
           chews, a look of ecstasy comes over her face. She closes her 
           eyes, her head tipping back a bit, borderline orgasmic.

           ON KROC-- staring at her. He looks down at his crotch. He 
           reaches into the McDonald’s bag.

           He takes out the burger, taking note of the odd paper 
           packaging. He unwraps the hamburger, looking at it, sniffing 
           it. It looks and smells wonderful.

           He takes a bite, chews. His eyes roll back in his head. A 
           small moan.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        How is everything?

           Kroc looks up, startled. A MAN is standing outside his 
           window. His necktie and demeanor suggest manager.

                                 RAY KROC
                        This is the best hamburger I’ve 
                        ever had.

                                 MAN
                             (smile)
                        We aim to please.
           The man extends a friendly hand.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        Mac McDonald.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Ray Kroc.

           They shake. Kroc pulls a BUSINESS CARD from a pocket, hands 
           it to him. McDonald looks at it.

           RAY KROC - PRINCE CASTLE SALES CORP. - 2310 WACKER DRIVE, 
           CHICAGO, ILL.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        The Multimixer fella!

           Mac looks again at the card, at the Chicago address.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        What brings you way the heck out 
                        here?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Oh, I was just in Los Angeles. For 
                        some meetings. Clients. Figured as 
                        long as I was in the neighborhood, 
                        I’d swing by and say hello.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Well, I’m glad you did. Welcome.

           Kroc’s eyes drift to the busy, humming restaurant.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Quite an operation you got here.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Care for a tour?

           There’s nothing Kroc would like more.

           INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           A bustling kitchen, organized as a series of stations.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (O.S.)
                        Speed.

           ON MAC-- leading Kroc through the kitchen. 

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        That’s the name of the game.
           They come to a massive GRILL manned by THREE COOKS.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        First stop for every McDonald’s 
                        hamburger is the grill, manned by 
                        three cooks whose sole job is to 
                        grill those all-beef beauties to 
                        perfection.

           Kroc watches the mouth-watering beef sizzling on the grill.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Meanwhile--

           He leads Kroc to an adjacent station, where two DRESSERS 
           stand before a rotating Lazy Susan with 24 BUN TOPS on it. 

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        As the patty cooks, our “dressers” 
                        get the bun ready.

           DRESSER #1 puts pickle slices and onion on each bun...

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Every burger gets two pickles and a 
                        pinch of onion.

           ...while DRESSER #2 applies a squirt of ketchup and mustard 
           with a pair of trigger-operated CONDIMENT GUNS.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        And a precise shot of ketchup and 
                        mustard.

                                 RAY KROC
                             (re: condiment guns)
                        Where’d you buy those things?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We didn’t. We made ‘em.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You made them?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (nods)
                        Custom built. The whole kitchen is.

           ON KROC-- utterly amazed.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                             (resuming)
                        Then it’s off to the finishing 
                        station.
           ANGLE ON the Lazy Susan, carrying 24 fully dressed bun tops, 
           traveling along a belt toward a FINISHING STATION.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Where it all comes together.

           A pair of FINISHERS put cooked patties onto the fully dressed 
           bun tops, then put on bun bottoms and neatly wrap it up.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Voilá--

           The finished product is fed into an angled metal sleeve that 
           slides them to the front counter, where cashiers can grab and 
           bag them with ease.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        A fresh and delicious hamburger, 
                        grill to counter in 30 seconds.

           ON KROC-- dumbfounded by what he’s seen. He looks at Mac.

                                 RAY KROC
                        How?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Did I come up with all of this? 
                             (BEAT)
                        I didn’t.

           Kroc is confused.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                             (sly grin)
                        He did.

           Kroc follows Mac’s eyes to a MAN coming toward them.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Meet Dick McDonald. My brother.

           Kroc grabs Dick’s hand, enthusiastically shakes.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I just have to say, what you’ve 
                        done here is nothing short of--

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                             (to Mac, ignoring Ray)
                        The fries.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What about them?
           Dick leads Mac toward the FRENCH FRY STATION. Kroc follows 
           along. Dick plucks a fry off the drying rack, hands it to 
           Mac, who pops it in his mouth.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Perfect.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        They’re five percent too crisp.

           Dick takes a fry, tastes it. He frowns a little.

                                 DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        I think we should drop to two 
                        minutes, 50 seconds.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That’s what you had it at before.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        400, not 375. Higher temp, shorter 
                        cook.

           Mac takes another taste. He shakes his head, not seeing it.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I really think they’re spot-on.

                                 RAY KROC
                             (to Dick)
                        If it makes any difference, they’re 
                        the best fries I’ve ever tasted. 
                        Crispy golden brown on the outside, 
                        fluffy on the inside. Not too oily, 
                        perfectly salty and crunchy.

           Dick stares at Ray, taking note of him for the first time.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Who are you?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        This is the Multimixer fella.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Ray Kroc, Prince Castle Sales.

           Kroc hands Dick his card. Dick gives it a cursory glance.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        How fast can you get ‘em out here?

                                 RAY KROC
                        ASAP. Blue Label Air. 
                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Good.

           Dick abruptly walks off, leaving Ray and Mac standing there.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (glances at watch)
                        I oughta get back to it myself.

           He heads toward the front of the restaurant. Kroc follows.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Let me take you out to dinner.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        You’re really not my type.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You and your brother.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What for?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Mac, I’m gonna shoot straight with 
                        you. This restaurant is the most 
                        remarkable thing I’ve seen in all 
                        my years in the food-service 
                        industry. And believe me, I’ve seen 
                        it all. I want to know everything 
                        about it. Where it came from, how 
                        you thought of it.
                             (eye contact)
                        Please. Tell me your story.

           INT. STEAKHOUSE - EVENING

           Kroc sits across from the brothers in a corner booth, rib eye 
           steaks in front of all three.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        There wasn’t a job in all of 
                        Manchester. All of New Hampshire, 
                        it seemed. So we packed our bags 
                        and headed west. To Hollywood. I 
                        wanted to be in the movie business. 
                        And Dick, he wanted to be in, well, 
                        anything.

           Dick gives a tiny nod as he chews his steak.
                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        We landed jobs driving trucks for 
                        Columbia Pictures. After a few 
                        years, we had enough saved up to 
                        buy our own little piece of show 
                        business. A little movie theater 
                        out in Glendora. Which would’ve 
                        been great--except for the small 
                        matter of timing. It was September 
                        of ‘29. One minute we’re screening 
                        “Gold Diggers Of Broadway”, the 
                        next it’s “Brother, can you spare a 
                        dime?” Literally.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I couldn’t.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Nobody in town was making any 
                        money. Except this one fellow, 
                        Wylie Reid. Ran a hot dog and root 
                        beer stand. People still gotta eat, 
                        right? So we decide to set up our 
                        own stand. Hot dogs and orange 
                        juice, out in Arcadia. It did 
                        alright, enough to keep us off the 
                        bread line, but we were hardly 
                        doing gangbusters. There just 
                        weren’t enough people in Arcadia. 
                        Meanwhile, one town over is San 
                        Bernardino, the place is growing at 
                        a terrific clip. We want to 
                        relocate, but we’ve got no money 
                        for a new stand. That’s when my 
                        brilliant brother here gets one of 
                        his ideas. Tell him, Dick.

           Dick gives a nod of deferral. That’s okay, you tell.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        “Why don’t we move the stand we’ve 
                        got? Put it on a truck!” 
                             (BEAT)
                        Genius, right? Except for one small 
                        problem. On the road connecting the 
                        towns, there’s an overpass. The 
                        building doesn’t clear. I figure 
                        that’s it, we’re done for. But then 
                        Dick says...

           He looks to Dick, who defers again.
                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        “Why don’t we saw the restaurant in 
                        half?” We truck the thing over in 
                        two pieces, put it back together!

           Kroc guffaws. Mac gives Dick’s skull a loving squeeze.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Who thinks of that?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Wow.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We move the building, set up shop. 
                        But before we open, we decide to 
                        give the place a little tweak. It’s 
                        1940. Drive-ins are all the rage, 
                        the hottest thing going. I say 
                        Dick, we gotta get in on this. Dick 
                        says sure. Two months later, we 
                        open for business...
                             (show-biz hands)
                        “McDonald’s Famous Barbecue!”
                             (BEAT)
                        We’ve got a 27-item menu, barbecue 
                        slow-cooked in a real pit out back. 
                        Uniformed waitresses bring the food 
                        straight out to your car. It does 
                        gangbusters, going great guns. But 
                        then... sales start to level off. 
                        The drive-in model, as we discover, 
                        has got a few built-in problems.

           Kroc leans in, eager to hear their perspective on this.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        For starters, there’s the customer 
                        issue. Drive-ins tend to attract, 
                        let’s just say, a less-than 
                        desirable clientele.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Then there’s the service. It takes 
                        forever and a day for your food to 
                        arrive. And when it finally does...

                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s completely wrong.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        The carhops are too busy dodging 
                        gropes to remember you wanted a 
                        strawberry phosphate, not cherry.

                                 RAY KROC
                        If they remember at all.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Then there’s the expenses. Payroll 
                        is high due to the large staff 
                        required. Dishes are constantly 
                        getting stolen or broken.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Tremendous overhead.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We’re about to throw in the towel 
                        when Dick has a realization. One 
                        day, while going over the books, he 
                        notices something. The bulk of our 
                        sales come from just three items. 
                        Burgers, fries, soft drinks.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        87 percent.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We say to ourselves, what the heck 
                        are we doing monkeying around with 
                        all this other nonsense? Focus on 
                        what sells. 

                                 RAY KROC
                        Yes.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        And that’s just what we do. 
                        Brisket, gone. Tamales, gone. And 
                        we don’t stop at the menu. We look 
                        at everything. What else don’t we 
                        need? Turns out, quite a lot.

                        And finally, the biggest, most 
                        crucial cut of all: The wait.

                        30 seconds, not 30 minutes.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We decide to tear down the kitchen. 
                        Rebuild, reconfigure, rethink the 
                        whole darn thing. And you’re gonna 
                        love how we do it. Tell him, Dick. 
                        Tell him what you do.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        The tennis court?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        He brings me to this tennis court, 
                        takes a stick, draws an outline in 
                        the dirt. Exact dimensions of our 
                        kitchen. He brings in a bunch of 
                        employees, has them go through the 
                        motions, moving around the court 
                        making imaginary hamburgers, shakes 
                        and fries. Dick’s following after 
                        them with the stick, marking up 
                        where all the equipment should go. 
                        They do it over and over, tweaking, 
                        adjusting, hashing out the moves. 
                        Choreographing like it’s some kinda 
                        crazy burger ballet. Finally, after 
                        about six hours of this, we get it 
                        perfect. A symphony of efficiency, 
                        not a wasted motion.

                        We take the layout to a builder, 
                        have it custom-made to the exact 
                        specs. Ta-da! The Speedee System is 
                        born, the world’s first assembly 
                        line for food. It’s totally 
                        revolutionary.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        And a complete disaster.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Opening day, people pull into the 
                        lot, they immediately start honking 
                        when no carhop comes over. We try 
                        to explain the walk-up window. 
                        They’re bewildered. Furious. 
                        “Whaddaya mean I gotta get out of 
                        my car?” Most of them just cuss us 
                        out and drive off. The few that 
                        stick around are outraged about 
                        having to eat off paper and throw 
                        out their own trash.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        We may have underestimated the 
                        learning curve.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        By five o’clock, Dick’s already 
                        calculating the cost of converting 
                        back to drive-in. But me, I’m not 
                        quite ready to throw in the towel. 
                        Going back to my Hollywood roots, I 
                        say to myself, “We gotta go big 
                        with this. We gotta put on a show.” 
                        I tell Dick I want to throw a grand 
                        re-opening. A gala premiere to put 
                        Louis B. Mayer to shame! We rent a 
                        bunch of spotlights, the very same 
                        ones we used to truck around to 
                        premieres in the Columbia days. I 
                        get a brass band, a juggler for the 
                        kiddies, it’s an event. People show 
                        up in droves. And then...

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        The flies.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Swarms of them. Millions.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        They must have been drawn by all 
                        the lights.
                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        People are running, screaming. It’s 
                        a complete disaster. Towel time.
                             (BEAT)
                        The next morning, Dick and I meet 
                        up at the restaurant to discuss 
                        going back to the old format. As 
                        we’re talking, there’s a knock at 
                        the service window. Dick goes over, 
                        he sees a little boy standing 
                        there. Wants a bag of burgers.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I tell him we’re closed.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        But he’s a cute kid, I feel bad. I 
                        fire up the grill, make him a 
                        batch. As he’s heading off, a car 
                        pulls into the lot. Then another. 
                        And another. Before long, there’s 
                        lines around the block. 
                             (amazed smile)
                        Word has spread. 

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        And it’s off to the races.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We’re an overnight sensation. 
                        Thirty years in the making.

           ON KROC-- absorbing all of this, blown away.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                             (shrugs)
                        So that’s our story.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Kroc lies awake in bed, unable to sleep. Buzzing. 

           EXT. MCDONALD’S - NEXT MORNING

           Mac and Dick pull into the McDonald’s lot in Dick’s car. 
           They’re startled to see-- 

           KROC, sitting on a bench out front. Kroc pops up, approaches 
           the car. Before Dick can fully roll down his window:

                                 RAY KROC
                        Franchise.
                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Franchise. Franchise this thing. 
                        It’s too good to be just one 
                        location. There ought to be 
                        McDonald’s everywhere. Coast to 
                        coast, sea to shining sea. And I’m 
                        just the man to help you do it. 
                        I’ve spent the better part of my 
                        life criss-crossing this country. I 
                        know every highway and byway, every 
                        city and every town. I’ve paid 
                        sales calls to them all.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Mr. Kroc...

                                 RAY KROC
                        Let me just say one more thing. One 
                        more thing. I want to confess 
                        something to you boys. I’m not out 
                        here in California for any business 
                        meetings. I’m out here for you. 
                        You’re what brought me out here. A 
                        few days ago, I was standing 
                        outside a filling station in St. 
                        Louis, staring at a U.S. road map. 
                        Staring at a long, white line 
                        called Route 66. I took my finger--

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Mr. Kroc--

                                 RAY KROC
                        --I took my finger, and I traced 
                        that line from where I was standing 
                        there in St. Louis all the way out 
                        to California, where it ran smack-
                        dab into this place where we’re 
                        standing now. As I stared at that 
                        line, something told me to follow 
                        it. Something told me to get in my 
                        car and see what’s out there at the 
                        other end. And when I laid eyes on 
                        your hamburger stand yesterday, all 
                        those hundreds of people lined up 
                        to buy your remarkable product, I 
                        just knew it was--

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        We already tried!!
           INT. MCDONALD’S - BACK OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc stands before a wall with the brothers.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Five.

           They’re looking at a MAP of California and the southwest, 
           five red pushpins in it.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Three in Southern California, one 
                        up in Sacramento, one in Phoenix.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        And that’s all there will ever be.

                                 RAY KROC
                        How come?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Two words: Quality control. 

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        It’s nigh impossible to enforce any 
                        real standards from afar.

                                 RAY KROC
                        But if you had someone in charge of 
                        supervising...

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We did.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What happened?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        He fell ill.

                                 RAY KROC
                        So replace him.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        It’s not worth the hassle. Our 
                        energies are far better spent 
                        making sure this restaurant is the 
                        best it can possibly be.

                                 RAY KROC
                        But if you had somebody else 
                        worrying about it--
                                 DICK MCDONALD
                             (sharp)
                        Not worth the hassle.

           Kroc looks at Mac, who nods in agreement with his brother--
           not entirely convincingly. Does Kroc detect a rift between 
           the brothers on this issue?

                                 DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, anyway.

           Kroc’s eye goes to something else on the wall... a BLUEPRINT. 
           The building has towering arches on each side.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What’s that?

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        A blueprint.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Those.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        The arches? Those were Dick’s idea. 
                        A way to make the place stand out 
                        when you’re driving past.

           Kroc stares at them, intrigued.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                             (admiring smile)
                        “The Golden Arches”, I call ‘em.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Ever build one like that?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Just one. 
                             (BEAT)
                        Phoenix.

           Kroc’s eyes go to the Phoenix pushpin.

           EXT. ROUTE 66 - FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ. - NIGHT

           Kroc is driving through Flagstaff, heading home on Route 66. 
           He passes a road sign: I-17 SOUTH - PHOENIX - NEXT RIGHT

           He takes an impulsive detour.
           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE (PHOENIX) - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc drives down Phoenix’s Central Avenue. He sees the arches 
           before he sees the restaurant.

           Kroc pulls into the empty lot (the restaurant is closed). He 
           gets out, looks up at the arches. They’re lit up and glowing. 
           Glorious, magical.

           He does a slow lap around the building, taking in the arches 
           from all angles. Halfway around, the shifting perspective 
           causes the arches to meet. They form a giant “M” (the 
           McDonald’s logo as we know it today), 30 feet high.

           ON KROC-- standing before the “M”, bathed in its golden, 
           glowing light. Like Moses before the Burning Bush.

           EXT. ROUTE 66 - SOMEWHERE IN OKLAHOMA - NEXT DAY

           Kroc is driving through the heartland, taking in the scenery. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS: Kroc passing through various small towns, 
           each with a Main Street running through it. On every Main 
           Street, we see the same two things: a church and courthouse.

           Glimpses of various churches and courthouses. Churches topped 
           with crosses. Courthouses with American flags.

           ON KROC-- processing, wheels turning.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE (DES PLAINES, IL) - EVENING - NEXT DAY

           A modest home in the Chicago suburbs. Kroc comes bursting 
           through the door.

           ETHEL (53) is at the table, eating dinner by herself. Kroc 
           comes bursting in, burning with excitement.

                        I saw a restaurant, Ethel. Like 
                        nothing you’ve ever seen. It’s 
                        going to change the way people——

                        No, Ray.

                        This is different.

                        It’s always different. Every time.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Just hear me out.

                                 RAY KROC
                        This place, it’s like something 
                        sprung from the mind of Henry Ford.

                        I’m too old to start over, Ray. I 
                        can’t do it again.

                        scraping like a couple of 25-year-
                        olds. Like a couple of dopes.

                        Don and Rosalie just went to Cuba.

                        If this is as big as I think, we

                        about had it with your small-

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        And I’ve just about had it with 
                        your mind. One cockamamie idea 
                        after another. And now, the 
                        cockamamiest of all.

                                 RAY KROC

                        headlong into this thing, and then 
                        at some point down the road, you’re 
                        either going to get bored and move 
                        on, or it’s gonna crash and burn.

                        One ticket, please.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc sits in the theater, the light of the screen flickering 
           off his face. A sweeping orchestral score rises.

           ANGLE ON screen: A title card, big and bold:

           MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION

           ON KROC-- staring at the words.
           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kroc lies on the couch, too worked up to sleep. (It’s unclear 
           if he’s there by choice or he’s been banished by Ethel.)

           INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Kroc paces, ringing phone to his ear.

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        McDonald’s Hamburgers.

                        Dick, then.

           The employee puts the phone down, goes off to check. Through 
           it, Kroc hears what sounds like a BIG CROWD.

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, he’ll have to call you 
                        back. We’re real busy.

           Kroc glances at his watch, puzzled by the commotion.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What time is it there?

                        What time do you open?

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.S.)

           ON KROC-- amazed. They don’t even open for another 40 
           minutes.

           INT. JOHNSON’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc out on a sales call to a local drive-in. He gives his 
           standard spiel--
                                 RAY KROC
                             (flat, distracted)
                        Mr. Johnson, are you familiar with 
                        the notion of the chicken and the 
                        egg? I mention it because I think 
                        it’s applicable here.

           EXT. JOHNSON’S DRIVE-IN - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc hauls the sample Multimixer back to his car.

           EXT. JOHNSON’S DRIVE-IN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc sits in his car, pulled up to a spot in front. He looks 
           at his watch. Honks. A CARHOP comes roller-skating over.

                                 CARHOP
                        Sorry, should be just a few more 
                        minutes.

           From out of nowhere... 

           SPLAT! A cup of KETCHUP smashes against his windshield.

           ANGLE ON a nearby FOOD FIGHT, one of the young participants 
           wincing at the sight of the collateral damage on Kroc’s car.

                                 FOOD FIGHTER
                        Oops.

           ON KROC-- staring at the ketchup glob sliding down his 
           windshield. He turns on the ignition, pulls out.

                                 CARHOP
                        Sir, what about your--?

           INT. MIDWAY AIRPORT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc steps to the TWA ticket counter.

                        One ticket to Los Angeles.

           INT. MCDONALD’S - KITCHEN - EVENING

           The dinner rush. Mac and Dick hustle about, making sure 
           things run as smoothly as possible.

           ON MAC-- reloading the Lazy Susan with a new set of bun tops.
                                 RAY KROC (O.S.)
                        Do it for your country.

           Mac turns, startled to see Kroc.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Ray.

                        If you boys don’t want to franchise 
                        for yourselves, fine. But do it for 
                        your country. For America.

           Dick comes over, seeing Ray.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Mr. Kroc. What are you--

                        This place you’ve created, it’s not 
                        a restaurant. It’s not even a 
                        place. It’s an idea.

           Mac and Dick look at each other, intrigued. Especially Mac.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (to an employee)
                        Bobby, finish the buns.

           INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc stands before the brothers.

                                 RAY KROC
                        That drive back home to Chicago on 
                        66, I passed through a lot of 
                        towns. A lot of small towns. In the 
                        middle of every one of them, there 
                        was a Main Street. And on each of 
                        those Main Streets, there were 
                        always the same two things: a 
                        courthouse and a church. 
                             (BEAT)
                        A courthouse topped with a flag. A 
                        church topped with a cross. Flags 
                        and crosses, crosses and flags.

           Mac and Dick glance at each other, not quite sure where he’s 
           going with this.

                        As I drove, I pondered those 
                        crosses and flags. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        I asked myself why they’re so 
                        ubiquitous. What they mean. And in 
                        doing so, I couldn’t help but think 
                        about your restaurant. About these:

           He goes to the wall, pulls off the blueprint with the arches.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Now, forgive me if this flirts with 
                        blasphemy, but to my mind, these 
                        arches share a great deal in common 
                        with the Christian cross and the 
                        American flag. A building topped 
                        with a cross is a gathering place. 
                        A place where decent, wholesome 
                        folks can come together and be with 
                        others who share their values. The 
                        same can be said of a building 
                        flanked by a pair of your arches. 
                        Those arches mean more than simply 
                        “delicious hamburgers inside”. They 
                        signify family, community, the ties 
                        that bind. They represent goodness. 
                        Togetherness. A place for Americans 
                        to gather and break bread. 
                        McDonald’s can be that, too. The 
                        new American church, feeding bodies 
                        and feeding souls. And not just on 
                        Sundays, either. Seven days a week.
                             (BEAT)
                        Crosses. Flags. Arches.

           ON MAC-- wowed. He looks over at Dick, who, to his surprise, 
           wears a troubled look on his face.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (to Kroc)
                        Would you excuse us a moment?

           INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The brothers, alone in the back office.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I don’t like it.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What’s wrong?

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                             (shakes head, troubled)
                        There’s just something about him.
                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        He seems like an alright guy.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        He’s a huckster.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That’s just the way these salesmen 
                        talk.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        He just seems so... desperate.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That’s not desperation, it’s 
                        passion. Did you hear the way he 
                        talked about McDonald’s? He wants 
                        to make us the biggest thing since 
                        sliced bread.

           Dick shakes his head again, full of nagging doubt.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I don’t know...

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Come on, give the fella a try. 
                        Let’s see what he can do.

           He grabs Dick’s shoulders, gives him a reassuring smile.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        What’s the worst that could happen?

           INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

           A LAWYER sits behind his big desk. Across from him are the 
           McDonald brothers and Kroc.

           ANGLE ON five stacks of duplicate CONTRACTS arrayed before 
           the lawyer. He glances at his watch, looks at Kroc.

                                 LAWYER
                        Will he be here soon?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Who?

                                 LAWYER
                        Your representation.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I don’t have any.
           ON MAC-- surprised. He looks at his brother, who seems 
           troubled, his worries about Kroc reinforced.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc skims through the contract. Skim is the operative word. 

           He comes to the last page, where a blank line awaits his John 
           Hancock. He grabs a pen and eagerly, readily signs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - DAY (ONE MONTH LATER)

           A LOAN OFFICER sits behind his desk. 

                                 RAY KROC (O.S.)
                        We are a dynamic, fast-growing 
                        company.

           Across from him sits Kroc in his best suit and tie.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        And now, we’re poised to make major 
                        inroads nationally.

           The loan officer looks at a set of BLUEPRINTS on his desk, 
           titled MCDONALD’S #6 - DES PLAINES, ILL.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        In addition to giving us a foothold 
                        in the Midwest, the Des Plaines 
                        location will serve as a lure for 
                        prospective franchisees.

           The loan officer looks over the blueprint.

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                             (re: arches)
                        What are those?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Those? That’s just our little way 
                        of separating ourselves from the 
                        pack.
                             (proud smile)
                        “The Golden Arches”, I call ‘em.

           The loan officer picks up a bound prospectus prepared by 
           Kroc. Artist renderings, projected earnings, etc.

           Kroc anxiously watches as he leafs through it. 
                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                             (filling the air)
                        There’s nothing like it in the 
                        entire food-service sector.

           The loan officer looks up from the materials. Stares at Kroc.

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        You look familiar. 
                             (BEAT)
                        Have we met?

           Kroc tenses up a drop.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I don’t believe so.

           ON LOAN OFFICER, searching Kroc’s face, determined to place 
           it. He snaps his fingers.

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        The Fold-A-Nook!
                             (hint of a smirk)
                        “It’s like a Murphy bed... for your 
                        kitchen!”

           EXT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc exits the bank in defeat.

           INT. MIDWAY SAVINGS & LOAN - LATER

           Kroc sits across from another LOAN OFFICER, watching as he 
           looks over the prospectus.

                                 RAY KROC
                        There’s nothing like it in the 
                        entire food-service sector.

           The officer looks up at Kroc.

                                 LOAN OFFICER #2
                        Have we met?

           The man searches his face. Kroc squirms.

                                 LOAN OFFICER #2 (CONT’D)
                        The paper-cup guy!

                                 RAY KROC
                             (forces a smile)
                        Long time ago.
           An awkward pause, painful for Kroc.

                                 LOAN OFFICER #2
                        I tell you what. Let me refer you 
                        to one of my colleagues. Somebody 
                        who may be better suited to meet 
                        your needs.

           A FEW DESKS DOWN - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc sits before a different LOAN OFFICER. The man is filling 
           out some sort of application for Kroc.

                                 LOAN OFFICER #3
                        Address?

                                 RAY KROC
                        143 Juniper Road, Arlington 
                        Heights, Illinois.

           ANGLE ON his desk plaque: HARVEY C. PELTZ - HOME MORTGAGE 
           REPRESENTATIVE

                                 LOAN OFFICER #3
                        Home telephone number?

           Kroc’s eyes drift to the form, a home-mortgage application.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Let me give you my office. That’s 
                        the best place to reach me.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - ANOTHER NIGHT

           The office is empty, except for Kroc. He’s at his desk, 
           engrossed in work. The phone RINGS, startling him a bit.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Hello?
                             (listening)
                        Ethel.

           Kroc glances out the window, sees it’s dark out.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I don’t think I’m going to 
                        be home in time for dinner.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ethel on the other end of the line.
                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Dinner?

           WIDER SHOT reveals she’s IN BED, in a nightgown.

                                 ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)
                        It’s almost midnight.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Kroc looks at his watch, cringing. It’s 11:45.

                                 ETHEL KROC (O.S.)
                             (irritated)
                        I’m going to bed.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Oh. Okay. I’ll be careful not to--

           Click.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

           Ethel is asleep, alone in the too-big bed.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Kroc is asleep on his too-small office couch. Paperwork is 
           scattered across his chest and on the floor.

           NEXT MORNING--

           Kroc still on the couch, out cold. A light knock on the door.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
                        Mr. Kroc?

           June opens the door a crack. The sound stirs him.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
                        I’m very sorry, sir, I didn’t--

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’s alright, June. What is it?

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                        This just arrived.

           She hands him a PACKAGE. He looks at it, unsure what it is. 
           The return address is from SAN BERNARDINO.
           MOMENTS LATER--

           Kroc opens the package. Inside is a THICK BINDER. He flips 
           through it. Hundreds of pages of dense, detailed instructions 
           regarding all things McDonald’s.

           He slows at a section titled CONSTRUCTION. It’s packed with 
           BUILDING SPECS, including a folded BLUEPRINT. Kroc unfolds 
           it. A troubled look comes over his face.

           INT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Mac picks up the phone, Dick a few feet away. (Intercut as 
           necessary.)

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (”chipper”)
                        Hiya, Ray. How’s tricks?

                                 RAY KROC
                        What’s this about?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What’s what about?

                                 RAY KROC
                        The binder.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Oh, that? That’s just a little 
                        operating manual we worked up. 
                        Thought it might be helpful to you.

           Mac glances at Dick, who’s listening in with concern.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        There a problem?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Quite a few, actually.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Oh? Such as?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Well, for starters, the blueprint.
                             (reading)
                        Must build to exact specifications. 
                        No variations permitted.
                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Nothing personal, Ray. It’s just, 
                        what with everything we’ve been 
                        through with the other franchises.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You can’t actually expect me to use 
                        this.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Why not?

                                 RAY KROC
                        There’s no basement. No furnace.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        So?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Have you been to Chicago in the 
                        wintertime?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Look, if you’d like to propose an 
                        amendment to the design, just 
                        submit a request in writing, and 
                        we’ll be happy to--

                                 RAY KROC
                        In writing?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Please. Yes.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What’s wrong with the telephone?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That’s just how we’d prefer to do 
                        it.

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’ll set me back weeks. Months.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        As I said, it’s nothing personal.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I’m sorry, I don’t understand why I 
                        can’t just--

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That’s how we’d like to do it.
           Mac glances at Dick, who nods in support/approval. We get the 
           impression this was at his insistence.

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’s silly.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Maybe so, but those are the terms 
                        you agreed to. Any changes must be 
                        officially approved by Dick and 
                        myself in writing.

           ON KROC-- bewildered.

                                 RAY KROC
                        When the hell did I agree to that?

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc sits at his desk, combing through a copy of the contract 
           he signed in California. Sure enough:

           ANY AND ALL CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE SPEEDEE SYSTEM OR 
           ANY MCDONALD’S FRANCHISE, EITHER PHYSICAL OR CONCEPTUAL, MUST 
           BE FORMALLY SUBMITTED IN WRITING FOR APPROVAL BY BOTH RICHARD 
           MCDONALD AND MAURICE MCDONALD.

                                 RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
                        I’ve been hoodwinked!

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           June Martino stands in the middle of Kroc’s office.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Talk about a sneaky, underhanded 
                        move.

           ON KROC-- pacing the floor.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        They buried the lead. Slipped it 
                        into the fine print.

           June just nods helplessly, sympathetically.

           INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER DAY

           A hard-hatted Kroc stands in a dirt lot, watching workers lay 
           a building foundation. A nearby sign proclaims COMING SOON - 
           MCDONALD’S FAMOUS HAMBURGERS!
           June comes over with a letter, hands it to Kroc. His eyes go 
           to the San Bernardino return address, hands it back to her.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Read it.

           She opens the letter, reluctantly begins to read:

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                        Dear Ray, Thank you for your letter 
                        sharing your idea to strike a deal 
                        with Coca-Cola to sponsor menu 
                        boards at the new Des Plaines 
                        location. An intriguing notion, 
                        indeed! As you rightly point out, 
                        such an arrangement would provide a 
                        steady source of revenue to the 
                        store at no additional labor cost.

           ON KROC-- nodding, surprised and heartened.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
                        However...

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           A frustrated-as-hell Kroc is on the phone.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Small. At the bottom.

           INT. MCDONALD’S - SAN BERNARDINO - CONTINUOUS

           On the other end is Mac, his brother sitting nearby. 
           (Intercut as necessary.)

                                 RAY KROC (O.S.)
                        Very discrete.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I’m sorry, Ray. But we’re just not 
                        comfortable with the notion of 
                        turning our menu into an 
                        advertisement.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Coca-Cola’s already on the menu. 
                        What’s the difference if there’s 
                        another little--

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I’m sorry, Ray.
           ON KROC-- shut down.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You couldn’t have told me that five 
                        goddamn weeks ago?

           He slams down the phone.

           MOMENTS LATER--

           Mac and Dick, post-call. Dick shakes his head darkly.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        The guy’s trouble. He’s a loose 
                        cannon.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        He’s just a little... excitable.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        We never should have let him in.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Will you relax? Everything’s fine.

           We get the sense he’s telling himself this as much as Dick.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        He’s powerless. The contract 
                        protects us fully.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        A hothead like that, you don’t know 
                        what he’s capable of.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        It’s all bluster. His bark is worse 
                        than his bite.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                             (sour chuckle)
                        That’s what Neville Chamberlain 
                        said.

           INT. MCDONALDS (DES PLAINES) - KITCHEN - DAY

           The brand-new Des Plaines McDonald’s, up and running. 

           TRACKING SHOT, high-energy, as Kroc marches through the 
           restaurant barking out orders to his charges. It’s a bit 
           militaristic in vibe, echoing Dick’s Hitler reference:
           “Watch those fries!”... “Straighten that hat!”... “Buns to 
           the left! Pickles to the right!”... “Let’s go, boys!”

           He passes an EMPLOYEE, catching him in a moment of repose--

                                 RAY KROC
                        Grab a mop! If there’s time to 
                        lean, there’s time to clean!

           Tracking shot ends at the GRILL, manned by a trio of GRILLERS 
           overseeing dozens of patties. Kroc moves down the line.

           ON GRILLER #1, flipping a patty--

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Wrist! More wrist!

           Kroc grabs the spatula, demonstrates proper technique. He 
           moves onto GRILLER #2, moving a patty off the grill--

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Too fast--it’s still pink!

           He moves the patty back onto the grill. He moves on to 
           GRILLER #3--

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        What the heck are you...

           Kroc trails off, realizing Griller #3 is doing NOTHING WRONG. 
           His patties are perfect, arranged in rows so precise they 
           could have been lined up with a ruler.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Good.

           ON KROC-- taking in the eager young buck, who looks maybe 22.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 GRILLER #3
                        Fred Turner, sir.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Fred Turner...
                             (small, approving nod)
                        Keep it up.

                                 FRED TURNER
                        Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

           Kroc walks off. Turner is thrilled by the approval.
           EXT. MCDONALD’S - NIGHT (AFTER HOURS)

           Under the glow of the arches, Kroc scours the parking lot, 
           fanatically cleaning. Picking up discarded cups, scraping gum 
           off the underside of benches.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

           Ethel is asleep in bed. Kroc enters, home from a long, 
           exhausting day of work. He starts getting undressed. 

           As he unbuttons his shirt, he hears a sound... a SNIFFLE. He 
           looks at Ethel, sees she’s actually awake. His eyes go to her 
           pillow. It’s stained with tears.

           He goes over, sits down on the bed next to her. He looks at 
           her, feeling genuinely bad.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I’m sorry.

           He takes in her hurt face. Her cheeks damp with tears.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        I know I’ve neglected you.

           He looks her in the eye, contrite.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to give you more time. I 
                        promise.
                             (BEAT)
                        Tomorrow night. Let’s have supper 
                        at the club.

           She looks up at him, surprised, heartened.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        It’s been way too long.

           He sweetly hands her a tissue. She blows her nose.

           INT. ROLLING GREEN COUNTRY CLUB - DINING ROOM - NEXT NIGHT

           The dining room of a not especially upscale country club. 
           Kroc, in a red Rolling Green C.C. sport coat, leads Ethel to 
           a big round table. At it are fellow CLUB MEMBERS, who warmly 
           greet the Krocs. One of the men gives Ray a hearty hug.

                                 CLUB MEMBER
                        By George! I think I’ve seen a 
                        ghost!
           SHORT TIME LATER--

           The middle of the meal. Ray kibitzes with the men, Ethel 
           engaged in a cross-conversation with the wives.

           ON ETHEL AND THE WOMEN--

                                 CLUB WIFE #1
                        I hear Acapulco is divine.

                                 CLUB WIFE #2
                        Mildred Ballard was just there. She 
                        adored it.

           Ethel nods along, not wanting to stick out.

                                 CLUB WIFE #2 (CONT’D)
                        Where do you like, Ethel?

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Me?
                             (BEAT, scrambling)
                        Spain.

                                 CLUB WIFE #3
                        Wonderful, how was it?

                                 ETHEL KROC
                             (backtracks)
                        I mean... we’re thinking about it, 
                        planning to. In the fall.

           Nods and smiles from the other women. The conversation moves 
           on, bullet dodged.

           ON KROC AND THE MEN--

                                 JERRY CULLEN
                        That’s the last time I try a sand 
                        wedge in that bunker!

           Hearty laughs from the others, loving the golf humor.

                                 JACK HORFORD
                        How’s your game, Ray?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Lately? Non-existent.

           The men laugh, missing the literalness of the statement.

                                 JACK HORFORD
                        I’m no Ben Hogan myself.
           ON KROC-- seeing an opening in the conversation.

                                 RAY KROC
                        But I did recently hit a hole-in-
                        one of a different sort.

           He smiles cryptically. The men look at each other, intrigued. 

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Anybody interested in hearing about 
                        an exciting investment opportunity?

           Kroc sneaks a glance at Ethel, who’s immersed in the ladies’ 
           conversation, oblivious to Ray’s machinations.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           --Jerry Cullen signing FRANCHISE PAPERS as Kroc looks on.

           --Kroc and Jack Horford, in hardhats, presiding as ground is 
           broken at a CONSTRUCTION SITE. Behind them is a sign 
           featuring McDonald’s mascot Speedee, who says in a word 
           bubble: “HOWDY, SCHAUMBURG! McDONALD’S IS ON THE WAY!”

           --Kroc and Ethel having dinner again at Rolling Green, Kroc 
           working the menfolk, trolling for franchisees.

           --Kroc playing a round of golf at the club, giving his golf 
           mates the McDonald’s sales spiel.

           --Kroc looking on as one of the golf guys signs a contract.

           EXT. MCDONALD’S (SCHAUMBURG) - DAY

           Kroc pulls into the parking lot of the brand-new Schaumburg 
           store. There’s a line out front, not spectacular but solid. 

           He parks, heads toward the restaurant with a spring in his 
           step. He abruptly slows, noticing something:

           ANGLE ON a CUSTOMER in his car, biting into a hamburger. 
           Sticking out the sides of the burger is a piece of LETTUCE.

           ON KROC-- stunned, appalled.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc enters the kitchen.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Jack?
           He looks around, doesn’t see Horford. Kroc goes over to the 
           dressing station, where, in addition to the standard fixings, 
           there’s a tray of lettuce.

           EXT. ROLLING GREEN C.C. - GOLF COURSE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Jack Horford, part of a foursome, is about to tee off.

                                 GOLF BUDDY
                        Give it a whack, Jack.

           Horford rears back to swing when, out the corner of his eye, 
           he sees Kroc, STORMING ONTO THE COURSE, marching toward him. 

           Horford sees he’s holding something. A hamburger. Kroc gets 
           right up in his face waving the burger.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What is this?

           Horford stares at the burger, bewildered.

                                 JACK HORFORD
                        It appears to be a hamburger.

                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s not a McDonald’s hamburger.

           He lifts off the bun, pointing out the many deficiencies--

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Too much ketchup. Three pickles not 
                        two. Lettuce. Lettuce?

                                 JACK HORFORD
                        Do you think maybe we could discuss 
                        this later? We’re in the middle of--

                                 RAY KROC
                        And the patty.
                             (tears open the meat)
                        Tragically overcooked.

                                 JERRY CULLEN (O.S.)
                        I don’t know, Ray...

           Fellow franchise owner Jerry Cullen (part of the foursome) 
           leans in, checking out the burger. 

                                 JERRY CULLEN (CONT’D)
                        Looks good to me.

           He impulsively grabs it, takes a big bite.
                                 JERRY CULLEN (CONT’D)
                        Delicious.

           Kroc stares at Cullen with deep suspicion. Et tu, Jerry?

           EXT. MCDONALD’S (JERRY CULLEN’S) - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc marches through the parking lot toward Cullen’s 
           McDonald’s. On the way, he’s met with the disturbing sight of 
           a WOMAN in her car--eating a HOT DOG. 

           Kroc looks at the menu, stunned to see HOT DOG listed. 
           Scanning, he spots FRIED CHICKEN and CORN ON THE COB, too.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc looks around the kitchen, scanning for offenses. He 
           quickly spots plenty--

           An overflowing trash can. An open freezer door. And, for the 
           capper, a USED TISSUE on the Lazy Susan. He watches in horror 
           as the BUN DRESSER grabs it, wiping his red, drippy nose.

           Kroc looks to the wall. Hanging there is a framed headshot of 
           a smiling Jerry Cullen. A plaque at the bottom says JERRY 
           CULLEN - OWNER/OPERATOR.

           INT. ROLLING GREEN - CLUBHOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

           The golf foursome are enjoying some post-golf cocktails at 
           the clubhouse, called “The 19th Hole”.

                                 JERRY CULLEN 
                        If you’re a six handicap, I’m 
                        Lawrence of Arabia!

           Roaring laughs. They’re all a bit drunk, having a great time. 
           Jack Horford looks up toward the door. His face falls--

                                 JACK HORFORD
                        Oh, boy. Here we go.

           ANGLE ON Kroc storming into the clubhouse, loaded for bear. 
           He makes a beeline for Cullen.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What the hell kind of two-bit 
                        operation you running, Cullen?

                                 JERRY CULLEN
                        Hello, Ray.
                                 RAY KROC
                        Fried chicken?

                                 JERRY CULLEN
                        People love fried chicken.

                                 RAY KROC
                        And the filth. It looked like some 
                        sort of Manchurian slum.

                                 JERRY CULLEN
                        With great chicken.

           Everybody laughs. Kroc is not amused.

                                 RAY KROC
                             (to Jack, Jerry)
                        Are you aware what goes on at your 
                        restaurants? Do you even care?

           Cullen and Horford look at each other, then back at Ray.

                                 JERRY CULLEN
                        Look, Ray... I don’t know about 
                        you, but I’m retired.

                                 JACK HORFORD
                        You said this would be a good place 
                        to park our money. It’s an 
                        investment, nothing more.

                                 JERRY CULLEN
                             (nods in agreement)
                        If I wanted a job, I’d have applied 
                        for a cook position.

           ON KROC-- silently stewing.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Ethel is getting dressed, putting on jewelry and makeup. Ray 
           enters, home from work.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Hurry up and get changed. Dinner’s 
                        called for seven.

                                 RAY KROC
                        We’re not going to the club 
                        tonight.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        You cancelled our dinner plans?
                                 RAY KROC
                        I cancelled our membership.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        What?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Those Rolling Green people aren’t 
                        our kind.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        What are you talking about?

                                 RAY KROC
                        I’ve lost interest in hobnobbing 
                        with the idle rich.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Idle rich?

                                 RAY KROC
                        With their golf and their Rob Roys.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Please tell me this is some kind of 
                        joke.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Contented. Complacent.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Those are my friends, Ray! My 
                        entire social life!

                                 RAY KROC
                        We’ll find new friends.

           Ethel throws herself onto the bed, bursting into tears. 

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                             (determined gaze)
                        Far more suitable.

           INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kroc is at work at his desk. The intercom buzzes.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
                        Mac McDonald for you.

           Kroc lets out a small, pained groan. He picks up.
                                 RAY KROC
                             (fake-friendly)

                             (equally fake-friendly)
                        Hiya, Ray!

           (Intercut as necessary.)

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Just thought I’d check in, see how 
                        it’s going with the new franchises.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Oh, fine. Swell.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Wonderful. Delighted to hear it.  
                        So your operators are panning out?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Swimmingly. We’re off to a flying 
                        start here in Chicagoland.

           A blast of hellacious DIARRHEA. We hard-cut on the sound to--

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc on the office toilet taking an angry, nervous dump.

           INT. FRONT DESK - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc walks toward the front desk with the men’s room key.

                                 SALESMAN (O.S.)
                        Just take a gander at this handsome 
                        gold inlay.

           Kroc comes to the desk, where a BIBLE SALESMAN (23) is 
           talking to June, briefcase full of samples popped open.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re telling me such marvelous 
                        craftsmanship isn’t worth $8.95?

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                        Thank you. I’m not interested.
                                 SALESMAN
                        Not interested in a Bible sure to 
                        be the pride of your home library?

           ON KROC-- observing the young salesman with interest.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        As I’m sure you know, June, envy is 
                        one of the seven cardinal sins. And 
                        that’s just what your friends and 
                        neighbors will be guilty of when 
                        they see this leather-bound beauty 
                        on your bookshelf.

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                        Sir, this is a private place of 
                        business. I’m afraid I’m going to 
                        have to ask you to--

                                 RAY KROC
                        What’s your name, son?

           The salesman turns to Kroc.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Leonard. Leonard Rosenblatt.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Rosenblatt?

           Ray stares at him, curiosity piqued.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        What’s a Jew doing selling Catholic 
                        Bibles?

                                 LEONARD ROSENBLATT
                             (blunt, unapologetic)
                        Making a living.

           ON KROC-- taking in the hungry young go-getter. It’s not hard 
           to read his mind: This is just the type of fellow I need.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rosenblatt and his wife MYRA (22) sit across from Kroc. Kroc 
           slides a pen and contract across the desk to them.

           Leonard looks at the contract. At his wife.

           ON LEONARD AND MYRA ROSENBLATT-- looking at each other, 
           excited, hopeful, nervous. 
           A young couple, staking everything on a shared dream. Myra 
           gives her husband’s hand a loving, supportive squeeze.

                                 MYRA ROSENBLATT 
                        I believe in you.

                                 LEONARD ROSENBLATT
                        Us.

           ON KROC-- watching the interaction with admiration--and more 
           than a touch of jealousy.

           EXT. MCDONALD’S (THE ROSENBLATTS’) - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)

           The Rosenblatts’ new McDonald’s in Waukegan, IL. Festive 
           bunting lines the front, a banner proclaiming GRAND OPENING 
           TODAY! A line of the curious and hungry forms outside.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The hustle and bustle of a smooth-running kitchen. It’s a 
           model of cleanliness and professionalism, everything the 
           country clubbers’ franchises were not.

           ON KROC-- standing in the middle, observing various workers, 
           pleased and impressed by everything he sees.

                                 LEONARD ROSENBLATT (O.S.)
                        Let’s go, chop-chop!

           KROC’S POV: Rosenblatt moving about the kitchen, barking out 
           orders, making sure everything’s just so. The mirror image of 
           Kroc at his Des Plaines store.

                                 MYRA ROSENBLATT (O.S.)
                        Here you go, sport...

           Kroc looks toward the front of the store, where he sees-- 

           MYRA, handing out lollipops to children. She’s wearing a red 
           apron that says McDonald’s and a big smile on her face. 

           Kroc goes over. She hands him a lollipop.

                                 MYRA ROSENBLATT (CONT’D)
                        It’s normally 10 and under, but 
                        I’ll make an exception.

           Kroc looks at the lollipop. Tied to it is a red ribbon with 
           the store’s address on it. He couldn’t be more impressed.
           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Kroc is getting undressed for bed, buzzing.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You should’ve seen this place.

           ON ETHEL-- in bed, her eyelids growing heavy.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        And those owners. You’ve never seen 
                        a pair of dynamos like these two. 
                        He’s in back, running the kitchen, 
                        she’s up front, passing out suckers 
                        to the kiddies. Like a team.
                             (no reply)
                        It’s wonderful.

           Kroc looks at Ethel, irked to see her drifting off.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you think?

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Think what?

                                 RAY KROC
                        That it’s wonderful. 
                             (touch loaded)
                        Two people, side by side, working 
                        together.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        It’s wonderful.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You say that with such sincerity.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        It mean it. It’s wonderful.
                             (singing, sarcastic)
                        S’wonderful... s’marvelous...

           A stretch of edgy silence as he pulls off his socks.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I made us supper plans for Friday 
                        night.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        I don’t suppose you rejoined the 
                        club.
                                 RAY KROC
                        Someplace much better.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        Oh, goody. I’ll polish my diamonds.

           INT. VFW HALL - EVENING

           ANGLE ON a big banner across a wood-paneled wall: VFW POST 
           482 - FRIDAY NIGHT POTLUCK DINNER & BINGO

           PAN DOWN to a long table lined with couples. Blue-collar 
           types, several rungs down the social ladder from Rolling 
           Green. And younger--the average age is closer to 30 than 60. 

           In the midst of them, we find Ray and Ethel. They’re dressed 
           deliberately “blue collar”, matching the people around them. 
           Ethel’s neck and hands are conspicuously jewelry-free.

           As Ethel picks listlessly at her meatloaf, Kroc chats up the 
           COUPLE (mid-20s) next to them.

                                 RAY KROC
                        So Art, what do you do for a 
                        living?

                                 ART WOLODARSKY
                        Well, I had a little plumbing 
                        business going for a while after 
                        getting out of the service. Now I 
                        sell vacuum cleaners. And I give 
                        piano lessons on the side.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Golly. Plumbing, pianos, you’re a 
                        regular jack of all trades.

                                 ART WOLODARSKY
                        Whatever puts food on the table.

           Art’s WIFE smiles proudly at her hard-working man.

           ON KROC-- sizing them up. They totally fit the profile.

                                 RAY KROC
                        How would you like to do more than 
                        merely put food on the table?

                        Hustlers! Scrappers! Grinders!

           More SNIPPETS of speeches to potential franchise owners. 
           Mechanics and schoolteachers, immigrants and outsiders.

           “With hard work and sacrifice...” 

           “With gumption and elbow grease...” 

           “This is your opportunity to climb the ladder of success!” 

           “...the brass ring!” 

           “...the American Dream!”

           Over and over, he invokes the same word: FAMILY.

           “When you join the McDonald’s family...” 

           “McDonald’s is a family business. By families, for families.” 

           “Our core family values...”

           Shots of KROC GAINING TRACTION, getting on a roll:

           --YOUNG COUPLES cashing out bank accounts
           --Kroc cutting the ribbon at store openings. Lines down the 
           block, cash registers ringing.

           --Kroc biting into a burger served by the owner/operator of a 
           new franchise. Art Wolodarsky.

           --Kroc driving back to his own store in Des Plaines, sweeping 
           the parking lot after dark. Relentless, inexhaustible.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kroc stands before a U.S. MAP tacked to the wall. Half a 
           dozen pins are clustered around the Illinois-Wisconsin area.

           ON KROC-- surveying the map with the bearing of a general, 
           hands clasped behind his back.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
                        Sir?

           June is standing by the door.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
                        We have a little problem.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kroc at his desk with June. Spread out before them is the 
           company’s financial ledger.

                                 RAY KROC
                        How could we be out of working 
                        capital?

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                        Well...

           She runs a finger down a column of figures in the ledger.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
                        There’s your monthly gross revenue.

           Kroc takes in the figures with dismay.

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’s it?

                        Percent. Of franchisee profits.

           MOMENTS LATER--

           June is flipping through Kroc’s contract with the brothers. 
           She finds the page she’s looking for, plants a finger on a 
           section in the middle. Amidst a sea of legalese--

           ...SHALL RECEIVE ONE AND FOUR-TENTHS PERCENT (1.4%) OF NET 
           PROFITS GENERATED BY...

           June looks at Kroc staring at it, surprised by his apparent 
           surprise.

                                 JUNE MARTINO
                             (treading lightly)
                        You never...?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Of course I’ve read it!

                        I want to renegotiate.

                                 RAY KROC
                        My deal. My lousy deal.

                        Ray...

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’s scarcely enough to cover my 
                        basic monthly overhead, much less 
                        drive expansion.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I don’t understand.

                        You boys have got me working with 
                        both hands tied behind my back.

                        Are you just now looking at your

                        You’ve set me up to fail.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That’s the cut you agreed to. 
                        Freely and willingly.
                                 RAY KROC
                        What I agreed to was to do 
                        everything in my power to make 
                        McDonald’s a smashing national 
                        success. And I assumed, perhaps 
                        naïvely, that you’d be an ally in 
                        that effort and not an impediment.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Nobody’s being an impediment.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Then renegotiate my deal.

           Mac glances at Dick.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We can’t do that.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Five percent.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I’m sorry.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Four and a half.

                        I’m sorry, Ray.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Goddammit!
                             (flings contract)
                        You took advantage of me!

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That’s not true.

                                 RAY KROC
                        It is. You exploited my trusting 
                        nature.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        In case you forgot, Ray, you pushed 
                        for a deal. Not us. You’re the one 
                        who wanted it. Badly.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Because I just wanted to help you.

                        and the best.

           A BEAT of silence from Mac, possibly telling.

                        That is your dream, right?

                        I said the biggest and the best.

                        What?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We’ve got a great thing going here 
                        in San Bernardino. We have a 
                        thriving business that produces a 
                        quality product. That people love.

                        I’m trying to say... 
                             (BEAT)
                        We’re happy. We’re content.

                        2,000. Sounds good. Nice round 
                        number.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I think we’re getting a little

                        I mean, sure, but... 

                                 RAY KROC

                        That’s never been the primary goal.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Those were your words.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Mac and Dick sit at their desks in gloomy post-call silence.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        So Neville, how’d it go in Munich?

           No reply from Mac. Dick waves an imaginary Anglo-German 
           Agreement Of 1938.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Which is?

                                 DICK MCDONALD

                        Is he a pain in the rear? Yes. Has 
                        he got a few screws loose? Maybe. 
                        But that doesn’t mean he’s going to 
                        do us any actual harm.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        If you say so.

                        I don’t, the contract does.

           We notice a light sheen of sweat forming on Mac’s forehead.

                        He’s powerless. Any and all changes 
                        have to be...

           Mac unexpectedly trails off, losing his train of thought.

                                 MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Any and all...

                        Mac?

           Mac loosens his tie a little. His face grows flushed.

                                 DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

           Mac looks woozy, lightheaded.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        It’s not fair.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Mac...

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        When are you gonna let me walk the 
                        dog, Dickie?

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I think you’re having one of your--

           THUNK. Mac flops over, CRASHING TO THE FLOOR. 

           Dick rushes to Mac’s desk, opens the bottom drawer. He takes 
           out a small red box that says GLUCAGON EMERGENCY KIT.

           SAN BERNARDINO - KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Mac is sitting on the floor, nursing a McDonald’s milkshake.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        A few more sips.

           Dick takes a sip of the shake. His sleeves are rolled up, 
           exposing a MEDIC ALERT BRACELET. Engraved on it is DIABETES 
           TYPE 2.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I’m okay.

           ON DICK-- looking at his brother with love and worry.

           ON MAC-- gazing off darkly at something.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Contentment is merely laziness in 
                        disguise.

           Turner ponders this earnestly, an impressionable young man.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        And do you know what laziness is?

                        It’s fear. Of success. Of 
                        sacrifice. Of doing the necessary 
                        hard work.

           Turner nods thoughtfully.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        McDonald’s could be the biggest 
                        thing going. But those two yokels 
                        out there in the desert can’t see 
                        past their own front porch. They’re 
                        a couple of field mice, afraid of 
                        their own shadows.
                             (shakes head)
                        I can’t stand small-mindedness.

                        Those boys have no clue what 
                        they’ve got on their hands. They 
                        struck gold and decided to open a 
                        copper mine.

           Turner nods sympathetically. Shakes his head.

                                 FRED TURNER
                        They don’t deserve this company.

           planted.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Kroc sits at his desk. Staring up at him is a mountain of 
           BILLS AND INVOICES. Among them are numerous PAST-DUE NOTICES.

           Kroc stares at them, overwhelmed. He picks one up, somewhat 
           at random. A bill from Chicago Gas & Electric. He opens it.

           ON KROC-- taking in the amount, appalled.

                                 FRED TURNER
                        You wouldn’t believe what it costs 
                        to power one of these suckers.

           Kroc looks at the electric bill in his hand, shakes his head.

                                 FRED TURNER (CONT’D)
                        My pop used to own an ice-cream 
                        parlor. He went belly-up from the 
                        refrigeration costs.

           Kroc’s eye drifts to one side of the cooler. The entire thing 
           is filled with drums of ice cream for the milkshakes.

           ON KROC-- staring contemplatively at the drums.
                                 CASHIER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Kroc?

           Standing in the cooler doorway is a young CASHIER.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                        We’re all out of singles.

           BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc is bent over the office safe. He enters the combination, 
           opens it. He takes out a pack of singles, $50 in ones.

           REGISTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc brings the singles to the register, sticks them in the 
           drawer. The cashier grabs three, hands them to a customer.

                                 CASHIER
                        Here’s your change, sir. I’m very 
                        sorry about the wait.

           ANGLE ON the customer, a white-haired gentleman (50s) in an 
           expensive suit. He has a polished, cosmopolitan air about 
           him. As we will later learn, this is HARRY SONNEBORN.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        No worries at all. For a burger 
                        like this, I’ve got all day.

           Sonneborn looks Kroc over, sizing him up as the owner.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        This your place?

                                 RAY KROC
                        It is.

           ON SONNEBORN-- looking around, taking in the thriving 
           operation. He seems like he’s thinking. He gives Kroc a 
           small, slightly enigmatic nod of approval and WALKS OFF.

           ON KROC-- watching him go, mildly amused/intrigued.
           INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc returns to his office. He drops the electric bill on top 
           of the bill stack on his desk. As he does, June enters the 
           room with a fresh batch of mail. She hands it to him.

           ON KROC-- sifting through the new mail. More bills, including 
           one from MIDWAY SAVINGS & LOAN stamped “PAST DUE”.

           He stares at the letter. A look of physical discomfort comes 
           over him.

           INT. OFFICE - MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc on the toilet, shitting his anxious guts out.

           He grabs a magazine off the rack. An industry trade 
           publication, RESTAURANT BUSINESS MONTHLY. He idly flips 
           through it. As he does, something catches his eye.

           ANGLE ON a full-page ad. For something called INSTAMIX. A 
           powdered milkshake mix. The ad copy trumpets--

           ATTENTION OWNER-OPERATORS: INTRODUCING INSTAMIX, THE 
           MIRACULOUS INSTANT ICE-CREAM SUBSTITUTE THAT WILL SAVE YOU 
           “SCOOPFULS” OF TIME AND MONEY!

           GREATER VOLUME! HIGHER PROFITS! MAKES REFRIGERATION A THING 
           OF THE PAST!

           ON KROC-- staring at the ad, wheels turning.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

           Kroc at his desk on the phone.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I want to run something by you.

           INT. SAN BERNARDINO - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Mac is on the other end, Dick listening in on the second 
           line. (Intercut as necessary.)

                                 RAY KROC
                             (his old salesman’s flair)
                        What if I told you there was a way 
                        to save you, me, and all our owner-
                        operators literally hundreds of 
                        dollars a year in electrical costs?
                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Well...

                                 RAY KROC
                        And free up valuable storage space. 
                        And reduce the amount of time it 
                        takes to make a milkshake by half.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I’ll bite. What is it?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Ready? It’s called...
                             (”drum roll”)
                        Instamix.

           Mac looks over at Dick.

                        Instamix.

           Kroc grabs a SILVER-FOIL PACKET off his desk.

                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s a powdered milkshake. Costs a 
                        fraction of ice cream, no 
                        refrigeration necessary.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Powdered?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Thickening agents and emulsifiers 
                        simulate the texture of milkfat. 
                        Tastes just like the real thing.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Ray...

                                 RAY KROC
                        Comes in vanilla and chocolate. 

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Ray...

                                 RAY KROC
                        And it’s easy as pie to prepare. 
                        Just stir the packet contents into 
                        eight ounces of water and stir.

           We see, on his desk, a sample VANILLA SHAKE that he’s made.
                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Do you hear yourself? Do you hear 
                        what you’re saying?

                                 RAY KROC
                        I really think it’s a crackerjack 
                        idea.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Absolutely not.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Why?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I have no interest in a milkshake 
                        that contains no milk.

                                 RAY KROC
                        At least give a try. I’m telling 
                        you, you’ll never be able to tell 
                        the--

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        A powdered shake flies in the face 
                        of everything McDonald’s stands 
                        for.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Which is?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Freshness. Quality.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Value.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        A McDonald’s milkshake is made from 
                        100 percent real milk. 

                                 RAY KROC
                        You don’t want to save a bundle? I 
                        know I sure wouldn’t mind boosting 
                        my bottom--

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Milk. Milk. Now and forever.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE/LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kroc enters the house, still steaming from the call with the 
           brothers. He hangs up his coat and makes a beeline for the 
           liquor cabinet, pours himself a stiff drink. As he gulps it 
           down, he’s startled to see... Ethel, sitting in a recliner in 
           a corner of the darkened room.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Ethel.

           She glares at him in stony silence, even stonier than usual.

                        You don’t know?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Of course not.

                        Why would I?

                        What?

           LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Kroc banished to the living-room couch. He tosses and turns, 
           trying to get comfortable. He rolls over, revealing a NASTY 
           WELT on his temple.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

           Kroc is on the phone. The welt is covered with a bandage.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I specifically said the office is 
                        the best place to reach me!

           On the other end is Harvey C. Peltz, his home-mortgage

                        I tried you there, Mr. Kroc. 
                        Numerous times.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You have no right to call me at my 
                        home. It’s a blatant invasion of 
                        privacy.

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        With all due respect, sir, when 
                        you’re three months behind on your 
                        payments, you don’t get to pick and 
                        choose where you’re contacted.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc sits his desk staring at the ever-growing pile of bills. 
           The intercom buzzes.

                        He says you don’t know him.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Is he with the bank?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Then who’s he with?

                        Tell him no thanks, we already have 
                        a supplier.

                        Just let me talk to you already!

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Settling into a chair is Harry Sonneborn, the patrician 
           gentleman who we (and Kroc, vaguely) recognize from their 
           exchange at the Des Plaines McDonald’s a few days earlier.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        So McDonald’s.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You’re wasting your time. We’re 
                        perfectly satisfied with our 
                        current supplier.
                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        I’m not looking to sell you meat. 
                        I’m looking to work for you.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        I’ve been keeping an eye on your 
                        company for some time, and I must 
                        say I’m extremely impressed. I see 
                        a bright future for McDonald’s--and 
                        I want to be a part of it.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I’m flattered. Really and truly. 
                        But I’m unfortunately not in any 
                        position to hire you.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        You lack the authority?

                                 RAY KROC
                        I lack the money.

           ON SONNEBORN-- nodding, absorbing.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        Then you definitely need to hire 
                        me.

           He hands Kroc a business card. Kroc looks at it...

           ILLINOIS BEEF COMPANY

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        I want $100 a week.

           Kroc looks up, taken aback.

                                 RAY KROC
                        My secretary gets more.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        That’s alright. You’ll give me a 
                        big raise when I turn this ship 
                        around.

           ON KROC-- blown away by this man’s confidence and audacity.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        Now say yes and show me your books.
           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc and Sonneborn sit in front of the ledger, poring over 
           it, Sonneborn asking questions.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc closes the ledger.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        So to summarize, you’ve got a 
                        negligible revenue stream, no cash 
                        reserves, and an albatross of a 
                        contract that gives you no autonomy 
                        and requires you to go through a 
                        maddeningly slow approval process 
                        to enact any changes--if approved 
                        at all. Am I missing anything?

                                 RAY KROC
                        I believe that covers it.

           ON SONNEBORN-- processing for a BEAT.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        Tell me about the land.

                                 RAY KROC
                        The land?

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        The land, the buildings. How that 
                        whole side of it works.

                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s pretty simple, really. The 
                        franchise operator finds a piece of 
                        land he likes, takes out a lease, 
                        usually a 20-year. Then he gets a 
                        construction loan, puts up the 
                        building, and off he goes.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        So the franchisee picks the 
                        location. He selects the property.

           Kroc nods.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not involved? You have no 
                        say?
                                 RAY KROC
                        Why would I?

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        So you supply the training, the 
                        system, the operational know-how, 
                        and he’s responsible for the rest.

           Kroc nods, unsure why he’s so interested in all of this.

           ON SONNEBORN-- nodding, processing. He seems bothered.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Is there a problem?

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        A big one.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Which is?

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        That you don’t seem to realize what 
                        business you’re in. You’re not in 
                        the burger business... You’re in 
                        the real-estate business.

           ON KROC-- confused.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t build an empire off a 1.4 
                        percent cut of a 15-cent burger. 
                        You build it by owning the land 
                        upon which that burger is cooked.

           Kroc seems intrigued, interested to hear more.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        What you ought to be doing is 
                        buying up plots of land and then 
                        turning around and leasing them to 
                        franchisees, who as a condition of 
                        their deal should be permitted to 
                        lease from you and you only. This 
                        will provide you with two things: 
                        First, a steady, upfront revenue 
                        stream. Money flows in before the 
                        first stake is in the ground. And 
                        second, greater capital for 
                        expansion. Which in turn will fuel 
                        further land acquisition, which in 
                        turn will fuel further expansion. 
                        And so on and so on and so on.
           ON KROC-- listening with his jaw on the floor. This guy is a 
           financial genius.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        This model not only gives you money 
                        but something I suspect you crave 
                        even more... control. Control over 
                        the franchisee: Fail to uphold 
                        quality standards, we cancel your 
                        lease. And even more important, 
                        control over Dick and Mac McDonald: 
                        Their power stops at the building’s 
                        foundation; yours goes all the way 
                        to the soil.

           An evangelical smile spreads across Sonneborn’s face.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        Land. That’s where the money is. 
                        And the power. He who controls the 
                        land controls the company.

           ON KROC-- thunderstruck. It’s the most brilliant thing he’s 
           ever heard, the answer to all his problems.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        Any questions?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Just one. 

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        Yes?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Where am I going to get the money?

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        To buy land?

           Kroc nods.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                             (confident smile)
                        Leave that to me.

           MONTAGE:

           The Harry & Ray Show. Sonneborn and Kroc jumping into action:

           --Sonneborn taking meetings with BANKERS AND INVESTORS in New 
           York City. Confidently presenting his sweeping vision to 
           conference rooms full of heavy hitters. 
           (He stands in sharp contrast to Kroc: Kroc is Main Street, 
           Sonneborn is Wall Street; Kroc is a salesman, Sonneborn is a 
           businessman.)

           --Hands being shaken, deals being struck.

           --Kroc criss-crossing the country by plane shopping for land. 
           Scouting suburban neighborhoods, plots of land near schools 
           and churches. Fertile ground for the planting of arches.

           --Kroc’s U.S. map filling in with pins. 10, 20, 30...

           --Kroc and Sonneborn presiding over lease signings. MOLINE, 
           KNOXVILLE, ORLANDO, KALAMAZOO. 

           --New franchisees combing through hundred-page agreements. 
           Glimpses of legalese:

           ANY AND ALL CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS MUST BE... SHOULD LESSEE 
           FAIL TO UPHOLD STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND QUALITY AS DEEMED BY 
           LESSOR, LESSOR HAS THE RIGHT TO...

           Control. For Kroc.

           END OF MONTAGE.

           INT. MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - OFFICE - MORNING

           The restaurant isn’t open yet. Dick is going through a stack 
           of mail. He opens a letter, puzzled by what he sees.

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mac is kneeling in front of the grill, making some adjustment 
           to the knobs. Dick comes over with the letter.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Have you heard of the Franchise 
                        Realty Corporation?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        No. What is it?

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I have no idea. But apparently Ray 
                        Kroc is the president and CEO.

           He hands the letter to Mac.

           ANGLE ON letter, written on FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION 
           letterhead.
           The letter itself is some innocuous bit of McDonald’s 
           business from Kroc to the brothers. But it’s really an excuse 
           to flash the letterhead and the signature at the bottom: 
           RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT/CEO

           INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - SHORT TIME LATER

           June is at the front desk. Behind her, WORKMEN are taking 
           down the old Prince Castle Sales sign and putting up a new 
           one in its place: FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION

           The phone rings. Through it, we hear Mac McDonald.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc picks up his phone. (Intercut as necessary.)

                                 RAY KROC
                        Mac! How are ya?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Well, if you really want to know, 
                        Ray, I’m a little bit miffed.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I’m sorry to hear that. What seems 
                        to be the trouble?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Franchise Realty Corporation.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What about it?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Well, for starters, would you care 
                        to tell me what it is?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Oh, it’s nothing, really. Just a 
                        little something I created to help 
                        provide leasing services and 
                        support to new franchisees.

           Mac can practically hear Kroc’s smirk through the phone.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        You know full well you can’t do 
                        something like that without 
                        clearing it with us.
                                 RAY KROC
                        Why would I need to do that?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Why? Because as your contract 
                        plainly states, all changes must 
                        be——

                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s not a change.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Excuse me?

                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s a company.

           ON MAC-- confused, alarmed.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Its own separate company. Which 
                        puts it outside your purview.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Anything relating to McDonald’s is 
                        within my and my brother’s--

                                 RAY KROC
                        You boys have full say over what 
                        goes on inside your restaurants. 
                        But outside? Above? Below?
                             (BEAT)
                        Your authority stops at the door. 
                        And the floor.

           ON MAC-- caught without a response.

           ON DICK-- standing in the doorway listening, angry and 
           disgusted with his brother for leading them down this path.

           Mac can’t bear to look his brother in the eye. He knows he 
           fucked up.

           INT. EASTERN AIRLINES - DAY

           A flight in mid-air. Kroc, in a window seat, gazes out at the 
           flat, snow-dusted expanse below. Next to him is Fred Turner, 
           his head buried in a MCDONALD’S OPERATIONS MANUAL.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, we are about 
                        to begin our initial descent into 
                        Minneapolis-St. Paul.
           EXT. MCDONALD’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc and Turner pull up to a brand-new McDonald’s in a taxi. 
           Stretched across the front is a banner proclaiming MINNESOTA 
           IS MCDONALD’S COUNTRY! They step out of the cab. 

                                 JIM ZIEN (O.S.)
                        Welcome!

           JIM ZIEN, the burly, gregarious owner, comes out to greet 
           them. With a showman’s flourish, he gestures to a pair of 
           HIGH-SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS dressed in McDonald’s red and white.

                                 JIM ZIEN (CONT’D)
                        Gimme an M!

                                 CHEERLEADERS
                        M!

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        Gimme a C!

                                 CHEERLEADERS
                        C!

           ON KROC-- beaming at the red-carpet reception.

           INT. MCDONALD’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Zien is leading Kroc and Turner on a tour of the kitchen. 
           It’s spotless, immaculately run. Everyone is on their best 
           behavior, well aware of the VIP in their midst.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        This should all look familiar.

           They slow at the grill, where a YOUNG EMPLOYEE is laying out 
           the first patties of the day. He pauses to greet Kroc.

                                 GRILLER
                        Welcome, Mr. Kroc.
                             (admiring handshake)
                        It’s an honor to meet you.

           Kroc can’t help but see in this eager young buck another Fred 
           Turner. Speaking of whom--

                                 FRED TURNER
                             (shakes griller’s hand)
                        Fred Turner. Director of 
                        Operations.
                                 GRILLER
                        Bobby Petrillo.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        Bobby here is our top griller.

           Kroc takes a moment to admire Bobby’s handiwork. Rows of 
           patties lined up with Fred Turner-like precision.

                                 RAY KROC
                             (to Bobby, re: Turner)
                        Keep it up, this could be you in a 
                        few years.

           ON BOBBY-- thrilled by the prospect. Getting back to work, he 
           reaches for another patty, but then he STOPS HIMSELF. He 
           heads for the nearby SINK, washes his hands.

                                 BOBBY PETRILLO
                             (to Kroc, smile)
                        Not that your hands would be dirty.

           Everyone enjoys a good laugh over this--especially Kroc.

           FRONT COUNTER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc, with Zien, watches as a cashier rings up a customer. A 
           big line is forming as lunch hour approaches.

                                 RAY KROC
                        How have sales been?

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        Oh, pretty good...

           Kroc detects a bit of hesitation in his voice.

                                 JIM ZIEN (CONT’D)
                        We came out of the gate like 
                        gangbusters, but lately... 

                                 RAY KROC
                        What?

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        Well, profits have leveled off a 
                        bit.

           Kroc glances at the long line of customers outside.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You seem to be doing just fine.
                                 JIM ZIEN
                        Customers aren’t the trouble. It’s 
                        expenses.

           ON KROC-- interested to hear more.

           WALK-IN COOLER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Zien leads Kroc into the big walk-in cooler. One whole side 
           is filled with drums of ice cream for the milkshakes. Just 
           like we saw in Des Plaines. Zien shakes his head.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        You can’t imagine the electric 
                        bill. Half my money goes to 
                        Minnesota Gas & Power.

           Kroc nods, all too familiar.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Oh, I could imagine.

           Kroc’s eyes go to the wall of ice cream. He stares at the 
           drums, antagonized by the sight of them. They make him think 
           of the brothers.

           INT. ROLLIE’S - NIGHT

           Kroc, Turner and Zien at a Minneapolis steakhouse. The WAITER 
           is taking their orders.

                                 FRED TURNER
                        And a baked potato.

                                 WAITER
                        Very good. 
                             (turns to Kroc)
                        And for you, sir?

                                 RAY KROC
                        How’s the rib eye?

                                 JIM ZIEN
                             (interjects)
                        Best in the Twin Cities.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Sounds good. Medium rare.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        And a couple sides of creamed 
                        spinach for the table.
           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Kroc is tucking into his steak.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        How is it?

                                 RAY KROC
                        You couldn’t top this in Chicago.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        We don’t mess around up here.

                                 RAY KROC
                        My compliments to the chef.

           ON ZIEN-- seeing an opening.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        I’ll do you one better. How about 
                        the owner?

           With this, Zien throws up a hand, waving at someone from 
           across the room. A man promptly comes over.

                                 MAN
                             (chummy back-pat)
                        Jimmy, good to see ya!

           We get the distinct sense this was all pre-arranged.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                             (re: food)
                        Everything alright tonight?

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        Wonderful as always, Rollie.

           This is ROLLIE SMITH, the owner. His eyes go to Kroc.

                                 JIM ZIEN (CONT’D)
                        Rollie Smith, meet Ray Kroc.

           Smith enthusiastically shakes his hand. (Turner is ignored.)

                                 RAY KROC
                        You’ve got a bang-up restaurant 
                        here.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Takes one to know one.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I see my reputation precedes me.
                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        I’m a great admirer.

           Kroc gestures to an empty chair, eager for more flattery.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
                             (fake-demurring)
                        I don’t want to interrupt.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Please.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Maybe just a minute.

           ONE HOUR LATER--

           The waiter is clearing everyone’s finished plates. Smith is 
           still there. He refills Kroc’s wine glass.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Well, you’ve certainly found a warm 
                        and loving home here in 
                        Minneapolis.

                                 RAY KROC
                        So it seems.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        This town just can’t get enough of 
                        McDonald’s. 
                             (”oh, hey”)
                        In fact, I’d say there’s sufficient 
                        enthusiasm to support another.

                                 RAY KROC
                        A second location?

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Absolutely. And come to think of 
                        it, I can think of somebody who’d 
                        be perfect to own and operate.

                                 RAY KROC
                             (gamely playing along)
                        Oh?

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Somebody who knows what it takes to 
                        build a great restaurant. A man 
                        with more than 25 years of hands-on 
                        experience in the food business.
                                 RAY KROC
                        Who?

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Me!

                                 RAY KROC
                             (”surprised”)
                        Oh!

           ON KROC-- deeply enjoying this. For a man who’s spent his 
           life groveling, sucking up to people, trying to curry favor, 
           to be on the receiving end is a thrilling new experience.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        I’ve got the know-how, I’ve got the 
                        backers. And I’ve got the location.

           As Smith makes his case, a PIANO is heard in the background. 
           Light and lovely tinkling.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Now obviously, where a restaurant 
                        goes is your call. But I’d be 
                        remiss if I didn’t call to your 
                        attention a piece of real estate I 
                        happen to know is available.

           ON KROC-- distracted, looking toward the piano.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Are you familiar with Hennepin 
                        Avenue?
                             (no reply)
                        It’s one of the busiest commercial 
                        thoroughfares in the entire Twin...

           He trails off, noticing Kroc is not listening.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Kroc?

           He sees Kroc staring off transfixed. He follows his gaze to--

           ...an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE (early 30s) playing a baby grand 
           piano in the corner. She begins to sing.

                                 PIANO WOMAN
                        A pretty girl is like a melody...

           Smith watches Kroc watch the woman. Kroc is clearly smitten.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Would you like to meet her?
           This gets Kroc’s attention.

           MOMENTS LATER--

           Smith is at the piano, leaning into the woman’s ear, saying 
           something. She gets up, goes over to the table with him.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Ray Kroc, meet Joan Smith.
                             (smile)
                        My wife.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           Joan is sitting next to Kroc, leaning in, hanging on his 
           every word.

                                 RAY KROC
                        ...Nashville, Memphis, Milwaukee, 
                        and Dayton, Ohio. 

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        Goodness gracious.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Oh, and Wilmington, Delaware.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        All in the last 18 months?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Twelve.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        Twelve? Why, you must be positively 
                        dizzy, Mr. Kroc.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Please. Call me Ray.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                             (eye contact, purr)
                        Ray...

           Kroc smiles, blushing, defenseless against the ego-stroking 
           of a pretty blonde.

           ON ROLLIE SMITH-- looking on from Joan’s other side, pleased 
           with his wife’s work.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        That’s some remarkable growth.
                                 JOAN SMITH
                        When did you start it?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Huh?

           ON KROC-- caught off guard by the question.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        What year? When did you start 
                        McDonald’s?

           BEAT. Kroc looks at Joan looking at him. So beautiful, so 
           impressed.

                                 RAY KROC

           A BEAT as the lie settles.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                             (shakes head, marveling)
                        Amazing.

           Kroc smiles; she’s got him wrapped around her finger.

                                 JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
                        I should probably get back.

                                 RAY KROC
                        To where?

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        To the piano.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Of course, of course.

           He nods, a little disappointed.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        What’s your favorite song?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Favorite song?

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        Your all-time favorite.

           He thinks for a BEAT.

                                 RAY KROC
                        “Pennies From Heaven”.
           With a smile, Joan gets up, heads over to the piano. She 
           starts to play. Ray immediately recognizes the melody.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        Every time it rains, it rains/ 
                        Pennies from heaven...

           ON KROC-- charmed, immensely turned on.

                                 JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Don't you know each cloud contains/
                        Pennies from heaven?

           Kroc gets up, heads over to the piano. He takes a seat on the 
           bench next to her. Removing her hands from the keys, he 
           starts to PLAY THE SONG. And SING.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You'll find your fortune fallin’ 
                        all over town/ Be sure that your 
                        umbrella is upside down...

           ON JOAN-- surprised and amazed.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                             (leans in)
                        Worked as an organ salesman for a 
                        few years.

           She smiles at this, charmed--possibly genuine.

                        If you want the things you love you 
                        must have showers...

           ON THE ROOM-- eating up the surprise duet. Including Rollie.

                                 RAY KROC AND JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
                        So when you hear it thunder, don't 
                        run under a tree/ There'll be 
                        pennies from heaven for you and me

           BIG APPLAUSE. Kroc stands up and takes a bow, basking in it. 
           Joan stands up, clapping and cheering for him, too.
           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT (FLIGHT HOME)

           Kroc gazes out the window in a state of dreamy reverie. It’s 
           not hard to tell what (or who) he’s thinking about.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - LATER

           Kroc enters the house. Ethel is in a chair reading a Barbara 
           Cartland romance novel.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                             (perfunctory)
                        How was your trip?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Do you really want to know?

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        I’m asking.

                                 RAY KROC
                        It was... triumphant. 
                             (BEAT)
                        They rolled out the red carpet for 
                        me. I was welcomed like a king. 
                        Everywhere I went, I was showered 
                        with adulation, admiration. 
                        Respect. People were kneeling 
                        before me, kissing my ring, 
                        practically begging for a 
                        McDonald’s.

           Ethel nods.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        That’s nice.

                                 RAY KROC
                             (edge)
                        It was.

                                 ETHEL KROC
                        I’m sure.

           Kroc glares at her with barely concealed rage. She chuckles 
           passive-aggressively.

                                 ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kroc leaning against his desk, arms folded confidently, a 
           big, winning grin on his face. It’s a weird sight until we 
           hear the click of a camera and realize it’s a PHOTO SHOOT. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Let’s try a few in front of the 
                        map.

           A PHOTOGRAPHER leads Kroc over to the expansion map, 
           significantly more crowded with pins now. Kroc strikes the 
           same pose, arms crossed.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Good, good.

           Kroc impulsively grabs a prop McDonald’s hamburger off the 
           desk, holding it up for the camera. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Love it.

           Kroc playfully takes a big, pretend bite.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        That’s a riot!
                             (snapping away)
                        That might be our cover shot.

           SHORT TIME LATER--

           The photographer and his ASSISTANT are packing up their gear. 
           The photographer hands Kroc a MAGAZINE from a bag.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Our current issue.

           Kroc looks at it, RESTAURANT BUSINESS MONTHLY. He starts idly 
           flipping through the magazine. He slows at a page.

           ANGLE ON a full-page ad for INSTAMIX. A new ad. Above an 
           image of a SPEEDING TRAIN done up in the Instamix colors--

           NOW AVAILABLE IN STRAWBERRY!

           ON KROC-- staring at the ad, wheels turning.
           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc is at his desk on the phone.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Remember that problem you were 
                        telling me about?

           INT. MCDONALD’S (JIM ZIEN’S) - CONTINUOUS

           Jim Zien is on the other end of the line.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        My cooler bill? What about it?

                                 RAY KROC
                        I think I’ve got the solution.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        Yeah? What?

                                 RAY KROC
                        How about I swing by and show you 
                        in person?

                                 JIM ZIEN
                             (a bit taken aback)
                        Swing by Minneapolis?

                                 RAY KROC
                             (”casual”)
                        Sure, why the heck not?

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - EVENING

           Kroc stands before a men’s room mirror, fixing his hair. He 
           adjusts his tie, making sure it’s just so. (It’s the first 
           time we’ve seen him exhibit such vanity.)

           He exits the bathroom, revealing he’s in--

           INT. ROLLIE’S - CONTINUOUS

           He heads to a table near the back where Zien, Zien’s WIFE, 
           and Rollie and Joan Smith are seated, in the middle of 
           dinner. Kroc retakes his seat next to Joan.

                                 JIM ZIEN
                        I was telling everybody about the 
                        product.
                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s gonna save you a small 
                        fortune.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                             (small chuckle)
                        That’s funny.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What?

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Mr. Multimixer, switching to 
                        powder.

           ON KROC-- not amused by the innocent, offhand comment.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Why’s that funny?

           The whole table suddenly tenses up.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        Y’know, it’s just... ironic.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Ironic.

           ON JOAN-- horrified by what her husband’s stepped into.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        But not in a bad way. Just because, 
                        y’know, you used to sell the thing 
                        for ice cream...

                                 RAY KROC
                        And now I’m advocating a powdered 
                        substitute.

                                 ROLLIE SMITH
                        I mean, yeah, but... 
                             (floundering)
                        It’s a terrific idea. Same great 
                        taste while boosting your bottom 
                        line. That’s a win-win. Plus, 
                        freeing up all that cooler space.

           Poor Rollie is dying inside. Joan is not happy.

           COAT CHECK - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc hands the restaurant’s COAT-CHECK GIRL his ticket. 
                                 JOAN SMITH (O.S.)
                        He meant nothing by it.

           Joan sidles up to Kroc, desperate to do damage control.

                                 JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
                        He has nothing but the utmost 
                        admiration for you and your 
                        success.
                             (touches Kroc’s arm)
                        As do I.

           Their eyes meet.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Kroc enters the bedroom, home from Minneapolis. He puts his 
           suitcase on the floor by his closet, looks over at his 
           sleeping wife.

           ON KROC-- staring stone-faced at Ethel as she sleeps.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kroc on the phone. He nods, listening with interest.

                                 JOAN SMITH
                        It’s about 10 miles south of 
                        downtown. They’re building a brand-
                        new sports stadium there. 

                                 RAY KROC
                        That’s right, I read about that.

                        I like the way you think, Joan.

                        That’s the one. He told me he 
                        received an unexpected shipment

                        You have no right to make any 
                        changes without our express 
                        permission. And that obviously 
                        includes the McDonald’s menu.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Nah.
                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Excuse me?

                                 RAY KROC
                        You heard me. Nah.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What does that mean?

                                 RAY KROC
                        It means from now on I’ll be doing 
                        things my way.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        You will abide by the terms of your

                                 RAY KROC
                        To hell with my deal. I’ve had it 
                        with following orders. You and your 
                        never-ending barrage of no’s. 

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        You have a contract, Ray.

                        If powdered milkshakes is your idea 
                        of progress, you have a profound 
                        misunderstanding of what McDonald’s 
                        is.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I have a better understanding of 
                        this company than you and your 
                        brother combined.

                                 MAC MCDONALD

                        some bubble in San Bernardino.

           INT. KROC’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING

           Kroc and Ethel eat dinner together in silence. All we hear is 
           the sound of knife scraping plate as they cut their meat.

                        You’re welcome.

           A stretch of tense silence. Cutting and chewing.

           The expansive, oak-walled office of a top Chicago law firm. 
           Kroc sits across from a LAWYER.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I want out.

                                 LAWYER
                        It’s unfortunately not so simple.

           He looks down at a DOCUMENT in his hand. Kroc’s contract with 
           the brothers.

                                 LAWYER (CONT’D)
                        This contract, it’s ironclad.

           Nearly the exact same scene, except a different office and a

           INT. SAN BERNARDINO MCDONALD’S - OFFICE - DAY

           The brothers enter the office. Dick notices a package on his 
           desk. It’s addressed to both of them.

           Dick opens it, pulls out a silver-foil Instamix packet. On 
           the front of the packet, it says: STRAWBERRY

           Dick reaches back into the package, pulls out a handwritten 
           note from Kroc--

           NEW FLAVOR... MAYBE YOU’LL LIKE THIS ONE!

           --BEST, RAY

           ON MAC-- looking at the note over Dick’s shoulder. A 
           disconcerted look comes over his face.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What’s...?

           Dick follows his brother’s eyes to the top of the note. It’s 
           not on the usual Franchise Realty Corporation letterhead. 
           It’s on letterhead for something called THE MCDONALD’S 
           CORPORATION. 

           And it’s signed at the bottom RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT
           INT. FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION - SHORT TIME LATER

           June is at the front desk. Behind her, WORKMEN are taking 
           down the Franchise Realty Corporation sign and putting up a 
           new one in its place: THE MCDONALD’S CORPORATION

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kroc is on the phone.

                                 RAY KROC
                        It was confusing.

           INT. SAN BERNARDINO - CONTINUOUS

           Mac is on the other end. Dick is there, too.

                                 RAY KROC (O.S.)
                        No one knew it had anything to do 
                        with McDonald’s.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What’s confusing is you calling 
                        yourself “The McDonald’s 
                        Corporation”. People will think 
                        it’s the whole company, not some 
                        real-estate arm. Which I suspect is 
                        exactly what you hope.

           Dick snatches the phone out of Mac’s hands.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        It’s not your company, Ray! Do you 
                        understand that?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Dick.

           It’s the first time Dick has gotten on the phone with Kroc.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I came up with the Speedee System. 
                        Not you.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Don’t get all bent out of shape.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        What did you ever come up with? 
                        Name one thing. You’re a leech. 
                        You’re a professional leech.
                                 RAY KROC
                        I’m sorry you feel that way, Dick.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I want you out. I want you out of 
                        this company.

                                 RAY KROC
                        And how do you propose to do that?

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        I don’t care, whatever it takes. 
                        We’ll sue you if necessary.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Sue me? Don’t make me laugh. You 
                        couldn’t afford to sue me. I could 
                        bury you in court costs alone. I’m 
                        the president and CEO of a major 
                        corporation with landholdings in 17 
                        states. And you? You run a burger 
                        stand in the desert. You’re a small 
                        business owner. That’s all you are, 
                        and that’s all you’ll ever be. A 
                        small business owner. A shopkeeper. 
                        I’m national. You’re fucking local.

           THUNK.

           Dick turns, sees HIS BROTHER ON THE FLOOR.

           The wail of an ambulance siren carries us to--

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Mac lies in a hospital bed, looking pale and weak. Dick looks 
           on as a DOCTOR talks to him.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’ve been following your eating 
                        plan?
                             (Mac nods)
                        Checking your glucose levels?
                             (Mac nods)
                        Taking your medication on a 
                        consistent basis?

                        Regular walks, 20 minutes a day?
                             (Mac nods)
                        No smoking?
                             (Mac nods)
                        Any stress?
           Mac does not nod.

                                 MAC MCDONALD

                                 DOCTOR
                        You need to watch that. Stress is a 
                        big contributing factor.

           The doctor flips back to the first page of Mac’s chart.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        As I said, your kidney function is 
                        currently at 50 percent. 18 months 
                        ago, it was 65. Drop any lower, 
                        you’re at serious risk for kidney 
                        failure.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

           Mac is doing a crossword puzzle, Dick in a chair nearby.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        William Who Rode With Paul Revere.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Letters?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Five. Fourth letter E. 

           Dick thinks for a BEAT.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Dawes.

           Mac pencils it in. A knock at the door.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Come in.

           Mac and Dick look toward the door, stunned to see--

           RAY KROC, holding a bouquet of flowers.

                                 RAY KROC
                        How ya feelin’?

           The brothers glare at the unwelcome guest.
                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        What are you doing here?

                                 RAY KROC
                        I’m here to see the patient.
                             (to Mac)
                        Heard you took a spill.

           Kroc extends the flowers to him. 

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        These are for you.

           Mac takes the flowers warily, like they’re laced with anthrax 
           or something. He notices the CARD that’s attached.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Open it.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        No, thanks. 

                                 RAY KROC
                        C’mon. Open the card.

           Mac reluctantly opens the envelope. Inside is a GET-WELL 
           CARD. He opens it. 

           A CHECK falls out. Blank.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        What is this?

                                 RAY KROC
                        What’s it look like?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        It looks like a blank check.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Well, then that must be what it is.

           Mac and Dick look at each other. They look at the check.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        How much should I make it out for?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That depends. What are you buying?

           Kroc flashes a smile.

                                 RAY KROC
                        The company, of course.
           HOSPITAL ROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

           Mac lies awake in bed, unable to sleep. Over in the recliner, 
           Dick is awake, too.

           After a stretch of silence:

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We’ll never beat him.
                             (BEAT)
                        We’ll never be rid of him.

           ON DICK-- gazing off. He knows his brother is right.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kroc is standing before the franchise map. There are now 
           nearly a hundred pins in it. The intercom buzzes.

                                 JUNE MARTINO (O.S.)
                        Dick McDonald for you.

           Kroc picks up, friendly and casual--

                        Hello, Dick.

                        $2.7 million.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Excuse me?

                        $2.7. That’s a million dollars for 
                        each of us after taxes.

                                 DICK MCDONALD
                        Yes. One percent of the company’s 
                        profits. In perpetuity.

           INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Harry Sonneborn sits in Kroc’s office.

                        It’s outrageous!
           ON KROC-- angrily pacing.

                        Borderline extortion.

           We see Sonneborn is holding a document, a purchase proposal 
           from the brothers.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        And they want one other thing.

           ON KROC-- bracing for it.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
                        San Bernardino.

                        What do you mean?

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        They want to give the original 
                        restaurant to their longtime 
                        employees. As a gift.

                                 RAY KROC
                        A gift.

           Sonneborn shrugs. Apparently so.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        I need San Bernardino. I was 
                        counting on its profits to cover 
                        the debt on the loan.

                                 HARRY SONNEBORN
                        I spoke with their lawyers. They 
                        say it’s non-negotiable.

           ON KROC-- absorbing, nodding. 

           He violently SMASHES a paperweight on his desk.

           INT. LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Kroc and the brothers, flanked by their respective lawyers, 
           are gathered in a conference room. In front of everyone is a 
           copy of a CONTRACT.
                                 KROC’S LAWYER
                        My client has agreed to your 
                        conditions of sale, all of which 
                        are reflected in the contract 
                        before you, the sole exception 
                        being the one percent cut of future 
                        corporate earnings, which, upon the 
                        insistence of his investor group, 
                        will have to be carried out on a 
                        handshake basis.

           The McDonald brothers and their lawyers nod, seemingly 
           familiar with the condition.

                                 KROC’S LAWYER (CONT’D)
                        Very well, then.

           He reaches into his briefcase and takes out two fountain 
           pens. Slides them across the table to the brothers.

           CONFERENCE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Mac and Dick sit alone in the conference room as their 
           lawyers pack up. 

           ON MAC-- staring at a check for $1,350,000 in his hands. 

           ON DICK-- staring at a check for $1,350,000 in his hands.

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kroc is at the urinal in the law office’s rest room. He 
           flushes, heads over to the sink.

           The rest room door opens. In walks Mac. He freezes at the 
           sight of Kroc. Kroc smiles amiably.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Hello, Mac.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        I just have to ask you one thing.

                                 RAY KROC
                        What’s that?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Something I never understood.
                                 RAY KROC
                        Alright...

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        That day we met, when we gave you 
                        the tour.
                             (Kroc nods)
                        We showed you everything. The whole 
                        system, all our secrets. We were an 
                        open book.
                             (Kroc nods)
                        So why didn’t you just...

                                 RAY KROC
                        Rip you off? 
                             (Mac nods)
                        Take your ideas and start my own 
                        place?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Yes.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Because it would have failed.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        How do you know?

                                 RAY KROC
                        Am I the only one who ever got the 
                        kitchen tour?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        No.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I bet you invited countless people 
                        back there. Dozens of would-be 
                        burger barons looking to replicate 
                        your success.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        We did.

                                 RAY KROC
                        And how many of them succeeded?

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Lots of people started restaurants 
                        of their own.

                                 RAY KROC
                        Bigger than McDonald’s?
           Mac is silent.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Of course not. No one has, and no 
                        one ever will. Because they all 
                        lack that one thing that makes 
                        McDonald’s so special.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Which is...

                                 RAY KROC
                        See? Even you don’t know!

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        Enlighten me.

                                 RAY KROC
                        It’s not the system. 
                             (BEAT)
                        It’s the name.

           Mac is confused.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        That name, that glorious name... 
                        McDonald.
                             (BEAT)
                        It’s wide open. Limitless. It could 
                        be anything, anything you want it 
                        to be. It sounds like... America.

           ON MAC-- straining to understand.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        Compare that to, oh, say, Kroc. 
                        Now, there’s a real lemon. Kroc. 
                        What a crock, load of crock, crock 
                        of shit. Would you eat at a place 
                        called Kroc’s? It’s enough to make 
                        you lose your appetite, a blunt, 
                        Slavic thing like that. But 
                        McDonald’s, now that’s a name. A 
                        handsome, all-American name. That’s 
                        a winner’s name, the name of 
                        somebody who’s got the world by the 
                        tail. A man named McDonald is never 
                        going to get pushed around in life.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (sneer)
                        That’s clearly not the case.
                                 RAY KROC
                        So you don’t have a check for $1.35 
                        million in your pocket?

           This silences Mac.

                                 RAY KROC (CONT’D)
                        That’s the mistake your competitors 
                        made, all those would-be imitators. 
                        They all thought they could simply 
                        take your system, slap on some name 
                        like Hamburger Hamlet or Roscoe’s 
                        and presto--instant success. But 
                        not me. I wasn’t so arrogant. I 
                        knew there was no beating that name 
                        McDonald’s. And if you can’t beat 
                        ‘em...

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                             (small chuckle)
                        Join ‘em.

           Kroc gazes off, smiling nostalgically.

                                 RAY KROC
                        I’ll never forget the first time I 
                        saw it stretched across the front 
                        of your stand. It was love at first 
                        sight. From that moment, I knew I 
                        just had to have it. And now I do.

                                 MAC MCDONALD
                        You don’t “have” it.

           He flashes Mac an unnerving smile.

                                 RAY KROC
                        You sure about that?

           INT. MCDONALD’S - SAN BERNARDINO - DAY

           PAN DOWN from the McDonald’s sign to...

           Dick and Mac with Kroc’s lawyers, listening like they’re 
           being read their Miranda rights:
                                 LAWYER #1
                        As per the terms of your agreement,

                        ownership of this location, you no 
                        longer have the right to call it 
                        McDonald’s, McDonald or any other 
                        such variation which might create 
                        confusion or infringe upon the 
                        McDonald’s trademark which is now 
                        the exclusive intellectual property 
                        of Mr. Kroc.

           Workers DISMANTLING THE MCDONALD’S SIGN in San Bernardino. 

           The brothers watch helplessly as their name is removed.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           A NEW MARQUEE up in its place, with a new name: 

           THE BIG M

           Below this, it says, with a whiff of desperation: 

           “WE HAVE BEEN HERE 23 YEARS!”

           The sign is as close to a McDonald’s marquee as is legally 
           possible--but it’s not McDonald’s. It’s heartbreaking.

           PAN ACROSS THE STREET, where--

           ...a NEW MCDONALD’S is under construction. 

           A hard-hatted Kroc is on site, watching as the signature 
           arches go up.

                        of your 100th location here.

           Kroc thinks it over a beat.

                        Call my office. They’ll set it up.

                        Here’s my card.

           reporter looks at it.

                                 RAY KROC – FOUNDER

           Hold on the words for a long BEAT. Our final image.

           POSTSCRIPT:

           Ray Kroc’s San Bernardino McDonald’s was an instant hit, 
           drawing customers away from The Big M across the street, 
           forcing it to close. The McDonald brothers were driven out of 
           business by a McDonald’s.

           Kroc later reneged on the handshake deal for the 1 percent 
           cut of royalties. The McDonald brothers never received a 
           cent. Today, that 1 percent promised would be worth $200 
           million annually. Each.

           From the moment Kroc took ownership, his business card listed 
           his title as “Founder”. Until his death decades later, calls 
           to McDonald’s headquarters asking the origin of the name were 
           told it was made up.

           Kroc married Joan Smith in 1969. They remained together until 
           his death in 1984.

           In 1971, Mac died of diabetes-related illness. His brother 
           Dick passed away in 1998.

           Thanks to Harry Sonneborn’s idea, McDonald’s today is the 
           largest owner of real estate in the world.
