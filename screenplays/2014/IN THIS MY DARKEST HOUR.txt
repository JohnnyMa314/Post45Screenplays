           EXT. WALNUT TREE FARM - WEDDING - DUSK (FALL 1831)

           Her slender shape is gently outlined, backlit by the setting 
           sun. 

           The simple wedding is framed in the opaque green glow of an 
           early-fall walnut grove.

           The moment is inaudible but for the violinist who plays her 
           approach.  The emotion is electric, 20 guests.

           Her petite hands meet his.  Their smiles reveal a marriage of 
           love rather than convenience, her green eyes lower, his are 
           steadily focused.  She smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Later, lit by the orange glow of candles and lanterns, the 
           guests share wine in honor of the newlyweds.

           The affectionate bride and groom steal eager glances with one 
           another.

           Eventually they fall away into the dark grove of trees.  The 
           abundant fireflies give away their Eastern location.

           The groom’s face is clearly lit by the glow of the moon.  
           JEREMIAH EMANUEL BENNETT is good-looking, twenty-one with 
           dark hair.  He stands a foot taller than his bride, broad 
           shoulders and strong.

           The bride, EMMA ISABELLE BENNETT, is fair-skinned with full 
           red lips.  

           He lifts her and presses his lips against hers.  She 
           passionately accepts.

           Still in his arms-

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I love you, Jeremiah Emanuel 
                        Bennett.

           He manages to pull her in, even more tightly than before.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        And I love you Emma Isabelle 
                        Bennett.
           She laughs and he sets her down, they take off into the 
           darkness together.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SMALL HOME - CONTINUOUS

           He slides the white dress from her thin fair frame and lays 
           her in their bed.

           The fireplace emits its soft glow as Jeremiah takes his bride 
           for their first time. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SMALL HOME - 9 MONTHS LATER

           Emma struggles through child birth with Jeremiah by her side.  

           A bloody mess.  A new boy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AMERICAN PRAIRIE - 1 YEAR LATER 

           A team of wagons travels across the rolling golden fields of 
           the Midwest.

           Emma breast feeds her one year old child in the back of the 
           cart.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DUSK - 14 YEARS LATER (FALL 1846)

           The evening sky settles over a bloody, silent battlefield on 
           the California coast.

           Hundreds of soldiers lie dead.  

           The Mexican-American War.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        I often pray for such a resolute 
                        state as evil.  What peace I would 
                        have, to be what nature calls of me 
                        and to have no remorse for it.  

           Those in white with red cuffs fought for Mexico.  
           Those in powder blue uniforms with gold buttons down the 
           breast and stomach, a white cross-belt and a dark Blue hat 
           fought for the United States.

           Thirty American soldiers, one of whom is Emma Isabelle’s 
           groom Jeremiah, browse the massive battlefield searching for 
           living comrades.

           A few quick explosions of gunfire here and there to help a 
           suffering friend.

           Jeremiah comes to a man whose body is severed, yet he still 
           lives.  He cries, cringing and writhing.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        I am an animal after all and I am 
                        by no fault of my own, a solitary 
                        predator with no equal.  I have 
                        become what this world requires me 
                        to be and yet, this plague of 
                        remorse grows deep in my bowels.  

           The fallen soldiers hands are wrapped tightly around a pack 
           the others did not carry. 

           He begs Jeremiah for peace.  Jeremiah kneels at his side and 
           places his hand on his comrade’s.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        It has not subsided.  Instead, with 
                        each new day, it’s stronger yet.

           Jeremiah stands, driving the edge of his bayonet at the 
           soldiers throat. 

           He quickly delivers him from the painful turmoil.

           He slides the fallen soldier’s leather pack from his shoulder 
           and removes a heavy fabric parcel, unwrapping it.  

           The American flag.  Twenty-Seven stars, seven red horizontal 
           stripes and six white. 

           A small role of twine accompanies the patriotic symbol.

           He holds the folded flag into the air, signaling a few of his 
           surviving comrades. 

           Together they approach a nearby tree and lay down their 
           rifles.

           One officer climbs the twisted oak and ties the twine tight 
           around a low limb.  
           Jeremiah tosses the folded flag up to his comrade, who 
           attaches the fabric to the tree.

           The American flag hangs in victory.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA CALIFORNIA - DAY - WINTER 

           The American River cuts through the steel colored rocks of 
           the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.  Then, through the snowy 
           peaks of Tahoe with its thick pine forests.  It flows into 
           the foothills, then finally through Sacramento where it meets 
           the Sacramento River.

           Coloma is a lush and seasonal town on the bank of the 
           American River’s southern fork.  Thick with wildlife.  

           Endless flatlands to the south give way to hills that 
           eventually meet at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  

           At present, the winter has covered the land in white.

           Melting snow lends to the particularly high and rapid waters 
           of the season.  

           Two-Hundred feet from the bank of the South Fork of the 
           American River sits a small home.

           Quaint, a single window near the door glows with the warmth 
           of a fire, a chimney on the slanted roof billows smoke.  A 
           small sloped over-hang protects the entry from weather.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. QUAINT BENNETT HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jeremiah and Emma’s son, EMMET is 14 years old now.  Growing 
           to be a very similar in size and shape to his strapping 
           father, the same dark hair but with his mother’s glowing 
           green eyes.

           The two are silent and casual.  Emmet pokes at the fire, Emma 
           sits, reading.

           They are startled when Jeremiah enters unannounced. 

           Clean shaven, a new uniform, his rifle slung over his 
           shoulder.  

           He stands momentarily.  Motionless.  Unsure of what might 
           come next. 
           As soon as his mind catches up with his heart, Emmet explodes 
           to his feet and wraps his arms around his father.

           The corners of Emma’s mouth begins to tremble, her eyes well.  
           She pauses but only to recognize that it isn’t another dream.

           Jeremiah’s mouth pulls into a smile.  

           His longing wife quickly steps towards him, joining the 
           embrace, welcoming the final counterpart of what was 
           otherwise an incomplete and lonely home.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUTTER’S MILL - COLOMA CALIFORNIA DAY 

           A group of 12 men hammer, lift beams and tie joints in the 
           structure at the river’s edge. 

           They are building a saw mill, to be powered by the current of 
           the American river.

           Jeremiah is among the employees who labor.

           A flash illuminates from the river, capturing Jeremiah’s 
           interest.  

           He eyes the spot, watching the water flow over the shimmering 
           yellow metal.

           Gold.

           He hesitates, averting his eyes.  Did someone see what he had 
           found, what he’d been eyeing?

           They would kill each other for it.  A flake, let alone a rock 
           of that magnitude.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUTTER’S MILL - COLOMA CALIFORNIA - DUSK

           Finally alone, Jeremiah makes his way to the shore, still 
           very cautious of his surroundings.

           He wades into the water knee deep, he searches, stumbling.  
           Nothing.

           He picks up something the size and shape of what he found.  
           It’s a simple rock.
           He throws it in frustration then reaches back into the 
           freezing water of the river.

           He feels it, jagged and different.  His face changes, 
           knowing.

           He raises it above the surface of the water to confirm and 
           then immediately pushes the yellow metal into his pocket.

           Jeremiah sloshes back to the river bank, hand in pocket where 
           he tightly grasps his family’s future.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. QUAINT BENNETT HOME - NIGHT

           Jeremiah arrives all smiles.  A rarity.  He rushes into the 
           door and rightly locks it behind him.

           Emmet is at the table, his mother is over the brick fire 
           stove stirring the modest contents of a cast iron pot.

           Emmet stands to greet his father but Jeremiah objects 
           excitedly.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Sit, sit!

           His confused son takes his place back at the table.

           Emma wipes her hands on a cloth and places a disobedient 
           strand of hair back behind her ear, making her way to the 
           edge of the table.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What is it?

           Jeremiah's hand is still in his pocket.  He is coy.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        How much did I send you while I was 
                        away?

           Emma misses his point.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What do you mean?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        How much money?  How much money did 
                        I send?
                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Ten dollars a month.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Three less than my entire wage as a 
                        Sergeant.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Yes.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        And how much do I bring home while 
                        laboring for Sutter?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Eight.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        No.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        More.

           Emma is excited.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        They’ve increased your pay?

           Emmett smiles.

           The contents of the pot boil, Emma hurriedly returns to it, 
           stirring once more.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I certainly didn’t expect that of 
                        Marshall.  Did he finally tell...

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        It’s not that.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What is in your pocket.

           He removes his hand, his fingers wrapped tightly around the 
           nugget. 

           It’s the size of a large egg, jagged and textured.

           He sets it at the edge of the table.

           Emmett reaches for it, fondles it close to his face.
           Emma approaches once more.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Gold.

           She laughs.  Impossible.

           She sits on the table near her Son.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What do you think Emmett?

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        We’re rich!

           She laughs again.

           Jeremiah stands with his arms crossed, watching the 
           realization unfold.  Giving them time.

           Emmett eyes her husband, waiting for the joke’s end.

           Sincerity.

           She returns to the nugget, holds her palm outward and Emmett 
           places it there obligingly.

           She turns to her husband.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You believe this is gold?

           He nods.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Where did you...

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        In the river, near the mill.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No one else saw it?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        No.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA - MORNING

           The next morning, Jeremiah on horseback, rides towards the 
           quaint home.  
           He can’t ride fast enough.

           The pack on his back reveals his return from some market.

           The trail is lined with thick foliage and pines.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. QUAINT BENNETT HOME - MORNING

           Jeremiah enters.  He sets the pack on the table, removing its 
           contents.

           Soon the table is decorated with the ornate tools of a 
           banker; the scale, small weights, a chisel, modest tweezers 
           and a small mixing bowl.

           Jeremiah removes a vile of liquid from his pocket and sets in 
           front of him.

           Emma makes her way to their bedroom and removes a board from 
           the wood floor where she’s hidden the gold, now wrapped in a 
           white cloth.

           She returns, setting it on the table.  Emmett sits.

           Jeremiah cautiously chips a piece of the yellow metal from 
           the nugget.

           His wife and son look on.

           He balances a teetering scale, cautiously weighing 35 grams 
           of gold.

           He removes the stopper from the vile of liquid, pouring it 
           into the mixing bowl.

           He acknowledges inquisitive Emmett.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Aqua Fortis.  It will tell us how 
                        much of this metal is really gold.

           He places the same chunk into the mixing bowl that holds the 
           aqua fortis.

           There is no reaction.

           Jeremiah smiles.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Nothing is happening.
           He removes the metal, dabs it on the cloth to remove any 
           excess liquid and weighs it once more.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        This is pure gold.  23... maybe 
                        even 24 carats. 

           His toothy son’s smile widens.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        What’s it mean?

           He gently lifts the piece of metal from the scale, reflecting 
           it in the light.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        It means, that this little piece of 
                        metal is the same as two and a half 
                        month’s work at the mill. 

           It means what’s left of the rock on the table is worth 2 
           years.

           She thumbs the texture of the metal then sets it down.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        It belongs to Sutter.

           Jeremiah pauses.  She can’t be serious.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        He doesn’t own the river.

           Her eyes don’t move.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        He owns the mill.  He owns the 
                        land.

           She’s thought this through.

           Jeremiah pauses.  The moment is thick with resentment.  

           Emma’s eyes do not divert.

           Jeremiah’s fist plunges hard against the thick wooden table.

           The gold hops.  So does Emma.

           Jeremiah pauses before turning his attention towards Emmett.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Emmett.  You do not speak a word of 
                        this to anyone.  Not a soul.  Not a 
                        bird.

           He nods, averting his eyes with fear.

           Jeremiah approaches Emma, standing too close for comfort.

           He places a hand on her shoulder.

           His posture is threatening.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I am not a man who wishes for 
                        simplicity.  I am not a man who is 
                        content pounding metal and wood for 
                        scraps.  Do you understand?

           She nods.  He gets closer still.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I am not a man who abides a law 
                        that would favor an immigrant like 
                        Sutter to man who has fought for 
                        this country, be it “his land” or 
                        not.  

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I understand.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        This is the beginning of something 
                        better for us.

           She nods.  Her eyes meet his with trust.

           TITLE: IN THIS, MY DARKEST HOUR

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA - RIVER BANK - MORNING

           It’s snowing.

           The land is white.  The river breaks between the frozen land.

           His thick breath clouds as it leaves his mouth.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        Nearly a year passed before an 
                        Indian worker at the mill caught 
                        the same glimmer of gold in his eye 
                        as I did the Fall prior.  

           Jeremiah stands from the bank of the river, walks toward his 
           home.

           His boots sink into the snow.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        He wasn’t as smart about it, not 
                        knowing it’s value at the time.  
                        Course, Marshall took it for 
                        himself, rode that same day into 
                        Sutter’s fort out in Sacramento to 
                        show Sutter what they’d found at 
                        the mill.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA - RIVER BANK - SPRING 

           The sun breaks over the land.  

           The snow glimmers brightly in its demise.

           Water drips from the cold branches of a frozen tree.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        No one could keep it quiet long 
                        enough.  Soon the believers would 
                        begin to filter in from every 
                        direction.  I had a start on them.  

           The warming leads the rushing river to flow aggressively.

           A flat space at the bend of the American river.

           Water moves slowly here.  A pool.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        Moved north a few miles on the 
                        American river at a bend where the 
                        water slowed long enough for the 
                        gold to drop, catching in the 
                        rocks.  

           Jeremiah is wading in the water, panning, searching.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        There was no shortage.  It’s a 
                        miracle no one had seen it before.

           Jeremiah walks the same path back to his home.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BENNETT HOME - CONTINUOUS (SPRING 1848 - 1 YEAR LATER)

           A set of workers, 10 men, are finishing up the new home of 
           the Bennett’s.  

           It’s large.  Greater than anything on the West Coast to this 
           point.  

           It’s a beacon, screaming fast wealth in abundance.

           A white home, pillars, shutters on windows, a large porch 
           that wraps the circumference of the dwelling which is by no 
           means modest.

           It resembles a home one might have seen in Savannah Georgia.  
           An out-of-place plantation home high on a hill.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA RIVER BANK - MORNING

           Jeremiah is dressed in more illustrious attire.  Nothing 
           overdone but still, a man of wealth now.

           15 Native American’s are on the river bank with pans, 
           catching and straining water.  Searching for gold.

           Jeremiah walks with a man dressed similarly to him.  A man he 
           must pay well.

           A man with a gun guards them.  Several more guards on the 
           banks watch the employees.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Each man checks in and out.  I’ll 
                        pay them ten percent of what they 
                        find each day as well as 8 dollars 
                        a month.  I want them searched 
                        every night before they leave.  
                        Nothing is to be missed.  

           His captive audience of two will do anything he tells them.  
           His marshal and his foreman.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I know how much comes from this 
                        river in a day by my hand.  I’ll 
                        know how much should come by 
                        fifteen.  You understand?

           The foreman nods.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        This is my land.

           INT. BENNETT HOME - JEREMIAH’S STUDY - NIGHT

           The room is enormous.  Three times the size of the entire 
           humble home the family lived in the year prior.

           Dark wood flooring, dark red curtains made of expensive 
           fabric, couches, bookshelves and rugs. 

           Everything is lit with fire.  Candles, lanterns and 
           fireplaces.

           At the end of the rich rectangular executive office, a large 
           dark wood desk.

           Jeremiah sits, cautiously weighing the day’s gold.

           Ten times what he’d found that day a year before.

           He is unmoved.  Simply silent.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - LIVING SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           Emma, dressed comfortably in a clean peasant’s dress makes 
           her way across the living room.

           It glows in the light of a fire place framed by an ornate 
           mantel.

           It is every bit as illustrious as the study, decorated in the 
           same grand manor.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BENNETT HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           She is barefoot against the rich hardwood floors as she turns 
           into the long hallway of the home.  

           The ominous space is magnified by the 40 foot ceilings.

           There’s too much space.

           Her face is simple now.  No glow, no smile, but present.

           Moments pass before she finds herself at Emmett’s bedroom 
           door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - EMMETT’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Smaller than the living room but still too large for Emmett 
           alone.  

           Simple decorations. 

           A large window bares the blue light of a full moon helping 
           the small flickers of candles illuminate the room just enough 
           for Emmett to read. 

           She enters. 

           He pauses, glimpsing over the pages of his book to see his 
           mother.

           A simple smile between them.

           He moves aside making room on his bed.  She leans into his 
           shoulder taking comfort.

           He begins to read aloud.  This is common for them.

           It’s how she spends her nights.

           He reads aloud.

           The King James Bible, New Testament.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        I thank God, whom I serve from my 
                        forefathers with pure conscience, 
                        that without ceasing I have 
                        remembrance of thee in my prayers 
                        night and day;

                        greatly desiring to see thee, being 
                        mindful of thy tears, that I may be 
                        filled with joy; when I call to 
                        remembrance the unfeigned faith 
                        that is in thee, which dwelt first 
                        in thy grandmother Lois, and thy 
                        mother Eunice; and I am persuaded 
                        that in thee also.  Wherefore I put 
                        thee in remembrance, that thou stir 
                        up the gift of God, which is in 
                        thee by the putting on of my hands.  
                        For God hath not given us the 
                        spirit of fear; but of power, and 
                        of love, and of a sound mind.

           Emma’s eyes fall closed, sleeping.  Emmett notices but 
           continues.

                        us with a holy calling, not 
                        according to our works, but 
                        according to his own purpose and

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           A long way off the main road of the growing town of Coloma, 
           in a thick of pine, is a small home. 

           A hard home to find unless you’re looking for it.

           A porch wraps around the exterior.

           Chickens mill around in the dirt outside near the outhouse. 

           The sun glows brightly.

           A heavy-hearted laugh, the kind that forces you to join.  It 
           belongs to MAMMY JANE, that’s what she asks to be called.

           At the moment, she’s having trouble catching her breath, as 
           is Emma Bennett.  Something very funny is happening.
           Mammy is a black woman in her late 30’s.  Now she’s trying to 
           fan the tears that are welling in her eyes.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        And then he... and then he...

           Another burst of laughter, she can’t get the rest of the 
           story out.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my dear Lord, I need time...

           Emma is collecting herself too.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What did he say?

           Mammy sighs.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        He asked me, if bacon grease wasn’t 
                        supposed to be eaten the same as 
                        butter, why’d we keep it in the 
                        butter jars...

           She shakes her head.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Let me tell you, that boy never ate 
                        butter like any normal child.  

           She breaths.  Wipes the tears from her eyes.  More composed 
           now.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        He ate butter like it was iced 
                        cream.  And that day, he dipped in 
                        the bacon fat the same way without 
                        noticing...

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        That is disgusting.

           Mammy and Emma laugh together again.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You ever try plain bacon fat?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Then you don’t know how disgusting 
                        it really is.
           They laugh.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        After I told him the fat wasn’t for 
                        eatin’ like butter is, I caught him 
                        two more times the same way, eatin 
                        it like it was sugar!  Explains why 
                        that child got so fat though.  I 
                        always told his pa he’d not fit in 
                        his pants the next day after he’d 
                        buy em’.  He just grew and grew.

           She thinks for a moment.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        No... he got fatter and fatter.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Do you ever miss them?

           There isn’t a moment of hesitation.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Of course I do.  Every single day.

           Emma smiles.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Things were different for me though 
                        Emma.  I loved that family.  I 
                        loved that man and his sons like 
                        they were my own.  

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You came here together?

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Moved far for em’.  Would’ve moved 
                        farther then back again.

           A moment passes.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        But, they weren’t your own.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        In a way, no. But he didn’t have a 
                        wife  no more.  Those children 
                        didn’t have no mom...

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Did you ever...

           She smirks, digging for the dirt.  Mammy erupts dramatically.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        No! My no... With that fat old man? 
                        No.  No, no, no... never.

           A moment passes.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        But I wish... I do wish he would 
                        have stayed with me.  Longer.  
                        After he passed, the kids moved 
                        right out onto other things, in 
                        other places.  But I suppose they 
                        all do.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        But you have this.

           She gestures to the home.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I do.  Thank the lord, I have more 
                        than so many.

           They share a smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA - TOWN - DAY

           The town is busy in comparison to what it once was.  Smoke 
           billows from a black smith.

           There’s a post office, a mercantile, a church, a bank, a town 
           hall, a saloon, the saw mill, a sheriff's station and prison.

           More structures scatter here and there, all near the river to 
           grant access to the daily panning.

           Pup-tents pop up around the town, new small homes, new faces, 
           new horses.

           There is a large population of natives who join in the hunt 
           for gold freely.

           Men play the harmonica and banjo together.  A fiddle joins.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH - MORNING

           Jeremiah, Emma and Emmett sit together in the second pew.
           All in their Sunday best.  It’s a full house.

           The pastor is 21, structured, sincere and handsome.  PASTOR 
           JACOB FICHNER

           The congregation concludes in prayer.

                                 CONGRAGATION
                        Amen.

           They begin to file out.

           Emma turns to her son.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You staying here today?

           He nods.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        Yea, youth ministry.

           She kisses his head.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You be home by five o’ clock?

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        Yessir.

           Emma and Jeremiah turn to join the flow of the remaining 
           patrons moving towards the door.

           Emmett approaches the preacher, they exchange smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - ENTRY WAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jeremiah removes his jacket, hanging it on the coat rack at 
           the entry way.

           Emma follows suit and then proceeds to head to the left, 
           opposite Jeremiah’s study, assuming he intends to spend his 
           day there per usual.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Wait a minute...

           She’s only slightly startled by the sound of his voice... 
           ghost-like in her ears.

           She turns and smiles, hopeful.
                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Yes?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Well, you’re rushing off so fast.  
                        Thought we could spend time 
                        together today.

           She smiles.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I’d like that very much.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The golden sun still warms the large bedroom.  

           The husband and wife have become nearly strangers but they 
           hold each other naked beneath the covers this day.

           Emma clings to her husband.  Her head on his chest.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I miss you.

           He nuzzles her.  His chin against her head.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’m sorry Emma.  I love you.  

           She smiles.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I love you too Jeremiah.

           She laughs a little.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        It’s been sixteen years.  Since we 
                        were married.  I was thinking that 
                        the other day.  How sixteen years 
                        have passed.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        It feels like yesterday.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Does it?

           He grins.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        It does for me, yes.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I remember it very well... but it 
                        feels distant.  Old.

           He pulls her in closer.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’m still here.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I know.

           A moment passes.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Where do you go?  During the day?  
                        What do you do?

           She looks up at him from his chest.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What do you mean?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You know, while I’m gone.  Emmett’s 
                        always off at church or doing some 
                        odd thing with some new friend... 
                        what do you do, here?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Well I clean, I tend to dinner and 
                        chores.  That sort of thing.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        So you don’t leave?  You don’t go 
                        for walks?  Make... new friends?

           She’s seeing where he’s going.  She considers her answer very 
           heavily, almost long enough that he might notice, but just in 
           time-

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I don’t need friends.

           She smiles.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        So long as I get you, every month 
                        or so.

           They laugh.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’ll try to be here more often.  I 
                        can have other men see to some of 
                        the ins and outs.

           She wonders if that’s what she really wants.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You know how it can be for me.  I 
                        don’t trust these men to turn over 
                        their findings the way they should.

           She recalls a time when Jeremiah found gold in the river 
           while working for another man.  

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I know.

           For that moment, she hates her husband for his hypocrisy, but 
           it passes.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Still... you have no friends?  No 
                        one else to talk to? 

           He’s suspicious.  She lies.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           A box of a room.  Wooden.  A large table.  8 men gather.  
           Jeremiah, his marshal and his foreman.  5 others, all 
           business.

           Jeremiah addresses them.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        It’s simple.  I need land.  I need 
                        the right to the land.  Each man is 
                        allotted a portion of land and the 
                        law says, as long as they work that 
                        land it is theirs to mine.

                        So land is people.  Where do we 
                        find the people?
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        The natives.  We show them that we 
                        have all their tribe has to offer 
                        and then some.  They have access to 
                        luxuries they’ve never dreamed of.  
                        To buy those luxuries, they need 
                        gold and to get gold, they pan, 
                        they mine... for me.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #2
                        For us.

                        So what is it that you need, from

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I can take care of the employment 
                        and overseeing the work itself but 
                        I need capital.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #3
                        You, need capital?

           They laugh.

           Jeremiah is as wealthy as any of them.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I may be a successful man but I 
                        don’t have the materials I need to 
                        begin an undertaking of this size.  
                        I need an advance in pay for each 
                        employee for 6 months so that they 
                        keep returning, knowing that they 
                        will be rightly paid with or 
                        without the gold.  We make 
                        discovering gold secondary to their 
                        employment and they’ll be loyal.

                        And what else?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I need protection.  I need weapons.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #3

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I need materials.
                                 BUSINESSMAN #4
                        I think it’s easy enough to say 
                        that we can help you with whatever 
                        it is that you need.  The question 
                        is, what can you promise?  

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Gentlemen, there is no promise.  We 
                        are hunting for metal from the 
                        earth.  I can only tell you that 
                        I’m the best at it and that I have 
                        innovations underway that I believe 
                        will make us all very rich men.

           EXT. COLOMA - RIVER BANK - DAY

           Jeremiah has moved the river.  Diverted it entirely with a 
           damn, filtering water what was called a sluice.

           The bare river bed is exposed.

           40 men work the riverbed, digging while 20 armed men watch 
           over them.  Finally, Jeremiah, his foreman and marshal watch 
           over them all.

           Instead of pans, the men now use “rockers” and “long-toms” 
           which look like the cradle of a child but are used to sift 
           through rock and debris, separating larger gold fragments.

           They use axes to pick away at the river bed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BLACKSMITH - NIGHT

           Gold is heated, melted and poured into brick molds, then 
           stacked.

           It’s a beautiful process.  Glowing liquid gold, raging fire, 
           in the midst of the harsh black iron machinery of the 1848 
           blacksmith.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DARK ROOM - MORNING

           The room is black.

           A door opens, the entrance.  
           The light of the sun breaks in, revealing a man bound in a 
           chair, a bag on his head.

           Jeremiah, his foreman and marshal step in.

           They go about lighting candles as Jeremiah speaks.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        12 ounces of gold.

           More candles illuminate the room.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        12 ounces of gold, that belongs to 
                        me.

           Jeremiah removes the bag from the victim’s head. 

           He is gagged.

           A white man in his late 20’s.  Red hair and a beard.

           He struggles in fear.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, what is it that you 
                        expected when you tried to leave 
                        with gold from my river?

           Jeremiah paces in front of him, then addresses his foreman.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        His name?

           Foreman responds.

                                 FOREMAN 
                        Adam.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Irony.

           Jeremiah pauses, crouches in front of the bound man.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I admit, I find myself in a strange 
                        state, Adam.  I’m not angry.  I 
                        feel... disappointed.

           Jeremiah stands.  He clasps his hands, recognizing their 
           texture for himself.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I provide for you.  
           He continues to pace.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        The penance for theft as given us 
                        by God is the repayment of what you 
                        took plus one fifth.  You owe me 14 
                        and a half ounces of gold.  Do you 
                        have it for me?

           The thief lowers his head, turning it from left to right.  
           “No”. 

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        No.  No you wouldn’t would you.  
                        Spent it?  Squandered it on some 
                        prostitute.  Indulged in some sin.  
                        What else with excess but to 
                        indulge?

           Jeremiah signals his men.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I pay my men what I do, for a 
                        reason.  Excess is a dangerous 
                        thing.  Few can handle what it 
                        brings.

           Marshal and foreman remove Adam from his chair and force him 
           to his knees.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I provide what is necessary for 
                        survival, not comfort, never 
                        excess. 

           Adam is still on his knees. 

           He begins to plead through his gag as Jeremiah approaches a 
           whip that hangs on the wall. 

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You owe me 14 and a half gold 
                        ounces.  You don’t have it, I’ll 
                        remove it in flesh.

           He makes his way, squaring off with his victim.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Shall it be 15 lashes then?  For 
                        good measure.

           Adam struggles, groaning through the gag.
           The Marshal and foreman hook the rope binding the Adam’s 
           hands to a metal peg on the stone wall.

           Marshal cuts the man’s shirt from his body.

           He is hanging by his wrists, his back exposed.

           Marshal steps away.  

           He lashes out.  The whip cuts harshly across the thief’s back 
           as it cracks.

           The thief cries out through his gag.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)

           Lash.  He screams.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)

           Another.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I pay you fairly for your time.  I 
                        even offer you a percentage of the 
                        findings.  Harder work, longer 
                        hours may have earned you the same 
                        amount you stole from me. 

           Sweat roles from the man’s face.  

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Why steal from me?

           A lash.  Harder.

           Jeremiah is losing himself in aggression.

           Lashing out violently, his questions are rhetorical as they 
           become a demonstration of his deep-seeded volatility. 

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Am I not good to you?

           Another lash.  Even more effort behind this swing.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Is it not enough?

           The whip cracks.
           The candle nearest Adam flickers in draft from the displaced 
           air.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - KITCHEN

           Emma sweeps as Mammy Jane comes in the front door having 
           retrieved the plucked and decapitated body of a chicken.

           Emma quickly places the broom against the wall and rushes to 
           the stove.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You bring what I asked?

           Emma turns to the counter where a cloth grocery sack sits.  
           She removes some herbs, cooking oil, milk and flour. 

           Mammy smiles.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get to it.

           She sets a cast iron skillet on her fire stove then pours 
           cooking oil into it as it heats, she continues to prepare.

           Mammy grabs a mixing bowl and shows Emma mockingly.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        This a mixin’ bowl.

           Sarcastic.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I know what a mixing bowl is Jane.

           Ignoring her and going about her business, Mammy corrects-

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Mammy Jane.

           She begins by breaking two eggs into the bowl.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You’re going to cook the chicken in 
                        chicken eggs?

           Mammy looks at Emma like she’s lost her mind but then 
           realizes it is actually a little strange.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I guess so!
           Mammy orders Emma-

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Chop the parsley!

           She quickly abides.

           Mammy continues by adding milk to the eggs, beating it 
           vigorously.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Cookin’ it in cow’s milk too.

           Emma twists her face humorously.

           She takes a second bowl and scoops in the flour.  Then she 
           adds bread crumbs, Emma’s chopped parsley, some garlic, a 
           little salt and pepper.

           In the third bowl, she puts plain flour.

           She tears the chicken apart like a professional.  Limb from 
           limb.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Alright.

           Now she takes a leg.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        First you dip the chicken good in 
                        this plain flour. 

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Ok.

           Emma picks up a leg as well, waiting for Mammy to move to the 
           next station before she begins rolling her raw meat in the 
           white powder.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Then you dip it into this egg and 
                        milk.

           Emma is finishing up with the flour and moves to the egg and 
           milk mixture as mammy moves to the final bowl.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Then last, you get it real good in 
                        these bread crumbs and flour.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Ok.
           A moment passes as Emma finishes dipping her chicken leg into 
           the final bowl.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Now stand back.

           Mammy tosses her chicken leg into the hot frying pan.  It 
           sizzles and cracks wildly.

           Emma laughs and dodges the splattering oil.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Oh, my!

           She’s cautious, holing her chicken leg by two fingers, 
           extended as far from her body as she can.

           She drops her leg into the sizzling oil.

           They laugh together.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Turn it!  You gotta turn it before 
                        it burns!

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        How!

           She hands Emma a fork.

           Emma approaches the sizzling meat cautiously.  She flips one 
           piece successfully, then the next.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Good!  Good!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

           The friends share their accomplishment.  Fried chicken.

           Emma is drooling over it.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Oh my God.  This is so delicious.

           Emma is shoveling the food into her mouth, no concern for 
           etiquette between these two.

           Mammy smiles, too busy chewing to speak.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        MMHHMMM...

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No, it’s very good.  Very good.  
                        The best thing I’ve ever eaten.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You say you cook for your family?

           Emma nods regrettably.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I want so much for you to meet 
                        Jeremiah and Emmett.

           It’s awkward.  This conversation has happened before and 
           Mammy doesn’t want anything to do with it.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I told you, just can’t.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        They’re very different people from 
                        what you’ve seen in the south 
                        Mammy.  They’d like you and you 
                        them.  You have nothing to be 
                        afraid of.

           Mammy becomes stern.  Standing and taking her plate to the 
           kitchen counter.  Her back is turned on Emma.

           A dramatic performance.  

           She is very concerned by this conversation.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I’m not afraid of them Emma.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Then what?

           Mammy goes to a dark place in her heart... remembering 
           something cold and best left there.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Jeremiah could help you.  He knows 
                        everyone.  We could make sure you 
                        are kept safe.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Emma.  One person becomes two 
                        people, then two four and then four 
                        eight.  Soon enough the whole town 
                        will know where I live.  Who I am, 
                        and that I’m alone.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        But this is your land.  He bought 
                        it and left it to you.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Those aren’t the laws that the 
                        hearts of men follow around here.  
                        I’m doing just fine without anyone 
                        knowin’.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        But I want you to come to church 
                        with us, to come to my home, to see 
                        my family.  To know their faces 
                        when I speak about them.

           Mammy turns to face Emma once more, realizing that her heart 
           is in a good place.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I believe the world is changing.  I 
                        believe a time will come when those 
                        things are possible for women like 
                        you and me.  Maybe even possible 
                        for you and me.  But it ain’t time 
                        for that yet.  

           Emma nods.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You’re my best friend Mammy.  My 
                        only friend really.  I just wish I 
                        had more time with you... that we 
                        could see the same things day to 
                        day.  Go the same places sometimes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - LIVING SPACE - DUSK

           Jeremiah sits in front of a fire in the living space adjacent 
           to the entryway when Emma enters.

           She’s carrying the white sack from the market.
           Jeremiah is not supposed to be here.  He’s never here at this 
           time.

           He’s clearly disturbed.

           He raises a glass of whisky to his lips.

           Emma shudders and makes her way towards the kitchen.

           In obligation-

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Hello Jeremiah.  You’re home early.

           He stands and follows her into the kitchen.

           She sets the bag on the counter.

           He approaches from behind her.  Pinning her to the counter.

           Tension builds.

           He moves the hair away from the back of her neck and kisses 
           her there.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Where were you?

           She manages to turn and face him, but he’s still standing 
           very close to her.  So close that she can’t escape.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I came home for you.  But you 
                        weren’t here...

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I was at the store.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        The store?

           She turns again and removes items from the bag on the 
           counter, a display.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Yes.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        For how long?

           She pauses?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What are you doing?
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I saw Emmett in town.  On his way 
                        to his damned ministry... he said 
                        you’d left early this morning.

           She’s quick.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I forgot a few things and had to go 
                        back, Jeremiah.  

           He subsides.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Doesn’t explain why you smell like 
                        smoke and chicken.

           She laughs to herself.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I am having an affair with a 
                        smoking chicken.

           He laughs slightly, surprisingly.  There’s a good man in 
           there somewhere still.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Are you having an affair?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No Jeremiah.

           He approaches her.  His cold hand brushes the side of her 
           neck and then wraps around the back of it.  Either 
           affectionately or dominantly... maybe both.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Have you been with another man.

           She eyes him dead-on.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No.

           He kisses her.  

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I would understand if you had.  
                        I’ve been distant.  

           She nods.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I haven’t.
           He believes her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA - MAIN STREET - DAY (SPRING 1949 - 1 YEAR LATER)

           Coloma is chaos.  

           The town is swarming with miners.  Asian, African American, 
           Indians... immigrants of all types.  

           New stores, new business everywhere.

           Hustling, noise, conversations, bells, music, a cultural 
           melting pot.

           EXT. BENNETT HOME - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Jeremiah, Emmett and Emma sit for a sketch artist and a 
           journalist. 

           As the sketch artists nears completion, the journalist 
           impatiently stands.

                                 REPORTER
                        Well done!  Well done!  Beautiful 
                        family!  Now, if you don’t mind I’d 
                        love a word with Mr. Bennett?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Of course.

           She and Emmett step away.  

           Jeremiah and the reporter make their way in the opposite 
           direction.

                                 REPORTER
                        Quite the town here now.  How was 
                        it when you began?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Began looking for gold?

                                 REPORTER
                        Quite, yes.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Well, it was nearing the end of 
                        winter.  I couldn’t do much along 
                        the lines of panning in that 
                        weather but I sure tried.
           He laughs.  The reporter feigns interest, all the while, 
           taking notes.

                                 REPORTER
                        And where did you find your first 
                        piece of gold.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Well here of course.  Just a couple 
                        miles down the river in fact.

                                 REPORTER
                        Right, right.  This was while you 
                        were working for James Marshall, 
                        right?  During his construction of 
                        Sutter’s Mill?

           Jeremiah grins.  Cunning muckraker.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Not quite.  At the time, I had 
                        enough money saved having served as 
                        a sergeant in the army during the 
                        Mexican War and I didn’t think it 
                        right my family go without me as 
                        often as they had for the years 
                        prior... so I left work.  I suppose 
                        God favored the decision because 
                        shortly there after I found my 
                        first lump of gold.

                                 REPORTER
                        Right, right.  And Emma, how is she 
                        taking to the new found success?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        She’s perfectly made for it, I 
                        think.  It doesn’t affect her one 
                        way or the other.

                                 REPORTER
                        Rare.

                        Very.

                                 REPORTER
                        And your Son, Emmett?

           Now it feels a bit strange to Jeremiah.  This man knows the 
           names of his family members, where he worked when he 
           discovered gold... he’s suddenly less apt to share.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        He’s fine.  Quite fine.  Spends an 
                        amount of time in the church.

                                 REPORTER
                        Well done then. He’s sixteen now?

           Jeremiah shoots a curious look.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Seventeen.

                                 REPORTER
                        It wouldn’t be a stretch to say 
                        that you made this town what it is 
                        today... considering what it was 
                        before.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Not at all.  I staffed my business 
                        and built the things necessary for 
                        my employees to be happy here.  As 
                        my employees grew the town grew.  
                        Of course now, other people are as 
                        interested in providing comforts 
                        for their employees as I was 
                        then... so it’s all grown beyond me 
                        at this point.

                                 REPORTER
                        I’d say.  This is the Gold Rush 
                        good sir... everyone’s coming.

           Jeremiah stops.  He locks eyes with the reporter, dead on.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        It feels very much that way.

           Jeremiah begins to walk away from the reporter, back towards 
           his family.

           The reporter chases after him for one final question.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jeremiah and his sidekicks make their way into the streets of 
           the town.  Foreman is drunker than he should be, but Jeremiah 
           surpasses him.  Marshal, of course, is with them.

           It’s fun and light they’re friends.
           In the distance an argument.  Yelling between men, a gunshot.

           They run to the bank of the river near the scene of the 
           crime.

                                                                CUT TO:

           holding a pistol opposite him.

           Jeremiah approaches, hand on his hip.  Marshall has his rifle 
           drawn and Foreman his pistol, each on different targets.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Now, calm down.

                        findings.

           Jeremiah turns his attention to the white culprit.

                        in my life!

           Jeremiah turns to the African American Male.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Try to stay calm here.

                                 WHITE CULPRIT
                        He owes me money.

           The white culprit gives away his drunken nature.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        What for.

           The white culprit is not quick on his feet, or if he is, he’s 
           too drunk to remember to be.

           Jeremiah refers to the dead body on the ground.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Who shot this man?

                                 AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE
                        I did, sir.

           For one reason or another these two men are willing to follow 
           the lead of Jeremiah, the would-be-lawmaker.

           Maybe it’s his domineering presence, maybe his image precedes 
           him or maybe the two men flanking him are intimidating.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Now, why did you shoot this man?

                                 AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE
                        He pulled his gun on me, thought he 
                        was going to kill me for my gold.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Rightfully so, he probably would 
                        have.

           He turns to the drunken white culprit.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Now, you should lower your weapon.  
                        You have three...

           He draws his gun and aims it at the white culprit.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You have four weapons on you.

           Jeremiah realizes that Marshal is still aiming at the African 
           American man.  He gestures and Marshal takes aim on the 
           correct target.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You have four weapons on you and 
                        you’re carrying but one gun.  Now, 
                        if you lower your weapon, no harm 
                        will come to you tonight.  You can 
                        head home, wherever that may be and 
                        sober up.

           The white male lowers his weapon and slumps away.

           Jeremiah sets his sites back on the African American man, 
           considering his options.
                                 AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE
                        Thank you so much sir!  I can’t 
                        tell you how much I appreciate you 
                        obliging...

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You can show me.

           The African American’s face twists in confusion.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        What we just did here was provide a 
                        service.  See there’s no law around 
                        town, as you know and I’m happy to 
                        oblige if there’s a need.  However, 
                        such efforts have costs.  I, for 
                        example have a family to feed.

           Jeremiah could feed the entire town for the next 3 
           generations, but still-

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        If you appreciate our efforts here 
                        and if you would value our future 
                        efforts we accept one tenth of your 
                        daily findings which will be 
                        collected on the last day of each 
                        month.

           The African American male understands.

                                 AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE
                        That seems a rightful request.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I agree.

           Marshall and Foreman look to one another in awe.  

           In what dimension of thought, in what conniving corner of 
           Jeremiah’s mind did this genius spawn of an idea take birth?

           Jeremiah extends his hand, palm open, waiting for the African 
           American Male to take it.

           The African American Male is unsure, not used to such 
           civilized behavior.

           Slowly, their hands meet.  They shake.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        That’s it then.  We’re in business.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

           Jeremiah stands before his room of 100 employees.  On his 
           right, his marshal, on his left his foreman.

           He addresses the crowed.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Men, we are stuck hard.  As you 
                        know, there is no room for me to 
                        move my entire company of employees 
                        anywhere of value on this river.  
                        There are just too many people 
                        working claims and there’s nothing 
                        that can be done about it.  

           The audience stirs.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Now, as some of you may know, the 
                        treaty of Hildalgo secured this 
                        land rightfully to the United 
                        States and as such, it is not 
                        natural for it to exist in this 
                        lawless manner.  From this day 
                        forth, I will act as the law of 
                        this town and beyond.  I need fifty 
                        of my strongest men to stay on with 
                        me.  You will carry weapons, you 
                        will have horses - fed and watered, 
                        you will be taught the law and you 
                        will assist me in securing 
                        diplomacy.  I will pay each officer 
                        Ten dollars a month.  

           Seventy hands raise into the air.  Shortly after the final 
           Thirty hands follow.  The translation delay.

           Jeremiah turns to his marshal-

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Pick the ones who speak fluent 
                        English first, then the strongest, 
                        then the youngest.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - EMMETT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Emmett lays on his bed, his mother next to him.

           Her head on his shoulder.  He’s reading again.  Their 
           routine.
           Emma interrupts.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Do you find it odd?  All of this?

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        What do you mean?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        This house.  This life.  It 
                        feels... cold.  Unreal.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        I suppose.  But it’s only because 
                        they are material possessions.  All 
                        true value lies in God.  This too 
                        shall be dust.

           She pauses.  Looks to her son for guidance.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Do you truly believe that?  In your 
                        heart?  You believe it?

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        I do.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I wish I had your faith.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        Just ask it of him and it will be 
                        so, mother.  If you truly wish to 
                        believe.

           A pause.  She doesn’t feel the same way.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I can find our names in every paper 
                        I see.  It seems anytime they 
                        mention gold, there we are.  Us and 
                        Sutter.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        That bothers you?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        It’s strange how people can get to 
                        know you when you’ve never seen 
                        their face.  All because you’re 
                        wealthy.  How word starts to travel 
                        by your name.  Everything we do, we 
                        get noticed for it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        I suppose they might recognize 
                        you’re different by the look of 
                        your clothes or maybe how high you 
                        might carry your head.  Then maybe 
                        they recall hearing your name from 
                        some gossip or paper they read.  
                        Then it’s like you become some 
                        object of fascination for them.  
                        Somehow learning about all the 
                        details of your life becomes the 
                        whole town’s meaning.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        You think people recognize me from 
                        the paper?

           He’s a child for a moment.  Excited.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Of course.

           He smiles.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        That’s another funny thing, making 
                        it in the paper because you got 
                        wealthy.  Though, I imagine getting 
                        wealthy is all anyone’s here to do 
                        any more.  So our getting wealthy 
                        gives everyone else a  sense they 
                        may be able to do it too.  Guess if 
                        I had a paper I’d put that story in 
                        there, I guess it’s good news, 
                        better than most other news you 
                        read.  Or see, for that matter. 

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        It is.

           Silence.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Maybe I’ll start a paper.

           They laugh.  She could.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You see any girls around town that 
                        you’ve come to like?

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        No.

           Emma sits up.  She jousts, giggles with her son.
                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No?

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        No!

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        When I was your age I was married.  
                        Next year you’d be having a child.

           His eyes widen.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        Are you glad you did?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Of course.  For you, I could never 
                        regret any of it.  For you.

           He smiles.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        I love you ma’.

           She kisses his forehead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Emmett sits in the front pew of the church with the young 
           Pastor Jacob Fichner.

           Emmett eyes the floor, slouching in his seat.  His hand rests 
           beside him on the pew, holding his weight.  

           Jacob’s hand is next to Emmett’s.

           Jacob does not look away when Emmett raises his head, their 
           eyes meet.  Emmett is confused, a tear in his eye.

           Jacob moves his hand over Emmett’s.  It lingers.

           Emmett’s head falls into Jacob’s chest.  Jacob holds it there 
           comfortingly.  Lovingly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STRANGER’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Two bodies intertwined, passionately.
           They kiss and pull at one another.

           The sun paints light across the white sheets, their canvas.

           It’s Emma but it is not Jeremiah.

           His hands are gentle on her skin.  He values her.

           He’s a bigger man than her husband in height, in sheer size.  
           He envelopes her with his embrace.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HORSE DRAWN CART - EVENING

           Gold bricks stacked high, only partially covered by a large 
           cotton wrapping.  

           It is being transported, to be exchanged for cash, or to be 
           turned in to its rightful owner, whoever that might be.

           There are a thousand bricks, maybe two thousand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA OUTSKIRTS - GRAVEL ROAD - NIGHT

           A wagon travels down a gravel path towards Sacramento.

           It is not well guarded.  Two men flank the cart drawn by 2 
           horses.  One rider steers.

           They are sitting ducks as they enter a canyon.

           8 Men at the peak on either side ready their aim on the 
           caravan.  Bandits.

           Jeremiah approaches from behind.  10 men ride on either side, 
           guns loaded.

           The bandits unload a round.  The guards on either side of the 
           caravan are down immediately.  The horses spook, taking to a 
           sprint.

           Jeremiah’s men fire upwards at the bandits who role and dive.

           Jeremiah’s marshal is a bandit, as is his foreman.  They 
           stand and brush themselves off.

           A dramatic show of gun powder and actors.
           Jeremiah continues forward with his men.  They race through 
           the canyon after the fleeing caravan of gold which has been 
           reduced to a single driver.

           Eventually they catch up to the caravan, the horses slowed by 
           the weight of the gold they pull. 

           The driver halts, throwing his arms in the air.

           Jeremiah pulls his horse around the front of the carriage.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        We aren’t here to rob you, we just 
                        saved you.

                                 DRIVER
                        The other guards?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Down in the canyon, likely dead.  I 
                        assume you’re transporting a hefty 
                        amount of gold there.

           A ploy, he already knows everything, he even knows where it’s 
           going.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Assuming you’re transporting bricks 
                        of a troy pound?  Worth about 248 
                        each.  A well paid man makes 120 a 
                        year.  Mind telling me whose stupid 
                        enough to send for that amount of 
                        gold and guard it with only two 
                        armed men?  Or rather, who cares so 
                        little about your well-being to 
                        have you steer the cart?

                                 DRIVER
                        I’m taking it to Sutter’s fort.  To 
                        John Sutter.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’ll tell you what, we’ll accompany 
                        you the rest of the way, so long as 
                        you promise to gain us an audience 
                        with Sutter.

                                 DRIVER
                        I can’t imagine he’d deny you after 
                        keeping his property safe all these 
                        miles.

           INT. BENNETT HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Emma is alone in the master bedroom.

           She slides into bed.  Pulls the blankets to her shoulders.

           Loneliness devastates her.  

           She licks her finger tips and reaches for the final burning 
           candle on the bedside table.

           Then darkness.

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. NEW HELVETIA - SUTTER’S FORT - MORNING

           A large establishment sprawling over acres of flat land in 
           the Sacramento valley.  

           The walls 17 feet tall.  2 and a half feet thick.  White 
           adobe.

           A true fort.

           Surrounding the fort are acres upon acres of grapes and wheat 
           fields.

           Jeremiah and his men follow the horse drawn carriage of gold 
           into the main entry point.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUTTER’S FORT - CONTINUOUS

           Within the walls, trade posts, mercantile, post offices, 
           black smiths, candles makers.  Anything and everything that 
           could be bought or traded.

           The fort serves as the end of the California and Siskiyou 
           trails.  

           Travelers pay to take residence.  For long awaited sustenance 
           and rest.

           The main building is two stories tall.  Sutter’s office is 
           within.

           The driver parks the cart and men begin to immediately unload 
           and carry the bricks into the two story building.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SUTTER’S FORT - SUTTER’S RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

           JOHN SUTTER, 46 years old and heavy set.  Balding with grey 
           white hair, long sideburns that grow to his chin.  A large 
           mustache that naturally curls upward at the corner of his 
           mouth.  A thick white goatee.

           He sits behind a large desk, littered with documents.  
           There’s a small candelabra, with lit candles, though, the 
           windows are providing adequate light in the room.

           A magnifying glass on an adjustable stand.  A leather bound 
           journal.  Pens and ink.

           The driver addresses him.  Sets a bill of delivery on his 
           desk.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        Thank you Percible.

           His swiss accent reveals his immigrant roots, his kind nature 
           does the same.

                                 DRIVER
                        Mr. Sutter, may I introduce you to 
                        a man whose actions ensured the 
                        safe delivery of your gold?

           Sutter looks up from his work for the first time since the 
           two men entered the room.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        I hadn’t even noticed that there 
                        was a second person here.

           He stands to greet Jeremiah.  

                                 DRIVER
                        We were attacked by a group of 
                        bandits.  The guards you sent did 
                        not return with me.  Had it not 
                        been for Mr. Bennett, we would have 
                        been overtaken.  He asked only that 
                        I introduce you.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        Of course, of course.  John Sutter.

           Jeremiah extends a hand.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Jeremiah Bennett.
                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        Your name is very familiar.  Are 
                        you Jeremiah Bennett of Coloma.  
                        The successful gold entrepreneur I 
                        often read of?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        The same.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        I should have noticed from your 
                        pictures.  A hard face to forget.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        We have even more history than 
                        that.  I worked as a laborer for 
                        you under Marshal at the mill in 
                        46’.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        How strange the winding paths of 
                        life.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Ever so.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        So Jeremiah, how can I repay you? 

           Jeremiah avoids.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Have you found much success with 
                        the discovery?

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        No, no, no.  It’s not my business.  
                        The true gold in California is its 
                        crops and land for ranches.  The 
                        grapes and wheat in my fields.  The 
                        saw mill that you were building was 
                        to produce lumber for my flouring 
                        mill in Brighton.  Also for other 
                        buildings I intended to erect in 
                        Yerba Buena.  

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        The gold that was being delivered 
                        here?

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        The last of my stake on the banks 
                        of the American river.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT'D)
                        I shan’t seek to dredge anymore of 
                        earth’s soil in this race for 
                        wealth.  Not me.  But you, you’ve 
                        created quite the illustrious name 
                        for yourself.  Gathered riches by 
                        acting more quickly than most 
                        could.  Commendable.

           For a moment Jeremiah is inspired, remembering who he was 
           before the war.  Before the gold.  Recalling honor.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Commendable is a word too kindly 
                        chosen.  Opportunistic at best.  
                        But such is the nature of survival 
                        I suppose.

           Sutter lets out a chuckle.

           A pause.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        So kindly once more, might I ask 
                        what I can do for you to thank you 
                        for your assistance?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        A true business man.

           Jeremiah considers.  

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve noticed a severe necessity for 
                        structure in Coloma.  For law.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        Ah, local ordinances not holding 
                        their ground?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Of course not.  It is a lawless 
                        state with no presence from the 
                        United States army and none of the 
                        Mexican Government to enforce their 
                        standards.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        Not that they would have before.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Maybe so.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        So, how can I help?
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        To be honest I came here expecting 
                        that your investment in the gold 
                        rush was greater.  I imagined you’d 
                        have more stake in the land, more 
                        business to protect, more of a 
                        need.  I saw how minimally you 
                        guarded your gold while it was 
                        being transferred and figured I 
                        might serve you some benefit.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        You found an opportunity.  How 
                        convenient that your men happened 
                        to be available and armed during 
                        such a time of need.

           Sutter is no fool.

           Jeremiah recognizes his play has become all for naught.  

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I suppose it was simple luck.

           Jeremiah approaches Sutter.  Extends his hand in defeat.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I suppose I’ll take my leave.  It 
                        truly was a pleasure.

           Sutter’s grip is firm.  Stronger than the first time they 
           shook hands.  Jeremiah takes note.  Sutter is not being 
           played.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        We are business men.  I can’t let 
                        you walk away empty handed.  
                        Please, allow me to pay you for 
                        your efforts.

           Their hands still wrapped tightly.

           Jeremiah releases his grip.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        It was in this very room that Mr. 
                        Marshal came to me with the gold he 
                        had found that January over a year 
                        ago.

           A moment.
                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        It was nothing substantial.  
                        Minimal really.  I remember he 
                        arrived in such a bustle.  I knew 
                        that something was amiss as he had 
                        visited just a few days prior and 
                        it was raining heavily.  Certainly 
                        no condition for travel.

           Sutter is teaching a lesson, Jeremiah’s guilt is growing.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        He asked to speak to me in private, 
                        requesting that I lock that very 
                        door behind you.  Something I have 
                        never done before or since.  When 
                        he revealed the gold, we tested it 
                        forthright finding that it was in 
                        fact pure gold.  Mr. Marshal begged 
                        that we leave right away for 
                        Coloma.  It was late and raining 
                        and I took the news of the gold 
                        with less excitement than Marshal.  
                        All-the-while I realized what the 
                        discovery might mean for my 
                        business.  I imagined it negative, 
                        rightfully so.  Still, the next 
                        morning I went to meet Mr. Marshall 
                        in Coloma at the site of my mill.  
                        We sorted through the tail-race, 
                        which you may have had a hand in 
                        building.

           Jeremiah looks up from the ground where he’s become lost in 
           Sutter’s story.  He smiles with closed lips but only for a 
           moment.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        We found flakes, occasional 
                        nuggets.  I crafted a ring once we 
                        had found enough.  The employees of 
                        the mill would occasionally come to 
                        me with their days winnings.  

           Of course they had, Jeremiah thinks to himself.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        Soon I began to lose them though, 
                        one by one.  The promise of wealth 
                        from the river stole them all away.  
                        Then once the word of your success 
                        began to travel, there was no hope 
                        for me.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        I never met you at the mill, when I 
                        came after Marshal’s discovery.  
                        You had already left by that time, 
                        I recall now.

           Jeremiah is transfixed.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        I did see you once though.  Not in 
                        a news article but in life.  
                        Marshal knew your back.  It was 
                        around the time of the discovery.  
                        Marshal and I were surveying the 
                        surrounding land and we found you 
                        near the river.  You were crouched 
                        on the shore, washing gravel 
                        through a makeshift pan.  He told 
                        me you had disappeared the year 
                        prior. 

           The story has come to an end.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  An old man reminiscing.  
                        What would one generally request 
                        for services of this nature?

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Ten percent.

           Much too high.

                                 JOHN SUTTER
                        Then it’s ten percent.  

           Sutter turns to Percible the driver, who still stands at the 
           side of the room.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        Percible, please escort Jeremiah to 
                        the cart and leave him with ten 
                        percent.  

           He turns back to Jeremiah.

                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        Please take the horses and cart as 
                        a token of my personal gratitude as 
                        the ten percent is simply payment.

           Sutter turns his back and makes his way back to his desk.
                                 JOHN SUTTER (CONT’D)
                        Best luck to you and your struggle 
                        in Coloma.  You seem a fit man for 
                        the job.

           Jeremiah exits with Percible.

                        At that moment I felt the true 
                        burden of a thief for the first 
                        time.  A thief against a willing 
                        victim.  Even worse, two lives had 
                        been lost in Sutter’s guards.  In 
                        my game.  But the winding paths of 
                        life always come with a choice and 
                        Coloma still had a need for law.  
                        So I would be their law, for a 
                        price.

                        On October 18, 1850 a steam ship 
                        called Oregon docked in San 
                        Francisco with a banner proclaiming 
                        that California was now a State.  
                        That’s how most Californians came 
                        to know of their newfound 
                        statehood.

           That night, Jeremiah enters his study and approaches the 
           parcel and sealed letter on his desk.

           The grand room crafted of dark wood, framed by blood red 
           curtains, is more fitting for him now than it’s ever been.

           His presence has become domineering and carnal but his pace 
           has become unsure and cautious.

           He lights the candles at his desk then sits.

           He opens the letter first.

           He reads.

                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT (V.O.)
                        Mr. Bennett, your success on the 
                        banks of the American river truly 
                        magnify the dreams of the common 
                        man during the gold rush.  Your 
                        story has fed the fires of hope in 
                        the bellies of thousands who flock 
                        to this west land.  I have followed 
                        the details of your endeavors as 
                        closely as word and news will 
                        allow.  I can only say that your 
                        entrepreneurial spirit is admirable 
                        and I would be honored to welcome 
                        you and your wife this November as 
                        we celebrate the statehood of our 
                        land, California.  
           He shuffles to the next card of information which includes 
           the details for a grand ball.  To be held at the State 
           Capital in San Jose.

           Jeremiah unravels the parcel that was delivered with the 
           note.  

           An American Flag, 31 stars.  Most recently, one was added for 
           California.

           EXT. BENNETT HOME - MORNING

           Jeremiah removes the previous flag from its post and replaces 
           it with the new flag bearing 31 stars.  Delivering the news 
           of California’s statehood before the press did.

           He remembers the flag he hung over the battlefield during his 
           final battle in the Mexican American war.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Emma sits in an armchair, leaning over it admiring Mammy who 
           sits on floral love seat opposite her.  

           The room is quaint.  A bit overly decorated.  Light shines 
           through the windows illuminating Mammy Jane’s knitting.

           She weaves the yarn between two sticks, creating some pattern 
           of fabric.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You know how to do so many things 
                        Mammy.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Learnin’ is easy enough I suppose.

           Her focus doesn’t waiver from her art.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Why do you suppose you took the 
                        time to learn these things when I 
                        never did.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Need, I guess.  I had a family to 
                        tend to.  Chores to complete.
                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I have a family to tend to.

           Mammy lowers her yarn and pins.  Sets them on the side table 
           and decides to have this conversation with her friend.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You and your family never want for 
                        anything Emma Bennett.  You ain’t 
                        got no need to learn how to knit a 
                        blanket.  

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        It didn’t used to be that way.  

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        How’d you make it through when it 
                        wasn’t.

           A long pause, she’s trying to remember who she was, why who 
           she is now might feel so distant from that same woman a few 
           years ago.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I was a stronger woman then.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I believe you’re a strong woman 
                        now.

           Emma smiles, truly grateful for the compliment from Mammy.

           Mammy returns it, sincerely.

           Emma takes a moment before she approaches the delicate 
           subject again.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Mammy.  The world is changing.  
                        There are free blacks all over 
                        these parts.  Men who been released 
                        of their services.  You know 
                        California is Union now.  You have 
                        nothing to fear anymore.  Come into

           Just enough light in the kitchen from the setting sun. 
           Emma has prepared herself for the undertaking of fried 
           chicken... alone.

           There are bowls, floury messes, utensils here and there.  
           More than she needs.

           She begins by heating the grease.

           She takes a deep breath.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jeremiah enters through the front door on the porch.

           He smells the frying chicken and enters the kitchen.

           Emma doesn’t notice him.  Her back is turned as she faces the 
           fire stove.

           She dances around splattering grease.  It’s a mess, but she’s 
           getting the job done.

           Jeremiah approaches from behind, wrapping his hands around 
           her arms, one on each.

           Emma is startled at first, but recognizes her husbands touch 
           quickly after.  He’s being gentle.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        What’s this?

           He asks playfully.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Fried chicken.

           He releases her.

           She turns over her shoulder and smiles, then goes back to her 
           business.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Wash up, dinner will be done in 
                        minutes.

           Jeremiah doesn’t move.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’d rather watch.

           She pauses, awkwardly, then continues.
           The chicken is dipped in the 3 assortments of liquids and 
           powders and then dropped into the sizzling hot grease.

           The grease is intimidating in this moment, rather than 
           playful as it was with Mammy.

           Jeremiah begins to recognize the glint of a memory.  He 
           pauses a moment... realizing he’s caught something.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You’ve never cooked fried chicken 
                        before.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Well, I wanted to try.  Figured 
                        there’s no harm in learning some 
                        new things.

           How will he sort this out?  He knows more.

           Mulling.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Where’d you learn it?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        A woman in the market gave it to 
                        me, I asked her for it.

           Emma recognizes that this fire could grow into something she 
           can’t control.

           She doesn’t remove her eyes from her task.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Did this woman write it down for 
                        you?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        She told me.  It’s easy enough, I 
                        have it by memory now.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Right.

           This isn’t over.  

           The grease cracks.

           A pause.  He approaches her and turns her face towards his.  
           Her chin in his fingers.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Stop lying to me.
           Her eyes lower.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           She turns with haste, back towards the oven.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        But I need to focus on this or the 
                        chicken’s gonna’ burn.

           She flips the chicken.

           Jeremiah grabs her by the arm and pulls her away from the 
           stove, forcing her backward against the opposite wall. 

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You tell me the truth Emma.  Where 
                        have you been spending your days?

           She pushes out from under his grip and walks into the living 
           room.

           Her temper rises.

           He follows her into the living room.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you run from me Emma!

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I’m just trying to do you a 
                        kindness!  I’m trying to cook you a 
                        meal!  Do the task of a simple 
                        wife!

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Don’t turn this on me.  You came 
                        home a while back from bein’ out 
                        somewhere.  You told me you had 
                        been to the store for a second time 
                        that day but you smelled like smoke 
                        and chicken.  You smelled like that 
                        fried chicken.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You’ve lost your mind entirely.

           He approaches her, grabs her by the arm again and throws her 
           onto the couch.

           She lets a yelp of pain slip from her throat, she’d rather 
           have not.  
           He bends at the waist, finger in her face.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You better tell me right now, where 
                        you’ve been.  Where you were that 
                        day.  What you’ve been hiding.

           She stands to leave again but he grabs her by the arm and 
           throws her back onto the couch.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Tell me!

           She repeats the attempt to leave but this time he backhands 
           her hard across the face once he’s sat her back on the couch.

           He’s never hit her before.

           It affects them both.  She holds her face for a moment.

           He turns away.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You know I could have you followed.  
                        It would be that simple.  To know 
                        where you go.  But I trust you.  
                        I’m a loyal man for you and I give 
                        you my faith.

           It’s the truth.

           This actually does effect her.

           He turns to face her.  The anger has not subsided, in fact it 
           has grown stronger as he’s just reminded himself that he has 
           a right to it.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You are my wife.  So help me God, 
                        you obey me and answer me what I’m 
                        asking you.

           She stands and flattens the apron on her waist.

           Calmly, she makes her way down the hallway towards their 
           bedroom.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - HALLWAY

           He lets her make it halfway down the hall before pursuing 
           her.
           She gets to the door, enters their room.

           He sprints a few steps to try to block her from closing the 
           door, but she’s fast enough.

           She struggles with the key in the lock.  

           He’s forcing with all of his weight trying to enter.

           He wins.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She stumbles backwards and lands on the floor.

           He’s enraged.  He straddles her body, reaching down, he takes 
           hold of her collar by both hands.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Enough of this!  Tell me!

           She begins to cry.

           He shakes her.  Her collar rips.

           Her cries become louder.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Please stop!

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Tell me!

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Please, stop Jeremiah!

           He draws back and hits her heavy across the face.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Tell me now!

           She is wrecked, inconsolable, afraid.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Tell me!  

           He grabs her by the arms and lifts her, throwing her against 
           the wall.

           The wind leaves her body, she tries to recover.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Does he like the chicken?  You 
                        thought I might too?  Is that where 
                        you were that day?

           She shakes her head no.  Then screams it.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No!

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Are you some southern man’s whore 
                        Emma?

           She cries.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You’re my wife!

           He slams her against the wall again.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You’re my wife!

           She’s shielding her face from continuous slaps now.

           Then finally she screams.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I’ll tell you!

           He backs away.

           Her clothes are torn.  Her face is read and wet from tears.  
           Her arms will bear bruises.

           He recognizes that he’s gone too far.

           But then his face changes again, if she’s about to admit what 
           he’s assumed, it’s merited.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        A friend...

           She pauses.  He’s more sure now that she’s cheating than 
           ever.  Until-

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        A black woman.  She’s a friend.

           Emma gains some strength as she sacrifices her friend for her 
           true affair.

           She throws her arm out towards the kitchen.
                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        She taught me how to cook this!

           He reaches for her but she slaps his hand away.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        She’s an older woman!

           He reaches for her again.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        No!

           She slaps his hand away again.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        She lives alone.  She didn’t want 
                        anyone to know.  She’s afraid.  
                        She’s afraid of you, afraid of the 
                        town.  Afraid of a hanging!

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I didn’t know...

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        She watched her brother hang!

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’m sorry.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        She watched them burn him!  So I 
                        didn’t tell you!  I was respecting 
                        her.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I didn’t know.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        She’s my friend...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Emma and Jeremiah sit at opposite ends of the table in an 
           awkward silence, eating the fried chicken Emma had prepared.

           Her eyes are vacant and cold.

           She tries to eat the fried chicken with a knife and fork.  
           A far cry from the mannerless free-for-all she’d had with 
           Mammy.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Emmett spends too much time at 
                        church.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - DAY

           Jeremiah, on horseback, is a distance from Mammy’s house but 
           he can see her as she sweeps her porch.

           He’s verifying his wife’s confession.

           He loiters longer than he should, watching, wondering if Emma 
           is there now.

           He makes his exit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STRANGER’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Emma scoots out from beneath the covers of her lover’s bed.

           She pulls her slip back over her bare chest and stands, 
           getting dressed.

           Her arms are bruised.

           Her lover watches. He seems like a good enough man.  

                                 EMMA’S LOVER
                        Who did this?

           He’s simple.  Attractive.

           He may even love her.

           She smiles nervously.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        It’s nothing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAN JOSE, CA - GOVERNOR’S BALL - NIGHT (NOVEMBER 1850)

           It’s an extravagant affair, in a luxurious hotel.
           Thousands of candles light the space.

           Men are black tie, women in gowns.

           A few familiar faces.  

           John Sutter of Sutter’s fort.  

           The business men from Jeremiah’s meeting to request financing 
           to expand his plans for gold retrieval.

           Political banter, boisterous laughs and moderate debates.

           Everyone enjoying libations.

           Sixty men and women in total.

           The women’s gowns are a series of pale blues, yellows and 
           whites.  A few greens.

           Emma enters at the side of her husband Jeremiah.  

           She is truly ravishing.  She wears a blood red gown which 
           perfectly accentuates her pale skin. 

           Her lips, thick and red.  Her eyes glow again, green.

           Jeremiah is handsome, clean shaven.  

           He seems young and proud to be seen with his wife.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You truly are the most stunning 
                        woman, I’ve ever laid eyes on.

           She blushes.  He hasn’t complimented her since he wooed her 
           19 years ago.

           Peter Burnett enters, at the balcony atop the stairs.  

           A man at his side clanks a silver spoon against his glass, 
           gathering attention.

           He introduces-

                                 CLANKING MAN
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Governor 
                        Peter Burnett.

           Mr. Burnett thanks his man for the introduction with a nod.  
           He approaches the railing of the balcony.
                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT
                        First, thank you all for joining us 
                        tonight.  I am happy to have a 
                        crowd of such exemplary citizens 
                        both men and women.  As you all 
                        well know, the land of California 
                        has been a wild one to tame.  We 
                        have fought hard and true for this 
                        place and now we have it outright, 
                        for that, we celebrate.

           He raises his glass.

           Men and women clink their glasses in applaud.

                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT (CONT’D)
                        In the infantile days of our 
                        statehood it is most important that 
                        we lay strong foundations of social 
                        expectation, of law and of 
                        discipline.  The discovery of gold 
                        has brought so much good to this 
                        land.  Our population has been born 
                        of an explosion rather than simple 
                        and steady.  We reap many benefits 
                        for that.  Business is booming.  
                        Wouldn’t you say?

           Clanking glasses.

                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT (CONT’D)
                        Certainly no miner has any interest 
                        in giving their land of gold back 
                        to Mexico and for that, we are 
                        given an army of civilians to 
                        protect our sensitive state in its 
                        beginning days.  But there are many 
                        detriments which are born of the 
                        same booming growth in population, 
                        especially due to the foreigners 
                        and blacks who freely enter and 
                        rape the land of its resources.  
                        Resources that belong to the 
                        American people who fought to take 
                        this land for themselves. 

           Emma looks to her husband, takes his hand.  She feels dizzy.

           He takes it as affection.

           She tries to hold aware and is successful.
                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT (CONT’D)
                        Land that was otherwise dormant and 
                        untapped.  The compromise promises 
                        us our statehood.  But there are 
                        more pressing issues that I hope to 
                        undertake as your Governor.  Many 
                        of social decline.  Lawlessness.  

           Sutter sees Jeremiah.  They exchange a glance.

           Sutter notices that he, himself, might be delivering a glare 
           of something more hateful than he’d wished, so he smiles and 
           returns his attention to the Governor, who has continued.

                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT (CONT’D)
                        We must be cautious about the 
                        freedoms we allot to those who do 
                        not pay a due for it.  Those who 
                        have not fought for it.  Those who 
                        have not lost for it.  We must be 
                        cautious of those who have no 
                        loyalty born of the United States, 
                        but intend to take from it.  We 
                        have certainly the right to prevent 
                        any class of population from 
                        settling in our State, that we may 
                        deem injurious to our society.  

           Emma looks to her husband and cringes a little.  She doesn’t 
           like this man, but she’s also still quite light headed.

                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT (CONT’D)
                        For some years past I have given 
                        this subject of slavery my most 
                        serious and candid attention and I 
                        most cheerfully lay before you the 
                        result of my own reflections. There 
                        is, in my opinion, but one of two 
                        consistent courses to take in 
                        reference to this class of 
                        population; either to admit blacks 
                        to the full and free enjoyment of 
                        all the privileges guaranteed by 
                        the Constitution to others, or 
                        exclude them from the State. If we 
                        permit them to settle in our State, 
                        under existing circumstances, we 
                        consign them, by our own 
                        institutions, and the usages of our 
                        own society, to a subordinate and 
                        degraded position, which is in 
                        itself but a species of slavery.

                                 GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT (CONT’D)
                        They would be placed in a situation 
                        where they would have no efficient 
                        motives for moral or intellectual 
                        improvement, but must remain in our 
                        midst, sensible of their 
                        degradation, unhappy themselves, 
                        enemies to the institutions and the 
                        society whose usages have placed 
                        them there, and for ever fit 
                        teachers in all the schools of 
                        ignorance, vice, and idleness.

           Glasses clank wildly.  Cheers.

           Emma moves her hand from her husband’s hand to his shoulder.

           She’s loosing balance.

           Her eyes shutter.

           She’s down.  Out cold.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           Sighs of concern and a cluster of action and noise as people 
           rush to gather around her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARRIAGE - DAY

           Jeremiah and Emma ride home together.

           Emma stares out the window of the carriage.

           They are mid conversation.  He is frustrated, she is distant.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Did you have to do it in the middle 
                        of the Governor’s speech?  For 
                        God’s sake, I didn’t even have the 
                        opportunity to discuss politics 
                        with him, to introduce myself.

           Sarcastically.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I planned it that way.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I would think you had.

           A moment passes.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Really though, what were you 
                        thinking?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I wasn’t thinking anything.  I felt 
                        ill.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        And now?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Now, I feel fine.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        A blatant lack of concern for me 
                        then.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Not at all Jeremiah.  I began 
                        feeling dizzy as he started 
                        speaking.  Blame the man’s rambling 
                        on if you must blame anything at 
                        all.

           She sets her gazes outward again.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You could have at least applauded 
                        him when the time permitted.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I have no interest in applauding a 
                        man that I so clearly disagree 
                        with.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Emma, there are certain ways of 
                        behaving in civil society.  You 
                        were invited as my guest and I was 
                        a guest of his.  In order to not 
                        cause me discomfort you should have 
                        behaved as though you agreed even 
                        if you hadn’t.  Even more so, you 
                        certainly should not have fainted.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Well then I am regretful.  May I 
                        take some silence, I’m beginning to 
                        fell the same dizziness that was 
                        brought on by Mr. Burnett’s 
                        rambling.

           Gutsy.
           Jeremiah accommodates.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA - RIVER BANK - DAY

           Jeremiah and his 3 “law men” approach a tent where an Asian 
           man has staked claim.  He pans nearby.

           Jeremiah dismounts and begins to speak to the Asian, who can 
           converse, but minimally.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You haven’t paid your taxes this 
                        month.

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        Yes, paid, to that man.

           He points to one of Jeremiah’s thugs.

           Jeremiah turns to his thug.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Did he pay you?

           Thug says no.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        He says you didn’t pay.

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        I did!  I did pay!

           He throws his arms up.

                                 ASIAN MAN (CONT’D)
                        I always pay!

           Jeremiah begins to intimidate.  Pointing his finger into the 
           Asian man’s chest.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You keep calm.

           Jeremiah refers to his thug.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        My boy here says you didn’t pay, 
                        that means you didn’t pay.

           The Asian man is noticeably disheartened.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Now, we provide a service here.  We 
                        protect this town and its people.  
                        But...

           He steps in closer, nudging the Asian man back a bit-

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        ...if you don’t pay your keep, we 
                        won’t protect you.  You just don’t 
                        know what might happen then.  Who 
                        might come looking for you.  Who 
                        might come to take all your 
                        findings.  You understand?

           He pushes one final time.  The Asian man stumbles backwards.

           Defeated, the Asian man goes into his tent and removes a 
           small metal box where he stores his minimal gold findings.

           A sad moment.  He is barely scraping by.

           He dumps what’s left into Jeremiah’s palm.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        That’s ten percent?

           The Asian man clarifies.

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        That’s everything.

           Jeremiah looks at his clan members who grin and laugh.  
           Jeremiah follows suit.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        From now on it’s twenty percent.

           Jeremiah drops the gold into a small bag and puts it into his 
           vest.

           He returns to his horses saddle, they ride off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM (2 MONTHS LATER)

           Emma is 5 months pregnant.  A clear bump.

           They laugh together.
                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I fell flat on the floor.  The 
                        whole room watching.

           Mammy laughs at her.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You’re a mess.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        There was so much money in that 
                        room.  So many fancy women.  Fancy 
                        men.  The Governor of California.  
                        Sutter.  Of course, my husband, 
                        trying to impress them all at once 
                        and I go down like a rock.

           She laughs through the story.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        It’ll be worth your pride I 
                        imagine.  Havin’ a new little one.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Of course.  Hell, the look on 
                        Jeremiah’s face when I woke up 
                        might have been enough.  

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I can imagine.  Poor man.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Poor man?  I’m the one who fainted.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        That’s your own doin’.  You don’t 
                        take care of yourself.  Course’ 
                        you’re tired.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I just have trouble sleeping.

                        That and you eat like a bird.  
                        You’re skin and bones besides that.

           Mammy refers to Emma’s baby-bump.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t healthy.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I just don’t have the appetite 
                        Mammy.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Well, you’re eatin’ for two now, I 
                        suppose you aware?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Yes.

           She holds her belly.

           A moment.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        It’ll be a girl.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Really!

           She hopes.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’d love that.  I’d love that 
                        very much.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        So’d I.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Why not... one of your own?  There 
                        are plenty of suitors in town now.  
                        Plenty of men.

           Mammy is a bit embarrassed.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I don’t know.  I feel like my time 
                        for that life may have passed.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Even for love?  Something simple?  
                        Easy?

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Ain’t nothin’ simple or easy about 
                        love.

           Mammy approaches, something she hasn’t asked before.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        He treat you ok?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Who Jeremiah?

           Mammy nods.
           Emma lets it sit too long for it to be the truth.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Yes.  He treats me just fine.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You know if you ever need anything 
                        from me Emma.  You come and ask it.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Thank you.  Thank you, I know that.  
                        It’s nice to hear you say it 
                        though.  The same to you of course.

           Mammy smiles.  It’s a little awkward for her.  They’ve grown 
           closer than either had expected them to.

           Mammy stands and Emma meets her.

           Emma reaches in for a hug and holds Mammy.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        There is something...

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Yes?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        When this baby comes...

           Emma releases Mammy so that she can see her face.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know him.  Or her.  I 
                        want you to know my child.

           Mammy forces a nervous smile but nods.  An agreement.

           Emma is cutting vegetables for the evening dinner.

           Jeremiah enters, tosses the newspaper onto the island.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Peter Burnett resigned as Governor.  
                        Spittin’ coward couldn’t stand in 
                        the face of some opposition to his 
                        views.  Says he was “forced out” 
                        because of his “unpopular beliefs”.

                        beliefs from where I stand.

           Emma smiles to herself.  Times are changing.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        That’s a shame.

           But it’s not.

           Mammy steps into the streets of the town.  In public.  Into 
           the light of the streets.

           It’s the first time in years.

           She is in awe.  Frightened of strangers who pass too closely.

           Gun-shy.

           She begins to notice the other African Americans.

           She sees Asians. 

           She makes her way to the busy market, perusing the displays.

           She feels safer than she thought she might.

           INT. BENNETT HOME - MASTER BEDROOM (MAY 1851)

           The darkly lit bedroom hums with silence.

           Then, the sounds of birth.  Emma’s effort, her cries. 

           A doctor is delivering her child in the home.

           Jeremiah paces.

           Emma is in pain.

           The doctor reveals the bloody mess.  It’s a girl.  

           He passes her off to a nurse who immediately begins to wash 
           the child.

           Emma is dizzy.  Panting.
           Her chest swells as she catches her breath, sweating heavily.

           The corners of her mouth lift into a smile.

           She lets her head fall into the pillow.

           The room spins.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Emma’s child cries and coughs.  Emma bounces her.  Walks her 
           into the living room.

           A nurse waits there on the couch.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        She won’t take milk.  It’s been 
                        days.

           The nurse offers to take the girl.  Emma holds her.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m sorry Mrs. Bennett.  All we can 
                        do is try.

           The infant coughs, then cries.  Emma makes her way to a 
           nursery near the back side of the house.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NURSERY - MORNING

           The door is slightly ajar.  Jeremiah enters.

           His wife is sleeping, the child in her arms still.  

           His daughter’s breath is broken with rasp.

           Jeremiah runs the back of his finger across his small girl’s 
           forehead.
           A smile escapes him, though, it is short lived.

           He stands for a moment, admiring his wife.  

           Suddenly feeling intrusive, he makes his silent exit.

           Jeremiah is clean.  Dressed in casual attire, but well-kept 
           today.

           He is on foot and alone.  Two rarities.

           The morning sun is barely creeping over the Eastern horizon.

           He makes his way to the steps of the small church.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jeremiah enters the sacred white building.

           Pews frame the isle, leading to the pulpit. 

           A large crucified statue of Jesus hangs there.

           Jeremiah slowly makes his way to the front of the room.

           He eyes the cross.

           Jesus.

           He steps to the right and backs into his seat, not removing 
           his eyes from the statue at the center front of the room.

           He clasps his hands between his legs.

           His chin shudders, he looks to the floor, holding back tears.

           Then with strength, he returns his gaze to the cross.

           His attempt at prayer.

           Emma bounces her crying baby, trying to appease her.
           The nurse comes in, suggesting that Emma has a visitor.

           Emma is a bit confused, not expecting anyone.

           The nurse invites her in, before the door can fully reveal 
           her friend, Emma realizes who it is.  

           Her mouth curls downwards, the tears well.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Mammy Jane...

           Tears break.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Now hun, don’t cry.

           Emma laughs a little as she wipes the tears from her cheeks.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You’re here!

                        That I am.  That I am.

           Mammy comes closer.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        It’s so good to see you.

           Still fighting tears, she pulls Mammy in and holds her next 
           to her daughter, who is still having trouble breathing 
           through congestion.

           Mammy frowns a bit.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I come to meet this child.  

           A smile.  A wide smile.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        This beautiful baby girl.

           She stretches out her arms, asking to hold her.

           Emma gladly hands her over, Mammy holds her in tight against 
           her chest.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t I tell you she’s a girl?

           The girl has calmed, resting, nearly sleeping.
           Emma nods and smiles.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        What’s her name.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Jane.  

           Mammy is lost in the comfort of holding the child.  Her eyes 
           don’t leave the girl’s round face.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Yes?

           Her eyes come back to Emma.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Jane.  Her name.  Jane Emma 
                        Bennett.

           It gets Mammy Jane to the core.  She trembles.  She can’t 
           fight the tears.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Oh!  Oh my!

           She laughs.

           Emma nods.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Jane.  Oh Jane.  Such a beautiful 
                        girl.

           Mammy closes her eyes as tears role down her cheeks.

           Jane begins to cough, waking herself.  Her sore throat hurts.  
           She cries, only perpetuating the pain.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Now, now.

           Mammy bounces her.

           Emma sits in the rocking chair.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Now, now.

           Emma closes her eyes, she’s so tired.

           Mammy rocks Jane, who continues coughing, continues crying.

           Mammy begins to sing.  
           A slow, beautifully haunting hymn.

           Her voice is thick and melodic.  Peaceful and soothing.  She 
           swells with love, Baby Jane can feel it.

           Emma can feel it.

           Her soothing voice quiets them both.

           She continues after the crying has ceased, after Emma has 
           fallen to sleep.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A pastor blesses the coffin.

           They lower the small box into the ground.

           Emma brings her palm over her face as she breaks.

           Emmett reaches for his mother’s hand and holds it.

           Jeremiah is stoic and distant.  As upset as Emma, but not 
           capable of the same release.

                        climate and character of California 
                        is peculiarly suited.”

           He tosses the paper aside.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        A perfectly suited plague is what 
                        he meant to say.  

           Emma smiles, trying to abide.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Explains why he’s not the Governor 
                        anymore.

           Emmett spoons stew into his mouth.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Emmett, you considered settling 
                        down?  You’re at the ripe age now.

           His father isn’t threatening, just trying to make small talk.

           Emmett nods, trying to finish his last bite which was an 
           attempt at avoiding his father’s last attempt at 
           conversation.  

           He knows now that shoveling another bite before answering his 
           question might give away his trick.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        I’ve actually... well, I’ve 
                        actually been considering joining 
                        the priesthood.
                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        The priesthood!

           Emmett nods, shoveling another bite into his mouth.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        How’re we supposed to have grand 
                        children?

           Emmett’s eyes widen, he shrugs his shoulders, mouth full.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna’ have to do the work of 
                        finding you a wife myself...

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Let’s not push it Jeremiah.

           Jeremiah lets out a guttural, disapproving noise.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - JEREMIAH’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Jeremiah enters his already candle-lit study.

           He locks his door behind him, turning the knob to ensure it 
           is secure.

           He goes from window to window, drawing each curtain closed 
           until he has complete privacy.

           He approaches his desk, removes the burning candles and sets 
           them aside on a bookshelf.

           Then he pulls his desk away from the wall, 10 feet.

           He roles the rug away, revealing a hatch door.

           He opens it, descending a staircase, 10 feet deep into what 
           could have been a wine cellar.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT - BENNETT HOME - GOLD CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           He goes from pilar to pilar, lighting candles which are 
           secured by sconces.

           Soon the room is lit enough to recognize just how much gold 
           this man has hoarded. 
           Bricks upon bricks stacked against the surrounding walls.

           Gold on every side.  Aisles of it.

           The flickering orange light is magnified.

           He inhales, taking comfort in his security.

           Closes his eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - JEREMIAH’S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeremiah ascends the staircase into his study, bearing four 
           bars of gold.

           He sets them down, closes the hatch, covers it with the rug 
           and replaces the desk.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SALOON - NIGHT

           Jeremiah plays cards with his friends, drinking.

           A particularly beautiful woman eyes him from the corner of 
           the saloon.

           He reciprocates glances over his hand of cards.

           His foreman notices his glances and turns to see the object 
           of Jeremiah’s affection.

           The foreman looks back at Jeremiah and grins, shaking his 
           head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STRANGER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (JANUARY 1853)

           Emma and her lover kiss passionately in candlelight.

           They lay beside each other, the man strokes her hair.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COLOMA - MARKET - DAY

           Emma is in the market.  
           There are very few women in town.  One for every twenty men 
           at most.  But the ones who are in town know Emma’s face well.

           These two women are young, Emmett’s age.  One blonde and one 
           red-head.  The blonde is a little heavier but only slightly.  

           Both are pretty enough but, at this moment she can’t blame 
           Emmett for not having found a suitable wife.

           She’s used to women staring, but in this particular situation 
           the women are gossiping about her from across the market.

           Emma’s pride shifts.  A slight.

           What could they be saying about her?  DO they know something?

           Emma tries to ignore them, but as she continues looking for 
           some specific item, the importance of which is now lost on 
           her, she can’t help but notice.

           That’s enough.

           All at once Emma storms up to them.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Judging by your talking about me 
                        since I walked in, I imagine you 
                        know who I am.  So please, do share 
                        with me, the insight you might have 
                        on my life.

           They back away, faces dead serious.  

                                 RED-HEAD GIRL
                        We don’t know anything.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Let’s just be honest with it.  I’d 
                        prefer to know what sorts of things 
                        go around about me.

                                 RED-HEAD GIRL
                        Honestly, it’s not about you.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Oh, come on now.  It must be 
                        something worth your time.  I mean, 
                        there’s a lot to say about my life, 
                        I’m sure.  As we’re on the matter, 
                        I’m sure that whatever it is that I 
                        do in my day to day life is as 
                        exciting as what happens in your 
                        life each day over and over again.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        I’m sure whatever it is, is more 
                        entertaining than the actual truth.

                                 BLONDE GIRL
                        Miss, we were just admiring you.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Admiring me.  I’m certain that’s 
                        the blessed truth.  Look at you 
                        with your cheap excuse for 
                        clothing, imitating what you’ll 
                        never have.  

           Emma thumbs the cheap material of the red-head’s dress.

           Intimidating her.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Painting your faces to hide your 
                        flaws.  There’s no hiding your 
                        size, cow.

           She gestures to the heavier of the two girls.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Blowhards.  Reading about me, 
                        talking about me.  Hell, maybe you 
                        were even admiring me.  Bone up.  

           She looks them up and down one last time.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Go find yourselves lives 
                        interesting enough to distract you 
                        enough that you avoid the talk of 
                        mine.

           The girls are embarrassed.  The public display has gained the 
           attention of the other bystanders in the market.

                                 BLONDE GIRL
                        We know who you are, of course and 
                        we’d never seen you in person 
                        before, that’s all.  We were just 
                        happy to see you in person.

           She’s a better liar than her friend.

           Emma is taken back.  A little flattered, a little angry with 
           herself for reacting the way she had.  

           She lowers her eyes as the girls make their exit without 
           looking back.
           Before she can fully recover another stranger, a woman, 
           closer to her own age approaches her.

                                 FEMALE STRANGER
                        I’m sorry, I couldn’t help but 
                        overhear.  They weren’t talking 
                        about you...

           Emma is all ears.

                                 FEMALE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        They were talking about your son. 

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        My son?  What about my son?

                                 FEMALE STRANGER
                        About the time he spends with the 
                        preacher.  People are thinking it a 
                        bit odd is all.  A bit, Betty.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        A bit Betty.  People ought to focus 
                        on their own business.

           The stranger smiles malevolently.

                                 FEMALE STRANGER
                        I thought you wanted to know.

           The stranger takes her exit.

           INT. BENNETT HOME - NIGHT

           The family eats together in silence.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Mammy stirs a pot of soup.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I need to ask you about something, 
                        I need you to keep it between you 
                        and I.

           Mammy turns over her shoulder, delivering a sarcastic glare.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Now who am I gonna’ tell?

           She wipes her hands on her apron. Then approaches the table 
           and sits across from Emma.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        There have been some rumors going 
                        around about Emmett.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Alright.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        He’s twenty years old now and 
                        people are beginning to question 
                        some things about him.

           Mammy laughs.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Alright.

           Emma corrects herself.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I’ve been questioning things about 
                        him.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        What sorts of things have you been 
                        questioning.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Well, he spends a lot of time with 
                        the pastor boy, Jacob.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I ain’t never heard no mother 
                        worried about a son who’s spending 
                        too much time in church before.

           She smiles.

           Emma realizes this.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I think it’s more.  I just, think 
                        maybe... the time he’s spending 
                        with Jacob, it might stop him from 
                        finding a wife.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You’re worried that he doesn’t want 
                        a wife at all.

           Mammy Jane knows.

           Emma nods, she takes Emma’s hand.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Now, let me tell you something 
                        Emma.  It don’t matter what people 
                        in town want to question.

           She looks her dead in the eyes.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        It don’t matter what you want to 
                        question either.

           Emma isn’t amused.

           Mammy repeats a bit more boisterously.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        It, don’t matter!

           Emma forces a laugh.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll say, whatever your boy wants 
                        to do with his life, whoever he 
                        wants to spend all his time with, 
                        that’s all his questioning to do.  
                        You see?

           Emma quickly changes the subject.  Reaching into the front 
           pocket of her dress, she removes a necklace that she brought 
           for Mammy.

           A gold pendant hangs from a thin gold chain.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I bought this for you.  

           Emma extends the necklace.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Well, put it on.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Emma, you know I’m not one for 
                        jewelry or shiny things.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        You don’t like it?

           Mammy catches on to her attempt.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        You want to hear what I have to say 
                        about your boy or not...

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I suppose I do.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        If spendin’ every last second of 
                        his time in that church, with that 
                        boy, or with that boy outside of 
                        that church, makes Emmett smile,  
                        it ain’t hurtin’ nobody.  Findin’ 
                        somethin’ in life that makes you 
                        smile is a hard thing to do now- 
                        days and let me help you to 
                        understand that there are many, 
                        many people, very near by and very 
                        far away who would tell you that 
                        it’s not right for you to be 
                        spendin’ your time with me.  

           Emma understands this.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t like that at all.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I wouldn’t either.

           Emma regroups.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        It’s just, I think it’s different.  
                        Maybe you don’t see what I’m trying 
                        to say...

           Mammy stops her.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I’m not finished.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Alright.
                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Now, love... for a friend, love in 
                        any way is a very hard thing to 
                        find.  When it’s valuable to you, 
                        the kind of love you want from the 
                        time you’re a child, you hold onto 
                        it, no matter what someone is 
                        questionin’ about it.  Now, I know 
                        this cause’ I know what I’ve been 
                        missin’ my whole life.  You see?

           Emma’s eyes grow apologetic.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        I know just what you’re askin’ me 
                        about your boy, I do.  You know 
                        I’ve hidden in this house for years 
                        and years, afraid to go into town, 
                        afraid of that same questionin’.  
                        Afraid that, that questionin’ might 
                        lead to somethin’ hateful happenin’ 
                        to me.

           Emma squeezes Mammy’s hand as Mammy’s eyes well.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        But if it hadn’t been for your 
                        visits, this life wouldn’t have 
                        been worth livin’ at all.  So now, 
                        I say, bring on the questionin’.  
                        Bring the hateful to me, bring the 
                        evil to me and I will persevere.  
                        That’s what people who do things 
                        that are worth questionin’ are 
                        meant to do.  Perservere.   

           Emma nods.

                                 MAMMY JANE (CONT’D)
                        Now, the last thing I’ll tell you 
                        is, if your boy is gonna’ be livin’ 
                        a life worth questionin’, then he 
                        better be prepared to confront it.  
                        To confront the hateful and the 
                        evil, or to hide from it.

           Their hands are still grasped tightly.

           The moment means everything to Mammy, who feels that she’s 
           broken through to Emma, but then Emma releases her hand.

           She moves back to the necklace.
                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Here, let me put this on you...

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I don’t want that on.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Why not?  It’s a gift.

           Mammy stands, realizing that she might not have gotten 
           through.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Did you hear one thing I just said?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Of course.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I suppose you might still feel 
                        differently?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I suppose I must.

           Mammy Holds back anger, revealing her humanity and 
           fallibility.

           Then she delivers a verbal blow to Emma.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Ain’t no matter what people think 
                        of you and I.  Ain’t no matter what 
                        people think of your son and his 
                        friend.  There ain’t no disagreeing 
                        about that.  You either agree with 
                        both those facts, or neither.  You 
                        be careful about yourself Emma, of 
                        how you think of this thing with 
                        your boy.  You walkin’ a thin line 
                        of being the same type of hypocrite 
                        you hate in your husband.  

           Emma’s face moves from shocked to sour.  

           She storms out, leaving the necklace on the table behind her.

           The door slams.

           Mammy Jane steps toward the window and watches Emma untie her 
           horse in a heated rush.

           Emma throws herself onto the beast’s back and looks at the 
           window where Mammy stands.
           The slighted friends make eye contact but only for a second 
           before Mammy pridefully turns away and goes back to her soup 
           on the stove.

           Emma takes a moment before she takes her leave.

           She kicks her horse into a gallop.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SIERRA FOOTHILLS - CONTINUOUS

           Several acres of flat nestled among the rising hills of the 
           Sierra Nevada’s.

           A group of men work on building a massive machine.

           Near them, wooden structures are being built.  A dam.

           Flakes of snow have began to fall, it’s still mid day.

           The engineer greets Jeremiah as he arrives on horseback.

                                 ENGINEER
                        Mr. Bennett.

           Jeremiah hops off his saddle and extends his hand.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Pleasure.

           The engineer begins by showing him the wooden water conduits 
           that lead towards where the dam is being built.

                                 ENGINEER
                        This is where the water will be 
                        diverted.  It will build into this 
                        damn and provide the water for the 
                        machine.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Simple enough.

           The engineer laughs to himself.  Not an easy feat.

           He leads Jeremiah to the machine.  It’s a monstrosity.

                                 ENGINEER
                        This is the next generation of gold 
                        mining.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        No one else has it?
                                 ENGINEER
                        Not in California.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        How’s it work?

                                 ENGINEER
                        We filter the water into the dam, 
                        then pump the water through the 
                        hydraulic system.  It creates a 
                        powerful stream of water that 
                        releases through the canvas hose.  
                        We use this high pressure water to 
                        break away the rock and sediment to 
                        dislodge the valuable metals.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        How powerful?

                                 ENGINEER
                        It’ll clear the hillside right 
                        quick.  Shoot a stream of water 
                        some, 400 feet into the sky.

           Jeremiah smiles.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Let’s get it working then, this 
                        snow ain’t gonna’ be the last of 
                        it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - DINING ROOM

           The usual silence, but they are still seated near one 
           another.

           Ham, corn, peas and bread roles.

           Jeremiah takes a bread role.  Eats.

           There’s something electric.  It looms.

           Emma feels it.  Her eyes flicker from Emmett to Jeremiah.

           Jeremiah hasn’t spoken to them at all that day, not entirely 
           unusual, but tonight, it’s out of purpose and not accident.

           He finishes swallowing a cut of ham.
           He waits until Jeremiah is finished swallowing a bite, 
           between cutting and shoveling the next into his mouth, 
           Jeremiah catches him

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        These rumors true?

           Emmett tries to get the next mouth of food in, but Jeremiah 
           reaches out, weighing Emmett’s hand down with the weight of 
           his own.

           Emmett can’t help but make eye contact.

           A mistake if lying were ever the play.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Are the rumors true?

           Emmett looks to his mother, wondering if she might help him 
           out of this inquiry.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        What rumors?

           Emma steps in.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        There were two girls, at the 
                        market... they were talking to one 
                        another.

           Emmett is silent.  His eyes lower.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        It’s no matter.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        The hell if it isn’t.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        People are suggesting that you’ve 
                        been spending too much time with 
                        Jacob.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Is it true, what they’re saying 
                        about you two?

           Emmett is silent.  He looks directly to his mother, ignoring 
           his father entirely.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        Do you believe them?
                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        No, of course not, it’s just that 
                        you’re...

           Jeremiah cuts her off.  He’s growing aggressive.  His 
           question is going unanswered.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Are the rumors true?

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Jeremiah, maybe we shouldn’t 
                        push...

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’m asking my son a question.

           Silence.

           He doesn’t have her relationship with their son and he’s 
           doing a terrible job of trying for it.

           Then suddenly the entire table shakes under the force of his 
           fist.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Enough with the God damned secrets 
                        in this house!

           Emmett stands and leaves the table.  Never one for 
           confrontation.

           Jeremiah lets him leave, then continues eating his food.  A 
           failed attempt.

           Emma glances at him over her dinner plate.

           They make eye contact and Jeremiah is sure to hold his 
           ground, not looking away as he shovels the next mouthful in.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Well, at least you handled that 
                        with grace.

           Emma excuses herself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SALOON - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jeremiah has abandoned his home for the later hours of the 
           evening.  Drinking and gambling with the usual cohorts.
           His foreman watches him, noticing that he seems particularly 
           distant tonight.

           The same beautiful prostitute is in her regular corner 
           tonight.

           She makes eyes at Jeremiah, per usual.

           Tonight he pays less attention to her.

           Eventually she’s had enough of the game and makes her way to 
           the table.

                                 BEAUTIFUL PROSTITUE
                        Hello boys.

           The table of men all say their hellos.  Simple fast grunts 
           and acknowledgments.

           She makes her way to Jeremiah, who doesn’t look away from his 
           cards.

           The foreman watches Jeremiah closely, knowing there’s 
           something off about him tonight.  He could do anything.

           The beautiful prostitute runs her hand around Jeremiah’s 
           chest, up his shoulder until she’s standing behind him.

           She moves like a cat, on purpose.

           She bends to his ear.

                                 BEAUTIFUL PROSTITUE (CONT’D)
                        Something the matter tonight?

           He doesn’t respond.

                                 BEAUTIFUL PROSTITUE (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you come talk to me about 
                        it sweetie?

           He’s silent for a moment.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’m in the middle of a game here.

           She stands.

                                 BEAUTIFUL PROSTITUE
                        Of course.  Whenever you’d like 
                        hun’.  You know where to find me.

           She slinks away.
           The round ends, the dealer collects the cards and distributes 
           winnings.

           The foreman, in the chair next to him, close enough to speak 
           privately.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Why don’t you go with her?

           Jeremiah is confused by the question.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’m a married man.

           Foreman is dead serious.

                                 FOREMAN
                        What’s that got to do with 
                        anything?

           Jeremiah looks at his friend.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I can’t do that to my wife.  The 
                        thought of it detests me.

           The foreman considers for a second, how should he deliver the 
           blow.

                                 FOREMAN
                        My friend, she does it to you.

           Jeremiah is enraged.

           He snaps, he’s up out of his chair, hand around his friend’s 
           neck and has him against the wall in moments.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You’d better be out with it or 
                        there’s gonna’ be real trouble.

           The saloon only half notices the scuffle.  The dealer pauses 
           but only because he’s not certain whether to deal the foreman 
           and Jeremiah.

           A few others watch because they’ve never seen these two 
           friends in any kind of altercation with one another.

           The foreman raises his hands in surrender.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Don’t make a scene friend.  This is 
                        a private matter and those that 
                        don’t already know ought not hear.
           Jeremiah lowers his offense, releases the foreman.

           Cautiously, the foreman turns his back from the saloon, to 
           finish what he was saying.

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        She has a man, who she goes to.

           Jeremiah is hurt.

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        A year now, maybe more.

           Jeremiah isn’t sure how to handle himself.  His hands move 
           from his waist to his face, then back to his waist.

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t know...

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Of course I didn’t know.

           Jeremiah punches the wall hard.

                                 FOREMAN
                        I’m sorry to have been the one to 
                        tell you, friend.

           The foreman puts his hand on Jeremiah’s shoulder.

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SALOON - LATER

           Jeremiah takes shot after shot of a dark alcohol.

           His foreman signals the prostitue and gestures to his 
           severely drunk friend, who he feels, needs the type of 
           attention that she can provide.

           Jeremiah is drunk enough to stumble when the beautiful 
           prostitue comes for him.

           This time he puts up no resistance.

           She takes him by the hand.

           Jeremiah exchanges a look with his foreman, who nods his 
           head.
           She pulls him up from his seat and they move upstairs.

           He demonstrates how inebriated he is on the way.  Step after 
           step.

           She takes him to a door and unlocks it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SALOON - PRIVATE BEDROOM

           They enter and she closes it behind them.

           She’s on him quickly.  Kissing his neck, unbuttoning his 
           shirt.

           She moves downward but he pulls her back to his feet.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Am I an evil man?

           She looks into his sad eyes.

                                 BEAUTIFUL PROSTITUE
                        Evil is the way of the world honey.  
                        We survive.

           She moves back in, kissing his neck, she tries to kiss his 
           mouth but he turns away.

           She continues until he pushes her off.

                                 BEAUTIFUL PROSTITUE (CONT’D)
                        I thought this is what you wanted.

           He’s drunk, trapped between wanting so many things.

           There’s a moment.  She waits for him to move, to leave.

           He doesn’t.

           She’s back on him.

           His breath quickens.  His sadness becomes frustration, then 
           anger and then hate.

           He throws her away from him.

           She falls onto the bed bewildered.

           He escapes through the door they came in through.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SALOON - CONTINUOUS

           Jeremiah races down the stairs, stumbling.  He catches 
           himself between falls.

           He makes it to the exit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COLOMA - MAINSTREET - CONTINUOUS

           Snow is falling, adding to the compiled snow from the 
           previous days. 

           Jeremiah races through the streets of the town.  

           He’s furious, vengeful, wasted.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - BEDROOM

           Moonlight breaks through Mammy’s frosted bedroom window, 
           illuminating her as she sleeps.

           The sound of breaking glass stirs her to her feet quickly.

           She stands, rustling through her belongings, looking for her 
           gun.

           She hasn’t needed it in fifteen years.

           The blue light of the moon is not her friend, casting his 
           shadow away from her.

           His silhouette stands in her bedroom doorway.  Jeremiah.

           His gun is aimed at Mammy.  He cocks it.

           The noise brings Mammy to her feet.  Her back is turned to 
           him.

           Mammy is wearing the necklace Emma gave her.

           She raises her arms in surrender. 

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Please.  I’ll give you anything you 
                        want, just please...

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Turn around.
           She turns, slowly.  His face doesn’t add or subtract any 
           value to her.  She’s never seen him in her life.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Did you know?

           She’s bewildered, shaking scared.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Know what?

           He snaps.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Don’t play dumb to me!

           Her head lowers.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t play dumb...

           He’s so drunk.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Did you know that she was with that 
                        man?  That whore.  Did you know 
                        that she was a whore?

           Mammy is fighting tears, thinking this person stark raving 
           mad.  He is, but not in the way she thinks him.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        Mister, I don’t know who you are.

           Jeremiah smiles.  Realizing-

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        I’m sorry, I have never had the 
                        opportunity to introduce myself.  
                        I’m Jeremiah Bennett, Emma’s 
                        husband.

           Mammy pauses, calmer for a moment, she takes the time to make 
           out his features.

           Mammy is betrayed.  Emma told her secret.  

           She’s sad again, so sad that she lowers her hands helplessly.  
           Defeated.

           She sits on her bed.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        She told you about me?
           She takes the golden pendant hanging from her necklace 
           between her thumb and index finger, holding it.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        You ain’t heard of the compromise?

           Mammy nods.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Nigger, this has been a free state 
                        for three years.

           The word cuts her more than it should for a woman of her 
           time.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Instead you... run around in secret 
                        with my wife.  Makin’ her keep 
                        secrets from me.  Makin’ it 
                        comfortable for her to keep a 
                        secret!

           He has a point, but it’s lost in his drunken rage.

           Mammy looks to him, their eyes connect.

                                 MAMMY JANE
                        I’m sorry...

           Still snowing.  The landscape is a blanket of white, the 
           trees bear heavy loads of frozen powder.

           The loud snap of a gunshot.  A spark of gunfire.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BENNETT HOME - LIVING SPACE - DAY

           Emma stands at the large window near the blazing fire place.

           It truly is a site to behold, Coloma after a snow storm.

           Jeremiah enters from behind her.

           He’s changed.  Calm, quiet.

           He approaches Emma, but stops halfway there.
           She senses him, turns to face him.

           They are enemies.  Two forces with different methods.

           She has no knowledge of Jeremiah’s night.  What he had 
           learned from his foreman, his prostitue, his murder.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Hello.

           Jeremiah musters a kind smile.

           But then it turns downward.  Sour.  

           He recites Exodus 21.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand 
                        for hand, foot for foot, burning 
                        for burning, wound for wound, 
                        stripe for stripe.

           She approaches him.

           She sees through him.  She sees that he knows about her 
           lover.  Then, she sees through to his confession.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        What did you do.

           He continues.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        And if a man shall open a pit and 
                        not cover it, and an ox fall 
                        therein, then the owner of the pit 
                        shall make it good and repay the 
                        owner of the ox.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        Oh God, what did you do.

           She races to the exit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           She races through the snow on horseback, directly for Mammy’s 
           home.
           Knowing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Emma stumbles from her horse, racing up the porch.

                        Mammy!

           She pulls on the front foor to no avail.  The lock rattles.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Mammy!

           She slams her fists on the door.  Calling out for her friend.  
           Fearing the worst.

           She notices the breeze catch a curtain from the draft through 
           the broken window and now she’s certain.

                                 EMMA BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        No.  No.

           She decidedly pulls herself through the broken window.  
           Cutting her leg, she falls to the floor.

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Inside now, Emma makes her way through the kitchen and 
           finally to Mammy’s bedroom.

           INT. MAMMY JANE’S HOME - BEDROOM

           Mammy’s peaceful body lay elegantly where it fell.  Her eyes 
           open.

           Emma crumbles and her breath escapes her.

           She makes her way to Mammy’s body and falls to the floor, 
           embracing her.

           Emma brushes the hair from Mammy’s brow and notices the 
           necklace she had given Jane, clasped around her cold neck.  

           Emma fixes the necklace, laying it straight on her chest.  
           She arranges Mammy.  Still distraught.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Emma, unlocks the front door and exits Mammy’s home.  

           A cold stare.  A decision made.

           A heavy fire is burning, illuminating the room in an orange 
           glow.

           The red curtains framing the dark red woods.

           Half of Jeremiah’s face is masked in shadow, half illuminated 
           in the blazing glow of the flames.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Emma enters the bedroom.  Locking the door behind her.

           She is rummaging through clothes.  Choosing some, laying them 
           on the bed behind her.

           Running away.

           Her face pink with tears.

           She comes to her wedding dress.

           Vivid memories of the wedding run through her mind.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. WALNUT TREE FARM - WEDDING - DUSK (FALL 1832)

           Her slender shape is gently outlined, backlit by the setting 
           sun. 

           The simple wedding is framed in the opaque green glow of an 
           early-fall walnut grove.

           Her frail hands meet his.  Their smiles reveal a marriage of 
           love rather than convenience, her green eyes lower, his are 
           steadily focused.  She smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The affectionate bride and groom steal eager glances with one 
           another.

           Eventually they fall away into the dark grove of trees.  The 
           abundant fireflies give away their Eastern location.

           The groom’s face is clearly lit by the glow of the moon.  
           Jeremiah Bennett.  Young.  Different. 

           He lifts her and presses his lips against hers.  She 
           passionately accepts.

                                 EMMA BENNETT
                        I love you, Jeremiah Emanuel 
                        Bennett.

           He manages to pull her in, even more tightly than before.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        And I love you Emma Isabelle 
                        Bennett.

           She laughs and he sets her down, they take off into the 
           darkness together.

           Emma lites the wedding dress ablaze, letting it burn.

           She throws it on the bed.

           The blankets ignite quickly.
           She exits with a single simple bag.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Through the hallway and to Emmett’s door.

           She opens the door.

           Emmett is gone.  The windows wide open.

           She makes her way to the front door of the home.

           Exits.

           Emmett runs through the main street of Coloma which is all 
           but empty.

           Seeking refuge in his friend, he comes to the church.

           Jeremiah is writing a letter.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        I often pray for such a resolute 
                        state as evil.  What peace it would 
                        be, to be what nature calls of me 
                        and to have no remorse for it.  I 
                        am an animal after all and I am by 
                        no fault of my own, a solitary 
                        predator with no equal.

           Emmett enters the church, looking for Jacob.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        I have become what this world 
                        requires me to be and yet, this 
                        plague of remorse grows deep in my 
                        bowels.  It has not subsided.  
                        Instead, with each new day, it’s 
                        stronger yet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COLOMA - CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           Emmett senses that something is wrong.  He makes his way down 
           the aisle of the church.

           He nears the front, under the statue of the crucifixion.

           He looks to his left, then his right.  

           Jacob isn’t here.

           He sits, waiting.

           They were supposed to meet here.

           But then he notices...

           A spatter of blood next to him, in the pew.

           Emmett touches the red spray, examines it near his face.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        But it is you, my son, who I suffer 
                        the most agony for.  I regret 
                        having chosen to bring you into 
                        this hell of life.  I am a selfish 
                        man and you are quite possibly the 
                        most selfish choice I’ve made.  I 
                        am sorry.

           Emmett notices that the trail of blood continues across the 
           dark wooden floors of the church.

           There is a smear of blood on the wall, low, near the floor, 
           by the back exit.

           He opens the back door of the church, revealing the sprawling 
           white landscape littered with random trees

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jacob is lying in the snow, shaking cold.

           His blood is sprayed across the white landscape from a second 
           gunshot.

           Emmett runs to him.

           His hand on Jacob’s back.

                                 EMMETT BENNETT
                        Who did this?

           Jacob can’t speak.  His eyes can only move to the side enough 
           to meet Emmet’s.

           Jacob reaches out his bloody hand and takes hold of Emmett’s 
           collar.

           Emmett pulls Jacob upward, embracing him against his chest.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (V.O.)
                        I told you once that nothing would 
                        harm you.  I have only wanted to 
                        protect what is mine.  Your mother 
                        and you.  My actions are 
                        deplorable... I suppose.  Evil.  
                        But I’ve learned something about 
                        evil.  It lives in every man.  
                        Every woman.

                        We have weaknesses in our soul and 
                        once we display them, once evil 
                        knows our weakness, a place for it 
                        to enter... it starts to seep in.  
                        More and more.  Consuming you, 
                        taking you.  Becoming you.

           Emmett’s teary eyes fill with the fury of his father’s.

           Jacob’s stunted breathing ends.  His head hard against 
           Emmett’s chest.

           Jacob passes away in Emmett’s arms.

           Emmett enters.  Covered in Jacob’s blood.  He holds a pistol.

           Emmett is distant.  He’s gone.

           The flames make their way into the door of Jeremiah’s study.

           He hasn’t noticed them until now.

           Emmett is holding the gun at his side.  His hands are 
           trembling.

           Jeremiah stands.  Approaches Emmett, hands out, he holds his 
           letter in his left.  Cautious.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT
                        Everything I want to say is here.

           Emmett is empty.  He raises the gun, pointing it at his 
           father.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t you Emmett.  You aren’t 
                        a cruel man.

           The flames enter, having their way with the curtains.  
           There’s no way out of the room except through flame.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t mark your soul with my death 
                        Emmett.  Hand me the gun.

           Emmett steps backward from him, making space.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You have to leave.  You have to go. 

           Emmett is shaking.
           Jeremiah yells.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you boy?

           He tries even harder.

                        Say something!

           10 feet away now.

                        Give me the gun Emmett!  I’m a 
                        sinful man.  I’ll do it myself.

           Too much time passes, Emmett is bluffing.

           Part of Jeremiah wishes he weren’t.  He wishes his son 
           weren’t so weak.

           But then, Jeremiah begins his attempt at an apology.

           He extends the sealed envelop with Emmett’s name written 
           across its face.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I want you to have this.  The 
                        things I’ve done...

           Before Jeremiah can finish Emmett turns the gun to his own 
           temple and pulls the trigger.

           It is so incredibly immediate.  So shocking.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        No! No!

           The crack of gunfire echoes and rings around the burning room 
           and in the ears of Jeremiah.

           He falls dead.

           The ringing lives on in Jeremiah’s mind.  Reflecting the 
           sounds that took his sons life with them.

           He rushes to his son’s body.

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        My God no.

           The flames burn.  Blazing, consuming closer.
           He tries to close the bloody wound on the side of his son’s 
           head.  

                                 JEREMIAH BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Emmett no... no...
