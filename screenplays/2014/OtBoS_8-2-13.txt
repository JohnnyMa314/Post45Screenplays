           EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - LANGDELL HALL - DAY

           Through a park-like quad, under a canopy of elms, well 
           groomed (white) MEN (20s) march toward a limestone building. 

           Ten Thousand Men of Harvard want victory today....

           They wear gray suits and narrow ties. With glasses and pipes. 
           They’re the future leaders of America. And in their jovial, 
           cocky grins it’s clear they know it. 

           For they know that o’er old Eli, fair Harvard holds sway...

           But there’s a pair of heels among their polished loafers. And 
           amid their clean-shaven faces, a hint of long, brown hair. 

           So then we’ll conquer all old Eli’s men...

           She slows her step. Letting the men pass. 

           RUTH BADER GINSBURG (23) is petite, lean. And striking. She 
           takes in the size of the place, its grandeur. And is awed.

           And when the game ends, we’ll sing again...

           Shoulders back, proud she rejoins the stream of men entering 
           the building.

           Ten thousand men of Harvard gained victory today!

           MAIN TITLE:      ON THE BASIS OF SEX

           INT. LANGDELL HALL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

           ERWIN GRISWOLD (52) is on stage at a podium too small for his 
           stature. Above him, a banner: “Welcome Class of 1959.”

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Settle down, please. ... Be seated.

           SUPER: 1956

           As the crowd quiets... Ruth smiles politely to the man she’s 
           settling beside. He stares. Plainly confused by her presence.
                                 GRISWOLD
                        I am Dean Erwin Griswold. It’s my 
                        pleasure to welcome you to 
                        orientation. And to Harvard Law. 
                        Take a moment to look around you. 
                        At your classmates...

           Ruth does. There are over five hundred people in this grand 
           room. Only nine of them women. 

                                 GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
                        Together, you will become lawyers. 
                        That is a privilege you share. And 
                        a responsibility that you accept.

           Ruth takes a deep breath. Hanging on every word. 

                                 GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
                        Consider: what does it mean to be a 
                        Harvard man? A Harvard man is 
                        intelligent, of course. But he is 
                        also tenacious. He is a leader 
                        devoted to the rule of law. He is 
                        mindful of his country. Loyal to 
                        tradition. And he is respectful and 
                        protective of our institutions.

           There’s determination in her gaze.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - LATER

           Young men and professors mingle over drinks.

           Ruth is to the side. Sipping wine beside EMILY (21). Blonde 
           and athletic, she towers over Ruth like an Amazon. 

                                 EMILY
                        Father, he’s a judge back in 
                        Cleveland, he’s still involved with 
                        the school -- alumni events and 
                        whatnot. Well he warned me Civil 
                        Procedure’s the class to watch out 
                        for. The professor’s supposed to be 
                        some sort of hyper-perfectionist.
                             (she downs her drink)
                        Are you nervous?

           Not one for schmoozing, Ruth collects her thoughts.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m ready. At least I think I am. 
                                 EMILY
                        Yeah. Yeah. Me too.

           She looks around. Then leans in to Ruth conspiratorially. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Do you know where the ladies 
                        room is?

                                 RUTH
                        There’s one across the quad. In 
                        Austin Hall. It’s next to the 
                        maid’s closet downstairs.

           Ruth notices Griswold working the room. As he, too, notices 
           them. And excuses himself from a conversation.  

           Emily takes off. As Griswold approaches. His smile disarming.

                                 GRISWOLD
                        I trust she’s not fleeing from me.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh. No. She, uh --

                                 GRISWOLD
                        I’m Erwin Griswold.

           The hand he offers engulfs hers completely.

                                 RUTH
                        ...Ruth Ginsburg. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Welcome to Harvard, Miss Ginsburg. 
                        From where are you coming to us?

                                 RUTH
                        Mrs. Ginsburg, actually. New York.

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Ah... Yankees or Dodgers? 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not really... my father’s still 
                        celebrating. We’re from Brooklyn. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        He must be proud you’re here. What 
                        kind of law does he practice?

                                 RUTH
                        He sells ladies’ coats.  
           It’s not the pedigree he was expecting.

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Really? ... I have a favor to ask. 
                        I am sometimes invited to respond 
                        to a question, which you may be 
                        better suited to answer than I.

           Ruth sips her drink nervously.

                                 GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
                        How do I justify giving a place at 
                        this school to a woman that could 
                        otherwise go to a man?

           Ruth stares. Stunned. A thousand thoughts... but no answer. 

                                 GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
                        There’s no pressure. I’m asking all 
                        the ladies. ... Well. Excuse me.

           Griswold smiles coolly and walks off. Leaving Ruth to stew. 

           INT. GINSBURG HARVARD APARTMENT - BEDROOM / BATHROOM - DAY

           Cluttered. Comfortable. Borrowed furniture placed like a 
           jigsaw puzzle. Books and museum posters.

           Ruth is before a BEDROOM mirror, wrapped in a towel, her hair 
           wet. Pondering two blouses.

                                 RUTH
                        I just stood there. What I SHOULD 
                        have said was...
                             (playing a ‘dutiful wife’)
                        Sir, my husband is studying law a 
                        year ahead of me. And with a 
                        Harvard degree, I’ll be more 
                        scintillating for him when he gets 
                        home at the end of the day. 

           Her husband, MARTIN (24), shaving in the BATHROOM, laughs.

                                 MARTIN 
                        He probably would have signed his 
                        wife up. You could have studied 
                        together! 

                                 RUTH
                        The nine women in that room fought 
                        tooth and nail to get here. We came 
                        to become lawyers! Why else?! 
           She takes a breath and presents him the shirts. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Which one makes me look more like a 
                        ‘Harvard Man’?

           He comes in a for a closer look, his expression both playful 
           and reprimanding. That’s the man in a nutshell. He is tall, 
           classically handsome - and he sees through the world, 
           delighting in its ironies.

           As he takes her in his arms...

                                 MARTIN
                        I for one am glad you look nothing 
                        like a Harvard Man. 

           She laughs. As he kisses her. 

                                 RUTH
                        I just want to look like a lawyer. 

           He kisses her again. Deeply. Dropping the shirts, she wraps 
           her arms around him. Until... 

           From a crib in the room, JANE (1) cries. Reluctantly Ruth 
           pulls away. And picks up the baby. 

           She smells Jane’s diaper. Sure enough... 

           Ruth unsnaps Jane’s cloth diaper. On cue, Martin hands her a 
           damp towel. She cleans Jane. He gets a fresh diaper.

                                 RUTH 
                        Marty. What did we say about 
                        peaches?

                                 MARTIN
                        She likes them.

                                 RUTH
                        They don’t like her.

           Ruth tickles Jane’s belly. And they switch. Martin puts on a 
           new diaper, while Ruth rinses the soiled one in the toilet.

                                 JANE
                        Ba-ba. Pfft.

                                 MARTIN
                             (to Jane)
                        Oh, really?! You’re welcome to put 
                        it on yourself.
                             (to Ruth)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARTIN (CONT'D)
                        You’ve been warned, Kiki (pr: Kick-
                        EE). This one has strong opinions. 

           Finished, he picks Jane up.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        You must get that from your mother.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Professor ERNEST BROWN (50), in a three-piece suit and bow 
           tie, clutches the podium. He’s a gentle, intelligent man, and 
           lectures like it - in a precise, slightly southern drawl.

                                 BROWN
                        Justice is not a set of ideals. It 
                        is a performance. Played by judges 
                        and citizens. And lawyers. 

           Casting a wary eye at her CLASSMATES, Ruth sits taller.

                                 BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Today we’ll study this performance 
                        in relation to property tax. To 
                        quote your text: “Land, like woman, 
                        is meant to be possessed.” Yet 
                        government taxes land and evicts 
                        for non-payment. Is that just? To 
                        start, who really owns it -- the 
                        purchaser or the government? 

           Ruth raises her hand. A CLASSMATE, noticing her, calls out: 

                                 CLASSMATE 1
                        The government does. 

           Ruth lowers her hand. 

                                 BROWN
                        But his name’s on the deed.

                                 CLASSMATE 1
                        If he can be removed, his ownership 
                        is in name only. 

                                 BROWN
                             (checking a seating chart)
                        Well argued Mr... Kirkpatrick.

           This time Ruth’s hand shoots up.

                                 BROWN
                        Mr. Hicks.
                                 CLASSMATE 2
                        But the government does not limit 
                        WHO can purchase property. 

                                 BROWN
                        Ah. The makings of a debate!

           Ruth raises her hand once more. The only one up. 

                                 BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see whose argument holds -- A 
                        question already ... Mrs. Ginsburg? 

                                 RUTH
                        Government DOES limit who can buy 
                        property. Often, married women 
                        cannot. 

                                 BROWN
                        You’ll be glad to learn the Married 
                        Women Property Acts dealt with that 
                        particular inequity. A century ago.

           The class CHUCKLES. 

                                 RUTH
                        Excuse me. They did not. 

           He scrutinizes her over his glasses.

                                 RUTH
                        ... Banks still may refuse women 
                        credit. We can’t buy anything, if 
                        we can’t get a mortgage. 

                                 CLASSMATE 3
                        Your husbands can.

                                 RUTH
                        That’s not the same.  

                                 CLASSMATE 1
                        Don’t tell her husband that! 

                                 BROWN
                        Let’s say, all things being equal, 
                        there is no limit on who may buy 
                        property. Page thirty-six. 

           He turns, scribbling “Property Tax” on the board. And the 
           class moves on. Except Ruth.
           INT. LANGDELL HALL CORRIDOR - LATER

           Ruth presses her way out amidst her classmates. On her toes. 
           Searching. Until she eyes Brown, turning a corner. 

                                 RUTH
                        Professor Brown. Professor! Excuse 
                        me. I don’t understand. Doesn’t the 
                        Fourteenth Amendment say all people 
                        are entitled to equal protection 
                        under the law? So, all things being 
                        equal -- 

                                 BROWN
                        ‘Equal Protection’ refers to freed 
                        Negro slaves. It has nothing to do 
                        with women. 
                             (off Ruth’s look)
                        According to the Supreme Court. In 
                        Goesaert v Cleary.

           She considers this. Then opens her notebook to write it down. 

                                 RUTH
                        G-O-S-?

                                 BROWN
                        There’s no need to look it up. 

           She remains poised to write.

                                 BROWN (CONT’D)
                        G-O-E-S-A-E-R-T... v Cleary. Also 
                        Muller v Oregon. State v Heitman. 

           Ruth continues to take down this list, fervently. 

                                 BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Ginsburg. If you genuinely 
                        aspire to be a lawyer --

                                 RUTH
                        I do.

                                 BROWN
                        Then I urge you not to be 
                        distracted from your course work. 

           He indicates the notebook and moves on. Ruth watches him go.  

           EXT. HARVARD YARD - DAY

           Weeks have passed. Autumn is at its peak. 
                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        I can’t study anymore. I’m 
                        exhausted...

           INT. HARVARD LAW LIBRARY - CORNER TABLE - DAY

           Ruth and Martin are secluded by a fortress of piled books. 

           Martin reaches for her hand. And she offers it. Her eyes 
           never lifting from her law book. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Please can we go home. Before the 
                        sitter costs more than our tuition. 

                                 RUTH
                        Listen to this. Man burns his hand. 
                        A doctor guarantees him “a hundred-
                        percent good hand,” if he allows 
                        the doctor to perform surgery. He 
                        does. And ends up with a palm that 
                        grows hair, because the doctor 
                        grafted skin from the man’s chest. 

                                 MARTIN
                        The moral being: a hand with a burn 
                        is worth two with a bush.
                             (off Ruth’s giggle)
                        It’s Hawkins v McGee. I learned it 
                        as a first-year, too. I’ll tell you 
                        all about it... on our way home.

                                 RUTH
                        The doctor should owe expectation 
                        damages. I need to check a citation 
                        on assumption of risk. 

           She’s gone. Martin grimaces. 

           INT. HARVARD LAW LIBRARY - STACKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruth finds a volume of the United States Reports. Opens it. 

           INT. HARVARD LAW LIBRARY - CORNER TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           She returns from the stacks with the volume open. 

                                 RUTH
                        Listen to this. “A plaintiff --

           She freezes. Terrified. 
           Martin is sprawled across the floor. His chair on its back 
           beside him. 

           Ruth drops the book and runs to his side. 

                                 RUTH
                        Help! Someone help me!

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Chaotic. Ruth trails a matriarchal NURSE.

                                 RUTH
                        He was fine. He was just -- We were 
                        studying... And -- 

           She glances at a woman moaning, abandoned on a stretcher. The 
           Nurse flags down a DOCTOR (50).

                                 NURSE
                        Doctor! This is Mrs. Ginsburg. 
                        You sent her husband to X-ray.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mrs. Ginsburg. Perhaps we should 
                        find someplace quiet to -- 

                                 RUTH
                        What happened? What’s wrong?

                                 DOCTOR
                        We don’t know yet. We seem to have 
                        gotten the pain under control. 

           It’s almost too much for her. 

                                 RUTH
                        Pain? He never said... 

                                 DOCTOR
                        We’ve sedated him. I’m going to 
                        keep him here so we can run tests. 
                        Mrs. Ginsburg, I suggest you go 
                        home. And get some rest. 

                                 RUTH
                        No. I’m not leaving him. Not 
                        without answers.

                                 DOCTOR
                        At the moment, I don’t have any.
           INT. GINSBURG HARVARD APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ruth pays off a frustrated baby sitter. And closes the door 
           behind her. The apartment is eerily quiet. 

           Ruth enters THE BEDROOM. And watches Jane sleeping behind the 
           bars of her crib. She gives a little cry in her sleep. 

                                 RUTH
                        Shh. Daddy will be home soon. It’s 
                        all going to be okay. 

           She stifles a sob. And lies down atop the covers - on a far 
           side of the otherwise-empty bed. Terrified and alone.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

           Bright. Antiseptic. A pile of textbooks beside the bed. 

           Martin is under the covers, reading. In a chair beside him, 
           Ruth holds a textbook as well. But watches her husband. 

           DOCTOR WYLAND LEADBETTER (50) enters. He’s broad and clean-
           shaven, full of genial self-confidence. 

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        Good evening. 

           As he grabs an empty chair on the far side of the room, he 
           glances at the book in Martin’s hands... 

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        Principles of Corporate Partnership 
                        and Business Taxation? I thought 
                        medical textbooks had dry titles. 
                             (to Ruth)
                        You must be Mrs. Ginsburg. Don’t 
                        get up. I’m Wyland Leadbetter. Head 
                        of Urology. 

           He sits in the chair he’s brought over.

                                 MARTIN
                        Well, Doc?

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        I’m afraid the growth is cancerous.  

           Ruth takes Martin’s hand, anxiously. 

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        But we caught it early, so there’s 
                        a fighting chance. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. LEADBETTER (CONT'D)
                        I’ll perform a series of surgeries, 
                        each followed by a course of 
                        radiation therapy. Marty, I’m 
                        afraid you’re in for an unpleasant 
                        experience. 

           Ruth looks from Martin to Leadbetter. Bravely.  

                                 RUTH
                        When do we begin?

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        The sooner the better. I’d like to 
                        start tomorrow. 

           Ruth nods her agreement. And Leadbetter rises to go.

                                 MARTIN
                        The thing is, Doc. I’ve been 
                        studying for midterms. 

                                 RUTH
                        Marty.

                                 MARTIN
                        I just want to hold off ten days.

           Leadbetter recognizes the intensity on Martin’s eyes.

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        I’ll tell the nurse to discharge 
                        you in the morning. Ten days.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Leadbetter is walking down the hall, when Ruth appears.

                                 RUTH
                        Doctor Leadbetter.

           He turns. As Ruth approaches. 

                                 RUTH
                        You said the sooner the better. I 
                        can convince him. I can talk to his 
                        professors. I’ll slash his tires. 
                        If it will make even the slightest 
                        difference... My mother withered 
                        away for four years. My husband is 
                        NOT going to go through that. 

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        Did she... ?
                                 RUTH
                        The night before my high school 
                        graduation. 

           The cruelty of it strikes him. 

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        You should be prepared. The 
                        survival rate for testicular cancer 
                        is less than five percent.

           Ruth stumbles. Leadbetter helps her into a nearby chair.

                                 DR. LEADBETTER
                        Marty should do the things that are 
                        important to him... while he can. 

           INT. LECTURE HALL TWO - DAY

           Professor FREUND (48), black-hair, broad, lectures before a 
           full class. His voice resonant. 

                                 FREUND
                        The doctrine of stare decisis, as 
                        we all know, comes from English 
                        Common Law...

           The door CREAKS. And Ruth enters sheepishly. As Freund 
           continues lecturing, he watches her find a seat in back. 

                                 FREUND (CONT’D)
                        Which also provides the first 
                        examples of circumstances when 
                        precedents may be overturned. 
                        Judges are bound... Excuse me. May 
                        I help you?

                                 RUTH
                        I’m Martin Ginsburg’s wife. I’ll be 
                        attending his classes for him. 

           Freund seems shaken by it. As do his students.

                                 FREUND
                        In addition to your own?

           The look in her eye leaves no room for negotiation. Freund is 
           moved. He nods his consent and resumes his lecture. 

                                 FREUND (CONT’D)
                        ...Ah yes. Judges are bound by 
                        precedent. But cannot ignore 
                        cultural change.
           Ruth begins scribbling notes. 

                                 FREUND (CONT’D)
                        A Court ought NOT be affected by 
                        the weather of the day, but will be 
                        by the climate of the era.

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                             (weakly)
                        Wait. Wait. Say that again...

           INT. GINSBURG HARVARD APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The LIVING ROOM and DINING ROOM are one and the same. Ruth 
           sits at the dining table with a typewriter and coffee. 

                                 RUTH
                             (reading her notes aloud)
                        A Court ought not be affected by 
                        the weather of the day, but will be 
                        by the climate of the era. 

           Martin is sprawled on the couch. His chalky skin blotched in 
           sweat. He is much too thin. And struggles to breathe. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You’re sure that’s -- Of course.

           He closes his eyes and catches his breath. It’s exhausting. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        The law is never finished. It is a 
                        work in progress. And ever will be. 

           As he dictates, Ruth types, adding to a mostly-written page. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        In Brown v Board of Education 
                        (1954), the Supreme Court 
                        overturned its own precedent... 

           End of the page. She loads another. But Martin doesn’t wait.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Representing Oliver Brown, et. al., 
                        Thurgood Marshall educated the 
                        Court about the burdens created by 
                        segregation --

                                 RUTH
                        Slow down! ... Would you hold on?! 

           He drops his head to the pillow. Catching his breath.
                                 MARTIN
                        Ugh. You type like an invalid. 

                                 RUTH
                        Educated the Court about...

           She waits, fingers poised over the keys. ... Silence. 
           Checking, she finds Martin lying perfectly still. Anxiously, 
           she crosses the room...

           He’s asleep. His breath shallow. Relieved, Ruth tucks him in. 
           Kisses his forehead. And returns to the table. 

           She takes a slow sip of coffee. Then she removes the page 
           from the typewriter, stacks it with others, and puts them all 
           into a folder, labelled “Martin.”

           She opens another folder: “Ruth.” Loads a half-typed page 
           into the machine. And resumes her work in the quiet dark. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - LANGDELL HALL - DAY - 18 MONTHS LATER

           The sun-drenched elms blossom green, the last clumps of snow 
           clinging to their bases. Campus is in bloom. 

           Ruth and Martin walk together. Ruth’s in a suit. And Martin - 
           though thinner - is clearly well. Jane (3 now) runs ahead. 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s a great firm. And New York is 
                        the center of the legal universe.
                             (to Jane, who’s escaping)
                        Jane! Jane! Not too far.

           Ruth trots after her. Picking her up and carrying her back. 
           As they come to a stop before the law school. 

                                 RUTH
                        You earned this. You worked hard. 

                                 MARTIN
                        YOU worked hard. I just survived.

           She takes a deep breath. And glances warily at the building.

           INT. DEAN GRISWOLD’S OFFICE - DAY

           A room with history. Daunting. Regal. Griswold sits at his 
           desk. Ruth, tiny in an oversized chair, looks him in the eye. 
                                 GRISWOLD
                        You want us to grant you a degree, 
                        though you plan to complete your 
                        coursework at another institution?

           He shakes his head. But this time, Ruth is prepared.

                                 RUTH
                        Dean Griswold. Between the first 
                        and third year of law school, which 
                        would you say is the more pressing? 
                        More educational? More important?

                                 GRISWOLD
                        The first. Of course. 

                                 RUTH
                        Yet when someone transfers in as a 
                        second-year student -- having taken 
                        the more important classes 
                        elsewhere -- he’s given a Harvard 
                        degree. Doesn’t it only make sense 
                        then that since I completed my 
                        first two years here, I should be 
                        entitled to the same?

                                 GRISWOLD
                        You have another option. Martin can 
                        go to New York, while you and the 
                        child remain here.

                                 RUTH
                        No. Marty’s doing well. But his 
                        doctors can’t rule out a relapse. 
                        What happens if we’re apart and... 
                        You’ve allowed this in the past.

                                 GRISWOLD
                        I’m sorry. If this were a job 
                        opportunity for you, and you were 
                        the provider for your family --

                                 RUTH
                        This is my family.

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Which your husband will support. 
                        It’s my job to protect the 
                        distinction of a Harvard education. 
                        Now if Columbia is willing to grant 
                        you a degree... Well it’s no 
                        Harvard, but that’s your decision. 
           EXT. CAMBRIDGE STREETS - LATER

           Ruth near tears. The weight of it pressing down. She slows...

           Ahead of her is a playground. She watches Jane climbing on a 
           jungle gym. And Martin spotting her from below. He notices 
           Ruth. And smiling, waves. 

           Ruth forces a smile. And waves back. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - THIRD AVENUE - DAY

           New construction - concrete office buildings going up beside 
           squat, brick pubs and luncheonettes. A blue collar 
           neighborhood being actively transformed. 

           Ruth, in a suit and heels, a briefcase in hand, is a woman on 
           a mission. Through bustling pedestrian traffic, she passes 
           the Baronet Theater. Its marquee advertises Room at the Top. 

           SUPER: 1959

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           She stops outside its rotating doors. There is no awe in her 
           stare, as there was outside Langdell Hall. And the steadying 
           breath she takes isn’t optimistic. She enters.  

           INT. GREENE’S OFFICE - DAY

           GREENE (45), a big man, a street-wise lawyer, is reading 
           Ruth’s resume. 

                                 GREENE
                        Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Two years 
                        at Harvard. Graduating from 
                        Columbia. Law Review at BOTH?! I 
                        didn’t even know that was possible. 

           He looks up at her at last. 

                                 GREENE (CONT’D)
                        You realize you’d be bored to death 
                        here. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sure you have interesting 
                        clients.
                                 GREENE
                        No. I’ve got run-of-the-mill 
                        clients. They pay the mortgage.

           He puts down the resume. 

                                 GREENE (CONT’D)
                        You want some white-shoe firm 
                        downtown. Big-money cases and  
                        complex legal questions.

                                 RUTH
                             (with growing frustration)
                        There are fourteen firms like that 
                        in the city. Six won’t hire women. 
                        Two told me being a mother would 
                        keep me from doing my job well. One 
                        partner said he closes clients in 
                        the locker room at his club - so 
                        I’d be out of the loop. A week ago 
                        I was told women are too emotional 
                        to be lawyers. And that same 
                        afternoon, that a woman graduating 
                        number one in her class must be “a 
                        real ball buster,” and wouldn’t 
                        make a good colleague. 

           Unburdened, she lets out her breath. And grows embarrassed. 

                                 GREENE
                        You must have been livid. 

                                 RUTH
                        I was. 

                                 GREENE
                        What about the rest? 
                             (off her look)
                        That’s only eleven. 

                                 RUTH
                        They don’t hire Jews. 

           He shakes his head. His sardonic chuckle says, “Of course.”

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Greene. I want to be a lawyer. 
                        I want to represent clients before 
                        the court in pursuit of justice. 
                             (re: her resume)
                        You can see I worked hard through 
                        school. I did everything I was 
                        supposed to and I excelled. I 
                        promise, I’ll do the same for you.
           She doesn’t break eye contact as he considers her plea.  

                                 GREENE
                        Mrs. Ginsburg, I’m impressed.

           His gaze drifts downward. Over the contours of her chest. The 
           curve of her torso. Ruth tenses. And buttons her suit coat. 

                                 GREENE (CONT’D)
                        Thing is... My wife is a jealous 
                        woman. 

           Ruth fights her building fury. Then silently rises to go. As 
           she heads out the door...

                                 GREENE (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Take it as a compliment. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - JANE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jane (4 now), is asleep, sucking her ring and middle fingers. 
           Ruth watches her in the dark. Drinking wine. A half-empty 
           bottle in hand. Still wearing the same suit, unbuttoned. 

           From somewhere in the apartment, a DOOR OPENS.

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Kiki?! Listen to this!

           INT. FRONT ENTRANCE / LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Martin’s taking off his jacket. As Ruth enters from the hall.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        You remember Mr. Heller? The man   
                        thinks the job of a senior partner 
                        is to see how much he can make you 
                        sweat. We’re at lunch today -- with 
                        clients -- and in front of everyone 
                        he starts in on me. BUT, it was all 
                        about the Sifton Merger!

           He looks to her for a reaction. And gets none. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Sifton! I was up half the night 
                        reading it. I knew all the answers. 
                        Afterward, he pulled me aside. He 
                        wants me to take the lead! 

           She embraces him with no cynicism behind her smile. But when 
           she pulls away, there’s a sadness to her.
                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 RUTH
                        Nothing.
                             (escaping)
                        Do you want a drink? 

           He follows her into the bright, open LIVING ROOM. It’s lined 
           with built-in shelves - books, trinkets and family photos. 

           As Ruth mixes Campari and soda, Martin figures it out...

                                 MARTIN
                        You had another interview. 

                                 RUTH
                        At Landon, Bibler and Greene. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I’ve never heard of that firm. 

           Exactly. 

                                 RUTH
                        I thought it went well. Until he 
                        said, “Thing is, my wife is a 
                        jealous woman.” 

           Martin is pained. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        He told me it’s a compliment. 
                             (finishing her drink)
                        And he thinks he’s one of the good 
                        guys. 

           She turns to Martin. A degree of desperation...

                                 RUTH
                        What more could I possibly --  

           Regaining control, she looks away. To a photo from another 
           era. Black and white. Her mother, laughing. On her chest, a 
           gold, sun-like pin. Ruth’s face reflects in the glass.

                                 RUTH
                        After mother died, father and I 
                        went to temple to say the mourner’s 
                        kaddish. But they were one man 
                        short of a minyan. I said, I’m 
                        here. The Rabbi just looked at me 
                        and said, You don’t count. ... Like 
                        God cared that I was a girl.
                                 MARTIN
                        Ruth...

                                 RUTH
                        She died believing that I wouldn’t 
                        have barriers, because I was 
                        getting an education.  

                                 MARTIN
                        Maybe it’s time to think about 
                        Professor Gunther’s suggestion. 

                                 RUTH
                        I went to school so I could 
                        practice law. Not to be a teacher.

                                 MARTIN
                        It’s a good job, Kiki. There are 
                        senior partners who would leave my 
                        firm in a heartbeat to join a law 
                        faculty. 

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah... After being lawyers.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           OVER BLACK:

                                 STUDENT PROTESTORS (V.O.)
                             (chanting)
                        One. Two. Three. Four. We don’t 
                        want your fucking war!

           EXT. RUTGERS UNIVERSITY - NEWARK CAMPUS - DAY

           Picketers. Placard bearers. Hippies. Freaks. And sidewalk 
           orators. An immense crowd of STUDENTS (20s) throng the urban 
           campus. They carry banners - “Out of Vietnam” - and effigies 
           of death. This isn’t “Occupy” anything. It’s Tahrir Square. 

                                 STUDENT PROTESTORS (CONT’D)
                        Five. Six. Seven. Eight. No more 
                        blood and no more hate! 

           Beneath shaggy hair and garlands. Behind long beards. Below 
           afros. Men, women. Caucasian, black. Unified by the anger in 
           their faces. Their voices hoarse from screaming. 

           SUPER: 1970
           IN A PARKING LOT - a bag slung over her shoulder, folders 
           hugged to her chest, Ruth locks her Chevy Impala. A serious 
           and determined woman with an air of disappointment. She’s 36. 

           Entering the crowd of protestors, her look says, if she were 
           ten years younger, she’d be one of them.

           EXT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - ACKERSON HALL - DAY

           Ruth squeezes her way through the striking students. Toward a 
           line of CAMPUS COPS - on edge, wearing helmets, their night 
           sticks poised. They forcibly clear a path for her. 

           INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Harried, rushing, Ruth enters her classroom.  

           And finds only two STUDENTS. Both looking out the window, at 
           the STUDENT PROTESTORS striking outside. She exhales sharply.

                                 RUTH
                        Good morning. Please take your 
                        seats. 

           They seem disappointed to see her. And hang by the window. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You cannot be both here and out 
                        there. That’s what makes it a 
                        strike. 

           INT. UPPER EAST GROCERY STORE - DAY

           A package of Saran Wrap lands in Ruth’s shopping cart. Jane 
           (now 15) is stunned. Don’t let the blonde hair and freckles 
           fool you; she’s grown into an opinionated and strong-willed 
           girl. She wears a Hallsworth School softball uniform. 

                                 JANE
                        Mom! Dow Chemicals makes that!

                                 RUTH
                        Jane, it’s not a political 
                        statement. 

           Jane will have none of it. She returns the box to the shelf. 

                                 JANE
                        Napalm doesn’t just kill. It 
                        tortures. 
           Before Ruth can respond. She hears...

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                             (”Where are you?”)
                        Mooo-mmmyyy? Mo-om? .... MOMMY!

                                 RUTH
                        Aisle four, James. 

           JAMES appears. A towheaded boy (5), with a box of Kaboom 
           cereal. 

                                 JAMES
                        Can we buy this?

                                 RUTH
                        Absolutely not. Show me where you 
                        got it, so we can put it back.

                                 JAMES
                        But mom! I love these.

                                 RUTH
                        You’ve never had them. C’mon. I 
                        promised Daddy we wouldn’t be late.

           With a pout, he leads the way. But as they turn the corner... 

                                 JANE
                        Madame Dubé! Hi!

           Ruth looks toward where Jane is waving...

           MRS. DUBÉ (25) is reaching for a high shelf, the tell-tale 
           swelling of her belly obvious. Hearing Jane, she turns. But 
           her eyes land on Ruth. And her smile falls. She hurries away. 

                                 RUTH
                        Jane. Who was that?

                                 JANE
                        My French teacher. She must have 
                        seen me. 

           Ruth understands completely. And feels bad about it.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m certain she did. 

           EXT. UPPER EAST GROCERY STORE - LATER

           The Ginsburgs leave the store, their groceries bagged, Ruth 
           and Jane doing the heavy lifting. 
                                 MRS. DUBÉ (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Ginsburg.

           They turn to find her. Plainly waiting for them. Speaking 
           with a French accent, she indicates her pregnant belly. 

                                 MRS. DUBÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I have to ask... Please. 
                        Don’t say anything to the school. 
                        I’ve been so careful. Nobody knows. 

           Ruth furrows her brow. 

           INT. CHEVY IMPALA - LATER

           Parked at a meter in front of the grocery store. Ruth is in 
           the DRIVER’S SEAT. Mrs. Dubé, beside her.

                                 RUTH
                        When I was pregnant with James, I 
                        borrowed clothes from my mother-in-
                        law. They were just big enough that 
                        I could hide it. For a while. I was 
                        lucky. He was born in summer. When 
                        are you due?

                                 MRS. DUBÉ 
                        March. 

           In the BACK SEAT, Jane shifts uncomfortably. Listening. 
           (James is playing with a Action Man toy.)

                                 RUTH
                        So you’re four or five months. And 
                        your contract says...?

                                 MRS. DUBÉ 
                        I’m supposed to leave at three.

           Looking away, Ruth’s face strains in frustration. It’s a 
           puzzle with only one solution. One Ruth can’t stomach.

                                 RUTH
                        Mrs. Dubé. You have to quit. 

           It’s clear the teacher knows Ruth’s right. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Otherwise, when they find out -- 
                        and how can they not? -- they’ll 
                        fire you for lying. With that on 
                        your record, you won’t find another 
                        teaching job in the city. 
                                 MRS. DUBÉ 
                        I need to earn money. Especially... 

           She waves vaguely at her belly. As Ruth considers this. 

                                 RUTH
                        My husband works with a member of 
                        Brearley’s Board of Trustees. It’s 
                        a good school. And a little more... 
                        reasonable. Marty and I will do 
                        whatever we can to help you find 
                        another job.

                                 MRS. DUBÉ 
                        Thank you... Thank -- Excusez-moi.

           Overwhelmed. Embarrassed. She flees the car. And Ruth watches 
           her escape. Compassion in her eyes. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - KITCHEN / FRONT HALL - NIGHT

           They’ve come up in the world. The furniture is contemporary, 
           the artwork original. 

           Martin (37 now) is in the KITCHEN, reading what looks like a 
           yellow and brown newsletter - the TAX COURT ADVANCE SHEETS. 
           He wears an apron and a short-sleeved collared shirt and tie.

           DING! A timer. He removes a roast from the oven. As the ARIA 
           he’s listening to is overwhelmed by MUFFLED VOICES... 

           Ruth enters the FRONT DOOR with the groceries. Trailed by 
           Jane - carrying a backpack, helmet and bat - and James.

                                 RUTH
                        Because I want you to be the editor 
                        of your paper and to play sports 
                        and study and not get... distracted 
                        by the rest of it. Shoes, shoes, 
                        shoes. James! Off the rug!

                                 JANE
                        The rest of it? You mean BOYS?

           James sits on the now-dirty rug, untying his shoes. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I have to learn to compete. God, 
                        Mom, talk about hypocritical. You 
                        went to PUBLIC school, and you were 
                        valedictorian. 
                                 JAMES
                        Mommy. Mom. Mom.

                                 RUTH
                        I just think you have your whole 
                        life to fight those battles. Yes. 
                        James. What is it?

           James is still on the floor - struggling with his laces.

                                 JAMES
                        What’s incorrigible mean? 

           Martin enters from the kitchen - Advance Sheets in hand. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Kids’ dinner is ready. What 
                        happened to not being late? This 
                        party’s important. 

           Ruth shrugs apologetically. 

                                 JANE
                        Daddy. Don’t you think if I want to 
                        go to a co-ed school, it should be 
                        my decision? 

                                 MARTIN
                        I think whatever your mother said 
                        is almost certainly right.

                                 JANE
                        Ugh! You always take her side!
                             (storming away)
                        You can’t protect me from boys 
                        forever, you know!

                                 MARTIN
                             (to Ruth)
                        I thought we were protecting the 
                        boys. 

           Ruth grins. Noticing James, Martin kneels to help the kid 
           with his laces. Laying the Advance Sheets open on the floor. 

                                 JAMES
                        Miss West said I’m incorrigible. 

           One shoe off. James takes up the Advance Sheets.

                                 MARTIN
                        She’s an astute woman. 
                                 JAMES
                        What’s this?

                                 MARTIN
                        It’s called an Advance Sheet. It’s 
                        the decisions issued in tax cases 
                        around the country this month. 

           He gets the other shoe. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        In that case, a man whose mother is 
                        sick took a tax deduction for --

           And James is gone. Leaving Martin with an unfinished thought 
           and a dirty shoe. He looks up at Ruth.  

                                 RUTH
                        Don’t take it too hard. That’s how 
                        I feel about tax law, too.

           EXT. WEIL, GOTSHAL & MANGES OFFICES - NIGHT

           In the heart of midtown. Near the top of an imposing tower.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        It is well known. TAX is the only 
                        genuinely funny area of the law. 

           INT. WEIL, GOTSHAL & MANGES RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

           Mahogany and marble, the law firm’s name in brass. 

           PARTNERS (50s +), ASSOCIATES (30s) and INTERNS (20s) in 
           clumps around the room. All of them men. THEIR WIVES are 
           segregated into their own corner.

           NEAR THE BUFFET: Martin stands out, still wearing his short-
           sleeved shirt. He’s surrounded by a group of eager INTERNS. 

                                 INTERN 1
                        I think most of us just want 
                        careers that have more... impact.

                                 MARTIN
                        Do you know that in Sweden, young 
                        people often don’t get married?

           The Interns chuckle. Nervously. Unsure what to say. 
                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s true. They get engaged. Live 
                        together. Raise families. But they 
                        don’t marry. Know why?

                                 INTERN 2
                        They can have sex without it?

           The other Interns laugh. Not Martin. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Because of taxes.

           They quiet. Martin tips his head. And cracks a smile.  

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        After the war, Sweden, like the 
                        U.S., decided married couples 
                        should file joint tax returns. But 
                        unlike here, they didn’t give 
                        couples a benefit. The Swedes found 
                        themselves in much higher tax 
                        brackets. So they got divorced.  

           He pops a grape in his mouth off the buffet.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Course they kept living together. 

           The Interns smile. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        So. The government retaliated. They 
                        passed a new law. If a couple had 
                        been married and got divorced, but 
                        continued living together -- then 
                        for tax purposes they were still 
                        considered married. 

           Shrugging, he crosses his arms. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        People did what anyone would. Added 
                        a second entrance to their homes 
                        and a wall down the middle. With a 
                        door for easy access.

           The Interns laugh. 

           AT THE BAR: Ruth, waiting, watches Martin affectionately as 
           he holds court. TOM HELLER (65) approaches from behind. An 
           imposing figure, he follows her gaze...
                                 HELLER
                        You can’t believe how many calls I 
                        get, telling me what a wunderkind 
                        that husband of yours is. 

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you, Mr. Heller. I won’t 
                        claim to be surprised.

                                 HELLER
                        I swear to Christ, he’ll run this 
                        place some day. You’re a smart 
                        girl, Ruthy. You married a star. 

           She makes a wry face at the backhanded compliment. Then 
           accepts the two glasses of wine held out to her. 

                                 RUTH
                        If you’ll excuse me, I’ll go bask 
                        in his glow.  

           He takes in the sway of her hips as she heads toward Martin. 

           NEAR THE BUFFET: Martin thrusts his arms up over his head. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Fine! Once married, now divorced, 
                        two-earner couples in sub-divided 
                        homes would, for tax purposes, be 
                        considered living together and --

                                 INTERN 1
                        And therefore still married! 

           Martin’s laughing along with the interns now. As Ruth nears. 

                                 MARTIN
                        It kept going! For decades! While a 
                        whole generation of Swedes avoided 
                        the issue by never getting married. 

                                 RUTH
                        The moral being that in their 
                        attempt to raise revenue, the 
                        Swedish government ruined all those 
                        young men’s best hope at happiness. 

           Martin grins at her finishing his story. Lovingly.   

                                 MARTIN
                        Indeed. How a government taxes its 
                        citizens is a declaration of a 
                        country’s values.
           He turns to look Intern 1 - who challenged him - in the eye. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        What in the world could have more 
                        impact than that?

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Martin on top of the covers, reading Advance Sheets. Ruth is 
           in an adjoining BATHROOM, in a nightgown, brushing her hair. 

                                 RUTH
                        Did you remember to talk to Mike 
                        about Jane’s French teacher?

                                 MARTIN
                        Uh-huh. He said he’d look into it. 

                                 RUTH
                        Does he think there may be a job?

                                 MARTIN
                             (”like I said...”)
                        He said he’d look into it. 

           She puts down the brush and steps out of the bathroom. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Sorry. I can’t go to sleep until I 
                        finish these Advance Sheets. I’ve 
                        been trying to all night.

           She gives him a look. And returns to the BATHROOM.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        You’d find these cases fascinating 
                        if you gave them half a chance.

           Ruth brushes her teeth, rinses, and considers her reflection. 
           Tugging at the crows feet around her eyes. 

           She heads back into the BEDROOM. And grins at Martin - sound 
           asleep, the Advance Sheets open across his chest. She takes 
           the booklet. Gives it cursory look. And frowns. 

           Then tries a different page: Charles E Moritz v Commissioner 
           of Internal Revenue. Pulled in, she reads. Settling on the 
           edge of the bed. As we enter the case she’s discovering...

                                 CLERK (V.O.)
                        The United States Tax Court is now 
                        in session. The honorable Norman O. 
                        Tietjens presiding. 
           EXT. DENVER SKYLINE - DAY - A FEW WEEKS EARLIER

           The jagged pinnacles of the Rocky Mountains pierce a clear, 
           blue sky. Beneath them, a city rises from the aspens.  

           EXT. DENVER COURT HOUSE - DAY

           A marble facade in the quiet city center.  

           OVER THIS: a GAVEL BANG-BANG-BANGS.

                                 TIETJENS (V.O.)
                        The court recalls docket number 610-
                        70 SC. Charles E. Moritz v 
                        Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 

           INT. TAX COURT - DAY

           CHARLES MORITZ (68) sits alone. Tall and white-haired, with 
           sad and gentle features. A man from Rockwell’s brush. 

           From the bench, JUDGE TIETJENS (67) eyes him sternly. 

                                 TIETJENS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Moritz. 

           He looks to MARVIN SCOTT (26), the Government Lawyer.

                                 TIETJENS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Scott. ... As I understand it, 
                        Mr. Moritz, you’re a travelling 
                        book salesman. And your elderly 
                        mother lives with you at home. 

           Moritz nods. And steels himself up. 

                                 TIETJENS (CONT’D)
                        In order to work, you hired a nurse 
                        to help care for your mother. And 
                        on your taxes, you deducted part of 
                        that nurse’s salary under section 
                        214 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

                                 MORITZ
                        That’s right, your honor. 

           Again Tietjens looks to Scott. 

                                 TIETJENS (CONT’D)
                        The Government rejected that 
                        deduction. 
           Scott gives Moritz a disdainful look.

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course, Judge. He was cheating 
                        on his taxes. 

           Moritz bristles. 

                                 TIETJENS
                        And now Mr. Moritz has challenged 
                        the Government’s decision in this 
                        court. Gentlemen. I have considered 
                        the facts of the case. And am 
                        prepared to issue my ruling. 

           As a STENOGRAPHER clacks at her machine, Tietjens refers to 
           his notes. 

                                 TIETJENS (CONT’D)
                        Section 214 awards a caregiver 
                        deduction to women, married 
                        couples, and men either widowed or 
                        divorced. ... It plainly makes no 
                        mention of bachelors. 

           Moritz jumps up. 

                                 MORITZ
                        But your honor! That doesn’t make 
                        sense! What does THAT have to do 
                        with caring for my mother? 

           Tietjens bangs his gavel.

                                 TIETJENS
                        Mr. Moritz. Enough!

           Moritz deflates into his seat. 

                                 TIETJENS (CONT’D)
                        Congress decides who can take a 
                        deduction, not the courts. Clearly 
                        you are not covered by the statute. 

           Scott leans back, self-satisfied. And Moritz is stunned. 

                                 TIETJENS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Moritz you are ordered to pay 
                        the remainder of your taxes, plus 
                        interest. In full. 

           He bangs his gavel once more - with finality. 
           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ruth, the Advance Sheet in her lap, sits in silence. 

           She turns to Martin - sound asleep. And nudges him. Martin 
           moans, shifting his weight. 

                                 RUTH
                        Marty. ... Marty. 

                                 MARTIN
                        What? What is it?! 

                                 RUTH
                        What do you know about Charles 
                        Moritz? ... The travelling salesman 
                        from Denver. He was denied a 
                        caregiver deduction on his taxes.

           She shows him the Advance Sheet. And it hits him. 

                                 MARTIN
                        NOW you want to talk about this?

                                 RUTH
                        The tax code assumes a WOMAN has to 
                        be the caregiver. If Moritz had 
                        been a dutiful daughter instead of 
                        a dutiful son, he’d be eligible for 
                        the deduction. It’s discriminatory. 

           It hits her...

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Against men.

           Martin falls back, exasperated, onto the pillow. 

                                 MARTIN
                        We’ll survive. Kiki. I have a busy 
                        day at work tomorrow. I was asleep.

           As a world of possibilities begins to form before her, Martin 
           gets under the covers. And flicks off the light. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Good night. 

           She lies down as well. And stares into the dark. In her eyes 
           is a glimmer of the girl with big dreams that she used to be.
           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hitting the light, she goes straight to the wall of 
           bookshelves. Looks... looks... and finds a book.

           Sitting at the table, she checks the index and opens to the 
           page. INSERT: Hoyt v Florida (1961). She begins to read.

           After a moment, she glances toward Jane’s softball bat - 
           resting near the door. And has an idea....

           INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Ruth’s STUDENTS (mostly men, some women, 20s) are chatting 
           together. When Ruth enters. Already lecturing. Carrying the 
           same book as in the prior scene, and Jane’s softball bat.  

                                 RUTH
                        Gwendolyn Hoyt was a housewife, 
                        married to a philanderer known to 
                        choke her, to slam her into walls, 
                        to tear off her clothes, and to 
                        threaten to kill her.

                                 MALE STUDENT 1
                        Professor. What page is this --

                                 RUTH
                        It’s not in your textbook. It’s not 
                        even Civil Procedure.

           She drops the book on her desk, open to Hoyt v Florida.

                                 RUTH
                        One night, Clarence Hoyt told his 
                        wife he’d met someone new and the 
                        marriage was over. In what her 
                        lawyers described as a fit of 
                        insanity, she picked up their son’s 
                        baseball bat... 

           With Jane’s bat, she mimes an over-the-head death blow.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        And smashed in Clarence’s skull. 
                        She then called an ambulance and 
                        tended his wounds. Nonetheless, he 
                        died. And Gwendolyn Hoyt was 
                        convicted of second degree murder.

           She writes Hoyt v Florida (1961) on the board.
                                 RUTH
                        In Florida, only men were obligated 
                        to serve on juries. Women didn’t 
                        have to. ... A great civil rights 
                        lawyer named Dorothy Kenyon...
                             (she writes the name)
                        ...took up Hoyt’s appeal. On behalf 
                        of the American Civil Liberties 
                        Union, she argued that Florida’s 
                        all-male juries violated the U.S. 
                        Constitution. Had there been women 
                        on the jury, she said, Hoyt may 
                        have been convicted of a lesser 
                        crime than murder: manslaughter. If 
                        you were on the U.S. Supreme Court, 
                        what would you think, Mr. Maxwell?

                                 MAXWELL
                        I’d think... If I didn’t have to do 
                        jury duty, I wouldn’t complain.

           The students chuckle. Another, BENNETT, raises his hand.

                                 BENNETT
                        The Florida law makes sense though. 
                        A woman’s responsibility is to her 
                        children. You can’t take care of a 
                        kid stuck on some sequestered jury. 

           WHOA! It doesn’t go over well with the women in the room. 

                                 FEMALE STUDENTS
                        Excuse me? Are you kidding?! You’re 
                        never getting laid again. (etc.)

           Some of the men chuckle at the women’s outrage. 

                                 BENNETT 
                        Men are the mammoth hunters. We 
                        support our families. 

                                 KATE
                        What about women who don’t have 
                        children? Or whose kids are older? 

           Ruth looks to her. Impressed. Hair down, her mid-riff 
           exposed, KATE (23) is a marked contrast to Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Or what if a MAN wanted to be a 
                        caregiver? Should he be excused 
                        from jury duty as well? Mr. Worth?
                                 WORTH
                        Hey, I’m with the ladies... But 
                        that was 1961. Things are different 
                        now. Women work. If my girl wanted 
                        to get a job, it’d be cool with me. 

                                 RUTH 
                        And if you marry her, and she gets 
                        fired as a result... which the law 
                        allows?

           That quiets him.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        My daughter’s favorite teacher had 
                        to resign because she’s pregnant. 
                        How is she supposed to provide for 
                        her child? When laws say women 
                        can’t work overtime? When a woman’s 
                        social security benefits, unlike 
                        her husband’s, don’t provide for 
                        her family after her death... 

           She points to the board.

                                 RUTH
                        What Dorothy Kenyon asked was this:  
                        If laws can differentiate between 
                        people on the basis of sex... Then 
                        how will women ever become mammoth 
                        hunters, too? This is the most 
                        recent precedent dealing with that 
                        question. The Court’s decision is 
                        standing law.

           A heavy silence. The class has never seen her so impassioned. 

                                 KATE
                        So what did they say?

                                 RUTH
                        That jury service is vital. And the 
                        very definition of being American. 
                        BUT because women are, “The center 
                        of home and family life,” for us 
                        it’s optional. They ruled against 
                        Mrs. Hoyt nine to zero. 

           INT. MORITZ RESIDENCE - MOTHER’S BEDROOM - DAY

           MORITZ’S MOTHER (89) is frail. She’s teetering at the edge of 
           the bed, balancing herself on a nightstand. She wears a 
           bathrobe and her hair is wet. Moritz is kneeling beside her.
                                 MORITZ
                        And step. 

           She does. And he guides a pair of underwear over her foot. 

                                 MORITZ (CONT’D)
                        And the other. 

           He pulls the underwear up under her robe. Then reaches for 
           the white dress laid across the bed. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Not that. It looks like a doily.

                                 MORITZ
                        Mother. I asked when you picked it 
                        out if you were certain. Remember? 

           The phone on the nightstand RINGS. And his Mother answers 
           before he can cross the room. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Who is this?!

           Moritz takes the phone from her. 

                                 MORITZ
                        Yes, hello?

           INTERCUT:

           INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - RUTH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Narrow. Cramped. Sagging shelves lined with books. 

                                 RUTH
                        Hello? Mr. Moritz?

                                 MORITZ
                        Speaking. 

                                 RUTH
                        Is this Charles Moritz who recently 
                        lost in the Tax Court?

                                 MORITZ
                        What’s this all about? 

                                 RUTH
                        My name is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I’m 
                        a law professor. From New York. I’m 
                        wondering...  
           She hesitates. As two male PROFESSORS walk by, chatting. She 
           reaches out and closes the door.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Moritz, are you planning on 
                        appealing the Tax Court’s decision?

                                 MORITZ
                        I hardly see the point.

                                 RUTH
                        I’d like to urge you to reconsider.

           His Mother begins to sway. And Moritz grabs her around the 
           waist. Helps her to sit on the edge of the bed.

                                 MORITZ
                        What firm did you say you’re with?

                                 RUTH
                        I don’t... I’m not with any firm.

           The bedroom door opens, and CLEETA STEWART (70) enters in a 
           white dress, and a shawl which she drops into a chair. 

                                 CLEETA
                        Good morning Mr. Moritz. GOOD 
                        MORNING MRS. MORITZ. Another long 
                        night, I see.

           Moritz’s gaze welcomes her -- with an air of relief. 

                                 MORITZ
                        Good morning, Miss Stewart. 

                                 RUTH
                        Mr. Moritz? Are you there?

                                 MORITZ
                        Listen young lady. It was made 
                        exceedingly clear I don’t have a 
                        case. Do you expect me to believe 
                        YOU know better than the judge? 

                                 RUTH
                        No. I want-- Hello? Mr. Moritz?

           He’s gone. Slowly... she hangs up the phone. Dejected. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Martin’s looks up incredulously from slicing a braised pork 
           loin. Ruth is watching him - warily.
                                 MARTIN
                        What do you mean you want to go to 
                        Denver? 
                             (yelling toward the hall)
                        Jane! James! Dinner!
                             (back to Ruth)
                        Don’t get me wrong. I’m delighted 
                        by your sudden passion for tax law. 
                        It’s just an awfully long way.

           As he serves the meat onto plates of rice and vegetables.... 

                                 RUTH
                        People think women are privileged. 
                        Because we’re excused from men’s 
                        obligations. But it’s a cage. And 
                        for ten years I’ve just... I’ve 
                        watched, as smart girls run head 
                        first toward the bars. 

           She grabs his arm. And his attention. 

                                 RUTH
                        It will never stop until a federal 
                        judge says women and men must be 
                        treated as equals before the law. 
                        This case could do that.

                                 MARTIN
                        It’s unwinnable. 

           James comes sprinting. As Martin finds Ruth staring him down. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        You asked my opinion.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s not quite that simple. 

           Jane comes sauntering. And they settle into the meal. Martin, 
           looking at Ruth, sighs deeply. Relenting...

                                 MARTIN
                        Jane. You’ll need to pick up your 
                        brother a few days next week. Your 
                        mother’s going to Colorado. 

           Jane rolls her eyes and groans. 

                                 JAMES
                        You are? Why?

                                 MARTIN
                        She’s climbing a mountain. 
                                 JAMES
                        Can I come?!

           Ruth eyes Martin - salting his meat, grinning slyly at James. 
           She has more to say. But isn’t sure how to broach it.

                                 MARTIN
                        Oh, Jane. I heard today that The 
                        Brearley School is hiring your 
                        friend, Mrs. Dubé. 

                                 JANE
                        I wish she came back to our school. 
                        The teacher who replaced her is --

                                 RUTH
                             (swallowing her pride)
                        I need a letter.

           Martin looks to her - questioningly. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Introducing me and the case. 
                        Something to send ahead to Moritz. 

                                 JANE
                        Like a permission slip? 

           Ruth shoots her a glare. But knows she isn’t wrong. 

                                 RUTH
                        From a law firm. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You realize what you’re asking.  

           Embarrassed. Upset. Ruth busies herself cutting James’s meat 
           into bite-size pieces. 

                                 RUTH
                        You’re the youngest partner in the 
                        firm’s history. If you ask --

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you submit a paper to a 
                        law journal?

           Ruth drops her utensils. A flash of anger. Jane watches her 
           mother’s growing tension. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I can’t go to my firm with this, 
                        Kiki. 
                                 RUTH
                        Excuse me.   

           She leaves the table... But turns back. 

                                 RUTH
                        I know I’m a professor. I am well 
                        aware that I may not be up to the 
                        task. But someone has to do this. 
                        And there’s no one else.

           She leaves them. Watching her. LINGER ON: Jane, amazed. Until 
           Martin takes James’s plate. And resumes cutting his meat. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Ruth is at the same small table that served them at Harvard - 
           now shoved into a corner. Before her is a stack of grading. 
           There’s an OPERA on the radio. 

           When Martin enters, she stops working, but doesn’t look up. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I’m trying to help you. Congress 
                        can write whatever taxes they want. 
                        In two centuries, no court has 
                        touched that. 

                                 RUTH
                        When people are treated like their 
                        work has no value... Marty. It 
                        poisons them. Until they’re so 
                        weak, they can’t stand up. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Kiki. The odds of winning this 
                        thing are -- 

                                 RUTH
                             (facing him)
                        When you’ve wanted help, did I ever 
                        dictate what sort you needed? I 
                        gave the help you asked for. 

           She can’t look at him when she says it:

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Even when your odds were less than 
                        five percent. 

           A flash of pain and anger. 
                                 MARTIN
                        I didn’t realize there was a quid 
                        pro quo. 

                                 RUTH
                        Martin Ginsburg. You were the first 
                        boy I met who cared that I had a 
                        brain. But not two minutes ago you 
                        insisted you are HELPING me by 
                        refusing to support me. You’re not 
                        helping. You’re protecting me. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You know whose permission I’d need? 
                        ... Tom Heller. The man’s barely 
                        more evolved than a newt. 

                                 RUTH
                        This appeal’s my chance, finally, 
                        to --

                                 MARTIN
                        Moritz doesn’t want to appeal!

                                 RUTH
                        That’s why I need to go to Denver. 
                        I didn’t... If I could just explain 
                        myself better, he could -- I know 
                        what it is to take care of someone 
                        who’s sick. It is relentless, 
                        taxing, exhausting... hard work. 

           She’s trying to hold herself together. As Martin’s look 
           softens. And he approaches her. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        And the law... it says that when 
                        this MAN does it, it doesn’t count. 
                        Because... it’s a woman’s job. 

           He takes her face in his hands. And kisses her. Gently. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I understand. I really do. 

           She looks up. Believing him. As she rises into his arms, he 
           kisses her again. Then she holds him. Her head on his 
           shoulder for support. 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s poison. ... Marty. It’s nearly 
                        done me in. 
           INT. TOM HELLER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tom Heller looks up from his work. Skeptical. World-weary. 

                                 HELLER
                        For God’s sake, Marty. Your wife’s 
                        on the rag because you’ve got New 
                        York by the balls while she’s 
                        teaching ambulance chasers in 
                        Jersey. 

           Sitting across the desk, Martin could punch him. As Heller 
           gets up and crosses his impressive corner office...

                                 MARTIN
                        I disagree. 

                                 HELLER
                        We have actual PAYING clients who 
                        expect your attention. This is a 
                        waste of your very valuable time. 

           Arriving at a small bar, he pours himself a scotch. 

                                 MARTIN
                        If it’s because you don’t like the 
                        case, I’d prefer you just say it.

                                 HELLER
                        You’re damn right I don’t like it. 
                        When did these girls start taking 
                        to the streets, calling MY wife 
                        SELFISH for dedicating the best 
                        years of her life to our children? 

                                 MARTIN
                        That’s not Ruth’s point. Nor mine. 
                        You and I will never agree on this, 
                        Tom. But I am determined to help.

           Heller looks him over. Resigned. 

                                 HELLER
                        You do this, Marty. But if she 
                        loses, you’ll have blundered our 
                        firm into one of the worst bits of 
                        crackpot activism in a generation. 
                        You really want to risk your career 
                        for that?
           INT. MORITZ’S HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Moritz sits at his desk. Reading a letter under Martin’s 
           letterhead. 

           INSERT: Dear Mr. Moritz, My name is Martin Ginsburg, and I am  
           writing in regard to your recent loss in the Tax Court... 

           Moritz checks the time. And reconsiders the letter.

           EXT. MORITZ RESIDENCE - DAY

           It’s a simple home. Unremarkable, save for the ramp to the 
           front door. Ruth hesitates. Before ringing the doorbell. 

           She waits. Her hand tapping nervously against her thigh. 
           Until the door opens. And the two come face-to-face at last.

                                 RUTH
                        Mr. Moritz. May I come in?

           INT. MORITZ’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The room is out of style. There’s a small television before 
           the fireplace. Settled before it are a wheelchair and a 
           folding table with the remains of a meal.

           Ruth and Moritz sit across from one another in arm chairs. 

                                 RUTH
                        You don’t look like a tax cheat. 

                                 MORITZ
                        I’ve never cheated at anything in 
                        my life.

                                 RUTH
                        That’s not what the tax court -- 

                                 MORITZ
                        The judge was wrong. 

           He gets up. Agitated. Ruth watches him busy himself folding a 
           blanket thrown across the wheelchair.

                                 RUTH
                        No. He wasn’t. 

           He considers her - skeptically.
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        The law is wrong. It says you can’t 
                        claim that deduction because you’re 
                        a man. It’s unjust. 

           She rises. And steps closer. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        But that’s just one example. There 
                        are... I don’t know how many laws 
                        that differentiate between men and 
                        women. For no good reason. 

                                 MORITZ
                        Then there must be other people you 
                        can go to. Why me? 

           As soon as he asks, he understands. He sits. 

                                 MORITZ (CONT’D)
                        Because I’m not a woman. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m betting judges will be able to 
                        see the harm done to you in a way 
                        they never have for female 
                        plaintiffs. If I’m right and you 
                        win, it will give us the legal 
                        framework to challenge laws that 
                        keep women out of jobs and limit 
                        our pay. Laws that say, in effect, 
                        “Men work. Women stay home. And 
                        that is the way things are.”

           Moritz is quiet. Weighing the situation.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Believe it or not, Mr. Moritz. The 
                        women in this country need you to 
                        take a caregiver deduction. 

           He looks up at her. A tired man. 

                                 MORITZ
                        You don’t know what it’s like. It 
                        never stops. It’s exhausting. 

                                 RUTH
                        I know. 

           It’s in his eyes: DO you?
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        My husband. Before that, my mother. 
                        ... Let me help. 

                                 MORITZ
                        What would I have to do exactly?

                                 RUTH
                        Just let me represent you. And, I 
                        don’t mean to pressure you, but I 
                        need you to decide quickly. 

                                 MORITZ
                        Why?

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll need to write a brief stating 
                        our entire argument. We don’t get 
                        much time. 

                                 MORITZ
                        And after that? Then what happens?

                                 RUTH
                        The Government will write a 
                        response brief. Then the Tenth 
                        Circuit Court of Appeals will 
                        schedule oral arguments, where each 
                        side will present its case to the 
                        judges. And they’ll decide how to 
                        interpret the law. 

                                 MORITZ
                        I’ve never done anything like this 
                        before. 

                                 RUTH
                        That’s all right, Mr. Moritz. 
                        Neither have I.

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           A tower rising over Manhattan’s cavernous financial district. 
           Ruth and Kate are specks crossing its busy forecourt.

           INT. ACLU RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           A sign above reception: American Civil Liberties Union. The 
           place is bustling. The elevator slides open, revealing Ruth 
           and Kate.  
           MEL WULF (40), exiting an adjacent CONFERENCE ROOM, notices 
           Ruth. And grins mischievously. He’s handsome, with dark, 
           curly hair and piercing blue eyes. Watching the two women 
           press toward reception, he sneaks behind Ruth. 

                                 MEL
                             (chanting in Ruth’s ear)
                        I'm a little acorn round / lying on 
                        the dusty ground...

           Ruth spins on him - mortified. As Mel jumps into an intricate 
           choreographed combination of stomps, claps and jazz-hands. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Everybody steps on me. / So I'm a 
                        little cracked you see... 

           Kate is stunned. The RECEPTIONIST lowers the phone. Everyone 
           stops. To watch. As Ruth looks away, wishing to disappear.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        I'm a nut / but that's no sin. / At 
                        Camp Che-na-wah I'll fit right in! 

           Arms spread. Breathing heavy. A broad grin. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen! The three-
                        time Camp Che-na-wah twirling 
                        champion: Ruth “Kiki” Bader!

           A smattering of APPLAUSE. As Mel struts toward Ruth, he jokes 
           to a laughing colleague...

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Hey! You think this job’s hard? Try 
                        judging the fifteen-and-unders when 
                        the color-war trophy’s on the line. 
                             (to Ruth)
                        Hi Kiki!

           She holds out the Moritz Advance Sheet to him. 

                                 RUTH
                        Mel. I need your help. 

           INT. ACLU OFFICES - CORRIDOR - LATER

           Ruth follows Mel down a crowded hallway. He’s reading the 
           Advance Sheet as they walk. 
                                 RUTH
                        It’s a civil rights issue. You’re a 
                        civil rights organization. The ACLU 
                        cannot continue to ignore this.

                                 MEL
                        I’ve got student protestors in jail 
                        in California. I’ve got school 
                        districts in Mississippi STILL 
                        refusing to desegregate. I don’t 
                        have the budget to take this on. I 
                        don’t have the manpower. Even if I 
                        did, I doubt anyone here would be 
                        remotely interested in helping you.

           A VOLUNTEER interrupts, handing Mel a document. 

                                 VOLUNTEER
                        Mr. Wulf. You wanted to see this. 

           He scans it, without breaking stride. 

                                 MEL

                        at the schoolhouse gate. 

           He hands it back.

                        Mel. With the ACLU on the brief, 
                        there’s no way the court treats 
                        this appeal as just another tax 
                        case. You have to help. 

           They stop before his office door - “Melvin Wulf / Legal

                        anything. 

           He opens the door. But neither moves.

                        After you.

           Mel closes the door behind them. Then relaxes into his chair, 
           feet up on the desk. Ruth sits across from him.

           Kate rises as Ruth enters from the back in a huff.

                                 KATE
                        How’d it go?

           Ruth passes her. And presses the elevator button. Repeatedly.

                        Professor? You know that continuing 
                        to push the button doesn’t bring 
                        the elevator any faster. 

           DING! The ELEVATOR opens. And they enter. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth hits ‘L’ and the doors slide shut. 

                                 RUTH
                        A complete waste of time.

                                 KATE
                        Okay. All right... So. We do it

                        I appreciate the faith, Kate. But 
                        we need an expert to advise us.

                        There’s just not that many people 
                        who do this sort of thing. Where 
                        are we going to find someone who --

           It hits her. She smiles. Kate eyes her expectantly. 

                                 RUTH
                        Someone who’s done this before.
           EXT. LOWER WEST SIDE - SIDEWALK - DAY

           A SHOP OWNER pulls a graffiti-covered grate before his store. 
           Cast iron facades. Pot-holed streets. Dumpsters overflowing. 
           And against a gray sky, the Twin Towers are being built.

           In her heels and up-town coat, Ruth is out of place. Holding 
           a piece of paper, she searches for an address. Beside her, 
           Kate hugs a denim jacket tighter against the drizzling rain. 

           A pair of CON-ED WORKERS give them a lascivious whistle. 

                                 CON-ED WORKER
                        Lookin’ good, honey. I can warm you 
                        up... if you’re gettin’ wet. 

           Ruth ignores them. But Kate turns back

                                 KATE
                        Real nice! You kiss your mother 
                        with that mouth?

           The men laugh. As she turns and catches up to Ruth. And they 
           come to a derelict building with an empty storefront. 

           They share a wary look. Step over a drunk, passed out on the 
           sidewalk. And enter...

           INT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           As they come to the second floor, Ruth grabs Kate’s wrist, 
           holding her back. Watching - awestruck.

           DOROTHY KENYON (82) is locking a door marked “Attorney” in 
           peeling paint. She’s slender, with a white bob beneath a 
           broad-rimmed, floppy hat. But her eyes are vivacious; they 
           can flash from humor to fiery passion without blinking. 

           Door locked, she turns. And finds them. 

                                 KENYON
                        You ladies look lost. 

           Ruth watches her - a long beat. 

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        Well? State your business. I don’t 
                        have all day. 

                                 RUTH
                        Ms. Kenyon. We’re here to see you. 
                        It’s about Gwendolyn Hoyt. 
                                 KENYON
                        Ah. In that case I have no interest 
                        in talking to either one of you.  

           She shoves the keys into her large bag. As she blows by them, 
           onto the stairs. Ruth and Kate follow. 

                                 RUTH
                        We’re arguing a case... Sex-
                        discrimination violates the equal 
                        protection principle.

           Kenyon doesn’t slow down as she descends the stairs.

                                 KENYON
                        ‘Equal Protection’ was coined to 
                        grant equality to the negro -- a 
                        task at which it has dismally 
                        failed. What makes you think women 
                        would fare any better?

                                 RUTH
                        Please. We need guidance. 

           At the bottom of the stairs, she turns on them. 

                                 KENYON
                        Then here’s my advice. Tell your 
                        client she won’t find equality in a 
                        courtroom. 

           EXT. LOWER WEST SIDE - SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Exiting, Kenyon opens an umbrella as she steps nonchalantly 
           over the Drunk. Ruth and Kate follow. Uncovered. 

                                 RUTH
                        The client’s name is Charles 
                        Moritz.

           Kenyon stops. Turning back. Impressed. But it fades.   

                                 KENYON
                        That’s cute. Your theory is what? 
                        The court will be sympathetic 
                        because they all have prostates?  

                                 RUTH
                        Feeling anything would be a start. 
                        He was denied a caregiver deduction 
                        on his taxes. We’re arguing the law 
                        is discriminatory.
           Kenyon drops her head. A weary warrior. 

                                 KENYON
                        You want to change the country? 

           She indicates Kate, who is taken by surprise. 

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        You should look to her generation. 
                        They’re demanding change. Like we 
                        did when we fought for the vote. 

           Kenyon resumes walking. Letting Ruth and Kate tag along.

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        Our mistake was we thought we won. 
                        We got off the street and went to 
                        the courts. Started asking please. 
                        As if civil rights were sweets to 
                        be handed out by judges. 

                                 RUTH
                        Protests are important. They mean 
                        nothing, if the law doesn’t change. 
                        As a lawyer, you must believe that. 

           She dismisses them with a wave of her hand. 

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        Go... Go argue your case. You can 
                        learn the hard way, like the rest 
                        of us did. 

                                 KATE
                        Professor. We should go. 

                                 RUTH
                        No. I’ll argue my case, and I’ll 
                        win. Because someone has to teach 
                        the courts to see that the law is 
                        unfair. 

                                 KENYON
                        And then what? If you win and the 
                        Court declares the caregiver 
                        deduction unconstitutional, 
                        overturns the law? What do you 
                        imagine will come of that?

                                 KATE
                        It would change everything!
                                 KENYON
                        Ha! Don’t tell me this is your star 
                        pupil.

           Kate pouts. As Kenyon slows to a stop before a decrepit 
           facade - crumbling, plywood on the windows. 

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        How many husbands do you imagine 
                        would let their wives work outside 
                        the home, if the cost of a sitter 
                        could no longer be deducted on 
                        their taxes? All those women would 
                        go back to the kitchen. And then 
                        what have you accomplished? 

                                 RUTH
                        I wouldn’t ask the Court to 
                        overturn the law. That wouldn’t 
                        help my client; it would just hurt 
                        others. But the court can extend 
                        the law to include Charlie.

                                 KENYON
                        So you want judges writing 
                        legislation now.

                                 RUTH
                        Levy v. Louisiana. The Supreme 
                        Court did it two years ago. 

           Kenyon’s clearly impressed.

                                 KENYON
                        So they did... Still that was 
                        children. 

                                 RUTH
                        Last June. Welsh v United States. 
                        Justice Harlan said laws could be 
                        extended when doing so would be 
                        closer to the legislature’s intent 
                        than overturning them would be. 

           She and Kenyon watch one another for an extended beat. 

                                 KENYON
                        What did you say your name was?

                                 RUTH
                        Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
                                 KENYON 
                        Well, Professor Ginsburg... The 
                        country isn’t ready. Change minds, 
                        before you change the law. Now if 
                        you’ll excuse me, a developer is 
                        kicking thirty families out of a 
                        building he abandoned ten years 
                        ago. 

           Turning, she tugs an unhinged door, making enough room to 
           squeeze under the lock and chain. And disappears inside. 
           Leaving Ruth and Kate - disappointed, in the rain.

                                 KATE
                        I know she's your personal hero and 
                        all. But she's kind of a bitch. 

           She looks away. And spies a BAR across the street. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon professor. I’ll buy you a 
                        drink. 

           INT. LOWER WEST SIDE - BAR - LATER

           Drenched. Unhappy. Ruth and Kate enter. As they claim stools 
           at the bar...

                                 RUTH
                        Imagine. Dorothy Kenyon went to 
                        college and law school at a time 
                        when women couldn’t even be...

           She looks around. Searching for an example. And notices the 
           BARTENDER - a woman in her 30s.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        ...bartenders. She worked on behalf 
                        of women and minorities and the 
                        poor, before it was fashionable. 
                        And what did she get for her 
                        efforts? Dragged before Joseph 
                        McCarthy, called a communist. She 
                        stood toe-to-toe with that man and 
                        said, “Senator. You are an 
                        unmitigated liar.” And know what? 
                        He blinked first. The charges were 
                        dropped. 

           Kate’s duly impressed.
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        How could she have done all that 
                        without being... tough?

           The Bartender approaches. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        What’ll you ladies have?

                                 KATE
                        A whiskey sour. 

           Ruth is lost in thought.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Your friend all right?

           Outside the THUNDER cracks and the RAIN picks up. Ruth turns 
           toward the window. Considering the weather.

           EXT. LOWER WEST SIDE - BAR - LATER

           It’s pouring and getting dark when Ruth and Kate exit. Kate 
           hails a passing cab. Which comes to a stop down the block. 

           She jogs uncovered through the rain toward the waiting taxi. 
           Opens the door. Then notices: Ruth hasn’t moved. 

                                 KATE
                        Professor?

           She watches Ruth, considering the Bartender through a window. 

                                 KATE
                             (to the TAXI DRIVER)
                        Hold on. 

           She jogs back to Ruth. As she looks up into the pelting rain. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Professor Ginsburg. You’re getting 
                        drenched.

           Ruth begins to laugh. When she looks to Kate, she’s smiling. 
           Kate can’t imagine why.  

                                 RUTH
                        A Court ought NOT be affected by 
                        the weather of the day, but will be 
                        by the climate of the era. 

           Kate looks at to her - questioningly. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Professor Freund at Harvard said 
                        that. When I graduated, I couldn’t 
                        practice law. But you will. And 
                        you’ll be brilliant. 

                                 KATE
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 RUTH
                        Women have been arguing for 
                        equality the same way forever. 
                        Fighting some precedents, using 
                        others. The same cases, over and 
                        over. And every time, they lose. We 
                        need to show that all those old 
                        precedents no longer apply. 

                                 KATE
                        Because of the climate of the era. 

                                 RUTH
                        Kate. I don’t know if I can do 
                        this...

                                 KATE
                        But you’re going to try. Aren’t 
                        you?

           Off Ruth: grinning. 

           MONTAGE (NEW & STOCK FOOTAGE):

           A) Women toss their bras, heels and girdles into the ‘Freedom 
           Trash Can’ at the Miss America protests. (note: despite the 
           myth - no one ever burned a bra.)

           B) Ruth and Jane take the artwork off her LIVING ROOM wall. 
           In the empty space, Ruth tacks up an old Tampa Times clipping 
           -- “MRS. HOYT TESTIFIES SHE WAS SCORNED”. In the photo, 
           Gwendolyn Hoyt (50) is cuffed, being lead into a courthouse.

           C) A Women’s Strike for Equality march. Amid the diverse 
           array of young women: Dorothy Kenyon chanting.

           D) Ruth is scribbling notes on an index card. She goes to the 
           wall - now filled with index cards and mimeographed pages. 
           Tacks her card amongst them. (INSERT: “Significant changes in 
           societal attitudes.”)

           E) Shirley Chisholm is sworn into Congress.

           F) Ruth reading in the RUTGERS LAW LIBRARY. Alone. Around 
           her, male students and faculty work in groups.
           G) Jane and James enter the apartment - carrying groceries. 
           Jane lingers to watch. Jealously. As Kate leans close to 
           Ruth, pointing out a section of a text. Around them, stacks 
           of books and papers are growing. 

           H) Ruth in line at the DRY CLEANER, jotting notes on the back 
           of the slip. (INSERT: “Unalterable biological traits.”)

           I) Jane with FRIENDS at the MOVIES. On screen: The Graduate. 
           (“Mrs. Robinson. You’re trying to seduce me.”)

           J) Ruth typing at breakneck speed. (INSERT: “Shackled by 
           biases...”) Behind her, the wall is papered with notes, 
           pages, photos. Surrounding her are books and papers in 
           tenuous towers. On the desk beside her is a stack of stained 
           and scribbled-on pages. 

           Jane enters from the hall. Her homework in hand. She stops. 
           Watches Ruth. And, resigned, turns back. 

           INT. ACLU OFFICES - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Mel is hurrying down the hallway, chatting with a LAWYER. 

                                 MEL
                        Either the campus called the city 
                        for backup and the provost is 
                        culpable, or the arresting officer 
                        was outside his jurisdiction. They 
                        can’t have it both ways. 

           He slows down outside his OFFICE DOOR.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Call the local affiliate. See if 
                        you can get a straight answer. 

           He opens his door.

                                 KENYON (O.S.)
                        Melvin! Didn’t your mother ever 
                        teach you to clean your room?

           INT. MEL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           She’s sitting behind his desk. Reading an Idaho newspaper. 
           Mel, surprised, enters and closes the door.  

                                 MEL
                        Ms. Kenyon. Is it time for your 
                        annual dusting-off already?
           Kenyon laughs. As she folds her newspaper...

                                 KENYON
                        In 1776, Abigail Adams wrote John 
                        Adams a letter during the 
                        Continental Congress. As your 
                        writing this new constitution, she 
                        said, “Don’t forget the ladies.” 
                        You know what that bastard went 
                        ahead and did?

                                 MEL
                        I can guess.

           She slams the paper down, oriented toward him. Headline: 
           State Court Finds For Cecil Reed.

                                 KENYON
                        These poor people. Sally and Cecil 
                        Reed. Divorced. Their teenage son 
                        is dead. Both parents want to 
                        administer his estate. In Idaho the 
                        law says that in this situation, 
                        males must be preferred to females. 
                        Wait ‘til you hear the rationale. 
                        Men are better at math. 

           She taps the newspaper article with her finger.

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        The Idaho Supreme Court just said 
                        that is perfectly legal. 

           With some effort, she gets up. 

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        He forgot the ladies, Mel. And it’s 
                        time the ACLU got back in the 
                        fight. I want you to get into this 
                        Reed v Reed. 

                                 MEL
                        Is this a personal favor or an 
                        official directive from a member of 
                        the board?

                                 KENYON
                        It’s whichever motivates you more. 

                                 MEL
                        I’ll put together a team to look 
                        into it.

           She pats him on the cheek - grandmotherly. 
                                 KENYON
                        Good boy. 

           Then opens the door to leave. 

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        And Mel. 

           She turns back. He’s already picked up the newspaper. 

                                 KENYON (CONT’D)
                        On this team of yours. Get Ruth 
                        Bader Ginsburg. 

           INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - RUTH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ruth is at her desk. Grading. Until someone KNOCKS.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes... Yes?

           MILLICENT (30, sultry), Ruth’s receptionist, opens the door. 

                                 MILLICENT
                        Excuse me, Professor. Do you have a 
                        moment?

                                 RUTH
                        Millicent. Sure. What is it?

           Millicent displays two stacks of paper. In one hand: a messy 
           pile of scribbled-over text. In the other: neat, typed pages. 

                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                        It’s just... I’m typing this brief. 
                        And jumping out all over the place 
                        is, well... Sex-sex-sex-sex-sex-
                        sex. It reeks of hormones, short 
                        skirts, zippers -- 

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. Yes. I understand.

                                 MILLICENT 
                        For the men who read this... Maybe 
                        you should use a less distracting 
                        word. ... Like gender?

           It dawns on Ruth... 

                                 RUTH
                        You’re absolutely right. Yes. But 
                        you realize that means --
           Millicent is ecstatic. 

                                 MILLICENT
                        No problem. I’m happy to retype it. 
                        It’s worth it.

           She turns - and is startled. As Mel appears in the doorway.

                                 MEL
                        I’m sorry. There was no one...

           He points vaguely toward the Reception Desk behind him. 

                                 RUTH
                        Mel? Is there something I can do 
                        for you?

                                 MEL
                        Hi Ruth. I was... curious to hear 
                        how your case is going. 

           Ruth eyes him skeptically.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Is there someplace we can go, and 
                        you can catch me up?

           EXT. RUTGERS CAMPUS - DAY

           A bright, late autumn day. Ruth and Mel are walking. 

                                 MEL
                        I get it. I do. We have pre-
                        schools. And washing machines. 
                        Cheap contraceptives. Times have 
                        changed and more women than ever 
                        are working. But then can’t you say 
                        the law is serving us well?

                                 RUTH
                        No! It’s fallen behind. And it’s 
                        trying to pull us back with it. 
                        That’s the argument. 

                                 MEL
                        So you’re not using the previous 
                        case law. You’re challenging it. 

           It’s clear on his face: he’s impressed. He stops and turns to 
           her. To Ruth’s surprise. 
                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Would the argument work as well if 
                        the client were a woman?

                                 RUTH
                        Man or woman, the law still uses 
                        sex as shorthand for ability. 

                                 MEL
                        Sex as shorthand. Hmm...

           From his coat pocket, Mel pulls out Kenyon’s Idaho newspaper.

                                 MEL
                        Here. Read. 

           INT. DINER - DAY

           They’re in a booth. Coffee mugs. A half-eaten piece of pie in 
           front of Mel. Ruth looks up from the newspaper. To mock him.

                                 RUTH
                        You’re not interested in sex-bias 
                        claims. You don’t have the budget. 
                        You don’t have the time.

                                 MEL
                        And I still say I’d rather be a 
                        woman in America than a black man. 
                        Or a socialist. Or a religious 
                        minority. 
                             (indicating the newspaper)
                        Kiki, we both know the Reed 
                        decision makes you more angry than 
                        I ever could. So let’s cut the 
                        crap.

           She measures him up. Then drops the newspaper. Giving in. 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s a good idea.

                                 MEL
                        What’s that? 

                                 RUTH
                        Now that I’ve done the work... You 
                        want a man AND woman before the 
                        courts -- both harmed by a gender 
                        stereotype presumed in the law. 
                                 MEL
                        Oh, I want much more than that. ... 
                        If you lose in the Tenth Circuit 
                        Court, what will you do?

                                 RUTH
                        Appeal to the Supreme Court. 

                                 MEL
                        Of course you will. And so will the 
                        Government if they lose. They can’t 
                        let a century of precedent just 
                        fall away. What I want is Charles 
                        Moritz’s case and Sally Reed’s case 
                        to both be argued before the 
                        Supreme Court... in the same term. 

           Ruth envisions it. And grows excited. 

                                 RUTH
                        Moritz and Reed... argued just 
                        weeks apart. 

           Mel leans in close. A salesman. 

                                 MEL
                        Imagine the impact. The Justices in 
                        conference, talking about both 
                        cases at the same time. Your cases. 

                                 RUTH
                        Mine?

                                 MEL
                        Who else’s? Your arguments are the 
                        backbone of this strategy. 

                                 RUTH
                        Me? In front of the Supreme Court?

           Mel leans back. Breaking eye contact. But Ruth is on a roll. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        It could end legal sex 
                        discrimination. ... You really 
                        think we can pull this off? 

                                 MEL
                        The timing will take some luck. We 
                        need the Supreme Court to wait to 
                        hear Reed and for the Tenth Circuit 
                        to move quickly on Moritz. But, yes 
                        -- we can pull it off. How close 
                        are you to finishing your brief?
                                 RUTH
                        I could mail it tomorrow. 

                                 MEL
                        I’ll want to review it first. 

           She considers him, warily. Mel grins. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the ACLU. I 
                        don’t see who could stop us.

           EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) - DAY

           An imposing, limestone facade. Over the entry: “Justice is 
           founded in the rights bestowed by nature upon man.”

                                 BOZARTH (O.S.)
                        Trust me. I’m a lawyer and I’m 
                        telling you, it’s illegal...

           INT. DOJ - TAX DIVISION - BOZARTH’S CUBICLE - DAY

           JIM BOZARTH (26) is gawky in his ill fitting suit. His 
           cubicle is uncluttered: a photo of his wife, his law degree - 
           University of Texas, 1970. 

           Laid-back, relaxed. Bozarth’s on the phone. He speaks with a 
           pronounced Texas twang. Full of airy, likeable, college-boy 
           confidence.

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        ...No. There had to be seven 
                        players on the line of scrimmage 
                        for at least one count before the 
                        snap. Or the formation’s illegal. 

           GLADYS (55) appears, pushing a file cart. A reliable cog in 
           the engine of government. 

                                 GLADYS
                        Bozarth. You finished a case today.

                                 BOZARTH
                        Aw shoot. Honey. Honey. I gotta go. 
                        ... Yeah. ... You too. Bye. 

           He hangs up. As Gladys passes him a brief. And a clipboard.

                                 GLADYS
                        Sign for your next brief. 
           INSERT: Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals / Charles Moritz v 
           Commissioner of Internal Revenue / Authors - Ruth Bader 
           Ginsburg; Martin Ginsburg; Melvin Wulf, Legal Director, ACLU.

           Bozarth, impressed by the cover, lets out a long whistle. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Know 
                        who I am, Gladys?

                                 GLADYS
                        Sure do. You’re the kid who’s going 
                        to sign my form. 

           She presses the clipboard on him. And he signs with a grin.

                                 BOZARTH
                        I’m a guy moving up in the world. 

                                 GLADYS
                        I’ll say I knew you when. 

           As she moves on, Bozarth settles in and opens the brief. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        Howdy, Mr. Moritz. And what can 
                        your Uncle Sam do for you today?

           INT. DOJ - TAX DIVISION OFFICES - LATER

           Bozarth warily considers a closed OFFICE DOOR on the far side 
           of the room - “Special Attorney” etched on its window pane. 
           Then goes the other way. Approaching another cubicle.

           He peers over the edge. HENRY (29) looks up from his work. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        Henry, young man. Ever see this? 

           He tosses the Moritz brief on the desk. 

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        That brief is a constitutional 
                        challenge to the Tax Code. 

                                 HENRY
                        Can you do that? What are the 
                        grounds?

                                 BOZARTH
                        There’s the best part. Gender 
                        discrimination. 
           He watches Henry flip through the pages. And get interested.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t know, Jim. ACLU. Maybe you 
                        should run this past the professor. 

           Bozarth looks back once more toward that closed office door.

                                 BOZARTH
                        Yeah. I was afraid you’d say that.

           INT. DOJ - BROWN’S OFFICE - LATER

           The room is utilitarian. Straight lines and right angles. 
           With an orderly and organized charm that’s inviting. 

           (Professor) Brown is 65 now. Dignified. Finished to a high 
           polish. He’s at his desk reading the brief. Bozarth watches. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        These folks are runnin’ at Hell 
                        with a bucket of water. Where in 
                        the world did they go to law 
                        school?

           Brown closes the brief. And picks up his phone. Calmly.

                                 BROWN
                        May I have the Solicitor General’s 
                        office, please? 

           That shuts Bozarth up.  

                                 BROWN (CONT’D)
                        This is Brown. Is he in? ... I need 
                        to see him. 
                             (to Bozarth)
                        It’s Bozarth, isn’t it?

                                 BOZARTH
                        Uh... yessir. 

                                 BROWN
                        Are you married, Mr. Bozarth?

                                 BOZARTH
                        Yes. I am. 

                                 BROWN
                        You should buy flowers. You’re 
                        going to be home late.
                             (back into the phone)
                        All right. We’re on our way. 
           EXT. RANDALL’S ISLAND ATHLETIC FIELDS - DAY

           The CRACK of a bat and ball. Jane’s Softball Team, in 
           Hallsworth navy and white, makes a double play. 

           In the bleachers, James goes nuts for his sister. Beside him, 
           Martin, clapping, leans toward Ruth - lost in thought. 

           From the outfield, Jane notices them talking. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You can’t coddle them forever. 
                        Eventually they go into the world. 
                        Nothing you can do but trust you’ve 
                        given them the best of yourself.

                                 RUTH
                        She’s only fifteen, Martin. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I was referring to your brief.

           Caught. 

                                 RUTH
                        What if no one else sees the case 
                        the way I do? What if, to the 
                        government and the judges, it’s 
                        just about taxes?

           Sympathetically, Martin puts an arm around her. As the inning 
           ends, and the GIRLS (14-16) jog past them to the dugout. 

                                 JANE
                        Mom! Did you see my run?!

                                 RUTH
                        Hmm. Yes dear. Very impressive. 

           Jane gives her a dirty look. 

                                 JANE
                        Mom. I’m glad you’re supporting 
                        girls and everything. But why don’t 
                        you start with the ones right in 
                        front of your face?
                             (off Ruth’s confusion)
                        I didn’t even get on base.   

           Ruth watches her rejoin the team. A flash of regret. 
           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - DAY

           Bozarth and Brown walk with (Dean) Erwin Griswold (67 now) - 
           the Capitol Dome behind them. Griswold closes Ruth’s brief. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Ten years I fought to bring women 
                        to Harvard Law. This is the thanks 
                        I get. Gender equality as a civil 
                        right. Who’s writing our response 
                        brief?

           Bozarth leans in. Eager to please. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        That would be me, sir. James 
                        Bozarth. 

           Griswold seems skeptical.

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Very well. Let’s be clear: Moritz 
                        is a patsy. This appeal is using 
                        the courts to propel a cultural 
                        revolution.

                                 BOZARTH
                        Ain’t no one’s more scared of a 
                        revolution than a judge. 

           Griswold stops. Facing him. Measuring him up. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Exactly. And they’re looking to us 
                        for a reason to crush it. 

           Bozarth’s relieved as Griswold resumes their walk. Turning 
           right - the Washington Monument coming into view behind them. 

                                 GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
                        Professor Brown. I want you to 
                        gather as many people as you need 
                        to read the U.S. Code of Laws. 

           Brown gives him a confused look.

                                 GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
                        All of it.

                                 BROWN
                        Why in the world...
                                 GRISWOLD
                        A revolution, Brown! This case 
                        threatens to cast a cloud of 
                        unconstitutionality over EVERY 
                        federal law that differentiates 
                        between men and women. So I want 
                        you to cite each and every one of 
                        them in your brief. You’re going to 
                        show the judges the consequences of 
                        their decision. ... Gentlemen. This 
                        is where I take my leave of you.

           They’ve arrived in front of the WHITE HOUSE. Griswold passes 
           ID to a GUARD in the booth. Who calls ahead. 

                                 BROWN
                        Erwin. To read the entire US Code 
                        in time to file, we’d need to pull 
                        staff from other divisions. They’d 
                        have to work around the clock. The 
                        Justice Department will be doing 
                        nothing but this.

           Bozarth considers this. As Griswold weighs his options.  

                                 BOZARTH
                        Not necessarily. 

           They both look back at him. Expectantly. 

           EXT. THE PENTAGON - DAY

           Sprawling. It dwarfs the Washington Monument in the distance.

           INT. THE PENTAGON - DAY

           A hundred reels of magnetic tape spinning. Glowing switches 
           CLACK. And the whole room HUMS. As a keypunch operator 
           (female, 22) hands a box of stacked punch cards to one of a 
           dozen dark-tied technicians. 

           Through plate glass, Brown and Bozarth watch from a hallway. 
           Amazed by the scale of it all. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        The DOD computer is so powerful it 
                        can find all the relevant laws in 
                        just a matter of days.
                                 BROWN
                        Without any human being actually 
                        reading them? What a terrifying age 
                        we live in. 

           EXT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DAY

           Ruth exits her Chevy Impala. A stuffed satchel hanging off 
           her shoulder. Carrying a pile of books, folders and papers. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DAY

           Ruth manages to enter her door. Ignoring the light switch, 
           she kicks off her heels. And goes to the DINING ROOM. 

           She approaches the table. Lifts the pile to place it atop. 

           But it all falls out of her arms. Books and papers crash and 
           flutter to the ground. An exasperated sigh.

           But as she picks up the papers, she finds a manila envelope. 
           Return address: Department of Justice, Washington D.C. 

           She drops everything. And tears it open. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - LATER

           The front door is shut. The apartment has grown darker. 

                                 JANE (FROM THE HALL)
                        Yeah, it’s true!

                                 JAMES (FROM THE HALL)
                        No, it isn’t! I don’t believe you.

           The door opens, revealing Martin, Jane and James. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I spent long, grueling hours 
                        posing. And now my own son won’t 
                        believe me? Would I lie? 

                                 JAMES
                        Mo-om!

           Martin turns on the lights. Sees the shoes on the floor. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Honey?
           They find her in the Dining Room. Sitting on the floor, 
           surrounded by her spilled papers. Reading the brief. 

                                 JAMES
                        Mommy. Is the sculpture on top of 
                        city hall of Daddy?

                                 MARTIN
                        Kiki. What is it?

           She looks up at him. 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s the Government’s brief. Look 
                        who’s listed as co-author.

           She passes it to him. And his perpetual smile fades. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Griswold must have recruited him to 
                        the DOJ. How does it look?

                                 RUTH
                        Like it’s time to get to work. 

           Martin understands. And eyes her supportively. But so does 
           Jane. She looks away - resigned. Here we go again. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Jane. Do you want to help? 

           INT. MEL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ruth, Kate, Jane and two other FEMALE STUDENTS sit around a 
           table. The brief is open to “Appendix E” on the desk. Each 
           has a volume, looking from the Appendix to her book, 
           searching for the corresponding page. 

           Kate shows Jane...

                                 KATE
                             (checking the volume)
                        You have Title Ten of the U.S. 
                        Code. According to the government 
                        brief, here’s all the laws in Title 
                        Ten that discriminate on the basis 
                        of sex. These are the section 
                        numbers. Next to them, the 
                        paragraphs. 

           She opens Jane’s book. 
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You find the section. You find the 
                        paragraph. And...

           She hands the book to Jane. Who reads.

                                 JANE
                        Huh. Did you know there’s a law 
                        that women aren’t allowed to pilot 
                        military cargo planes?

           Mel enters. And is caught off guard.  

                                 MEL 
                        What the hell is this?

                                 RUTH
                        Mel. Make yourself at home.

           He’s not amused. Ruth takes the brief from Kate. Shows him.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        At the end of the government’s 
                        brief, they added an Appendix. 

           She shows him ‘Appendix E’ - a list, pages and pages long.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        It’s every federal law that 
                        discriminates on the basis of sex. 

           Amazed, Mel takes it from her. Flipping through the pages. 

                                 MEL
                        How in the world did they... 

           He looks at her. Suddenly nervous. Then glances at the 
           Students and Jane working. He puts it together. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        You're not going to read every law.

           That is precisely what she means to do.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        This is window dressing. It's a 
                        prop to scare the judges. 

                                 RUTH
                        Maybe that’s the intent. But we can 
                        use it. It’s ammunition.  
                                 MEL
                        Ammunition? Your case is hard 
                        enough. The last thing you need to 
                        do is go into court and argue over 
                        laws that AREN'T at issue.

                                 RUTH
                        The more I know-

                                 MEL
                        You KNOW enough! Your focus now 
                        should be on practicing a hundred 
                        different ways to explain it. 

           Ruth looks down. Humbled. Her Students avert their eyes. 
           Embarrassed for their teacher. 

           Only Jane watches. Stunned. Distressed. She’s never seen her 
           mother spoken down to. Can’t imagine that Ruth would take it. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        We need to set up a moot court. 

                                 RUTH
                        I know how to answer questions. 

                                 MEL
                        We're not talking about eager young 
                        minds. These are federal judges. 
                        Old curmudgeons with wives at 
                        home... baking briskets. And you’re 
                        going to call them oppressors. I’d 
                        say you should practice. 

           He watches Ruth. Who’s still formulating a response. 

                                 JANE
                        You braise a brisket. You don't 
                        bake it.

           Mel gives her a look. Another Ginsburg heard from. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m not making a request. I am 
                        telling you for your own good. 
                        Practice your arguments. We are 
                        going to hold a mock trial. 

           He leaves. Ruth, Jane and the Students stare after him. 

           EXT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DAY

           Pouring rain outside. 
           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DAY

           In the BEDROOM, Martin holds up his tattered bathrobe. Ruth 
           is before the mirror, clasping on a necklace.

                                 MARTIN
                        What’s wrong with it? Does it 
                        smell?

           He smells it. And is satisfied. 

                                 RUTH
                        Marty. Absolutely not. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Oh you’re no fun. A judge needs a 
                        robe. Even a moot court judge. I 
                        bet you he’ll wear it.

                                 RUTH
                        Gerald Gunther is a man of towering 
                        intellect. 

           Rolling his eyes playfully, he walks away - down the HALL. 
           And she follows. Frustrated, but enjoying the game. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        He has been a mentor and a friend.  

           They enter the LIVING ROOM. It’s been transformed into a 
           rough facsimile of a courtroom. James is diligently drawing 
           at the coffee table. Jane is setting up a dictionary lectern 
           as the lawyers’ podium

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        He helped me get my job for 
                        heaven’s sake. You’re not making 
                        him wear your cruddy old bathrobe.

           Martin stops before the dining room table, moved into the 
           space to serve as a judges’ bench. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You’re right. I don’t know what I 
                        was thinking. 
                             (she’s relieved)
                        An apron would be funnier. 

           As he heads toward the kitchen, Jane and James approach Ruth.

                                 JANE
                        Mom. Can we be on the jury? We 
                        promise to be quiet and we’ll take 
                        it totally serious.
                                 RUTH
                        There is no jury. In federal 
                        appeals court there’s no jury, no 
                        witnesses, no evidence. Each side 
                        gets thirty minutes to present 
                        their case to the judges. And 
                        that’s it. 

           She lays her hands upon the lectern - like a lawyer.  

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You only get one shot. 

           The DOORBELL rings. She looks to Jane and smiles. Then heads 
           to the FRONT HALL. 

           She opens the door to GERALD GUNTHER (44). He’s genial, with 
           graying hair - thick around his ears, giving way to a bald 
           crown. He wears a collared shirt and gray sweater. 

           Ruth is delighted to see him. They embrace.

                                 RUTH
                        Gerry. Jane. You remember my 
                        professor. Gerald Gunther. 

           He speaks with a vaguely European accent. 

                                 GUNTHER
                             (to Jane)
                        A woman already.

           Jane smiles. As he follows them back into the LIVING ROOM...

                                 JANE
                        What do you think of our courtroom?

                                 GUNTHER
                        Look at this. All it’s missing is 
                        Justice holding her scales. Tell 
                        me, who did Mel find to be the 
                        third judge? 

                                 RUTH
                        Pauli Murray. 

           He’s impressed. As Ruth takes his coat.

                                 GUNTHER
                        He’s not making it easy for you.

                        Who’s Pauli Murray? 
                                 GUNTHER
                        Don’t they teach anything at your 
                        school?! Pauli is a GREAT lawyer!

           Martin enters from the direction of the kitchen, wielding a 
           meat tenderizer. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Gerry. I come bearing your gavel! 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Beneath a drawing (by James) of Justice, the moot-court 
           judges sit behind the dining room table. 

           Gerry, wearing Martin’s robe, bang-bang-bangs his meat 
           tenderizer gavel. 

           Mel is to his left. 

           And to Gerry’s right is PAULI MURRAY (61) - a petite, black 
           woman with short hair in tight curls and round glasses. Her 
           grin extenuated by joyous laugh lines. 

           Martin watches from the couch. Beside him, Kate takes notes. 

                                 GUNTHER
                        Counsel for the appellant, you may 
                        proceed. Again. 

           Ruth, at the lectern, is already frazzled.

                        Why isn’t it rational, professor 
                        Ginsburg? Men go out. Women stay 
                        home. That’s the way of things for 
                        thousands of years.

                        of race and gender.

           She slams her podium. Kate looks up from her note-taking. As 
           they all fall silent. Ruth realizes she’s blown it. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        This is ridiculous. I know the

                                 MEL
                        No! Your wasting time and you’re 
                        scaring the judges.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m answering your questions.

                                 MEL
                        Don’t! What do my questions have to 
                        do with your client? Don’t give me 
                        an excuse to fear the changes this 
                        decision could bring about. 

                                 GUNTHER
                        Mel. I think she understands.

                                 MEL
                        She better. Because I was baiting 
                        her. 
                             (to Ruth)
                        And you walked right into the trap. 

                                 RUTH
                        So what would you have said? 
                                 MEL
                        Not that!

           She continues to stare down. Frustrated. Angry.  

                                 MARTIN
                        You evade. 

           He rises. He’s gentle. Supportive. Like an excellent teacher. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never considered the question, 
                        your honor. Because my client isn’t 
                        a fireman. 

           Mel looks up. That’s not bad. Martin steps closer to Ruth. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Or you refocus. All due respect, 
                        Judge. This case isn’t about 
                        firemen; it’s about tax payers. And 
                        there’s nothing inherently 
                        masculine about paying taxes. 

           He reaches her. And she allows room as he takes her spot at 
           the lectern - demonstrating. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Or crack a joke. Your honor, no one 
                        who’s raised children would be 
                        intimidated by a burning building. 
                        Then lead them back to your case. 

           Ruth looks to Martin: Thank you. 

                                 MEL
                        Martin... You should handle oral 
                        arguments. 

           It lands like a grenade. Ruth is demolished. Martin looks to 
           her. And begins backing away from the podium. 

                                 MARTIN
                        No. No way. I was just... Ruth is 
                        the expert in gender law.  

                                 GUNTHER
                        At least half this case is tax. 
                        This is your expertise. 

                                 MEL
                        And you have the courtroom 
                        experience. The most important 
                        thing is that Charles Moritz wins. 
                                 MARTIN
                        I said no. Drop it Mel. 

                                 PAULI
                        They could split the time. 

           They all look to her. 

                                 PAULI (CONT’D)
                        Martin will go first. He’ll focus 
                        the argument on taxes. Then Ruth 
                        steps in to talk about gender.

           Her tone is so even. Her solution, so reasonable. Her affect, 
           so definitive. It’s clear they agree. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - LATER

           The ‘Judges’ are getting ready to leave. As Ruth chats with 
           Gunther and Pauli, Martin sidles up to Mel. Quietly. Angrily.  

                                 MARTIN
                        There is NO aspect of the law at 
                        which Ruth Bader Ginsburg can be 
                        bested. I don’t know how things 
                        work at the ACLU. But if anyone at 
                        my firm couldn’t see that, he’d be 
                        fired. 

                                 MEL
                        Objection noted, counselor. She’s 
                        still arguing half. 

           He stops putting on his coat. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        She’s written a revolutionary 
                        argument. Know what the young women 
                        at my office call it? The 
                        Grandmother Brief. They know it’s 
                        the start of something important. 
                        Even I can see that. But writing a 
                        brief and presenting oral arguments 
                        are very different skill sets. 

           He resumes buttoning his coat. As Martin looks him over.

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I want you do to something 
                        for me. If things are going badly 
                        in court, Ruth can stop her 
                        argument. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        She can reserve time for rebuttal. 
                        Think of it as an escape hatch. 

                                 MARTIN
                        That’s not going to happen. 

                                 MEL
                        Okay. But if it does. If it comes 
                        down to a rebuttal. You take over. 

           Mel turns away - suddenly cheerful. 

                                 MEL
                        Well, I think this was a very 
                        productive exercise. I have to get 
                        to a fund raiser. Pauli. Gerry. Are 
                        you headed downtown?

                                 GUNTHER
                        Yes. After you. 

           He lets Pauli go first.

                                 PAULI
                        Goodbye, Martin. 

                                 GUNTHER
                        So long. 

           But Martin pays them no mind. They leave. Closing the door 
           behind them. Slowly, he turns to Ruth. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Kiki. 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s fine. They’re right. You’re 
                        more experienced.

           But she’s clearly disappointed. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Only because I had the opportunity 
                        to gain experience. 

                                 RUTH
                        No. You’re a charming man. Always 
                        have been. Besides, it’s not like 
                        it’s the Supreme Court. Yet. For 
                        now... you’ll do a good job of 
                        warming up the judges for me.

                                 BOZARTH
                        This is Judge Fred Daugherty.

           Bozarth stands before the image. A team of six DOJ Lawyers in 
           suits - all men, including Henry - around his end of the 
           table. Griswold and Brown are their audience. 

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        He’s a Mason. His wife Betsy is a 
                        homemaker. 

                                 BROWN
                             (to Griswold)
                        Homemaker wife bodes well.

           A WOMAN is running the projector. At the mention of Betsy, 
           she changes slides: a newspaper clipping announcing their 
           marriage - December 15, 1965. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        He was nominated to the bench in-

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Cut to the chase. Will he respond 
                        to our position that Martin 
                        Ginsburg and his wife are radicals 
                        agitating for change? 

           A new image of Daugherty appears on the screen. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        He was a brigadier general. Like 
                        any military man the idea of an 
                        agitator will make his skin crawl. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Excellent. Moving on. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        Ehem. Yessir. 

           The Projectionist skips ahead several slides. To a friendly-
           looking man. 48. Soft-featured with a broad smile. 

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        Will Holloway. Wife worked until 
                        they were married. Two children, 
                        including --
                                 GRISWOLD
                        Yes. Yes. What do you say, Ernie, 
                        are we on the right track here? 

                                 BROWN
                        Absolutely. We’ll drive the point 
                        that the Ginsburgs are USING the 
                        court to engineer social change. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Yes. That change is what this case 
                        is really about. Children coming 
                        home to empty houses, unsupervised, 
                        doing God-knows-what. Divorce rates 
                        skyrocketing. Men losing jobs to 
                        women who can work for less, not 
                        being able to support their 
                        families. Let the other side bicker 
                        about the Equal Protection 
                        Principle.

                                 BOZARTH
                        That may not be a winning strategy.

           Bozarth watches them all turn to eye him. A nervous beat.

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        I’ve read all of Judge Holloway’s 
                        opinions. He’s diligent about 
                        following lawyers through the case 
                        law. Scaring him won’t change that.

           He’s got Griswold’s attention. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Go on. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        And then there’s William Doyle. 

           He nods to the projectionist. Again, she skips ahead. To a 
           thin man, 60, with round glasses and a shock of white hair.

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        This here’s the man who issued the 
                        ruling that desegregated Denver. 
                        They called him an agitator. And 
                        radical. Someone threw a homemade 
                        bomb at his house. 

           Brown lifts an eyebrow.
                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        Even after his wife left, he didn’t 
                        quit. This isn’t a man who will be 
                        persuaded by labels.

           A SECRETARY (30) enters. And passes a note to Griswold.  

                                 GRISWOLD
                        So what do you suggest?

           He opens the note. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        We still call the Ginsburgs 
                        radical. But also we praise the 
                        courts. For the work they’ve 
                        already done for equality. Argue 
                        this appeal is undermining --

           Rising, Griswold crumples the note and tosses it to Brown.

                                 GRISWOLD
                        These judges are the least of our 
                        problems now.

           And he’s gone. 

           Brown un-crumples the note. Conscious of being watched. And 
           reads it. Releasing a long, distressed breath.

           Martin watches a golf tournament. James is adding sound

           is bouncing. 

           As the television cuts to a REPORTER in front of the U.S. 
           SUPREME COURT. 

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        It’s a case that may change the 
                        role of women under the law.

           Martin and Ruth clasp hands. 

                                 REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        The Supreme Court today confirmed 
                        they will hear the appeal to an 
                        Idaho Court ruling in Reed v Reed.

                        The dispute is between Sally and 
                        Cecil Reed, a divorced couple. When 
                        their son committed suicide, both 
                        parents asked to administer the 
                        estate. The law specifies that 
                        preference must go to the father. A 
                        law which the American Civil 
                        Liberties Union, championing 
                        women’s equality, calls 
                        unconstitutional. 

           Mel appears on screen at a PRESS CONFERENCE outside the ACLU.

                                 MARTIN
                        Did he call you?

           Seeing the fury and confusion in her eyes, he has his answer.

                        We’ll show that laws like this use 
                        sex as shorthand for ability. And 
                        that that limits the freedom of 
                        both men and women. I’d like to 
                        introduce the lawyer who will make 
                        that argument, Allen Derr.

           Ruth lets go of Martin’s hand. 

           INT. MEL WULF’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mel is on the phone when the door flies open. Ruth storms in. 

                                 RUTH
                        Allen Derr?!

                                 MEL
                        I’m going to have to call you back. 
                        ... Looking forward to it. Goodbye. 

           His smiles drops as he hangs up the phone. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s the Supreme Court, Mel. Did 
                        you think I wouldn’t hear about it?

           She’s pacing the room - righteous indignation. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        First you took half of Moritz away. 
                        Telling everyone I’m not “man 
                        enough” for the job. And I didn’t 
                        complain. Hell, I practically 
                        helped you. 

                                 MEL
                        Nobody took away -- 

                                 RUTH
                        “Two cases at the same time. Moritz 
                        and Reed.” You said they’d be my 
                        arguments. 

                                 MEL
                        I’ve had about enough of this 
                        display.

           She stalks closer. Anger - and desperation - boiling over.

                                 RUTH 
                        The Supreme Court will hear Reed v 
                        Reed before the 10th Circuit Court 
                        has even issued an opinion. And 
                        you’re going with Allen Derr? The 
                        man has no experience before 
                        federal judges!

           Mel rises. Meeting her eye-to-eye. 

                                 MEL
                        When I gave you this opportunity --

                                 RUTH
                        Oh you gave it to me?

                                 MEL
                        Yes in fact I did. Damn it Ruth, 
                        get your emotions in check. 

                                 RUTH
                        You first. 

           They stay that way. Eye-to-eye. Face-to-face. Seething. 

                                 MEL
                        I said it would be your argument.  
                        But I never promised you would be 
                        the one who makes it in court. You 
                        assumed that. 

           He falls back into his chair. 
                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        No. Allen Derr does not have the 
                        experience. In fact, I doubt he’s 
                        up to this. By the way, the same 
                        could be said of you. Would you sit 
                        down?

           She does. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        The whole thing’s ass-backwards. 
                        It’s at least partially your fault. 
                             (off Ruth’s look)
                        Until you came along with this 
                        Moritz character, the ACLU wasn’t 
                        worried about gender rights. You 
                        convinced us to take a look at the 
                        woman issue in the first place. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’d say you’ve got a woman issue. 

           He gives her a look. And she drops the defensive sarcasm. 

                                 MEL
                        We hoped we’d get lucky with the 
                        timing. We didn’t. Now Allen Derr’s 
                        going before the Supreme Court -- 

                                 RUTH
                        Do you even know what he’s going to 
                        say? 

                                 MEL
                        That’s why we have you.  

           He reaches into his drawer, pulling out a small pile of 
           documents. 

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        These are the briefs Derr filed in 
                        the Idaho Courts. I know you’re 
                        busy with your case. But I need you 
                        to help him write a brief worthy of 
                        the U.S. Supreme Court. 

           As he tosses them across the desk toward her...

                                 RUTH
                        Ha! I’m sure you do. 

                                 MEL
                        He’s been Sally Reed’s lawyer for 
                        three years, Kiki. 
           She gets up. Leaving the documents.  

                                 MEL (CONT’D)
                        I will say one thing for him. The 
                        man does give a shit about this. 

           She sighs. And picks up the briefs. 

                                 RUTH
                        How long ago did you know that he 
                        was going to argue Reed?

                                 MEL
                        He insisted. It was the only way 
                        he’d work with us. 

                                 RUTH
                        How long?

           He looks her bluntly in the eye. 

                                 MEL
                        Since the beginning.  

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Martin is talking on the phone. From another room, a VIOLIN 
           scratches out painful notes. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I will. ... Yes. It’s nice to hear 
                        your voice. ... Goodbye. 

           He hangs up. Considers his conversation. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           His work is laid out on the table: a stack of papers, a pad 
           and pen. Martin sits before it, writing notes in the margin 
           of a contract. 

           He hears the FRONT DOOR open and close. Then Ruth rummaging 
           in the KITCHEN cabinets. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Martin enters. Finding Ruth before an open cabinet.
                                 RUTH
                        It’s a wonder you can find anything 
                        in this kitchen. 

                                 MARTIN
                        How did it --

                                 RUTH
                        Apparently I’m the only one who 
                        thinks I’m ready for the Supreme 
                        Court.

                                 MARTIN
                        Kiki. I need to tell you something. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh Marty. Can’t it wait?

                                 MARTIN
                        No. 

           She stops to look at him. 

                                 RUTH
                        So tell me. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Ernie Brown called. The 
                        Government’s offered to settle 
                        Charlie’s tax debt for a dollar. 

           Her face falls. She can see where this is going.

                                 RUTH
                        They’re killing our case. Of course 
                        they are. The issue’s taken on new 
                        importance. They’re not going to 
                        risk arguing it twice.

           She looks like she could break something. But she takes a 
           deep breath. Soldiering on. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Couple hours ago I was preparing to 
                        argue a pair of landmark cases. Now 
                        one’s dead. I don’t get to argue 
                        the other. 

           She shows him the Reed briefs, dropped on the counter.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        And all I’m doing is helping write 
                        a brief...
           She reflects on this turn of events. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        And I’ve been running around 
                        claiming times have changed. ... 
                        What is that sound?!

                                 MARTIN
                        Hmm? Oh. James has been harassing 
                        me for months for violin lessons. I 
                        gave in. 

           One more thing out of her control. It’s all too much. She 
           passes Martin. And he watches her go. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Ruth. Brown’s expecting you in D.C. 
                        on Monday. To sign the statement 
                        they’ll present to the Court.

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll call Charlie. He may as well 
                        take the offer. 

           It’s on his face as she leaves. Martin knows she’s given up. 

           INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruth comes upon James. Standing seriously before a music 
           stand. Torturing his instrument. 

                                 RUTH
                        That sounds wonderful. May I 
                        listen?

                                 JAMES
                        No. I’m practicing. 

                                 RUTH
                        I know. I just want to --

                                 JAMES
                        I’m practicing!

                                 RUTH
                        ...Okay. 

           She considers the photograph of her mother on the shelf.  

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Then why don’t you practice in your 
                        room, dear? Mommy needs to work. 
           With a groan, he stomps out of the room with his books, stand 
           and instrument. 

           Turning away from her mother, she crosses the room to the 
           index cards still tacked to the wall. And begins taking them 
           down. One by one. Piling them on the coffee table.  

           Down the hall, James’s VIOLIN - muffled - begins again. Ruth 
           smiles to herself. As Jane enters, carrying a stapled stack 
           of papers.

                                 JANE
                        Whoever’s idea it was to give that 
                        kid an instrument has a sick sense 
                        of humor. 

                                 RUTH
                        Is that your homework?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah. Daddy already checked it. I’m 
                        just showing him I made the 
                        changes.

                                 RUTH
                        Still. I could --

                                 JANE
                        Mom. I can only rewrite a paper so 
                        many times.

           Ruth gives up on it. 

                                 RUTH
                        ... So how are you?

                                 JANE
                        What do you mean? ... Is everything 
                        okay? 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s fine, honey. 

           She turns back to the wall. Resumes taking down the cases. 

                                 JANE
                        Dad told me about the Supreme 
                        Court. Why’s Mr. Wulf being such a 
                        douche bag? 

           Ruth looks back at her. Displeased with the language. Though 
           she can’t help but chuckle.  
                                 RUTH
                        He says he has no choice. ... Maybe 
                        it’s for the best. I don’t know. 

                                 JANE
                        If you say so. 

           Ruth offers a poor attempt at a smile. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        So do you want help taking apart 
                        your life’s work or is that 
                        something you’d rather do alone?

           Ruth glances back at the wall. At the books still piled in 
           the room. And at her daughter, waiting for an answer. 

                                 RUTH
                        I know that this work... that I 
                        disrupted our lives. I’m sorry if 
                        it ever seemed...

                                 JANE
                        Mom. I get it. Who was all this 
                        for, if not for me?

           She hugs Jane. As she does...

                                 RUTH
                        Anyway. It’s over now. I better 
                        make a call. 

           Jane nods. And moves to leave. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to go, Jane. You can 
                        stay. If you want. 

           It’s clear in Ruth’s look that she needs Jane there. Jane 
           stays, as Ruth picks up the phone and dials from memory...

                                 RUTH
                        Charlie. It’s Ruth. I have some 
                        news. 

           INTERCUT:

           INT. MORITZ’S HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Moritz cradles the phone to his ear with his shoulder. He’s 
           carrying a stack of textbooks to a half-filled crate - 
           packing for a sales trip. 
                                 MORITZ
                        I don’t understand. What does this 
                        mean?

                                 RUTH
                        Your tax bill has been reduced to a 
                        dollar.  

                                 MORITZ
                        So you did it. We won. Ruth! 
                        Congratulations!

           But Ruth’s mood is unchanged. Jane watches compassionately.

                                 RUTH
                        You can keep your two-hundred and 
                        thirty-six dollars. 

                                 MORITZ
                        This is amazing! And they’ll say 
                        it, right? That I’m not a cheater. 
                        That the law is unfair. 

                                 RUTH
                        No, Charlie. That’s the point. They 
                        don’t want to... They will never 
                        say that. A judge has to. We can 
                        still go to court. ... In the end, 
                        you may walk away with nothing. 

                                 MORITZ
                        But if they don’t say it, Ruth... 
                        how have I gotten justice?

           A realization dawns on Ruth. This is about more than just a 
           cause. It’s also about her client. 

           She glances at Jane, who can see that something has changed. 

                                 RUTH
                        You haven’t.  

                                 MORITZ (O.S.)
                        You’re my lawyer. What do you think 
                        I should do?

           Off Ruth: with a decision to make. 

           EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUILDING - DAY

           A throng of WOMEN march down D street. Through a chasm of 
           vitriol. MEN - on both flanks - shouting heinously. Ugly. 
           Bitch. Slut. Whore. Get back to your kitchens. 
           But they march on. The women CHANT, CHEER, BLOW WHISTLES. 
           Together. Their placards depict the logo of the National 
           Organization for Women. They demand “Equality Now!”

           Ruth is trying to cross against the current. Hugging a 
           briefcase to her chest. 

           At last she makes it to the steel barricade before the 
           Department of Justice. Where a POLICE OFFICER (40) snarls. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Keep movin’ honey. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not part of... I have an 
                        appointment.

           INT. DOJ - BROWN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Brown opens the door to Ruth. He takes her hand. Warmly. 

                                 BROWN
                        Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Hello Professor Brown. 

                                 BROWN
                        You’re not a student anymore. It’s 
                        Ernie. Come in. Come in. How’s 
                        little Jane?

           He offers her a seat and takes his behind the desk. 

                                 RUTH
                        Not so little. And we have another. 
                        James. 

                                 BROWN
                        They must keep you busy. 

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. Both of us. 

           Bozarth enters cautiously. And Ruth rises. They shake hands. 

                                 BROWN
                        Ah. Ruth Ginsburg, may I introduce 
                        James Bozarth. Ruth was always my 
                        most thoroughly prepared student. 
                             (they resume their seats)
                        So much to prove. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BROWN (CONT'D)
                        These days the girls are as 
                        hopeless as the men.
                        You spoke to your client?

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. He IS interested in accepting 
                        your offer. 

                                 BROWN
                        Excellent. Excellent. We have the 
                        paperwork all ready. 

                                 RUTH
                        There are, however, conditions. 

                                 BROWN
                        Conditions...? Fine. Fine.

                                 RUTH
                        First of all. He’d like you to 
                        forgive a hundred percent of the 
                        money. None of this one dollar 
                        business. 

                                 BROWN
                        Ha. Well... I’m sure we can find a 
                        way to arrange that. 

                                 RUTH
                        And he’d like the government to 
                        concede, and to enter into the 
                        court record, that he didn’t cheat 
                        on his taxes -- because Section 214 
                        discriminates on the basis of sex. 
                        And is therefore unconstitutional. 

           Brown and Bozarth’s smiles drop.

                                 BROWN
                        I can’t do that. And you know it.  

           She’s already rising to go. 

                                 RUTH
                        In that case. Mr. Bozarth. Ernie. 
                        I’ll see you in court. 

           INT. DOJ - TAX DIVISION OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

           The elevator door slides open. Revealing Griswold. As he 
           steps out, Ruth passes him. A self-satisfied smile. 
                                 RUTH
                        Hello, Dean Griswold. 

           He does a double-take as she gets in the elevator. And the 
           doors close. Griswold looks back to Brown and Bozarth, in 
           Brown’s office doorway. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        I know her. Don’t I?

                                 BROWN
                        That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        THAT’S Ginsburg? I remember her!

                                 BOZARTH
                        She just turned down our offer. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        When Nixon hears we failed to... 
                        We’re all going to end up on one of 
                        his damn lists. 

           He weighs the consequences. But a thought sweeps across his 
           face - a flash of a grin. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        She turned down... Not the husband. 
                        Is SHE arguing in court? 

           It comes spontaneously. A deep belly laugh. 

                                 GRISWOLD
                        Oh, Mr. Bozarth. You’re going to 
                        have fun! 

           EXT. THE BROWN PALACE - DAY

           A grand, brownstone hotel - a wedge between two of Denver’s 
           broad boulevards. 

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM / HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Concealer, lipstick, mascara in a pile on the counter. Ruth 
           applies blush - a forced smile. The smile fades.

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK on the BATHROOM door. 

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Justice delayed is justice denied.
           The final touch: she puts on the same gold pin that’s in her 
           mother’s photograph. Then opens the bathroom door. 

           For the first time since we’ve met him, Martin is in a suit. 
           Ruth is prim and beautiful in a skirt-suit and heels. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Mel’s out front. Are you ready?

           Her whole body’s clenched. He’s sympathetic. 

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey. You did it. You’re here. You 
                        don’t have to worry about whether 
                        they’ll listen to you. They HAVE to 
                        listen. You’re ready.

           EXT. 10TH CIRCUIT COURTHOUSE - FRONT STEPS - DAY

           A neoclassical facade. Columns three stories high. Mel parks 
           a rented Dodge in front. He, Ruth, Martin and Kate all unpack 
           themselves from the car. Ruth looks up at the building.

           As a black town car pulls up. And another. DOJ Lawyers step 
           out. With Bozarth and Brown.

           Brown spies Martin and approaches.

                                 MARTIN
                        Professor Brown. 

           He clasps Martin by the hand. Another hand on his shoulder. 
           And eyes Ruth, still staring up at the building. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Oh. She’s... getting in the zone. 

                                 BROWN
                        Ah. I see. 

           She isn’t. He doesn’t.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Ruth, Martin, Kate and Mel enter between gray, marble 
           pillars. A chandelier casts the JUDGE’S BENCH in warm light. 
           Over it, a clock and an adage: Reason is the Soul of All Law. 

           A small CROWD loiters amidst the pews IN THE GALLERY. From 
           among them, Moritz approaches.
                                 RUTH
                        Charlie. 

                                 MORITZ
                        Good morning.
                             (to Mel)
                        Mr. Ginsburg? 

                                 MEL
                        Uh... Um. No. 

           Kate chuckles.

                                 MARTIN
                        Mr. Moritz. It’s nice to finally 
                        meet you. 

           They shake. Moritz looks warily toward Bozarth and Brown, 
           huddled with the other DOJ Lawyers at THE APPELLEE’S TABLE. 

                                 MORITZ
                        Who are all those people?

                                 KATE
                        Your tax dollars at work. 

           The Court Clerk puffs his chest.  

                                 COURT CLERK
                        All rise. The United States Court 
                        of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is 
                        now in session. Judges Doyle, 
                        Holloway, and Daugherty presiding. 

           Martin and Ruth find their place at the APPELLANT’S TABLE. 

           As the Judges enter from behind the velvet curtain beyond THE 
           JUDGES’ BENCH. Each takes a seat behind his name plate. 

           In THE GALLERY, Mel and Kate flank Moritz. Kate reminds him 
           to remain standing. 

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        Be seated. 

           Martin and Ruth share a glance as they sit. At THE APPELLEE’S 
           TABLE across the aisle, Brown catches Bozarth eyeing them. 

                                 BROWN
                        You have two centuries of case law 
                        on your side. Just do your job.  

           Holloway flips through a couple papers on his desk.
                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        The first case is docket number 71-
                        1127. Charles Moritz v Commissioner 
                        of Internal Revenue. Each side will 
                        have 30 minutes to present. When 
                        two minutes remain, the Court Clerk 
                        will rise to give warning. When 
                        your time is up, he will sit.

           He looks over at Martin and Ruth, seated together before him. 

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        Counsel for the appellant, you may 
                        proceed. 

           Martin and Ruth look to one another supportively. And it 
           begins. Martin takes his place AT THE LECTERN, checking the 
           time on the clock overhead. 9:00 AM. 

           IN THE GALLERY, Moritz sits taller. Smiles nervously to Kate. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Martin Ginsburg for the appellant. 
                        May it please the court. We’re 
                        going to demonstrate that Section 
                        214 of the tax code discriminates 
                        against our client -- Charles 
                        Moritz -- because he is a man. 

           FROM THE BENCH the Judges settle in. Interested. And engaged. 

           INT. COURTROOM - 9:13 AM

           ON THE BENCH, Judge Holloway remains polite. Thoughtful.

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        Congress assumed that a caregiver 
                        is most likely a woman. Is that so 
                        unreasonable?

                                 MARTIN
                        If the law said ALL caregivers can 
                        claim a deduction. And in the back 
                        of their minds the authors thought, 
                        well, this will only apply to 
                        women, THAT would be an assumption. 
                        But they did more than that, Judge. 
                        They explicitly listed WHO counts 
                        as a caregiver. And in doing so, 
                        they left out Mr. Moritz. 
                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        As is their prerogative, Mr. 
                        Ginsburg!

           He leans forward on his elbows.

                                 JUDGE DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        The fact remains. Congress has the 
                        constitutional authority to write 
                        whatever tax law they want. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I doubt you’d turn a blind eye if 
                        the code said that only WHITE 
                        caregivers -- 

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        That’s hardly the same thing.

           Martin checks the clock. 9:14:40

                                 MARTIN
                        Respectfully we disagree. But I’ll 
                        turn it over to my co-counsel to 
                        address the constitutional --  

           Ruth begins to get up.

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        You’re telling us that race and 
                        gender are the same?

           Ruth is stuck, mid-rise. Watching Doyle.

                                 JUDGE DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t remember reading about ship-
                        loads of women forced across the 
                        ocean to work plantations in my 
                        history books.

                                 MARTIN
                        Your honor, my co-counsel -- 

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        Yes. Yes. We’ll get to her in a 
                        minute. I want an answer to my 
                        question.

           Ruth sinks back into her seat. And Martin is caught looking 
           back and forth between her and Doyle. She urges him on with 
           her eyes: Get out of there. 
                                 JUDGE DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        In order for a law to discriminate, 
                        it must distinguish between groups 
                        arbitrarily. Is that correct?

                                 MARTIN
                        Again. Your Honor. My wife --

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        MISTER Ginsburg. I have asked YOU.

           Martin looks to Ruth. An apology. He has no choice...

                                 MARTIN
                        It must be arbitrary. Yes. And this 
                        law is. Mr. Moritz is a man who has 
                        never been married. That may 
                        suggest he is less likely to have 
                        child-care responsibilities. But 
                        not parent-care responsibilities. 
                        Had he been a woman --

           Judge Daugherty cocks a skeptical eyebrow. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        And to your mind, classifications 
                        of this sort must always be 
                        discriminatory. 

           AT APPELLEE’S TABLE, Brown leans close to Bozarth.

                                 BROWN
                        There’s some help. He’s asking him 
                        to make a broad categorical claim. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I can’t speak to always, Judge 
                        Daugherty. We can only speak of 
                        this man. In this case. 

           IN THE GALLERY, Mel lets out a breath. Martin nailed it.

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        Very well. 

           He takes a note on the brief before him. As Martin moves away 
           from the LECTERN. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY (CONT’D)
                        Then speak of him. 

           The COURTROOM chuckles. Especially Brown. In the ruckus, 
           Martin turns to check on Ruth. She’s staring at her notes.
                                 MARTIN
                        Again. The distinction between Mr. 
                        Moritz and other caregivers is, in 
                        Judge Doyle’s words, arbitrary. 
                             (hurriedly)
                        I concede the remainder of the time 
                        to my co-counsel. 

           Ruth looks up. Realizing she’s on. As Martin gathers his 
           papers and flees the LECTERN. 

           As he passes, he eyes Ruth: What could I do? Martin sits at 
           the APPELLANT’S TABLE. As Ruth approaches the lectern. 

           FROM THE BENCH, the Judges eye her skeptically. 

           She adjusts the microphone down. To Doyle’s amusement. 

                                 RUTH
                        Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the 
                        appellant. Your Honors. 

           She watches them. Looking down on her. And falls silent. She 
           cannot see Martin urging her on with his eyes. 

           IN THE GALLERY, Mel sits forward. Nervous. Moritz notices. 

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        Whenever you’re ready, Mrs. 
                        Ginsburg.

                                 RUTH
                        ... May it please the court. 
                        Section 214 denies Mr. Moritz a 
                        caregiver tax deduction available 
                        to similarly situated women who --

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY 
                        Yes. Yes. We’ve been through all 
                        that. Mrs. Ginsburg. You are aware 
                        that the government has three co-
                        equal branches?

           She watches. Expecting him to continue. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Ginsburg?

           It dawns on her. He actually expects an answer. 

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. Of course, Judge. 
                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        And that it is the Congress’s role 
                        to write law. 

                                 RUTH
                        Your Honor. I understand how 
                        government works. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        Well sometimes a law -- even a good 
                        law, even a law that is legal under 
                        the constitution -- may not be good 
                        for every individual it affects. 

           Judge Holloway scratches his head thoughtfully. 

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        I have a question. If I understand 
                        correctly, you’re concerned about 
                        men and women being pigeon-holed 
                        into certain roles based on gender. 

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. That’s correct. Because --

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        Excuse me. That wasn’t my question. 
                             (Ruth grimaces)
                        It strikes me that the caregiver 
                        deduction does the opposite. It 
                        helps women be able to work outside 
                        the home. Isn’t that a good thing?

                                 RUTH
                        Not for Mr. Moritz. The law assumes 
                        it must be the woman who is at home 
                        in the first place.

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        That’s the case in every family I 
                        know.

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        So it’s the assumption that’s the 
                        problem?

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        Then when CAN a law differentiate 
                        on the basis of sex? Never?

           Ruth stares up at Daugherty for a beat. Catching up. 

           IN THE GALLERY, Moritz glances down at Kate’s knee - bouncing 
           nervously. Then back at Ruth.
                                 RUTH
                        When the classification is 
                        rationally related to the law. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        Keeping women out of combat, for 
                        example. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not sure whether I agree with 
                        that example, but --

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        So you think women belong on the 
                        front lines now, too?

           IN THE GALLERY, Mel closes his eyes. Exasperated. 

                                 RUTH
                        No. That’s not what we’re here 
                        to... I didn’t mean to say that.

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        Then what DID you mean, Mrs. 
                        Ginsburg?

                                 RUTH
                        I merely meant...

           Ruth takes a deep breath. Composing herself. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                             (suddenly rehearsed)
                        Gender. Like Race. Is a biological, 
                        unalterable trait. 

           Judges Doyle and Daugherty share an exasperated look. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        There is nothing that women are 
                        inherently better at than men. Nor 
                        vice versa. 

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        Growing a beard. 

           The GALLERY laughs. And Doyle appreciates the attention. As 
           Ruth grows visually frustrated.

                                 RUTH
                        That isn’t -- 

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        Lactation.
           More laughter. AT THE APPELLEE’S TABLE Brown and Bozarth 
           share a satisfied grin. 

                                 RUTH
                             (bursting)
                        No thinking person can possibly 
                        believe Charles Moritz’s gender 
                        relates to his ability to --

           Her hand strikes the microphone. And it SQUEALS. Leaving the 
           courtroom dauntingly quiet in the wake of her outburst. 

           IN THE GALLERY, Mel drops his head. Defeated. 

           AT THE APPELLANT’S TABLE, even Martin looks away. 

           Ruth knows she’s blown it. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        Why can’t we? Mrs. Ginsburg?

           Staring at the floor, she doesn’t answer. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY (CONT’D)
                        In most households, aren’t women 
                        the primary caregivers? Aren’t men 
                        the breadwinners? ... Aren’t they?

           She readjusts the microphone.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes, Your Honor. 

                                 JUDGE DAUGHERTY
                        Then doesn’t the evidence seem to 
                        suggest that it’s the natural order 
                        of things?

           She looks to Martin. Who watches her with deep and tender 
           sadness in his eyes. 

                                 RUTH
                        Respectfully. Your Honors. I’d like 
                        to reserve the remainder of my time 
                        for rebuttal. 

           Slowly. She gathers her papers. And returns to the 
           APPELLANT’S TABLE. Daugherty tosses up his arms. 

           As Ruth sits, Martin leans toward her. 

                                 MARTIN
                             (whispering)
                        It’s not over yet. 
           IN THE GALLERY, Moritz turns to Mel. 

                                 MORITZ
                        I don’t think I followed all that. 
                        How are we doing?

           Mel eyes him askance. Are you serious? He mimes an explosion. 

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        Counsel for the appellee. You may 
                        proceed. 

           Brown nods supportively. Bozarth steps to the LECTERN. 9:27.

                                 BOZARTH
                        James Bozarth for the government, 
                        y’honor. 

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        Ah. Bozarth. The master of 
                        citations!

                                 BOZARTH
                        That’s what my family calls me too, 
                        Judge.

           Doyle chuckles. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        May it please the court. Congress 
                        created this tax deduction to help 
                        caregivers go out and work. 
                        Caregivers. Folks that, if they 
                        weren’t working, would be home. 

           Martin focuses his attention on Ruth. Eyes her steadily. As 
           she stares ahead. Maintaining her composure. 

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        Does anyone believe that this 
                        deduction is the only thing keeping 
                        this MAN from staying home?

           IN THE GALLERY, Moritz listens intently. One thing about him: 
           he could be any man.  

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        Let’s say he did stay home. Are we 
                        meant to believe that he would have 
                        the skills or the... caregiver’s 
                        instinct to do the job? 
           Martin - calmly, quietly - takes Ruth’s notes from before her 
           on the table. She watches them slide away. A flash of relief. 
           As Martin begins to review them. Preparing for rebuttal.

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        The Government will show that 
                        though Congress chose not to cover 
                        never-married men in Section 214, 
                        Mr. Moritz has not suffered as a 
                        result. 

           INT. COURTROOM - 9:53

           STILL AT THE LECTERN, Bozarth is winding down. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        Y’honors, I’m certain there isn’t a 
                        man amongst us who wouldn’t try to 
                        ease his wife’s burdens.

           AT THE APPELLANT’S TABLE, Martin is working on Ruth’s notes. 
           Drawing arrows, jotting down reminders. 

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        So I don’t see how we can judge 
                        negatively the members of Congress 
                        who would do the same. And I’m not 
                        alone in that. There is a long and 
                        honorable tradition in the Courts 
                        of supporting laws like this one.

           The Court Clerk rises. 9:54.

           IN THE GALLERY, it’s clear on Mel’s face: the damage is done.  

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        I for one would rather see my 
                        government err on the side of 
                        caring TOO much, of trying TOO hard 
                        to help the ladies of this country. 
                        Rather than be indifferent to their 
                        unique burdens. Now maybe Mr. 
                        Moritz disagrees. Or maybe he 
                        simply doesn’t like paying taxes.

           IN THE GALLERY, Moritz looks small. And defeated. 

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        Personally, I don’t believe that.

           AT THE LECTERN, Bozarth knows he has the Judges’ attention.
                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        I believe Charles Moritz is a 
                        victim. Not of his government. But 
                        of lawyers who used his case to 
                        achieve their own ends... 

           Ruth looks up at him - finding him staring at her.  

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        Radical. Social. Change. 

           He lets it sink in. Lets his head nod for emphasis. 

                                 BOZARTH (CONT’D)
                        It is respectfully submitted. 

           9:55. The Clerk is still standing. 

           An awed silence follows him. Ruth watches as he takes his 
           seat at the APPELLEE’S TABLE. Brown pats him on the back. 

           AT THE APPELLANT’S TABLE, Martin jots a last note to himself. 
           As Ruth watches Bozarth and Brown. Her mind reeling.

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        Counsel for the appellant. You have 
                        four minutes for rebuttal.

           Ruth looks up toward the BENCH. And sees where the Judges are 
           looking: all eyes are on Martin. He rises. 

           She looks across the aisle. At the APPELLEE’S TABLE, like 
           he’s still her professor, like she’s still some presumptuous 
           student - Brown stares at her over the frames of his glasses. 

           And she looks back into the GALLERY. Where Mel rocks gently 
           with nervous energy. 

           Ruth grabs Martin’s arm. He looks down at her. An enduring 
           glance, as she tightens her grip and pulls him back down. 

           IN THE GALLERY, Mel notices Martin and Ruth. He catches 
           Martin’s eye. And his stare says it: “YOU take this.” 

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
                        Counsel for the appellant?

                                 MARTIN
                        Kiki.

                                 RUTH
                        I am Charlie Moritz’s lawyer.

           Martin considers her... And settles back into his chair. 
           Leaving her notes behind, Ruth approaches to THE LECTERN. The 
           Judges share a look. 

                                 RUTH
                        Radical social change. 

           She chuckles at the idea of it. And looks up to the Judges. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Where I went to law school... there 
                        was no women’s bathroom. 

           A murmur of LAUGHTER from the gallery. ON THE BENCH, Doyle 
           appears skeptical.  

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        It’s amazing to me now, but we 
                        never complained. Not because we 
                        were timid. We were just astounded 
                        that we were in law school at all. 

           AT THE APPELLEE’S TABLE, Bozarth turns away dismissively - 
           toward Brown. Surprised to find him listening intently. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        A hundred years ago, Myra Bradwell 
                        wanted to be a lawyer. She had 
                        fulfilled the requirements for the 
                        Illinois bar, but wasn’t allowed to 
                        practice because she was a woman. 
                        An injustice she asked the Supreme 
                        Court to correct. Illinois was so 
                        confident of victory, they didn’t 
                        even send a lawyer to argue their 
                        side.

           IN THE GALLERY, Mel leans forward. This is a different Ruth. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        And they were right. She lost. That 
                        was the first time someone went to 
                        court to challenge his or her 
                        proscribed gender role. A hundred 
                        years ago. Radical social change?  

           She clutches the lectern. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Sixty-five years ago. When women in 
                        Oregon wanted to work overtime, and 
                        make more money, as men could. The 
                        Court looked to the precedent in 
                        Bradwell. And said no. And then 
                        there were two precedents. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Then three. Then four. And on. And 
                        on. You can draw a direct line from 
                        Myra Bradwell to Gwendolyn Hoyt - 
                        told ten years ago SHE was not 
                        entitled to a jury of HER peers.   

           She looks the Judges directly - and vehemently - in the eyes.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        THAT is the legacy the Government 
                        asks you to uphold today. You are 
                        being urged to protect the culture 
                        and traditions and morality of an 
                        America that no longer exists. 

           For Judge Holloway, it’s a sobering thought. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        A generation ago, my students would 
                        have been arrested for indecency 
                        wearing the clothes that they do. 

           THE GALLERY laughs. Including Kate and Moritz, side-by-side. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Sixty-five years ago, it would have 
                        been unimaginable that my daughter 
                        would play organized sports. And a 
                        hundred years ago. I would not have 
                        had the right to stand before you 
                        and ask for justice.

           She presses her fingers into the lectern for emphasis...

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I am not asking you to change the 
                        country. That’s already happened 
                        without any Court’s permission. I 
                        am asking you to protect the right 
                        of the country to change. 

           She looks to Daugherty.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You’re right, Judge Daugherty. Many 
                        men are still breadwinners. And 
                        many women have fulfilling lives 
                        ensconced in the domestic sphere. 
                        So many that it may seem natural. 
                        But if it is, why do we need laws 
                        that coerce them there?

           9:58. The Clerk Rises. Ruth considers him.
           IN THE GALLERY:

                                 MEL
                             (to himself)
                        Get to the remedy. The remedy.

                                 RUTH
                        There are a hundred and seventy-
                        eight federal laws that 
                        discriminate on the basis of sex. 
                        Count them. The Government did the 
                        favor of collating them for you. 
                        And while you’re at it, I urge you 
                        to read them. They are obstacles to 
                        our children’s aspirations. 

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        You’re asking us to overturn nearly 
                        a century of precedent. 

           She looks him dead in the eye. Without hesitation.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m asking you to set a new 
                        precedent. As courts have done 
                        before when the law is unjust. 

           It’s in Martin’s reaction - that was a good response. 

                                 JUDGE DOYLE
                        But in those cases the courts had a 
                        clear constitutional handle. 

           He turns his attention, addressing his colleagues.

                                 JUDGE DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        The word ‘woman’ doesn’t appear 
                        even once in the U.S. Constitution. 

                                 RUTH
                        Nor does the word ‘freedom.’ Your 
                        honor. 

           Doyle looks down on her for a long time. And she returns his 
           gaze - unflinchingly. Until he leans back. A slight nod. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Our sons and daughters are barred 
                        by law from opportunities based on 
                        assumptions about their abilities. 
                        How will they ever disprove these 
                        assumptions, if laws like Section 
                        214 are allowed to stand?
           FROM THE APPELLANT’S TABLE Martin watches the Clerk, watching 
           the clock. 9:59:30.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        That is why we must take these laws 
                        on. One-by-one. For as long as it 
                        takes. For their sakes. 

           IN THE GALLERY, Kate smiles. Mel is anxious: C’mon. C’mon. 

                                 RUTH
                        And you have the power to set the 
                        precedent that will get us started. 
                        You can right this wrong, by --

           The Clerk sits. 10:00. 

           Ruth watches him. Her jaw clenched. Willing him to stand. As 
           Mel exhales a long, distressing breath. 

                                 JUDGE HOLLOWAY
                        Go on. Professor Ginsburg. 

           Ruth looks to him. His gentle eyes urging her on avuncularly. 

                                 RUTH
                        The principle purpose of Section 
                        214 is NOT to protect women nor to 
                        discriminate against men. It is to 
                        provide caregivers the opportunity 
                        to work outside the home. Therefore 
                        -- as the Supreme Court did in Levy 
                        v Louisiana -- this court should 
                        fix the law in the way most in line 
                        with the legislative intent. Extend 
                        the deduction to never-married men. 
                        Help all caregivers equally.

           She should be done. She knows that. But she lets herself 
           linger a moment more. And no one stops her. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Our children and grandchildren will 
                        admire Charles Moritz. A man who 
                        surpassed the limitations the rest 
                        of us - and our laws - have tried 
                        to force upon him.

           IN THE GALLERY, Moritz’s smile is slight. But impactful. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        A man well deserving of your good 
                        will. It is respectfully submitted. 
           EXT. 10TH CIRCUIT COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Amongst the milling crowd, Bozarth and Brown exit. 

                                 BOZARTH
                        I’d say it’s clear we had the 
                        stronger legal footing.

                                 BROWN
                        I’ve said it time and again, Mr. 
                        Bozarth. Justice is a performance. 

           He eyes Ruth, Martin, Kate and Moritz on the bottom, far side 
           of the stairs...

                                 MORITZ
                        What happens now?

                                 KATE
                        They’ll issue an opinion in a few 
                        months. For now, we wait. 

           Mel comes running up. Embraces Ruth. 

                                 MEL
                        Kiki! That was perfect! Perfect! 

                                 RUTH
                        We don’t even know who won.

                                 MEL
                        It doesn’t matter, Ruth. It was 
                        right. 

           She’s moved by the sentiment. As Mel eyes the government 
           lawyers piling into their cars. And gets that playful look.

                                 MEL
                             (bounding off)
                        I’m going to gloat. 

                                 MORITZ
                        Martin. Kate. Thank you. 

           They shake. Then Moritz and Ruth embrace.

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll be in touch soon. 

           As he walks off, Kate does as well. And Ruth turns to Martin. 

                                 RUTH
                        How was it? Really. 
           Hand-in-hand, they head away from the Court House.

                                 MARTIN
                        It was... passable.  

                                 RUTH
                        Passable?!

           She turns away in mock irritation. Clearly enjoying the game.  

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need your approval anyway! 

           He stops. And she turns back to find him completely serious. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You’re right. You don’t. 

           She steps closer and kisses him. 

           EXT. U.S. SUPREME COURT - DAY

           Mel steps out of a sedan. Followed in a second vehicle by 
           ALLEN DERR (43), an affable, mousey-looking man in an ill-
           tailored suit. A horde of REPORTERS rush toward them. 

                                 REPORTERS
                        Mr. Wulf. Mr. Derr. Just one 
                        comment, please. (Etc.)

           SUPER: Two Weeks Later.

           Ruth and Martin, climbing the front steps, turn to watch the 
           melee. Share a significant glance. Then continue up. 

           INT. U.S. SUPREME COURT - COURTROOM - DAY

           Ruth and Martin stand in the back row. OBSERVERS between them 
           and the BENCH. As the nine (male) JUSTICES take their seats. 

                                 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
                        Be seated. The first case this 
                        morning is docket number 70-4, Reed 
                        v Reed -- on appeal from the 
                        Supreme Court of Idaho. Counsel for 
                        the appellant. You may proceed. 

           He leans back as Derr approaches the lectern. Blocked from 
           Ruth’s point of view. She struggles to get a glimpse. 
                                 DERR (CONT’D)
                        Allen Derr for the appellant, Your 
                        Honors. May it please the Court... 

           She gives up. And instead settles back into the pew.

                                 DERR (CONT’D)
                        One hundred years ago, Myra 
                        Bradwell wanted to be a lawyer...

           Off Ruth: Listening to her argument. Her chin raised proudly. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           SUPER: Moritz v Commissioner and Reed v Reed were the first 
           federal cases to find laws unconstitutional for 
           discriminating on the basis of sex.

           SUPER: In 1972, the ACLU formed the Women’s Rights Project. 
           As Director, Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the leading gender 
           rights lawyer of her generation, arguing several landmark 
           cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.   

           SUPER: Martin Ginsburg became one of America’s preeminent tax 
           attorneys and a beloved professor at Georgetown University 
           Law Center.

           He died of cancer in 2010, a few days after he and Ruth’s 
           fifty-sixth wedding anniversary. 

           SUPER: James Ginsburg is the founder of Cedille Records, a 
           classical music label based out of Chicago. 

           SUPER: Jane Ginsburg is a professor of law at Columbia 
           University. 

           SUPER: On June 14, 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated 
           Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

           The Senate confirmed her nomination: 96-3.

           PRESIDENT CLINTON stands to the side. Ruth (60) is at a 
           podium, behind the presidential seal. She wears a blue suit, 
           and that same sun-like pin from her mother’s photograph. 
                                 RUTH
                        The announcement the President just 
                        made is significant, I believe, 
                        because it contributes to the end 
                        of the days when women, at least 
                        half the talent pool in our 
                        society, appear in high places only 
                        as one-at-a-time performers...

           INT. U.S. SUPREME COURT - PRESENT DAY

           All in the courtroom rise. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the 
           other modern-day JUSTICES enter behind their raised bench. 

                                 MARSHAL OF THE COURT
                        Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons 
                        having business before the 
                        Honorable Supreme Court of the 
                        United States are admonished to 
                        draw near and give their attention, 
                        for the Court is now sitting. God 
                        save the United States and this 
                        Honorable Court!

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        I am indebted to so many for this 
                        extraordinary chance and challenge. 
                        Most closely, I have been aided by 
                        my life partner, Martin D. 
                        Ginsburg, who has been, since our 
                        teenage years, my best friend and 
                        biggest booster...

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE)

           Back to Ruth. Finishing her speech. 

                                 RUTH
                        I have a last thank you. It is to 
                        my mother, Celia...Bader, the 
                        bravest and strongest person I have 
                        known. Who was taken from me much 
                        too soon. I pray that I may be all 
                        that she would have been had she 
                        lived in an age when women could 
                        aspire and achieve, and daughters 
                        are cherished as much as sons. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
