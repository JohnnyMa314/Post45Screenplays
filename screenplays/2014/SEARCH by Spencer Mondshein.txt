           A MAN lays face down in the dirt, motionless. He is TORN TO 
           SHREDS. 

           WE HOLD ON HIM -- SUDDENLY he coughs, sending dust in the 
           air. SEAN DAVIS (30) struggles to open his eyes through the 
           CRUSTY, DRIED BLOOD covering his face.

           He lifts his head only to feel the intense pain of a 
           CONCUSSION. He has CUTS, GASHES and BRUISES everywhere, 
           including a particularly large laceration above his left eye. 

           Sean tries to flip himself over. He SCREAMS in pain, turning 
           just enough to see his broken tibia STICKING OUT OF HIS LEG. 

           Turkey Vultures gather in high trees. They shriek and flap 
           their wings, fighting for position on branches.

           The YELLOW SUN sinks halfway behind the mountainous horizon.

           Sean grabs the thigh of his broken leg and pulls it over. He 
           SCREAMS, once again.

           Sean drags himself along the ground. Once he has moved a body 
           length away, he sees the ground behind him is soaked in DARK 
           RED BLOOD.

           Sean checks his head and other body parts before noticing the 
           large damp ring of blood on his shirt over his rib cage. He 
           is afraid to look underneath. 

           It’s DARK, now. Sean searches for shelter. Finally, he crawls 
           around a sizable boulder. On the other side... a CAVE. 

           Sean flips his backpack forward and takes out a HEAD TORCH. 

           He shines his torch into the inlet. It’s deeper and larger 
           than one would have guessed, but most importantly, it’s 
           EMPTY. 

           He crawls inside. 

           Sean pulls out his cell phone and turns it on. 

           The battery bar FLASHES. 

           There is NO SERVICE. 

           Barely able to click the buttons, he goes from “Contacts” to 
           “Jess” then “Text Message”.
           The battery bar flashes.

           CLOSE ON -- Sean’s hands texting fast. SEND.  

           The MESSAGE SENT BAR shoots three quarters across and stops.

           Sean looks at the service. It goes from ONE BAR to ROAMING 
           and back again.

           The battery bar flashes.

                                 SEAN
                             (desperate)
                        Please.

           We focus on the message bar when... The screen turns black. 

           His phone DIES. 

           Sean crawls deeper into his natural shelter and rests his 
           head. He uses his torch to explore the cave. The light dances 
           on the rock above him. 

           WE HEAR -- SCRATCHING at the entrance of the cave. Sean lifts 
           his head to see what’s there. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (nervous, hopeful)
                        Hello?

           No response. Sean shines his light. Yellow glowing eyes move 
           swiftly in the darkness. 

           COYOTES. 

           He grabs some small rocks with his left hand and throws them 
           towards the entrance.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Get the fuck outa here!

           The coyotes retreat quickly, but Sean grabs more stones with 
           his RIGHT hand and throws. He grimaces and grabs his chest. 
           Blood drips through his fingers. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        HELLLLLPPPP!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHOBE NATIONAL PARK - BOTSWANA, AFRICA - EARLY MORNING

           A spectacular orange and red sun creases the horizon. 
           Large herds of WILDEBEEST and ZEBRA move through the 
           grassland. GIRAFFE walk behind ELEPHANTS feeding on tree 
           tops. 

           A BLACK-BACKED JACKAL sniffs the ground and then pounces on a 
           fleeing rodent. Two CHEETAHS sit in the shade watching IMPALA 
           graze.

           INT. TORO SAFARI LODGE - SHACK - MORNING

           A MAN does sit ups. An empty bottle of WHISKEY and numerous 
           containers of PAIN KILLERS/OXYCONTIN/ANTI-DEPRESSANTS sit on 
           a bed side table. 

           The room is small and plain. A lonely map rests on the 
           otherwise barren wall. There is a box spring and mattress in 
           the corner and a desk with a small light. A beat-up African 
           style rug lays alongside the bed.

           He PUSHES himself to pain. 

           LATER --

           FOLLOWING FROM BEHIND -- The man walks in a towel, freshly 
           showered.

           A sequence of quick cuts as he...

           - Puts on KHAKI SHORTS.

           - Picks up BINOCULARS.

           - Slides a long HUNTING KNIFE into a sheath.

           - Clips his belt together.

           - Grabs a .458 CALIBER RIFLE, pushes a LARGE BULLET down into 
           the magazine and brings the bolt over leaving the chamber 
           empty. 

           INT. TORO SAFARI LODGE - SHACK - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           FROM BEHIND -- He sits fully dressed on his closed toilet. 

           He opens a container and dumps a bunch of PILLS into his 
           hand. He throws them back with a few good gulps of whiskey. 

           He splashes his face with water, pauses and then looks up to 
           the mirror. 

           HENRY DAVIS (27) is revealed. He’s thin, tan and has a shaggy 
           beard. 
           His eyes are glazed and bloodshot. 

           INT. TORO SAFARI LODGE - LOUNGE AREA - MORNING

           A group of safari guides drink coffee, smoke cigarettes and 
           play cards. WAYNE (late 30’s, tough, white South African) 
           LUNGILE and MSIZI (mid 30’s, brothers, pure blooded Zulus 
           with thick accents).  

           Guests mingle outside the lounge. They are very clearly 
           TOURISTS. 

                                 WAYNE
                             (of the guests)

                        friend. 

                                 WAYNE
                        I’m almost as blek as you. And I’m 
                        not talking about skin colla you 
                        racist prick. They are whites. 
                        White, whites. A different species. 
                        The type that wull little by little 
                        be pullin beck when you talk to 
                        them, afraid to get too close, like 
                        you are going to bayte them. Always 
                        looking over thea shoulder. Afraid 
                        of you blecks. A nervous people who 
                        cannot enjoy anything cause’ 
                        they’re so afraid of wuts coming 
                        next.

                                 LUNGILE
                             (hiding his sarcasm)
                        Very very wise. Let me look at you 
                        for a second. 
                             (he stares)
                        You are as white as day to me 
                        brotha.

           Lungile and Msizi laugh.

                                 WAYNE
                        Fuck you.

           Henry enters. 
                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh, here he is. The God of fuckin 
                        buzz kills.

                                 LUNGILE
                        What type of white is Henry? White? 
                        Or white white?

           The two laugh again. Henry ignores as he pours himself 
           coffee. 

                                 LUNGILE (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear the Lions last night, 
                        Henry?

           Henry doesn’t respond. 

                                 LUNGILE (CONT’D)
                        Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        I didn’t hear em.

                                 LUNGILE
                        Close. Very close. 

                                 MSIZI
                        One hundred Pula, I find Lion 
                        first.

           Msizi slaps down the money on the table while taking a deep 
           drag of his cigarette. Lungile and Wayne both agree.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t bet.

                                 WAYNE
                        Stupid fecking yank. You track 
                        betta then’ll these blacks.

                                 HENRY
                        They don’t track, they listen for 
                        me on the radio. 

                                 MSIZI
                        Nought today. No no no no. I find 
                        Lion, first.

                                 LUNGILE
                             (to Msizi)
                        He always finds the animals first. 
                        You are stupid with your money. 
                        This is why no women like you. 
                                 MSIZI
                        The women I pay don’t think I’m 
                        stupid with my money.

           Lungile and Msizi laugh and give each other a fist pound. 

                                 MSIZI (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Henry. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Ehhhh fek that, he’s a panzy bitch. 
                        Right, ef you win an find that 
                        lion, I will lit you sleep with mah 
                        wife.

           Lungile and Msizi both give an ohhhhhh. As Henry walks out 
           the door...

                                 HENRY
                        It’s about time that woman got 
                        laid. 

           Lungile and Msizi laugh hysterically in Wayne’s face. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Fuck off.

           EXT. AFRICAN BUSH - DAY

           Henry leads a family of five wealthy English guests. They 
           walk in a single file line. Behind him is LAUREN (30), an 
           attractive blonde woman with a camera around her neck. 

           She is followed by her parents, RICHARD and DEBRA (late 50’s) 
           and anchoring are CINDY (late 20’s) and DAVID (early 30’s), 
           Cindy’s husband. 

           Henry keeps his head down as he TRACKS. The sun scorches in 
           the sky. 

                                 DEBRA
                             (whispering)
                        He hasn’t said anything to us in 
                        over an hour. 

                                 RICHARD
                        He’s tracking.

           Henry senses their boredom and puts his hand up signaling the 
           group to stop. He kneels down and looks around on the ground. 
           He waves them over.
           The group circles around Henry as he points to a section of 
           dirt. The group sees nothing. 

                                 LAUREN
                        What are we looking at?

                                 HENRY
                        Hyena.

                                 LAUREN
                        We don’t see it.

           Henry slowly and gracefully traces the footprint with his 
           finger, revealing the track. The group is intrigued. Henry 
           points ahead and the hyena’s path becomes clear. 

                                 DEBRA
                             (interrupting)
                        There’s a huge bird on a tree. 

           The group pulls out their binoculars. 

                                 DAVID
                        Vulture. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Look at the size of him.

                                 DEBRA
                        Does that mean there’s a dead 
                        animal nearby?

           CLOSE ON -- THE VULTURE.  

           After a beat, the bird turns and looks directly at Henry. A 
           distinct, ominous look.

                                 DEBRA (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me?

           Henry snaps out of it. 

                                 HENRY
                        No. But, they do mainly scavenge.

           LATER...

           The group marches on as the sun beats down hard. Socially 
           unaware and inconsiderate, Henry pushes forward with little 
           regard for the comfort of the others. 

           Debra is dehydrated.
                                 DEBRA
                             (frustrated)
                        What are you looking for?

                                 HENRY
                             (annoyed)
                        It’s a surprise. 

                                 DEBRA
                        Couldn’t the surprise be anywhere 
                        by now?

           SUDDENLY, Henry kneels down. The group stops.

           FRESH LION TRACKS. They lead into thick bush. 

                                 RICHARD
                        More Hyena?

                                 HENRY
                             (whispering)
                        We’re gunna swing around and see if 
                        we can get a look from a safe 
                        place. Stay behind me and don’t 
                        speak.

           The group tip toes into a clearing. Henry, intensely focused, 
           puts his hand up again. 

           In the distance, two stiff and alert ZEBRA look in their 
           direction, they turn and run. A VERVET MONKEY screams in a 
           nearby tree. 

           Henry is in tune with EVERY DETAIL. The rest of the group is 
           oblivious. Lauren starts to speak. Henry quickly silences 
           her. He listens carefully. 

           Nothing. 

           He kneels down.

           Another large LION TRACK. This one, however, has an identical 
           footprint next to it... ONE THIRD THE SIZE. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Oh shit.

           In the blink of an eye, a large LIONESS STORMS out of a bush 
           directly towards the group. She charges at full speed. 

           Henry shoulders his rifle and sticks up his right hand.
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (towards the lion)
                        HEYY!

           The LIONESS halts no more than eight meters from the group.  
           She SNARLS with rage. Debra, terrified, turns to run, when 
           David grabs and pulls her into his chest. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        NOBODY MOVE!

           The lioness backs up quickly. Behind her, a pride of six more 
           lions slowly comes out of the thicket. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Face the animals and slowly back 
                        up. 

           The moment the group moves the lead lioness COMES CHARGING 
           BACK. Henry cocks the rifle. The sound makes the lioness stop 
           five meters away. She paces back and forth, stopping to snarl 
           ferociously and slap at the ground. 

           Henry screams at her and she backs up a little, but won’t 
           leave. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (to the group)
                        Move.

           Again, after their first step, the lioness charges. HER MOST 
           AGGRESSIVE CHARGE YET. Ten meters. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. 
           She does not slow down.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        HEY!

           Five. Four. THREE METERS. HENRY TAKES AIM. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Don’t.

           The lioness comes to a screeching stop, TWO METERS AWAY, 
           spraying dirt in Henry’s face. 

           Henry and the lioness lock eyes. With the same speed at which 
           she arrived, the lioness leaves, darting into the bushes. The 
           other lions disappear. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Back up.
           The group slowly walks backwards. After a moment of calm, 
           Henry brings the gun down and turns to face the group. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Surprise. 

           INT. TORO SAFARI LODGE - RESERVE MANAGER’S OFFICE - EVENING

           PETER KNOWLES (50’s, Aussie) sits behind his large wooden 
           desk. His office is full of disorganized paperwork. Henry 
           drowsily stands opposite of Peter. 

                                 PETER
                        Well?

                                 HENRY
                        She sprung on us. I handled it.

           Peter looks drained.

                                 PETER
                        She was with her cubs wasn’t she?

           Henry stays quiet.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I mean Jesus, Henry. What the fuck 
                        is with you? That old broad coulda 
                        had a heart attack. You don’t stop 
                        for water? I mean fuck. You smell 
                        like a liquor store all the time.

                                 HENRY
                        Who’s saying that?

                                 PETER
                        It doesn’t fucking matter who says 
                        it, does it?

           Henry is quiet.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        We coulda had a real nice funeral 
                        in the bush today. You’ve been 
                        attacked by something or other six 
                        times in the last three weeks. If 
                        you want to kill yourself fine, but 
                        I won’t let you destroy my reserve 
                        doing it. 
                             (Pause)
                        The only reason you are still here 
                        is because of your Dad...
           EXT. CHOBE NATIONAL PARK - SAVANNA - DUSK

           Henry sits on the hood of his GAME VEHICLE. 

           He stares off at a beautiful SAVANNA. He takes a swig of 
           WHISKEY. 

           CLOSE ON -- Henry. His brain CHURNING as... 

           WE PRE LAP -- The sound of RHYTHMIC SCRAPING...

           EXT. ADIRONDACKS, NY - WOODS - DUSK 

           FLASHBACK

           CLOSE ON -- A pair of young hands SCRAPING a small piece of 
           metal against a flint rock. 

           It’s early-fall in the wilds of upstate New York, deep in the 
           lush Adirondack forest. The first layer of lifeless leaves 
           coat the forest floor. 

           YOUNG SEAN (12, precocious and clean-cut) teaches his younger 
           brother how to use a MAGNESIUM FIRE STARTER. Sean scrapes the 
           stone gracefully producing sparks and smoke. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        It works better when you do it 
                        smooth. See?

           YOUNG HENRY (10, curious and grubby) can’t contain himself. 
           He reaches for the fire starter.

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        Can I try?

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Henry, relax. Don’t grab.

           Sean hands it over. Henry scrapes aggressively.

                                 YOUNG SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Slow down.

           Henry scrapes and scrapes and gets no sparks. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        It’s broken.

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        It’s not broken. You aren’t 
                        listening. 
                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        I can make a fire with two sticks 
                        and a rock. This is stupid. 

           Henry throws it back. 

           Sean considers how dark it’s getting. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Ready? 

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        Wait for the signal this time.

           Henry pulls out a SLING SHOT and an ACORN. He puts the acorn 
           to his lips and blows making a loud WHISTLE. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (sarcastic)
                        Got it?

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Give me a break.

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        I’m gunna get him in the forehead.

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Million bucks says you miss.

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        Deal. 

           They shake hands. Sean looks up to scout out their plan. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        I’ll go this way, you...

           Henry is gone. 

           EXT. ADIRONDACKS, NY - WOODS - TEN MINUTES LATER

           Sean creeps through the forest, stepping on twigs and crunchy 
           leaves. He sees smoke from a campsite through the brush. 

           Out of nowhere, WILLIAM DAVIS (40’s a robust, bearded man) 
           grabs his eldest son by the waist hoisting him in the air. 

           William is SOUTH AFRICAN, revealed by his blondish-brown 
           hair, his sun-wrinkled skin and the unmistakable accent.

           Sean screams. 
                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Damn it!

                                 WILLIAM
                        You could bild a hut with all the 
                        twigs you were stompin on. Walk 
                        lahter.

           We hear the acorn whistle.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

           Sean quickly pulls out of his father’s arms as the acorn ZIPS 
           out of the forest and hits William in the forehead. 

           Henry comes screaming from the bushes and tackles his father. 
           William hits the ground laughing. Sean jumps on top of the 
           pile and the boys laugh and wrestle.

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           PRESENT

           Sean tries to open his eyes, but the dried blood seals them 
           shut. The sun, HIGH IN THE SKY, creeps through the thick 
           trees.

           He lifts his head and grits his teeth. His mouth is desert 
           dry. He feels for his water bottle and dabs a little into his 
           hand. He wipes the blood out of his eyes and opens them. 

           Sean guzzles his water, but abruptly stops. Better conserve. 

           He touches the wound on his head. It’s severely swollen. 

           He checks out his leg. The blood around the wound has dried 
           and the PROTRUDING bone looks clean. 

           Sean slowly lifts up his shirt to investigate the wound on 
           his stomach and chest. He reveals...

           A VERY DEEP GASH. 

           DARK RED oozes from his mid section. He removes his shirt and 
           pulls a clean one out of his backpack. 

           He dabs a little water onto the new shirt and wipes the dirt 
           and dried blood around the area of the wound. Even light 
           pressure makes the wound bleed. 
           Sean takes out a small FIRST AID KIT and pulls out a half 
           used bottle of HYDROGEN PEROXIDE. Laying on his side, he 
           pours the liquid on the wound.

           Sean growls as the peroxide sizzles. He wraps the shirt tight 
           around his abdomen. 

           Sean drags himself to the entrance of the cave to assess the 
           predicament. 

           There is a steep incline to the north and a decline to the 
           south. Everything is heavily wooded and rocky. Difficult 
           terrain.

           Sean looks up...

           Tall trees above him block the sky. He can barely see the 
           clouds. 

           EXT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - PORCH - EVENING

           CLOSE ON -- A foot tapping a wooden floorboard.

           It’s JESSICA DAVIS (30, cute, but tough and athletic). She’s 
           five months PREGNANT.

           Jessica stares anxiously out into the wilderness behind her 
           home. She hears a noise and quickly leans over the balcony, 
           only to see an older man and woman out for an evening stroll.

           She grabs the CORDLESS LAND LINE and dials. Jessica bites her 
           nails. We hear the other end of the line go straight to 
           SEAN’S voice mail. 

           LATER -- 

           Jessica paces nervously. She sits and turns on the TV. It’s 
           the news where a reporter behind a desk says... 

                                 TV REPORTER
                        Sam Mitchell, age 10, was last seen 
                        on the outskirts of...

           Jessica abruptly turns the TV off and lays down on the couch. 
           Once more, she tries Sean’s cell phone.

           Straight to voice mail. Jessica grabs a pillow and hugs it. 
           EXT. ADIRONDACKS, NY - MEADOW - DAY 

           FLASHBACK

           A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER Sean (27) and Jessica (26) relax together 
           on a blanket on a soft patch of grass. Both are thinner with 
           younger faces. Sean has longer hair. 

           Sean rests his head on Jessica’s lap. Jessica sketches a 
           drawing of an OLD MAN and OLD WOMAN fishing together in a 
           stream. It’s VERY detailed and VERY good. 

           Sean turns his head to see the art work. 

                                 SEAN 
                        I plan on being fatter. 

                                 JESSICA
                             (smiles)
                        Quit changing the subject. We have 
                        to come up with something. 

                                 SEAN
                        What’s going to stop this perfect 
                        athletic specimen?

           Jessica is serious. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        A meal. Two meals. If I say I’ll be 
                        home for dinner and miss 
                        breakfast... you call for help. 

                                 JESSICA
                        And if you say you’ll be home for 
                        breakfast and miss lunch?

                                 SEAN
                        I mainly snack my way through the 
                        day, I don’t technically consider 
                        lunch a meal...

           Jessica playfully knocks him in the stomach. Sean laughs and 
           softly tackles her. 

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           PRESENT

           Jessica wakes up on the couch with the phone still in her 
           hand. She sits up quickly.

                                 JESSICA
                        Baby?
           The house is dead quiet. She stands up and walks to her 
           bedroom. 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Sean?

           No Sean. 

           EXT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Her pace quickens as she walks to the front porch. Jessica 
           leans over the balcony and looks at their BIKE RACK. 

           ONE bike.

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - 30 MINUTES LATER

           Jessica sits with her arms folded at her kitchen table. She 
           stares at her clock. The minute hand clicks to 9:00 AM.

                                 JESSICA
                        And that’s breakfast.

           EXT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           A couple POLICE JEEPS are parked outside of the house.

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE- LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Jessica is frustrated and arguing with a YOUNG LOCAL COP 
           when... “MICK”, DAVID MCKORKLE, 60’s, enters. 

           Mick, the local Sheriff, gives a false sense of competence. 
           He has never been taken seriously as a law enforcement 
           officer in his town, because there has never been much law to 
           enforce.

                                 JESSICA
                        Yes, last night. I’ve said that 
                        eight times. 

           She sees Mick.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Mick, these are kids you’ve sent 
                        over. 

           The young cop rolls his eyes. 
                                 MICK
                             (to Jess)
                        Let’s talk outside. 

           EXT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S - DECK

           Mick looks at a NOTE Sean left for Jessica. It reads. 

           “Good morning. I’m off to the woods to save our business. Be 
           back for dinner Thursday. Love, Sean”.

                                 MICK
                             “Back for dinner 
                              Thursday”.

           Mick checks his watch. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        He’s about fifteen hours overdue at 
                        this point. I have to say, normally 
                        we don’t report someone as missing 
                        until it’s been at least twenty 
                        four hours. 

                                 JESSICA
                        It’s our rule. 

                                 MICK
                        Your rule?

                                 JESSICA
                        If he says he’ll be back for dinner 
                        and misses breakfast... we call for 
                        help. 

                                 MICK
                        He’s never just, been late? 

                                 JESSICA
                        Never.

                                 MICK
                        I’ll get in touch with Mountain 
                        Rescue. Right now, we’ve got 
                        volunteers and all the guys I can 
                        afford... are on foot.

                                 JESSICA
                        He has a cell phone.

                                 MICK
                        We’ll look into it, but out here, I 
                        doubt that means anything. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICK (CONT'D)
                             (pause)
                        Now, I need you to relax. Even 
                        professionals get lost in the 
                        woods. I’m guessin, in an hour or 
                        two, your husband will walk through 
                        the front door and ask what the 
                        commotions about. 

           INT. TORO SAFARI LODGE - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A door opens.

           Henry walks through, entering a LUXURIOUS African-bush style 
           restaurant, exposed on all sides to it’s wild surroundings. 

           The five guests laugh and drink wine around the table. Henry 
           sits with them.

                                 DEBRA
                        Explain to me how a Westminster 
                        snob like myself could prepare for 
                        that. We lack man-eating cats, if 
                        you don’t recall. 

           Laughter.

                                 LAUREN
                        When I was mugged-- I thought I 
                        would lay down, cry and beg. But, I 
                        didn’t. Some people are just built 
                        different. 

           Lauren glances over to Henry, trying to both impress and 
           compliment him with that story. Henry doesn’t care. 

                                 DEBRA
                        If I ever get attacked by a bottle 
                        of Chardonnay, I’ll know what to 
                        do. 

           Laughter.

                                 HENRY
                        She wasn’t a man-eater.

                                 DEBRA
                        Sorry?

                                 HENRY
                        You said man-eater. She was 
                        defending her cubs. 
                                 DEBRA
                             (taken back)
                        Oh.

           The table is quieted by Henry’s aggressive remark. Richard 
           breaks the silence.

                                 RICHARD
                        Henry, mind if I ask you a personal 
                        question?

                                 HENRY
                        I might.  

                                 DEBRA
                        Richard. 

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s not too personal. How are you 
                        here?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m not sure I--

                                 RICHARD
                        Africa. How did you find yourself 
                        out in the bush?

                                 HENRY
                        I was looking for something, I 
                        guess. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Have you been at Toro the whole 
                        time?

                                 HENRY
                        I started in South Africa.

           A STILL PHOTO --

           Henry is shirtless. He wears Army pants and a head band. He 
           holds a large machine gun. 

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        I did six months with an anti-
                        poaching unit. That’s where I 
                        learned about the bush.

           Henry sits next to an OLD BLACK MAN with a long white beard. 
           He also holds a large MACHINE GUN. 

           They are surrounded by green African jungle.
                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        A man who knew my father there took 
                        me under his wing. 

           We hold on Henry’s face from the photograph. An angry soul.

                                 DEBRA
                        You arrested poachers?

                                 HENRY
                        Sometimes.

                                 DEBRA
                        And other times?

                                 HENRY
                        We shot them. 

           The group is unnerved. Lauren is captivated. 

           INT. TORO SAFARI LODGE - HENRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Henry sits at his small desk. He nurses a glass of whiskey 
           and stares at what seems like nothing at all.  

           Henry picks up a photo. It’s of himself, Sean and Jessica. He 
           throws back some more pills and takes another swig of 
           whiskey. 

           WE HEAR -- a light KNOCK on the door. Henry quickly snaps out 
           of it and hides the pills.

           Another light KNOCK.

                                 HENRY
                        Come in. 

           The door opens and Lauren enters. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I hope I’m not interrupting. 

                                 HENRY
                        No.

                                 LAUREN
                        You left so abruptly, thought we 
                        might have upset you. 

                                 HENRY
                        No. 
                                 LAUREN
                        I can only imagine what you must 
                        think of the prudish city folk who 
                        wet themselves when they get their 
                        hands dirty.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t care. 

           Lauren takes few steps forward and has a quick glance around 
           his room.

                                 LAUREN
                        I wanted to say thank you for 
                        today. You saved our lives for 
                        bloody sake.

                                 HENRY
                        I got us into that jam. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Either way, it was remarkable.

           Henry nods and looks away. An awkward silence. Lauren 
           expected this to be easier.

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        Are you busy?

           Henry picks up a guide book.

                                 HENRY
                        I was... pretending to read a book.

                                 LAUREN
                        I’m brilliant at pretending to 
                        accomplish things, as well. 

           Henry forces a fake smile.  

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        We are about to move from the table 
                        to the bar. You can’t pretend to 
                        have a drink. Let me buy you one. 

           A long beat. 

                                 HENRY
                        Why?

                                 LAUREN
                             (surprised)
                        Think of it as gratuity for 
                        rescuing us from impending doom.
                                 HENRY
                        Why would you want to spend a 
                        second more with me than you have 
                        to?

           There’s no stopping Henry now. With this cold question, 
           Lauren’s romantic feelings turn to pity.

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re interesting. 

                                 HENRY
                        You think you can help me?

                                 LAUREN
                        That seems near impossible.

                                 HENRY
                        You know how many woman have 
                        knocked on that door? It does help, 
                        actually. For a few minutes. 
                        Then... it’s ten times worse. 

                                 LAUREN
                        That’s not why I’m --

                                 HENRY
                        Right, you think a meaningless 
                        conversation we have is going to 
                        change something. 

           Lauren keeps her chin up.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t change a fucking thing. 
                        Like every shit-head tourist who 
                        comes out here to find themselves. 
                        What have you found? Did you find 
                        yourself?   
                             (laughing)
                        You found a dejected, drunk safari 
                        guide who almost got you killed. 
                        And you still want to fuck him. 
                        Now, that’s depressing... Go home, 
                        whatever your name is. 

           Lauren stares him down. Even Henry knows he went too far. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I hope getting that out helped in 
                        some way. 

           Lauren leaves. Henry sits back in his chair for a moment. In 
           a rage he throws his lamp against the wall. 
           SMASH. 

           EXT. AFRICAN BUSH - NIGHT

           Henry drives fast through the bush. Some IMPALA cross in 
           front of the road. Their eyes glow. 

           Henry chugs whiskey, his eyes blood shot. He comes to a stop, 
           far away from everything and everyone. 

           WE HEAR -- The deep sounds of ROARING LIONS and the high 
           pitched yelps of HYENAS in the distance. 

           Henry grips his rifle. He looks at it for a moment, before 
           taking a big swig from his bottle. He places the rifle in his 
           BACK SEAT and steps out of the car...

           Henry takes another swig and throws his bottle into the bush. 
           He stares into the darkness, the deadly sounds of the wild 
           calling to him.  

           Henry STARTS FORWARD. He raises his hands above his head, as 
           he deliberately moves away from the safety of his car. His 
           eyes stream tears. The African night begins to consume him.

           He is about to disappear completely when --

           The CAR RADIO CRACKLES. 

                                 RADIO VOICE
                        Henry, come in, mate. Henry, it’s 
                        Peter. 

           Henry snaps out of his suicidal trance. 

                                 RADIO VOICE (CONT’D)
                        If you can hear me. I’m sorry, 
                        mate. It’s your brother... he’s 
                        gone missing.

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           Sean takes everything out of his bag...

           A mattress pad, his one man tent, sleeping bag, head torch, 
           long underwear, a sweatshirt, a swiss army knife, binoculars, 
           rope, two pairs of socks, rain gear, an elastic cord with 
           hooks on the end, a few granola bars, two cans of tuna, a 
           map, notebook, some pens and his cigarettes. 

           He organizes, putting everything neatly and accessibly in a 
           corner of the cave.
           He uses his head lamp to check on his stomach. It does not 
           look good. The cut is WIDE OPEN and mildly infected. 

           Sean takes his knife and cuts small punctures on each side of 
           the wound. His eyes tear because of the pain. Once he cuts 
           enough, he shakily puts his knife down and brings the foot of 
           his unbroken leg close to him.

           He removes his SHOELACE from the boot. Sean ties a marbled-
           sized knot on one end. He takes the shoelace and carefully 
           dips it into the bottle of hydrogen peroxide. 

           He proceeds to thread his cut with his shoelace. Every 
           insertion stings. Once the shoelace is through all of the 
           punctures, he PULLS TIGHT. 

           Sean slowly and carefully cuts his pants open with his knife. 

           He tips the peroxide and pours a bit on the break. It 
           sizzles. 

           Sean grabs rope and takes out the poles from his wrapped up 
           tent. He cuts the rope into three sections. 

           Sean puts three tent poles against his broken leg and lightly 
           secures them in three different spots with the rope. 

           Sean wipes sweat from his forehead. 

           He adjusts himself, takes a deep breath and puts his hands 
           over his eyes.

                                 SEAN
                        Fuck.

           He lightly touches the top of the break and quickly pulls 
           back as though receiving an electric shock.

           He LUNGES forward, but stops himself. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Do it. Do it. Now!

           He starts and stops, once again. 

           After a brief pause, he PUSHES down on his break, the bone 
           SLAMS back into his leg. 

           CRACK.

           Sean’s eyes roll back. He VOMITS violently. His leg shakes 
           uncontrollably. 

           About to pass out, Sean quickly TIGHTENS the ropes. 
           WE PRE-LAP -- A man YELLS over the PIERCING sound of a SAW 
           cutting metal as...

           INT. ADIRONDACKS, NY - GARAGE - DAY

           FLASHBACK

           YOUNGER SEAN (27), dirty and sweaty from the day of work, 
           YELLS up to an OLDER MAN from the first floor of an OLD BARN 
           turned MECHANIC shop. 

           The older man wears a WELDING MASK and saws a large sheet of 
           metal on the second level of the open concept barn.  

           Sean stands next to an ELEVATED CAR. A few OVERWEIGHT 
           mechanics sit around on boxes and eat sandwiches. 

                                 SEAN
                        HEY!! LENNY!! I’m takin off!

           Lenny stops cutting. We think it’s because he heard Sean. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Lenny, I’m taking --

           Lenny starts back up again. 

           EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean exits the garage. The old barn is surrounded by a junk 
           yard of OLD BEAT UP CARS, SCRAP METAL etc... FORECLOSED 
           STORES and MOBILE HOMES line the sides of the street. 

           Sean lights a cigarette and opens the door to his been-
           through-hell 1982 Toyota pick-up.

           EXT. SOMEWHERE IN TOWN - BACK OF STORE - DAY

           A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER, but just as tortured, HENRY (24) stands 
           with his back to us behind a foreclosed store. He flips a 
           large BUCK KNIFE around his finger. Very impressive. 

           A LOCAL BOY (16, hickish) approaches him from around the 
           side. He is startled at the sight of the knife. 

           Henry flips it into his sheath.

                                 BOY
                        You Henry?
                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. Where’s Boondo?

                                 BOY
                        He’s sick. I got wut you want. 

           Henry gives him a suspicious look. 

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s see it. 

           The boy is nervous and fumbles in his pockets. He pulls out a 
           VILE OF PILLS. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        How much?

                                 BOY
                        Thirty. 

           Henry hands him the money. The boy hands over the pills. 

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        Everybody know you round here. 

           Henry investigates the drugs. 

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        They say you could track a moose 
                        two weeks in front of ya. They say 
                        you smell better than a coyote. 

                                 HENRY
                        They sound like idiots. 

           Henry’s done with this kid. He reaches for his pack of 
           cigarettes. The boy slowly backs up. 

           He turns the corner and runs away.

           INT. SEAN’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Sean drives through town. He sees the boy come running out 
           from behind the store. 

           Sean stops. Goddamn it, Henry. 

           He pulls over in front of the store and rolls down the 
           window. After a moment, he honks. 
           EXT. SOMEWHERE IN TOWN - BACK OF STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry peaks around the store to check out who is honking. 

                                 HENRY
                        Shit. 

           EXT. STREET IN TOWN - CONTINUOUS

           Henry comes around the side of the store and approaches the 
           car. 

           He gets in and looks straight ahead. Sean stares him down. 
           Henry keeps his head pointed forward.   

                                 HENRY
                        Ready when you are.

           EXT. ADIRONDACKS, NY - WATERFALL - DAY 

           Sean leaps off a forty foot WATERFALL and crashes into a 
           natural pool, not before completing a graceful, mid-air flip. 

                                 SEAN
                        Fuck me. You either get your balls 
                        smashed or ass raped by water. I’m 
                        not sure which I prefer. 

           Henry sits, legs hanging over the edge of the jump. A 
           cigarette hangs from the corner of his mouth. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (disgruntled)
                        I’m gunna have creature children.  

           Sean floats peacefully on his back. Henry remains seated. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        You gunna jump or what?

           Henry pinches the lit end of the cigarette out and places the 
           butt in his pocket. 

                                 HENRY
                        I gotta find dinner.

           EXT. WOODS - EARLY EVENING

           A GREY SQUIRREL crawls up a thick tree trunk. Henry silently 
           peaks his eyes around a nearby boulder. He watches, perfectly 
           still.
           Sean lays on the ground behind him. He impatiently fidgets 
           and softly rustles the leaves below him. The squirrel stops, 
           momentarily sensing danger. Henry puts a JAGGED STONE into a 
           HAND-MADE SLING SHOT.

           The boys whisper.

                                 SEAN
                        Ten bucks. 

                                 HENRY
                        Quiet.

                                 SEAN
                        Ten bucks. 

                                 HENRY
                        Make it a million. 

           In the blink of an eye Henry pulls the sling back and 
           releases.

           SNAP!

           EXT. CAMP SITE - EVENING

           A perfectly skinned and gutted squirrel roasts over a 
           crackling flame. Henry cooks his meal on a stick over a fire 
           that burns in the middle of an open, tentless campsite. 

           Sean sits a few feet away, his back against a log. He eats a 
           store bought sandwich and a granola bar.

                                 SEAN
                             (mouth full)
                        I’ll write ya a check.

           Henry takes a big bite of his squirrel. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        And you ask me why you’re single.

                                 HENRY
                        I never asked you that. 

                                 SEAN
                             (pointing at squirrel)
                        You’re eating my answer if you ever 
                        do. Women like things nice n’ 
                        civilized. A picnic comes with a 
                        basket and blanket, not a sling 
                        shot and a dead raccoon. 
           A rare LAUGH from Henry. 

           EXT. CAMP SITE - SOME TIME LATER

           Half a bottle of whiskey has been consumed. Both the boys 
           smoke cigarettes. They sing “Redemption Song” by Bob Marley, 
           in unison. 

           Won’t you help to sing. This songs of freedom. ‘Cause all I 
           ever have: Redemption songs; Redemption songs. 

           They stop and enjoy the quiet.

                                 SEAN
                        I need you to come with me to 
                        Chucks. 

                                 HENRY
                        You don’t need shit. 

                                 SEAN
                        It’ll look better if we both go.

                                 HENRY
                        What am I gunna say?

                                 SEAN
                        I don’t want you to speak when we 
                        get there. This guy could give us 
                        everything. It isn’t a coffee date. 

                                 HENRY
                        It’s a picnic?

                                 SEAN
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, in a dramatic 
                        turn of events, young Henry Davis 
                        has put all his contempt for 
                        mankind aside and shows us he 
                        understands irony.

           Henry gives Sean the fist clenched “jerk-off” motion. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I can have that arranged for ya... 
                        If you show me you’re committed.

                                 HENRY
                        I’d make it worse. I hate that guy. 

                                 SEAN
                        Henry, he’s got money. Money we’re 
                        desperate for.

           PRESENT

           Jessica stands on her back porch. She scans the woods behind 
           her home with binoculars. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Come on baby. You are old and lost 
                        track of time. That’s it.  

           She looks back inside her home.

           JESSICA’S POV -- Through her porch door Mick stands over the 
           dining room table looking at a map. He talks to someone on 
           the radio. 

           Jessica gets anxious. She storms into the house.

                             (to Jess)
                        I wish it worked that quickly. It

                        sugar coat anything with you. It

           INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           FLASHBACK

           Family dinner in the IMPOVERISHED country house of Sean and 
           Henry’s childhood. Like so many families in the Adirondack 
           Park, the Davis’s have never had much. 

           Sean (27) sits next to Jessica (26). Accompanying them are 
           Henry (24) and their mother, SUSAN DAVIS (50’S, country 
           tough, proud), UNCLE IRV (50’S, overweight, funny) with 
           Jessica’s parents and a few extended family members from both 
           sides.

           We arrive to an animated Sean, mid story...

                                 SEAN
                        ... and this just is NOT... the 
                        bunny slope. If I start skiing, 
                        I’ll die. I wouldn’t even have to 
                        fall, I would just drop dead. 

           Laughter.

                                 JESSICA
                        He said he was a skier!

                                 SEAN
                        I lied. I’m frozen there. 

           The table is engaged. Henry sips his beer, his mind 
           elsewhere.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Then, I start sliding down and I 
                        can’t stop. People are whizzing by 
                        me shouting. I could only hear the 
                        end of their “uckk yoouuus”. 

           Jessica reaches for Sean’s hand underneath the table.

                        I had to choose. Die, or look 
                        really stupid. I choose stupid and 
                        I leaned forward and belly flopped 
                        into the snow. 

           Laughter.

                                 FAMILY MEMBER
                        How’d you get down?

           Sean acts out a crawling motion.

                                 SEAN
                        On my stomach. 

           More laughter.

                                 SUSAN 
                        And that was your first date?!

           Jessica smiles and nods.

                                 JESSICA
                        Yes, it was. Susan tell my parents 
                        how you met Bill. 

           Susan smiles, but it still hurts.

                                 SUSAN
                        Well. It was the only trip I’ve 
                        ever taken. My aunt brought me to 
                        Africa for a safari. Bill was our 
                        guide. 

           The table is intrigued.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        He was a tall, handsome safari 
                        guide. I don’t think I saw any 
                        animals, I was watching him the 
                        whole time. I don’t much believe in 
                        fate, but it was hard not to after 
                        he asked if I would stay in Africa 
                        with him. But, I convinced him to 
                        come here. 
                             (pause)
                        You would have loved him. He would 
                        have loved you too.

           Susan tears up. Uncle Irv rubs her back. Sean smiles at her. 
           He glances at Henry.
                                 UNCLE IRV
                             (diverting)
                        When do you all head out west?

                                 SEAN
                        Depends on Chuck.  

                                 FAMILY MEMBER
                        Who’s Chuck?

                                 SUSAN
                        He’s a long t--

           Henry cuts her off, out of the blue.

                                 HENRY
                        He’s a prick with a ton of money, 
                        who kills animals for the fuck of 
                        it. 

           The table is stunned and sits silently.

                                 FAMILY MEMBER
                        Oh.

                                 SEAN
                             (clarifying)
                        We’re looking for an investor. He’s 
                        a family friend who might help us 
                        out. 

           The fun, boisterous atmosphere at the table has DIED. 

                                 SUSAN
                             (towards the guests)
                        You’ll have to forgive my other 
                        son. We gave him a room, but he 
                        chose to live in cave.

                                 HENRY
                             (to Susan)
                        I’m sitting right here, you know.

                                 SUSAN
                             (to Henry)
                        I hadn’t noticed, you’ve barely 
                        said a word.

                                 HENRY
                             (sarcastic)
                        Just trying to make you happy, Ma. 

                                 SEAN
                        Guys.
                                 SUSAN
                        Do me a favor? Think about your 
                        brother and not yourself, for once. 

           Henry stands up.

                                 HENRY
                        I never think about either of us. 

           INT. SMALL PLANE - WINDOW SEAT - DAY

           PRESENT

           Henry stares out the window. The clouds look like an infinite 
           white mountain range. 

           Henry holds a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH -- 

           WILLIAM DAVIS in full SAFARI GUIDE GEAR stands with a group 
           of BLACK AFRICANS somewhere in the BUSH. It’s the moment 
           frozen in time that Henry has been chasing. 

           Henry regards it as we...

           EXT. ADIRONDACK WOODS - CAMPSITE - NIGHT 

           FLASHBACK

           The dark forest surrounds a small campfire. YOUNG Sean (12) 
           and YOUNG Henry (10) sit beside William, who enjoys a Guord 
           Pipe, a traditional African smoking device. 

           They sit atop their sleeping bags. The Davis boys sleep 
           outside, under the stars.  

           Off to the side of the camp, an expensive tent is set up. 
           CHUCK FOLEY fumbles around inside. 

           William glances over towards the tent.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’can only save you so much of this 
                        hea pipe, bru. It’s too good.

           Chuck (40’s, wealthy, a nice man) pops his head out.

                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        One minute. 

           Chuck continues messing around in his tent, it sounds like 
           he’s struggling with something. 
                                 YOUNG HENRY
                             (quietly)
                        Why is he with us?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yu are with us. I’m werkin, you 
                        know that. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        You do everything and he gets to 
                        shoot the deer.

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Henry. Dad gets paid to do that. 
                        And we get the meat.

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        So what?

           Sean rolls his eyes. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ay didn’t realize your lavish lafe 
                        allowed for making fun of dinna.

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                             (smiling and cocky)
                        I can get us all the meat we need. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Good lord, Henry, wake up. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        I’m wide awake dumbass.

           Chuck emerges from his tent. He’s dressed in top of the line 
           camping apparel. Way overboard. 

                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        May I?

           William hands Chuck the pipe. 

                                 CHUCK FOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           Chuck takes a puff.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Imported frem Africa.
                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        Ironic, the man who restores 
                        legitimacy to the ancient art of 
                        Adirondack guiding is African. 
                        Makes sense if you ask me. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN 
                        There are still other guides here, 
                        aren’t there?

                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        Not the way there used to be and 
                        none like your father. They say the 
                        last great guides were gone by the 
                        nineteen hundreds. 

           Sean is intrigued. Henry is annoyed.

                                 CHUCK FOLEY (CONT’D)
                        Like anything else when there’s 
                        money to be made, art loses it’s 
                        purity. Along came -

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        Rich people.

                                 SEAN
                        Henry, shut up!

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        Do something about it. 

           Sean pushes him. Henry pushes back. It gets serious.

           All of sudden, as though they were sucked into a vortex, the 
           two are lifted into the air.

           William has them, one in each arm. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sory bout this, Chuck. 

           Chuck smiles and gestures “no problem”. William carries the 
           two off into the woods. 

           When Chuck is out of ear shot, he puts them down. William 
           gets close. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Ah can see you two are entering 
                        thet piss-your-fatha-off age,

                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        It’s nice of em to lit me bring you 
                        hea. We can’t afford to screw this 
                        up. 

           The boys feel bad. William warms up. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Wrestlin’s one thing, fightin’s 
                        anotha. Whatever crap you are

                        guy I’m workin for.
                             (pause)
                        You hearin me?

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        I’m sorry I said - 

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, the both a ya. We stick 
                        togetha...

                                 YOUNG HENRY/SEAN
                        Yes. 

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           PRESENT

           The SUN beats down violently in the sky. Sean’s sweat has 
           washed away some of the dirt and dried blood. However, he is 
           pale and WEAK.

           He takes a quick swig from his water bottle and wipes sweat 
           from his chest and forehead. 

           Sean eats his granola bar. He chews slowly and painfully. 
           Everything hurts. 

           Sean digs a hole in his cave and buries the wrapper. He gives 
           a quick look at his remaining food and water that is neatly 
           organized in a small corner of his cave. A Hershey Chocolate 
           Bar, two small cans of tuna and half a bottle of water. 

           Sean flips open his phone and presses power. Nothing. 

           He maneuvers his way to the entrance of the cave.

                                 SEAN
                        Move.
           He drags himself along the ground.

           He throws sticks towards his cave. Small branches fly through 
           the air, one after another. 

           Sean stops for a moment. He hears something. A HUMMING sound. 
           Help on the way? 

           His pace increases. Sean creates a pile of sticks. He checks 
           his pockets for the lighter. 

           Not there.

           The HUMMING gets louder. Sean painfully scurries back into 
           the cave. He frantically checks his ruck sack. 

           No lighter.

           Sean looks in his neatly organized food, clothing and 
           supplies. 

           Nothing.

           The HUMMING is very loud. 

           Sean pokes his head out to see a HELICOPTER shoot over head, 
           above the trees.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        HEEELLLLLLLPPPPPP!

           His exertion aggravates his stomach wound and he grabs it. 
           The helicopter moves on and the HUMMING softens.

           CLOSE ON -- Sean’s bloodied face, emotionally destroyed.

           INT/EXT. SEAN’S TRUCK - DAY 

           FLASHBACK

           CLOSE ON -- Sean (27), clean cut and healthy. He drives 
           through town, passing small foreclosed stores, abandoned 
           homes and farming equipment, left for dead. 

           As he continues driving, the homes and properties get nicer. 
           He’s driving towards the future.

           EXT. CHUCK FOLEY’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Chuck’s log cabin-style mansion sits water’s edge on a large 
           serene lake. 
           Sean exits his truck, wearing the nicest clothes he owns, a 
           flannel button down and khakis. He reaches the front door, 
           takes a deep breath and knocks. 

           INT. CHUCK FOLEY’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Chuck (50’s now) answers the door. His grey hair and beard 
           serve him well. 

                                 CHUCK 
                        Seanny boy. 

           They shake hands and half hug. Chuck’s demeanor is relaxed 
           and inviting. Sean is a touch nervous. The two walk in.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Henry?

                                 SEAN
                        He had an emergency call. 

           Chuck doesn’t buy it. 

                                 CHUCK 
                        Always had the feeling that boy 
                        didn’t like me very much. 

                                 SEAN
                        Be news to me.  

           Chuck smiles.

                                 CHUCK 
                        Drink?

                                 SEAN
                        No thanks. 

                                 CHUCK 
                        Horse shit, you must want a beer.

                                 SEAN
                        You’re right.

           Chuck heads towards the kitchen. 

                                 CHUCK 
                        Make yourself at home. 
           INT. CHUCK FOLEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The inside of the house is large, clean and RUSTIC. It feels 
           more like a museum than a home. The walls of the cavernous 
           living room are made of thick beautiful logs and covered with 
           gorgeously framed paintings of wilderness settings. 

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        You proposed I hear, 
                        congratulations. 

                                 SEAN
                        Thank you.  

           Scattered throughout are STUFFED ANIMAL HEADS, including A 
           SIX POINT BUCK, a WILD BOAR and a BLACK BEAR. 

           Chuck returns with two bottles of beer. 

                                 CHUCK
                             (smiling)
                        Hell awaits you. 

           The two clink their bottles and take a sip.

                                 SEAN
                        This is great.

           Chuck plops down on the couch.

                                 CHUCK 
                        Thanks, brew it myself.

           Sean sits.

                                 SEAN
                        Really? Where do you sell it?

                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        I don’t.

                                 SEAN
                        Nice label.

                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        So people don’t think I’m poisoning 
                        them.

                                 SEAN
                        Why don’t you sell it?
                                 CHUCK
                        I like that it’s mine and no one 
                        else’s. Not all investments need to 
                        turn a profit.

           Sean sits silently, unsure how to respond. 

                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        Others, however, do. 

                                 SEAN
                        Right.

                                 CHUCK
                        Now, why should I team up with the 
                        Davis boys?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           FLASHBACK CONTINUES

           Henry (24) uses a BUCK KNIFE to carefully whittle a handle 
           into a long walking stick. He wears an unkempt PARK RANGER 
           UNIFORM. 

           Henry patrols the deep Adirondack woods. On his belt hangs 
           the buck knife. On his shoulder, he carries a powerful BOLT 
           ACTION RIFLE. 

           Henry bends down to inspect the ground. We see an extremely 
           faint outline of a boot track. Henry digs a little and picks 
           up a BULLET SHELL. He slips it into his pocket.  

           Henry continues looking for something. 

           He ducks under a branch and squats down, examining the bushy 
           roots of a small tree. Henry traces something. Something 
           invisible to the untrained eye.

           He slowly lifts up a muddy cord, cleans off the dirt and a 
           hidden WIRE, thin and silver, is revealed. He rests it back 
           down. 

           As Henry walks to the other side of the tree. He steps back 
           and reveals a GAME TRAIL or clearing in the dense thicket.

           Carefully, Henry takes his walking stick and places it 
           through the open space. In one fluid motion, he pulls up. A 
           SNARE, or hidden LASSO of silver wire CATCHES the stick.
           INT. CHUCK FOLEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           We return to the middle of the proposal. Sean excitedly 
           pitches the tag line.

                                 SEAN
                        “Where Mother Nature Dominates”.

                                 CHUCK 
                        Maybe a less frightening slogan, 
                        but I see.

                                 SEAN
                        It’ll be something else. The point 
                        is, our store becomes a name. A 
                        name that says “toughness, 
                        woodsman, real outdoors”.

                                 CHUCK 
                        That’s what every outdoors name 
                        wants. Why would this be any 
                        different?

                                 SEAN
                        One, our location. My father used 
                        to talk about finding places that 
                        were still unexplored. True 
                        wilderness. There aren’t many, but 
                        we found something close. 

           Sean pulls out a crinkled map and opens it emphatically. He 
           points to a region in NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        You gotta see this place, Chuck. 
                        Beautiful and wild. We set up in 
                        Etna. A small mountain town forty 
                        miles southeast of Fresno, 
                        California. Hundreds of square 
                        miles of wilderness. We couldn’t 
                        find a single outfitter store. No 
                        camps, no picnic tables, nothing.

                                 CHUCK
                        And...

                                 SEAN
                        Henry. We have Henry. I’m the 
                        coach, he’s the star running back. 

           Chuck Foley looks into Sean’s eyes and nods.
                                 CHUCK
                        I’m very impressed. It doesn’t 
                        surprise me. You have always 
                        impressed me, Sean. 

           Sean is elated. Chuck stands up and walks to the window.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        I have a concern, though.

                                 SEAN
                        What’s that?

                                 CHUCK 
                        I don’t see this working without 
                        Henry. His skills are unique, 
                        there’s no doubting that. I’m just 
                        not sure how I feel about such a 
                        huge part... relying on him.
                             (off Sean’s look)
                        Please don’t take that the wrong 
                        way.  

           Sean leans back.

                                 SEAN
                        Listen...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The only sound we hear is Sean’s voice continuing.

           Henry walks through the woods, his arm full of SNARES made of 
           wire and rope. He hears something and ducks down. 

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        When Henry was ten years old, a 
                        coyote got our cat. 

           Henry pokes his head out of the thicket to see a DOE with her 
           head caught in a SNARE. She slowly writhes in pain... dying. 
           There is nothing to be done.

           Henry approaches and kneels down next to her. The DOE is 
           defenseless, her back broken. 

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        Henry disappeared. When he didn’t 
                        come home that night, we called the 
                        police.

           A rustle in the bushes. 
                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        After five days, we had prepared 
                        for the worst. I was certain he was 
                        dead. 

           Henry looks up to see a few month old FAWN peering at him 
           through the bushes. The fawn darts away after a moment of eye 
           contact.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        On the sixth morning, Henry walked 
                        through the door. He stood for a 
                        moment holding something behind his 
                        back. He pulls out the dead coyote, 
                        looks me in the eye and quietly 
                        says “got’m”.

           A DEVASTATED Henry looks down at the dying mother. The deer’s 
           eyes are stricken with fear. 

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        He’s my brother, Chuck. I love 
                        him...

           Henry shoulders the rifle and cocks it.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        ... and I trust him. 

           BANG. The gun shot is THUNDEROUS. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHUCK FOLEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sean sitting on the sofa. Chuck soaks in the story.

                                 SEAN 
                        Let me control the other side.

           Chuck slowly sits down. A man with his kind of money has the 
           luxury of drawing out dramatic decisions, even when his mind 
           has already been made up. Sean watches him anxiously. 

                                 CHUCK 
                        I think we might just have 
                        something here.

           Sean claps and fist pumps in excitement. 

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Just one thing. 
                             (curiously amused)
                                 (MORE)

                        How did you know it was the same 
                        coyote?

           Sean motions a knife to the stomach.

                                 SEAN
                        Out popped old Astro.

           INT. POLICE CAR - EVENING

           Henry sits in the back seat of an ARRANGED POLICE ESCORT. He 
           flips his buck knife fast around his finger.

           The YOUNG COP drives. He notices the knife in the rearview 
           and gives a half-worried look. 

           Henry looks out the window.

           EXT. ADIRONDACK WOODS - CAMPSITE - MORNING

           FLASHBACK

           William packs up a cooking kit. YOUNG Sean (12) comes around 
           a bend with a bucket of water to douse the fire. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Mind fillin up another buckit? 
                        Chuck’ll be up and wantin coffee, 
                        surely. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Do I get commission?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You get to eat. Yu two are 
                        unbelievable. Speakin’ of which, 
                        where is that little devil?

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        He was with you.
           EXT. FOREST - MEANWHILE

           Not far away from camp, young Henry uses the MAGNESIUM 
           FIRESTARTER. He scrapes the flint against a rock creating 
           sparks, but no smoke or flame. He scrapes harder and harder, 
           becoming more and more frustrated. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                             (while scraping)
                        Bull shit. This is bull, bull, bull 
                        shit. It doesn’t work!

           Henry fakes like he is going to throw the flint, but stops. 
           He tries again. This time smoother. Sparks. Smoke. Henry’s 
           eye light up. He grabs more sticks and kindling. 

           FLAMES. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Got it!

           Young Henry jumps around, the overjoyed ten year old boy that 
           he is. He is so excited, he forgets to set up a fire pit...

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           PRESENT

           Jessica goes over a map with Mick and SEARCH AND RESCUE. Base 
           camp has been set up in the house. 

           EXT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           The car pulls up. Henry, wearing his sturdy, but worn down 
           hiking boots steps out of the vehicle. He puts on his old 
           Adirondack park ranger cap.

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Jessica sees Henry through a window. She puts the map down 
           and walks briskly to the front door. 

           Jessica swings it open just as Henry knocks. Jessica takes 
           his arm and pulls him in for a hug. She feels safer, already.

                                 JESSICA
                        I’m so glad you’re here.

           After a long beat, Jessica pulls back quickly.
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jessica slaps down a map on the counter. Mick and Henry hover 
           over it on either side of Jessica. 

           She points to the bottom right corner.

                                 JESSICA

                        We run bikers through these trails 
                        in Six Rivers.

           She points northeast of the town.

                                 HENRY
                        Why was he out there?

                                 JESSICA
                        We’ve been looking for more places 
                        to take guests. He was mapping an 
                        area.

                                 HENRY
                             (focused)
                        Pen.

           Mick pulls a red pen from his shirt and hands it to Henry.

                                 JESSICA
                        We spoke about this area in 
                        Klamath. There were trails that cut 
                        through the valley and into the 
                        park. 

                                 HENRY
                             (drawing on the map)
                        He left four days ago. Heading 
                        west, starting somewhere along this 
                        general point.

           Henry draws six lines extending left over wilderness area on 
           the map. He draws a complete square from the tips of the 
           lines to the main road.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (to Mick)
                        Where are your people?
                                 MICK
                             (pointing on the map)
                        We have search teams hiking east 
                        and west at ten mile gaps. Chopper 
                        flies north and south. 

           Henry stares at the map.

                                 HENRY
                        What about here?

           Henry points to a southern entrance, via a road. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Did he walk from the house?

                                 JESSICA
                        Road his bike.

                                 HENRY
                        He must have started down a road. 
                        If I were him, I’d start south, 
                        head up and loop around. We have no 
                        trace of him whatsover?

                                 MICK
                        Nothing as of now. 

           Henry stands up. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m going to need a few things.

           EXT. MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE

           The sun slowly climbs over the mountains. 

           INT. CAR - MORNING

           Jessica drives Henry in silence. Anxious and nervous, she 
           continually looks over at Henry, who keeps his eyes straight 
           ahead.  

                                 JESSICA
                        I’d think you’d have a lot to say, 
                        after disappearing for three years.

           Henry looks over.

                                 HENRY
                        I do.
                                 JESSICA
                        Why didn’t you respond when we 
                        wrote you?

           Henry is quiet for a moment.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t think I’m ever going to 
                        have a good answer for that.

           Jessica begins to tear up. Henry sits in silence. 

           EXT. SOUTHERN ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Jessica pulls over to the entrance. Henry gets out of the car 
           and comes to the drivers window. He is already at work, 
           scanning the woods for ways in, assessing. Jessica watches 
           him.

                                 HENRY
                             (nodding his head)
                        Alright.
                             (focused)
                        I’m going to be checking in with 
                        you and the Rangers. YOU need to 
                        make sure they are covering ground. 

           Jessica takes a deep breath and nods.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Listen...

           Henry starts as though he is going to say something 
           apologetic. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Tell it to Sean. 

           Henry nods. He turns and walks towards the forest. 

           Jessica watches Henry as he disappears into the thicket.

           CLOSE ON -- Jessica’s face. 

           EXT. DAVIS’S BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 

           FLASHBACK

           WEDDING. 

           Outside on the small yard behind the Davis House. Heavily 
           wooded hills surround the property. 
           YOUNGER Sean (27) and Jessica (26) stand in front of forty or 
           so family and friends watching from white plastic chairs on 
           the lawn. 

           The newly weds take their vows, say their “I do’s” and kiss. 
           The crowd claps and cheers. 

           EXT. DAVIS’S BACKYARD - LATER 

           DANCING. A local band plays country music. Twenty or so 
           people dance in an area close to the house. Jessica and Sean 
           dance together. 

           Chuck Foley steals Jessica and swings arms with her. Sean 
           dances with Susan.

           Henry sits at a table away from the dance floor. He drinks a 
           large whiskey on the rocks. He looks wasted and melancholy as 
           usual. 

           DINNER and TOASTS. Susan stands in front of the guests who 
           are now scattered at plastic fold up tables. 

                                 SUSAN
                             (choked up)
                        I never thought Sean would find a 
                        woman that could deal with him. Any 
                        girlfriend he had, I would say to 
                        myself, you can’t handle Sean, his 
                        spirit... his love. That was until 
                        I met you, Jessica. You are the 
                        only person who’s heart is as BIG 
                        as my son. 

           The audience claps. Sean and Jessica smile. 

           Henry reads off a flimsy napkin. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m not very good at these things. 
                        Which is unfortunate because I’m 
                        supposed to be the 
                             (making the quotation 
                              gesture)
                        “best” man. 

           The crowd gives a light sympathetic chuckle 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Jessica. I think you’re amazing. 
                        Sean and you, it works. It does. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You actually can get him to shut 
                        up. 

           Genuine laughter. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        My brother. I remember when all we 
                        wanted was to go on adventures. 
                        Life changes. But, no matter what 
                        we do, who we meet or where we are, 
                        there will always be adventure. 

           Henry brings the napkin down. The brothers LOCK EYES.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I hope the two of you make the most 
                        of yours.

           THE REVEAL. Henry has no plans to join them out west. For the 
           brothers, this subtle moment will define the rest of their 
           lives. 

           Sean KNOWS IT. He is shattered. He forces a fake half-smile 
           and claps.

           Uncle Irv gives his toast.

                                 UNCLE IRV
                        I remember, I remember when Sean 
                        came trotting up to me, once. He 
                        tugged my shirt and pinched my leg, 
                        screaming “Uncle Irv, Uncle Irv!”
                             (acting out the story)
                        “What?!” I said. “What does it feel 
                        like to make love to a woman?” he 
                        asked. I said, Sean, for the love 
                        of God, your wedding’s this 
                        Saturday...

           Genuine laughter.

           EXT. DAVIS’S BACKYARD - LATER THAT EVENING

           More dancing. The band is back in action. Jessica swings arms 
           with an awkwardly dancing Henry.  

           Sean lolls in a chair off to the side, drinking a beer. He 
           GLARES at Henry. Henry gestures to Jessica that he needs a 
           smoke and walks off. 

           He walks towards the house, free from the party. 

           Sean rises, takes a good slug of his beer and follows.
           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Henry lights a cigarette and lifts himself onto the counter.

           The kitchen is quiet. The sounds of the celebration outside 
           are faint. Henry closes his eyes and puts his head back. 

           Sean enters. Henry looks up.

                                 HENRY
                        I shoulda just read from the 
                        napkin.

           Sean glares at him and slowly walks to the counter. 

                                 SEAN
                        Where are you going?

           Henry’s confused. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’ll hang out for a while. 

           Sean slams his beer into the counter. 

                                 SEAN
                        Where are you.. going?

           Henry is amazed. He didn’t want it to go like this... 

                                 HENRY
                        South Africa. Fuck, Sean, I was go -
                        -

                                 SEAN
                             (interrupts)
                        You weren’t gunna tell me shit. 
                        You’re too much of a pussy for 
                        that. Do you know what I’ve put 
                        into this? I gotta get out of here, 
                        Henry. There’s no future. 
                             (building anger)
                        I’ve worked so fucking hard for 
                        this. Did you even think about 
                        that?

           Sean is livid and intimidating.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I NEED you. Forget the fact that 
                        you are stabbing in the back the 
                        only person willing to put up with 
                        your shit. I NEED you out there.
                                 HENRY
                        You have a wedd --

                                 SEAN
                        No, fuck you. Face this. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck you! When did I have a say in 
                        this? You drag me around 
                        everywhere. Like I’m on a goddamn 
                        leash! I’m sick of it. This whole 
                        thing was your idea. 

                                 SEAN
                        You prick, we planned this.

                                 HENRY
                        You planned it.

                                 SEAN
                        And you were never even gunna say 
                        anything because you are a 
                        miserable, selfish fucking outcast. 
                        That’s why you’re alone. You think, 
                        you’ll leave your misery behind?

                                 HENRY
                             (quietly)
                        I don’t know.

                                 SEAN
                        You’d rather go chase a ghost than 
                        stick with your brother who’s here 
                        and alive. 

           A chord is struck in Henry. Sean tries to calm himself.

                                 HENRY
                        Careful. 

                                 SEAN
                        You are doing this. At least give 
                        me the satisfaction of admitting 
                        that.

                                 HENRY
                        This is who I am.

                                 SEAN
                        Well, fuck who you are! 

           Sean turns to go, but before he does. 
                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        You know what?

                                 HENRY
                             (aggressive)
                        What?

                                 SEAN
                        Maybe, I’ve been wrong this whole 
                        time. Maybe, if it weren’t for “who 
                        you are”, we’d still have Pop.

           Henry goes wide-eyed with RAGE. Sean starts to walk away, but 
           Henry dives into his back, spearing him to the kitchen floor. 
           Sean, quickly flips over underneath Henry and HITS him across 
           the face, knocking him back. 

           In a flash, Sean is on his feet, TACKLING Henry into the 
           refrigerator. The boys try to CHOKE each other. Sean lifts 
           him up and SLAMS him into a glass cabinet, SMASHING it. 

           Guests outside hear the loud crash and look towards the 
           direction of the noise. Through the window they can see the 
           violent fight taking place. Jessica looks on, horrified. 

           BACK TO THE KITCHEN --

           Sean pushes Henry against the broken glass. Henry knocks both 
           of Sean’s hands off his chest and punches him in the face, 
           sending Sean back a few steps. Henry jumps down off the 
           counter and swings for Sean’s head. Sean ducks and drives 
           Henry into the ground, tackling his waist. 

           The boys wrestle on the ground as family and friends come 
           rushing in. A few older men pull Sean off Henry. The bruised 
           and bleeding brothers violently go after each other while 
           being restrained. 

           Susan SCREAMS for the two to stop. The boys stop struggling 
           and breath heavily. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (dead serious)
                        Get the fuck out of here and don’t 
                        come back. 

           Henry gives his brother one last look and storms out of the 
           house. 

           Sean wipes the blood from his face. Jessica enters the room. 
           She gives Sean a look, starts to tear up and leaves. Sean 
           says nothing. He just hangs his head.
           EXT. ROAD -  NIGHT

           Henry, with his face beaten and clothes ripped, walks into 
           the middle of the dark, quiet road. We hear the sounds of the 
           outdoors. The crickets and the soft breeze. 

           Henry, walks into the night... alone.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           PRESENT

           Henry moves briskly through the thicket. He smoothly leaps 
           over logs. He walks as though he has seen something already. 

           The spider webs and pricker bushes are no match for this 
           experienced TRACKER.

           Henry pushes hard uphill. He grabs trees for leverage. He 
           reaches an open area at the peak of an incline. 

           Here we can see the vastness of the North American wild. 
           Henry takes out his map and marks the peak. 

           He takes out his binoculars and scans the terrain. We see 
           some rocky mountainous regions. He notices a soft flowing 
           river at the base of the rocky hills

           Henry puts down the binoculars and takes off. 

           EXT. WOODS - HOURS LATER - DAY

           Henry searches the ground, trees and bushes looking for a 
           sign. Henry pauses and catches his breath, leaning against a 
           tree. He takes out his radio.

                                 HENRY
                        Come in house.

                                 JESSICA (THROUGH RADIO)
                             (static, very unclear)
                        It’s Jess. Anything?

                                 HENRY
                        Not yet. Tell them to focus on 
                        rocky areas. If he’s hurt, he’s not 
                        building a shelter. He may be in a 
                        cave or under a cliff or something.  

           There is silence on the other end of the radio.
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Jess?

           The radio loses contact for a moment. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Here. Can you hear me?

                                 HENRY
                        Let me know if something changes. 

           Henry puts the radio back in his bag. He quickly sprints up a 
           hill. Looking through his binoculars, we see a small 
           helicopter in the far distance. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        SEAN?!

           His voice echoes. 

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           Sean pushes against the walls of the cave. 

           SEAN’S POV -- He lifts his good leg up and down. Sean takes a 
           breath, his second leg begins to shake. Sean yells. 

                                 SEAN
                        Come on you pussy. 

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean in the nearby thicket finds a large stick.

           EXT. OUTSIDE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           He tries to pull himself up using a boulder. The injury on 
           his stomach streams blood. Sean fights through the pain and 
           stands up using the stick as a crutch. He smiles. 

           Sean slowly starts to ease his other hand off the boulder. He 
           stands on his own. 

           Sean takes one step and puts the crutch down instead of his 
           broken leg. Then another. 

           Sean takes a third step, but loses his balance and FALLS 
           forward onto his face, kicking DUST into the AIR. 
           EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINS - SUMMER - DAY

           FLASHBACK -- THREE YEARS SINCE THE WEDDING -- 

           CLOSE ON -- DUST kicked into the air by a BIKE WHEEL. 

           INTENSE MOUNTAIN BIKING. A group of seven speed down a hill. 
           The terrain is rocky, but surrounded by green forest. 

           PULL BACK WIDE -- The bikers are dwarfed by the vastness of 
           their surrounding wilderness. Snow peaked mountains as far as 
           the eye can see. 

           WE SHOOT BACK IN -- These are experienced bikers. They weave 
           in and out of boulders and take steep downhill slopes with 
           confidence. 

           The bikers push hard up a hill and stop at the peak. The view 
           is TREMENDOUS. The bikers breath heavily and go for their 
           water bottles. The leader turns to the group and removes his 
           sunglasses. 

           SEAN (Now, 30) is revealed. He looks older, but healthy as 
           can be. Sean takes a few good gulps of water.

                                 SEAN
                        Ahhh there is nothing better than a 
                        couple hydrogen for every oxygen 
                        molecule. Hydrate everyone. Drink, 
                        drink, drink. Water is life, life 
                        is all we got. 

           PHIL (mid-to-late 30’s, almost bald) is particularly out of 
           breath. He can barely speak. 

                                 PHIL
                        We are pushing it today, eh?

                                 SEAN
                             (amused)
                        We are, Phil. Course I come back 
                        out here with the middle school on 
                        Thursdays, if this is too much. 

           Lite laughter. Phil waves him off.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (to the group)
                        Everyone else alright?

           The group unanimously says they are fine. 

           Their view overlooks hundreds of miles of wilderness. Trees, 
           mountains, valleys and rivers provide an epic panorama. 
           GUEST GIRL, early twenties, athletic, blonde. 

                                 GUEST BLONDE
                        We never ride out that way. 

                                 SEAN
                        I’m working on it, trust me. 

           Sean faces the area and extends his arms out.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Gorgeous, untouched land. It’s all 
                        national park, but there’s barely a 
                        hiking trail. I’ve heard if you go 
                        far enough it’s a fair bet you get 
                        raided by Sioux.

           The group doesn’t buy it. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (joking)
                        I’m serious! We don’t even know 
                        what’s out there, haven’t set foot 
                        on parts of it. We can send Phil to 
                        check it out. 

           The group laughs. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Phil, I’m fucking with you. I love 
                        you. 

           Sean puts his sunglasses back on. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do it.

           Scattered “Hell Yeah”, “Let’s go” ring-out with enthusiasm. 
           They strap on their helmets and hop on the bikes. 

           INT. OUTFITTER STORE - “TRAILS” - EARLY EVENING

           Sean walks through the door of his business, “Trails”. It’s 
           small, but stocked with nice looking equipment. Bikes, 
           backpacks, shoes, knives, tents etc. 

           Sean looks across the store at the checkout counter where 
           GAIL (54, country sweet) his good friend/employee is folding 
           clothing.
           INT. “TRAILS” - EARLY EVENING - CONTINUOUS

           Sean walks behind the register and sorts through paperwork.

                                 SEAN
                        How’d we do today?

                                 GAIL
                        A little better than usual.

                                 SEAN
                        That bad?

                                 GAIL
                        You got a message. From the 
                        National Forest committee. 

                                 SEAN
                             (bright eyed)
                        When?!

                                 GAIL
                        Ten minutes ago. Her name is Niomi, 
                        her number is on your desk next to 
                        a glass of cold water.

           INT. “TRAILS” - SEAN’S OFFICE - 5 MINUTES LATER 

           Sean stands behind the desk in his small office.  He is on 
           the phone. We only hear Sean’s side of the conversation.

                                 SEAN
                        I’m sorry, I was told that I had 
                        until August. 
                             (pause)
                        Yes, I sent that in. 
                             (pause)
                        I’ve tried getting in touch with 
                        them numerous times. It seems as 
                        though they are purposely ignoring 
                        me. 
                             (pause)
                        Yes ma’m. Mountain biking, hiking, 
                        canoeing, white water rafting. All 
                        of them. 
                             (pause)

           Sean looks at a calendar. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s in two weeks. It’s 
                        impossible--
                             (pause)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Is there any way, I can have more 
                        time? 
                             (pause)
                        I understand. 
                             (pause)
                        OK. OK, thank you for your time. 

           Sean hangs up the phone with force. He turns and stares out 
           the window. 

           EXT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

           Sean pulls up to the back of the house. He chains his bike to 
           the RACK underneath the balcony. 

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S - EVENING

           Jessica (Now, 29) fills a pot of water in the sink. Sean 
           enters. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Hey there.

           Jessica faces the sink and Sean approaches her from behind. 
           He puts his chin on her shoulder and his arms gently around 
           her stomach. 

                                 SEAN
                        The forest committee got back to me 
                        today. 

                                 JESSICA
                             (intrigued)
                        What did they say?

                                 SEAN
                        I’m going to have to get a proposal 
                        and layout in.

                                 JESSICA
                        By when?

                                 SEAN
                             (lying)
                        Not sure, but soon. 

           Jessica turns back to the counter. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Chuck called looking for you. 

           Sean pretends he didn’t hear. 
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Are we just ignoring him now?

                                 SEAN
                        I’m afraid of what he’ll say.
                             (off Jessica’s look)
                        Don’t even think it. We’ve come too 
                        far to fold. Please don’t worry 
                        about it.

                                 JESSICA
                             (adamant)
                        That’s not the way this works. 
                        Don’t talk to me like I’m a poor 
                        house wife who shouldn’t concern 
                        herself with her man’s money. 

           She’s a tough cookie. 

                                 SEAN
                        I know that. Good lord. You’re 
                        pregnant and I don’t want you 
                        stressing. 

           He spoons Jessica and begins kissing her neck passionately. 

           He slowly moves his hand up to her chest and grabs firmly. 
           Jessica closes her eyes.

                                 JESSICA
                        We have no money, no plan and soon 
                        no business.

                                 SEAN
                        We work on those to make time for 
                        this. 

           Jessica turns and they kiss passionately.  

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           PRESENT

           Sean takes the cloth off his leg. All of the skin around the 
           break is black. He pours more peroxide on it and re-wraps it.

           Sean slowly lifts up his shirt. Dark red blood has soaked 
           through the white bandage. He removes it. 

           We see the wound. Puss oozes around the shoelaces. The skin 
           around the cut is dark and swollen. Sean winces at the odor 
           it produces and coughs again. 
                                 SEAN
                        Oh God.

           Sean dabs more peroxide on it and takes a clean cloth to 
           bandage it. He buries the two puss filled and bloodied cloths 
           outside the cave. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Henry looks at bushes, trees and in the dirt for any kind of 
           sign. He leans against a tree, takes out a map and a piece of 
           BEEF JERKY. Henry looks at his map and briefly scans the 
           surrounding area. He spots...

           DISTURBED MUD. 

           Henry runs over to investigate. TIRE TACKS from a bike. Henry 
           follows. He goes up and over, in and around boulders.  

           Henry reaches a peak and looks down and sees something! He 
           slides down the hill and stands over a BIKE. Henry takes out 
           his radio. 

                                 HENRY
                        Jess. Anyone there?

           Static. Nothing.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        House? House? Come in house.

           More static.

                                 JESSICA (THROUGH RADIO)
                        We’re here.

                                 HENRY
                        What kind of bike does Sean have?

                                 JESSICA 
                        Say again?

                                 HENRY
                        What kind of bike does Sean have?

                                 JESSICA
                        A Trek. Blue and yellow.

                                 HENRY
                        I found it. 
                                 JESSICA
                             (ecstatic)
                        Where are you?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m twelve miles north west from 
                        where you dropped me. He started at 
                        the bottom of a ravine. His bike is 
                        on the east side of a narrow 
                        stream. Looks like he headed north 
                        from here. Will know more soon.
                             (pause)
                        Do you follow?

           Pause through the radio. 

                                 JESSICA
                        We do. 

                                 HENRY
                        Send everyone you have this way. I 
                        got his track now. 

           Henry shuts the radio off. He crouches down and outlines a 
           boot print with his finger reminiscent of the hyena tracks 
           from Africa. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        OK Sean. Here I come. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           WIDE -- CIRCLING SHOT -- of Henry heading up a hill 
           surrounded by the vast North American wilderness. 

           A lone warrior in search of his lost brother.

           EXT. CAVE - DAY 

           Sean sits at the entrance of his cave looking weak and thin. 
           His eyes, glossy. His body movements, slow.

           - He hits a stick into the ground repeatedly and sings 
           “Yellow Submarine” by THE BEATLES, unenthusiastically. 

           - Sean lays on his back and throws a stone up to himself. He 
           coughs. A sudden, DEEP cough. 

           - Sean talks into his cell phone.
                                 SEAN
                        You do deliver? I’ll have a double 
                        bacon cheese burger, fries and an 
                        extra pickle. 
                             (pause)
                        I appreciate the free extra pickle.
                             (pause)
                        Ok, bear with me. If you head into 
                        the middle of nowhere, take your 
                        second left, keep going straight 
                        until you reach a tree, hang a 
                        right and you’ll see me sitting at 
                        the entrance of this MOTHER FUCKING 
                        CAVE!

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

           FLASHBACK

           Sean (30) writes THE NOTE on the counter. He tapes it to the 
           fridge. 

           INT. SEAN AND JESSICA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           From outside the bedroom, Sean looks in on a sleeping 
           Jessica. He chooses not to wake her. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - CRACK OF DAWN 

           Sean rides his bike on a narrow dirt road. He reaches a peak 
           and looks out over the vast wilderness he is about to enter. 
           He descends towards the forest. 

           Sean weaves in and out of rocks and boulders. Suddenly, his 
           BIKE SKIDS and Sean hockey stops sending mud FLYING 
           everywhere. He gathers himself and continues to ride. 

           Sean stops at the top of a hill. Below him in the ravine is a 
           soft flowing STREAM. Sean rides towards it. 

           When he reaches the stream, he stops, jumps off his bike and 
           leans it against a tree. 

           He grabs a sip of water and takes out his map, a notebook and 
           a pen. He scribbles some notes. 

           Sean takes off into the thicket.
           EXT. HILL TOP - DAY

           Sean emerges at the peak of another hill. The forest around 
           him is green and mountainous. He sits on top of the hill and 
           scans the area with binoculars. 

           Again, he takes out his paper and jots down notes.

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           Sweating in the intense summer heat, Sean crouches down next 
           to a stream and splashes water on his face. He picks up a 
           stick and continues.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Sean wears his head torch and reads over paperwork from the 
           National Forest Services as he eats a granola bar. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

           WIDE -- The dimly lit tent surrounded by darkness. 

           EXT. RIVER EDGE - DAY

           CLOSE ON -- A POWERFUL white water RIVER. 

           Sean stands on the edge looking down at the powerful force of 
           nature.

           He writes the number FIVE in his notebook.

           EXT. RIVER EDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           WE HEAR -- The sound of the river CRASHING just out of sight. 

           Sean climbs down into a small valley. He comes to a steep 
           cliff face. 

           He looks back from where he came and realizes he’s somewhat 
           trapped. He either has to climb or backtrack a ways. Sean 
           checks his watch.

                                 SEAN
                        Shit.

           Sean notices a narrow opening along side the riverbank. He 
           walks over to check it out.
           The narrow passage goes through, running dangerously close to 
           the river. Sean proceeds forward.

           He arrives at a gap dissected by a log. Sean checks it’s 
           sturdiness and makes his way across. 

           Walking one foot in front of the other, he steadily and 
           smoothly crosses and avoids a twenty foot drop into water.

           Once he’s over the log, Sean walks up to the rivers edge. He 
           puts his bag down and lights up a CIGARETTE, while he turns 
           his cell phone on.

           NO SERVICE. His battery bar flashes. Sean turns it off to 
           save power.

           Sean makes one last note and slaps his book closed. He takes 
           a step forward and... 

           CRACK!

           A weak group of branches BREAK and uncover a GAP that falls 
           down to the river.

           Sean’s notebook sails out of his hands. His LIGHTER flies 
           into the river. His CIGARETTE lands next to the tree. 

           Sean grabs the ground and catches his fall. He pulls himself 
           up.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (stunned)
                        Fuckin a. 

           He looks over to what he was about to fall into. A gully,  
           pulling directly into the fast flowing river.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Sean hikes along with a smile on his face. He walks directly 
           towards us. When his face fills the screen, he stops. A new 
           look overcomes him. One of... confusion. 

           We see what Sean sees.... Trees. Trees that have been there 
           for hundreds of years. Trees that have not moved. But, these 
           trees are unfamiliar. 

           Sean looks at his map and then at the terrain ahead of him. 
           The woods all look the same. 
           EXT. WOODS - DAY - LATER

           Sean skids down an incline kicking up dust. Once again he 
           tries to get his bearings. The woods feel sinister, as though 
           they purposely rearranged themselves.

           He begins to see the reality. He is LOST. Anxiety sets in. 
           His heart races. Sean puts his map down and breathes deeply. 
           He settles himself. He takes action and power walks uphill. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY - LATER

           Sean finds himself at a mountain peak. He gets to the edge of 
           a cliff and looks down. The terrain is rocky and jagged. It’s 
           steep. 

           He looks out over the vast wilderness with his binoculars and 
           then down at his watch. 

           Sean starts to make his way down the steep region of the 
           rocky terrain. Still surrounded by lush green forest, this 
           area is home to many large boulders, alcoves and CAVES. 

           Sean gets on all fours and crab walks down a particularly 
           steep area. He lands on a sturdy rock that sits perpendicular 
           to the almost vertical mountain side. Sean rests a moment.

           He notices that somehow, someway he managed to get himself 
           stuck in a dangerous situation. 

           Sean decides to edge his way off the rock ledge. Using small 
           trees to help himself down. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY 

           With his hand on a sturdy stump, Sean finds his footing. He 
           lowers himself down and reaches for a root without checking 
           it’s stability.

           He grabs the root and it PULLS OUT! 

           SLOW MOTION -- Sean falls backwards. 

           He heads down an EIGHTY FOOT INCLINE. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           REAL TIME - Sean BOUNCES down the cliff side, rolling over 
           UNCONTROLLABLY. 

           He gets flipped horizontally as he flies down the mountain, 
           scraping and SMACKING everything around him. 
           He reaches out his arms, trying to grab anything to slow his 
           fall. Sean SLAMS his mid section into a group of SHARP ROCKS. 

           Sean’s shin SMASHES into a tree sending his body into a 
           helicopter motion. 

           Finally, he flies off a three foot ledge, pounding the flat 
           ground with his FACE. 

           Sean lays MOTIONLESS on the forest floor WHERE WE FIRST FOUND 
           HIM.

           CLOSE ON -- A stream of BLOOD trickles out of his HEAD.

           EXT. CAVE - LATE AFTERNOON

           PRESENT

           CLOSE ON -- The last few droplets of water TRICKLE out of a 
           water bottle. 

           Sean raises his shaky hand and pours the remaining drops into 
           his dry mouth. His eyes are blood shot and his lips crusty.

                                 SEAN
                        Gotta find water, Sean. 

           EXT. THICK WOODS - MINUTES LATER

           Sean pushes himself slowly along the forest floor. 

           He grabs leaves off bushes and licks them. He sees a few 
           light DEW DROPS on another bush and heads for it. He sucks 
           the moisture off.

           Sean looks for damp soil. He furiously digs a hole. He digs 
           and digs. No water.

           Frustrated and exhausted, Sean falls on his back and lays 
           down to die, it seems. 

           We hear birds, light wind and SOMETHING ELSE. Something faint 
           and soothing. Sean hears it too. The very sound puts life 
           back into his veins. He rests his ear to the forest floor and 
           listens...

           The sound becomes clear.

           RUNNING WATER. 

           Sean drags himself in the direction of the sound.
           A hundred yards from the safety of his cave, Sean hears a 
           twig break and whips his head around. He scours the thick 
           forest. 

                                 SEAN
                             (paranoid)
                        Hello?

           Sean gets to the top of a small hill and looks over. We see a 
           STREAM eighty yards away. Sean heads toward it. 

           SUDDENLY, he stops and hides behind a tree. 

           CLOSE ON -- Sean’s face, stricken with fear as...

           A LARGE EMACIATED MALE BLACK BEAR paws for fish in the 
           stream. This bear looks ABNORMALLY thin.

           The bear catches a scent in the wind and points his nose to 
           the sky. He smells something bloody. 

           Sean crawls as fast as he can back towards his cave. His 
           shattered leg drags along the ground. As every rock, stone 
           and bump jolts him with intense waves of pain. 

           The bear heads in Sean’s direction, sniffing the ground and 
           the air. 

           Sean makes it up the small hill and drags himself back into 
           the cave. He crawls in deep and faces the opening. 

           SEAN’S POV -- The large head of the BEAR appears in the 
           distance.

           Sean frantically looks around for a weapon. He rifles through 
           his equipment finding an ELASTIC CORD WITH HOOKS.

           Sean hooks the ends to the opposite sides of the cave and 
           grabs a jagged golf ball size ROCK. He places the rock in the 
           middle of the cords and pulls back as far as he can.

           The bear reaches the cave opening. He sniffs the ground where 
           the bandages were buried. Sean is silent.

           The bear pauses cautiously, before crawling inside. Sean, 
           takes a deep breath and releases the slingshot. 

           The rock SMASHES the bear in the EYE. Blinded and startled 
           the bear rolls on the ground, pawing it’s face. It takes off, 
           running away, yelping. 

           Sean exhales.
           EXT. MOUNTAINS - SUNSET

           TIME LAPSE -- The sun falls behind the mountains until it is 
           dark.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           WIDE -- Pitch black forest. An abundance of crickets, owls 
           and cicadas assaults our ears. 

           A beam of light dissects the darkness. 

           CLOSE ON -- Henry uses his HEAD TORCH. 

           GNATS fly ferociously around Henry’s light. He slaps and 
           swipes at them, spitting the bugs out of his mouth. It gets 
           so bad, he can barely see.

           Henry shines his torch past something that catches his 
           attention. A small pile of ASH surrounded by a circle of 
           rocks. 

           He turns and sees a pile of sticks and an area of grass that 
           has been flattened. Sean’s campsite. 

           Henry walks over to the ash and inspects a bit on his finger 
           tips. 

                                 HENRY
                             (calling into the 
                              distance)
                        Sean?!

           Henry continues into the night.

           EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Sean’s head torch rests on a rock providing light as he 
           tightens his knife to the end of a long stick with rope, 
           creating a SPEAR.

           He SUDDENLY whips his SPEAR in a defensive position.

           Sean surveys the outside of the cave. No bear. Nothing but 
           trees. Paranoia and delusion his newest enemies.

           He rests his spear along the cave wall and clicks off his 
           torch.

           Sean lays half in and half out of his cave. It’s a clear 
           night and the stars glow magnificently through the trees. 
           He soaks in the moment, aware his opportunities to witness 
           beauty are quickly running out. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Henry is out of breath. He stops at a tree to rest. He checks 
           his digital watch.

           5:27 AM

           Henry sets the alarm then chops down a leafy branch.  He puts 
           a stick vertically into the ground right in the middle of 
           Sean’s closest BOOT PRINT. 

           Finally, he places the branch over himself and rests against 
           the tree. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY 

           FLASHBACK 

           Behind the TEN YEAR OLD HENRY... the fire spreads. Henry 
           jumps on the flames, once he realizes. He manages to smother 
           some, but not enough. 

           Before he knows it, the flames are high and the smoke is 
           thick.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY 

           William packs up his sleeping bag. YOUNG SEAN drops some 
           sticks next to the FIRE PIT. 

                                 WILLIAM
                             (to Sean)
                        Mind getting that started there, 
                        bru?

           Sean checks his pockets. Nothing. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        Henry must have taken it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Taken what?

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        My fire starter.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why?
                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        He was pissed he couldn’t do it.

           William’s fatherly instincts ignite.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (calling out)
                        Henry?!

           EXT. TREE - MORNING 

           PRESENT

           Henry’s alarm goes off. He checks the time.

           5:40 AM

           Henry stands up immediately, takes a chug of water and goes 
           back to work, heading deeper into the wilderness. 

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           Sean breathes heavily. Sick, hungry and dangerously 
           dehydrated. 

           With shaky, weak hands Sean pulls out the can opener on his 
           swiss army knife. He picks up a can of tuna and tries to make 
           an incision. He is too weak. The opener slides off the can 
           again and again....

           Sean hits the can of tuna against a protruding rock. He hits 
           again and again until it pierces. 

           Tuna water shoots out and Sean quickly puts his mouth on the 
           hole. He tilts the can upside down and pours the liquid into 
           his mouth. The moisture is insubstantial, but satisfying none 
           the less. 

           Sean eats the tuna out of the smashed can with his dirty, 
           bloody fingers. 

           EXT. CAVE - SOME TIME LATER

           INTERCUT -- SEAN IN CAVE/MEMORIES

           Sean leans against the cave wall. He takes a picture of 
           Jessica out of his wallet. 
           DINING ROOM 

           Sean and Jessica around the dinner table with family and 
           friends. Sean tells an animated story waving his arms and 
           Jessica laughs, genuinely. She puts her hand through his 
           underneath the dinner table.

           Sean stares at the picture. Moisture in his eyes.

           BEDROOM

           Silhouette of Sean and Jessica making love in their bedroom. 
           Jessica straddles Sean who sits upright. She leans her head 
           back and Sean kisses the bottom of her neck and chest. 

           Sean fights back tears with all his might. He puts the 
           picture to his face and cries on it. The emotional pain is 
           worse than any of the injuries his body has sustained. He 
           wipes the tears from his face. 

           After a deep breath. 

                                 SEAN
                        Keep it together. 

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           Henry tracks through the forest. He arrives at the cliff face 
           Sean failed to climb. The terrain is rocky and tracks are not 
           easily visible. 

           He notices some disturbed soil and rocks at the bottom of the 
           cliff. 

           Henry heads for the narrow path around the cliff, same as 
           Sean. He follows along until he reaches the thick FALLEN TREE 
           over the stream. Doubting Sean crossed this path, he 
           hesitates before crossing. 

           Across the gap, Henry sees the CIGARETTE BUTT. 

           He sprints over the log with ease. To his left the river 
           flows with frightening speed. Henry reaches the cigarette 
           butt and picks it up. 

                                 HENRY
                             (smiling)
                        Still smoking.
           He takes one step and CRACK. Henry disappears into the earth.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           VERY WIDE -- THE STILL WILDERNESS. 

           A hawk shrieks in the distance.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER RAPIDS - CONTINUOUS

           Henry surfaces in the white water with a loud and desperate 
           GASP. In a flash, he is pulled underneath again. He forces 
           his head up and tries to take a breath, but the water SLAPS 
           him in the face and he CHOKES. 

           Henry kicks and swings his arms wildly in an effort to gain 
           control, but the water effortlessly tosses him around. 

           Finally, Henry manages to lay flat on his back and extend his 
           legs out front. He flies past boulders large and small, round 
           and jagged. 

           Henry hits a rock with his legs and bounces off of it. The 
           current pulls him down. Henry fights to the top and takes 
           another huge breath.

           Laying on his back, Henry goes through two boulders three 
           feet apart. His rifle, still around his shoulder and turned 
           horizontally, CATCHES both rocks. 

           Stuck between, Henry grabs hold of the bolder over his right 
           shoulder. The movement sets the gun free, but not before 
           Henry has his hands tightly gripped around the top of the 
           rock. 

           He climbs up and catches his breath. The boulder is small and 
           the water thrashes VIOLENTLY around him on all sides. The 
           river’s edge is well out of reach. Henry is trapped. 

           He takes out his BINOCULARS. He looks DOWN river and sees a 
           group of boulders dissecting the rapids. The succession of 
           boulders reach the edge of the river. 

           Henry turns UP river. He notices a large dead tree 
           overhanging the rapids thirty or forty yards away. A very 
           thin and dying section of wood keeps the large trunk from 
           falling into the river.

           Henry puts away his binoculars. He takes the RIFLE off his 
           shoulder, cocks it, aims at the tree and fires. 
           CLICK.

           Henry shakes the rifle to get some water out. He cocks and 
           fires again. 

           BANG!

           Part of the wood explodes. Henry readies. He cocks, aims, 
           fires.

           BANG!

           More wood is blasted. The trunk shifts. Again, Henry cocks, 
           aims and fires.

           BANG!

           The large branch DISLODGES! It falls into the water and comes 
           storming towards Henry. The log moves very quickly. It gets 
           closer, Henry braces for it.

           The log SMASHES into the two boulders. Henry takes a huge 
           breath and LEAPS onto the log, bear hugging it. 

           The log spins over and over with Henry going in and out of 
           the water. It shoots down the rapids towards the DISSECTING 
           BOULDERS. 

           As he gets dunked and splashed in the face, he slides down 
           the log to avoid a collision with the boulders.

           Once again he braces for impact. The log SLAMS into the row 
           of rocks. Henry is JOLTED, but hangs on. 

           The power of the water holds the log in place, giving Henry a 
           chance to climb up onto one of the boulders, just as the 
           water SNAPS the log in half. 

           Henry jumps his way across the river. He reaches the river 
           bank and climbs up onto safe ground. 

           EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Henry plops down and catches his breath. He twists his ruck 
           sack around and unzips it. He pulls out the radio. Water 
           spills out of its pores. 

           Henry looks around the river bank and at the unfamiliar 
           forest. In the midst of saving his life and checking his 
           equipment, he forgot about the most important new development 
           in this journey. He lost Sean’s tracks. 

           THUNDER overhead. The sky is GREY. Henry looks up. 
                                 HENRY
                        Don’t rain. 

           EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

                                 SEAN
                             (head to the sky)
                        Please rain.

           A drop here and there turns to a light drizzle. Sean sticks 
           his head out of the cave and lets it hit his face. 

           The light drizzle turns to strong rain. He opens his mouth 
           wide. The strong rain turns into a downpour. 

           Sean slowly pulls himself up and back into his cave. He grabs 
           his rain coat and returns to the entrance. He digs a hole in 
           the mud.

           Sean places his rain coat into the mud hole keeping the water 
           in. The pocket fills up quickly.

           In a dehydrated fury, he slurps the water and waits for it to 
           refill again. 

           Sean appreciates the euphoric sensation of water reaching 
           every corner of his body. He leans back and lets the rain hit 
           his face. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The rain pours as Henry searches ferociously for a sign of 
           Sean. He scours the ground looking for footprints as the 
           water washes away all traces. 

                                 HENRY
                        Sean?!

           Henry grabs bushes looking for breaks, trees looking for 
           scratch marks. The rain comes down so hard, he can barely 
           see. He searches like a madman. 

           Henry spots something on the ground. He kneels down to 
           investigate. As quickly as he stopped, he stands up and 
           nervously examines the foggy forest. His visibility is very 
           limited.

           A slight movement in the bushes ahead. White breath emerges 
           from the thicket. Henry’s eyes widen. 
           The ONE-EYED BEAR emerges thirty feet away. It walks slowly 
           towards Henry with his head down. The bear is THIN, HALF-
           BLIND and desperately hungry. Henry puts his hands up over 
           the top of his head.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (shouting at the bear)
                        HEY!

           The bear pauses for a moment. Henry takes the rifle off his 
           back. 

           Without warning the bear CHARGES!

           Henry cocks the rifle and raises it to his shoulder.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        STOP!

           The bear continues. Henry has no choice this time.  

           CLICK. Oh shit. 

           The bear SLAMS into Henry’s mid-section, knocking him to the 
           ground, sending the rifle flying. With immense strength the 
           bear CLAWS and BITES. Henry kicks and punches for his life. 

           The bear tries to bite Henry’s stomach, but grabs his shirt. 
           It thrashes it’s head, shaking him like a rag doll. 

           Henry fights violently. The bear goes for his FACE. Henry 
           shields and the bear BITES his FOREARM. With his other hand, 
           Henry reaches for the KNIFE on his belt. He pulls it out and 
           slams it into the bears PAW.

           The ONE-EYED BEAR yelps and backs off. Henry hurriedly gets 
           up and climbs a TREE. The bear watches him go up. 

           Once out of reach, Henry looks down. The bear stands on his 
           hind legs and looks for a grip.

           Henry notices the bear has ONE EYE. His blind eye looks 
           recently wounded. Sean? Possibly?

           The bear starts to climb, struggling because of the injury. 
           Henry ascends even farther up. 

           The bear reaches Henry’s feet, biting and pawing at his 
           shoes. Henry kicks in defense.

           The bear loses it’s balance and drops to all fours looking up 
           at his potential dinner. 
           Henry reaches some sustainable branches and gets comfortable. 
           The bear circles down below, limping and grunting. 

           Just like that, the rain stops. The sun pokes through. The 
           ONE-EYED BEAR lays down next to the tree, licking his wounded 
           paw. 

           Henry, once again out of breath and in need of a 
           psychological re-charge, puts his head back. From his ruck 
           sack, he pulls out hydrogen peroxide and pours it on his 
           forearm. He wraps it tight with a bandage.

           Henry looks down at the bear. The bear looks back up. Henry 
           puts his head back and closes his eyes...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           FLASHBACK

           YOUNG HENRY (10) coughs on the ground as the fire spreads all 
           around him.

           EXT. CAMPGROUND - CONTINUOUS

                                 WILLIAM
                        Henry?!

           A light mist of smoke reaches William and young Sean. They 
           exchange worried looks and take off running. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Chuck! Get up!

           Chuck pops his head out of the tent and scrambles to come 
           help, having no idea what’s going on. 

           The father and son RACE through the woods. They quickly reach 
           heavy smoke. 

           EXT. FOREST FIRE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry covers his face with his hands. He gets up and runs 
           towards fresher air.

           William and Sean arrive to the fire which is now OUT OF 
           CONTROL and growing rapidly.

           William stops Sean. He shouts over the LOUD crackle of the 
           flames. 
                                 WILLIAM
                        You wait here! If you see your 
                        brother, get him out of here!

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        What about you?

           William heads right into the flames. He shouts for his son.

                                 WILLIAM
                        HENRY?!

           Sean waits anxiously just beyond harms reach. He also shouts 
           for Henry. 

           William is in the thick of it. He dodges the fire searching 
           desperately for his son.

           In the blink of an eye Henry comes DARTING out of the smoke 
           towards Sean, who grabs and hugs him.

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                             (screaming)
                        Dad!! I got him!

           William hears Sean’s faint voice. Before he can respond, a 
           LARGE FLAMING TREE BRANCH falls on his head, knocking him to 
           the ground. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad?! I have Henry!

           Henry coughs and cries. The fire is vast now. It engulfs 
           acres of forest.

                                 YOUNG SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I HAVE HIM!!

           Sean holds off as long as he can, but it becomes too 
           dangerous for himself and his little brother. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN (CONT’D)
                        We gotta go Henry!

           He tries to drag his younger brother away. Henry screams the 
           way only a ten year old can. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        Dad!! 

           His voice is lost in the swell of the flames. Chuck comes 
           running up behind them.
                                 CHUCK FOLEY
                        WILL?! WILL?!

           The flames are too large now. Sean and Chuck pull Henry away 
           as he screams for his father.

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        DAAAAAAAD!!!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. TREE - DAY

           PRESENT

           Henry screams in his sleep and is suddenly awakened by the 
           tree SHAKING. The bear stands on it’s hind legs pushing 
           against the trunk. 

           Henry FALLS. He catches a lower hanging branch with his 
           unwounded arm. 

           The bear swipes, but Henry lifts his legs, the claws just 
           missing his feet. The branch starts to break.

           Henry fights through the pain of his bad arm and switches 
           hands, before the branch snaps. He finds some footing and 
           climbs back up to a safe height. 

           Henry gathers himself. 

           The rifle is twenty feet away from the base of the tree. The 
           bear is ten. He takes a swig of his water. 

           EXT. CAVE - DAY

           The cave is a mess. Blood, food wrappers, empty bottles, 
           grungy clothes strewn all over the place. No organization.

           Sean breathes heavily. He lays on his back staring at the 
           cave ceiling. He’s even skinnier, hurting and losing his 
           mind.

           WE HEAR -- STEPS at the foot of the cave. 

                                 SEAN
                             (attentive)
                        Hello?! Please god.

           A shadow outside.
                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m in here!

           Jessica pokes her head in and enters.

                                 JESSICA
                        Baby?

                                 SEAN
                        Jess. Gorgeous. What are you doing 
                        here?

                                 JESSICA
                        You’re late.

                                 SEAN
                        I know. I’ve been, stuck. In this 
                        cave.

           Jessica lays down on her stomach next to Sean. He is so happy 
           to see her. 

                                 JESSICA
                        When are you coming back? Gail is 
                        killing herself at the shop.

                                 SEAN
                        She’s a tough cookie. She can 
                        handle it.

                                 JESSICA
                             (smiling)
                        You wanna hear something cool?

                                 SEAN
                        Course.

                                 JESSICA
                        I’m gunna sell one of my sketches.

                                 SEAN
                        Finally, someone recognizes genius.

           Jessica nudges him for the sarcastic remark. Sean smiles.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations babe.

           Jessica’s cute smile quickly fades. Sean puts his hand on her 
           cheek. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        You look sad.
                                 JESSICA
                        Things are quiet when you’re not 
                        around. Just come home.

                                 SEAN
                        God, you are so beautiful.

           SNAP. Jessica DISAPPEARS. 

           Sean looks confused for a moment. He lays his head back. 

           EXT. TREE - DAY

           The sun beats down hard. Henry sweats. 

           The bear circles below, limping and grunting out of 
           frustration. Henry takes notice of the bizarre behavior. 

           Abruptly, the bear heads into the thicket, turning to look at 
           Henry, one more time.

           Just like that, the bear is gone. Henry waits quietly in the 
           tree. He puts his head down and listens. 

           He takes out his binoculars. Henry waits another moment, 
           before slowly making his way down. Henry stops and looks 
           around, again. No sign of the bear. He continues to descend.

           Half-way down, Henry plants his foot on a weak branch and it 
           CRACKS.

           The ONE-EYED BEAR comes darting out of the thicket!

           Henry pulls himself up quickly. The bear reaches the bottom 
           of the tree and swipes at Henry’s feet. Henry scrambles to 
           his safety branch. The bear stands on his hind legs and looks 
           up. 

           Henry is FURIOUS. The bastard tricked me!

                                 HENRY
                             (at the bear)
                        You MOTHER FUCKER!
                             (to the sky)
                        SHIT!
                             (to the bear)
                        Leave me, the FUCK alone! You got 
                        the wrong guy. I protect you!

           Henry whips his head around and notices a BRANCHY TREE STUMP 
           next to his tree. An idea. 
           He opens up his ruck sack and takes out a LONG PIECE OF THICK 
           ROPE and begins tying knots....

           EXT. TREE - SOME TIME LATER

           Quiet around our tree. 

           CLOSE UP - Henry’s eyes move back and forth. He looks for the 
           ONE-EYED BEAR who has, once again, DISAPPEARED.

           A LASSO, like the SNARES Henry used to cut, is lowered onto 
           the forest floor.

           Henry drops a piece of Beef Jerky in the middle of the 
           circled rope. The rope is tied around Henry’s mid section. On 
           the other end is another, smaller lasso. 

           He waits. No sign of the bear. Henry breaks off a branch near 
           his head.

           CRACK. 

           The bear RUSHES out of the thicket.

                                 HENRY
                        Alright.

           The bear walks to the tree base. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        When shit hits the fan, you gotta 
                        make a move.

           The bear steps closer to the lasso.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           The bear sniffs and eats the beef jerky.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Has hit.  

           The ONE-EYED BEAR steps in the middle of the LASSO with his 
           injured paw. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        The fan. 

           Henry LEAPS OFF the other side of the tree. The rope TIGHTENS 
           and catches the bear’s PAW. 
           Henry hits the ground HARD and the bear’s caught foot SLAMS 
           against the tree.

           The bear GROWLS. Henry, stunned from the fall, squirms to get 
           the rope off his mid-section.

           The bear swipes, it’s razor sharp claws come inches from 
           Henry’s face. The bear pulls the rope, dragging Henry closer.

           With a sudden burst of ENERGY, Henry pulls himself back, 
           twists out of the rope and hooks it on the branchy stump, 
           trapping the bear. 

           Henry gets up and runs towards the rifle. 

           The bear BITES THE ROPE, ripping it in half and takes off 
           after Henry. Henry reaches the RIFLE and cocks it. 

           The bear reaches Henry.

           BANG.

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           The echo of the gun shot wakes up Sean. Not sure if he 
           imagined the sound, he lifts up his head and tries to shout 
           through his coughing.

                                 SEAN
                             (soft and raspy)
                        Hello? Anybody?

           He puts his head back down.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m in a cave. 

           EXT. TREE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry stands and stares at the carcass of the ONE-EYED BEAR. 
           He bends down and puts his hand on it’s back.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry.

           Henry massages his mid-section, probably having fractured his 
           ribs on the fall. He takes out his map. He follows the river 
           he fell into, but has no idea where he is. 

           Henry turns the bear’s large head over and studies it’s 
           damaged eye. 
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you were shot.

           Henry picks up a small rock and puts it up to the bears eye. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        This is crazy.  

           Henry looks around. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sean?!

           He looks at the bear tracks. It’s my only lead.

           Henry follows.

           INT. CAVE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Sean lays on top of his sleeping bag. He coughs, too weak to 
           react to the pain.

           He holds the picture of Jessica. With shaky hands and 
           moisture in his eyes, he turns the picture over and slowly 
           writes “I’m sorry, I love you”.

           Sean brings the picture to his swollen, crusty lips and 
           kisses it. 

           He places the picture over his heart and covers himself with 
           his raggedy clothes. 

           Sean has prepared his coffin.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry walks fast. He is hurt, hungry and weak, but 
           determined. He marches through the thicket following the bear 
           tracks. 

                                 HENRY
                        Sean?!

           He loses sight of the tracks for a moment, but notices a bush 
           that has been CRUSHED. Henry heads in that direction. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sean?!
           He walks in circles staring at the ground. He scours trees 
           looking for claw marks. Nothing. He gathers his energy and 
           storms uphill.

           Henry climbs hand over foot to higher ground, convinced he 
           will find something promising. Henry reaches the peak of the 
           incline. And.....

           Mountains, valleys, trees, rocks. QUIET. 

           Henry is injured. He is exhausted. And he has FAILED. He 
           failed to find Sean. Henry is LOST, in every sense of the 
           word. He loses control.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Stupid fuck!

           He slams his rifle to the ground.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?! Fucking shit! 
                        Should of fucking been there!

           He grabs a stick and smashes it into a tree. 

           INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Sean hears the faint echo of yelling. He tries to shout.

                                 SEAN
                             (barely a whisper)
                        Help. Help me.

           He coughs and clears his throat, but his voice is only 
           slightly louder.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Help. Please God. Help.

           EXT. WOODS

           Henry plops himself down on the ground with force. His search 
           is over. 

           INT. CAVE

           Sean’s voice gets louder as he fights through the pain. 

                                 SEAN
                        Over here. Help me. Please. 
           EXT. WOODS

           Henry sits for a moment and stares out into the valley. He 
           gives one last try.

                                 HENRY
                        SEAN?!

           No response. Henry slowly picks up his rifle and begins to 
           limp in the other direction, shoulders hanging, DEFEATED... 
           alone.

           INT. CAVE/WOODS - DAY

           INTERCUT -- SEAN IN CAVE/HENRY IN WOODS

                                 SEAN
                        Help!

           Sean looks around the cave, desperately.. For anything. 

           Henry walks away.

           Sean spots something in the dirt. An ACORN! His last 
           chance...

           Henry continues to limp.

           Sean places two fingers in the middle of the acorn and blows. 
           His first couple attempts brings a soft whistle. But, by the 
           third and fourth try, it’s LOUD. 

           Henry walks away. We hear Sean’s whistle. It’s so faint if 
           one was chewing food they wouldn’t hear it. Henry stops. 

           He puts his head down to concentrate. The sound is much 
           clearer. Henry whips his head around.

           Sean puts his last breaths into blowing the acorn whistle.
           Henry runs towards the very familiar sound. He stops and 
           listens. It’s MUCH louder now.

                                 HENRY
                        Sean?!

           Sean hears his name called and looks out through the entrance 
           of the cave.  

           Henry dodges trees and jumps boulders. He jogs up a small 
           hill. At the peak he looks down into the small valley at the 
           base of the mountain. We see Sean’s cave on the other side of 
           the slope. Henry races towards it.

           Sean sees movement in the distance. This time, it’s not the 
           ONE EYED BEAR. This time, it’s Henry. Henry is the last 
           person on earth he expected to see. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sean!

           Henry comes running up to the cave and enters it.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sean, holy shit. Holy shit. 

           Henry hovers over Sean. The brothers lock eyes. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You’re safe, now. You’re safe. 

           Henry wants to hug him, but refrains. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sean. Look at you.

           Sean, painfully smiling, can barely speak. He mouths the word 
           WATER and slowly raises his hand to motion drinking. 

           Henry whips open his ruck sack and takes out a CAMELBACK. He 
           crawls to Sean’s head and puts the tube to his lips. 

           Sean gulps the water, swallowing loudly. He coughs and clears 
           his throat.

                                 SEAN
                             (raspy, but clear)
                        Nice of you to stop by.

                                 HENRY
                        Keep drinking. 
           Sean shakily grabs the mouth piece. Henry, moving with 
           controlled urgency, takes out his first AID kit.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Where are you hurt?

           Sean pours water on his face.

                                 SEAN
                        My leg is broken. Bad. I set it.

           Henry cuts through the bloodied and dirt covered bandage 
           around Sean’s leg. It’s SWOLLEN and bruised, but the wound 
           looks surprisingly healthy. 

           The area where the bone breached the skin has scabbed over, 
           with minor traces of puss.

                                 HENRY
                        Looks fine. We’ll tighten this up, 
                        but I’m not gunna fuck with it.

                                 SEAN
                        The tent poles work well.

                                 HENRY
                        Where else?

           Sean doesn’t answer.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Where else are you hurt?

                                 SEAN
                        My stomach.

           Henry takes off the bandages around Sean’s mid section. His 
           stomach is a combination of WHITE, GREEN, BLUE and BLUE-RED.

           Sean has GANGRENE. It has spread into his chest. Henry cannot 
           hide his concerned expression. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        That bad, huh?

                                 HENRY
                             (covering)
                        You’ll be alright.   

           Henry takes out a clean bandage and re-wraps the wound. He 
           feeds Sean some pain killers.
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        As bad as I want these, you’ll need 
                        ‘em more. 

           EXT. AREA ABOVE CAVE - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Henry runs uphill. He looks out over the trees and spots a 
           clearing, big enough to land a helicopter five hundred yards 
           away. 

           He assesses the sun. Ninety or so minutes of light. 

           EXT. CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry jumps back in front of the cave. 

                                 HENRY
                        Where’s your sleeping bag?

                                 SEAN
                        Could you get a signal?

                                 HENRY
                        I need you to get off your bag.

                                 SEAN
                        If you’ll notice, I’m almost dead 
                        and can’t move. Where is Jess?

                                 HENRY
                        Jess is fine. 

                                 SEAN
                        Why are you alone?

           Henry slows down for a moment.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Henry, talk to me.

                                 HENRY
                        There’s no time, you gotta move.

           Henry PUSHES him off his bag. Sean SCREAMS into...

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           A MONTAGE. The following series of quick cuts has the 
           rhythmic sound of HENRY CHOPPING wood over it.

           - Henry cuts holes into the sleeping bag.
                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        Where are we?

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        In a clearing. Big enough to land a 
                        chopper.

           - Henry chops wood in the forest.

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        Two fires. One for us, the other 
                        for the helicopters.

           - Henry takes two large sticks and attaches them on either 
           side of the sleeping bag creating a STRETCHER. 

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        It’ll have to be tomorrow, but 
                        they’ll see us.

           - Henry drags Sean through the woods on his sleeping bag. 
           Sean winces and moans. Henry ignores his brother’s cries. 

                                 SEAN
                        Henry, goddamnit. Fuck.

           - Henry chops wood.

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        And we’ll get you out of here.

           Henry throws a large log onto a large flame and it BURSTS.

           EXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT

           Sean is wrapped up in as much clothing as Henry could offer. 
           The signal fire, twenty feet away, blazes high. Henry sits. 

           Sean eyes his little brother as he jabs at the flame.  

                                 HENRY
                        What were you doin out here?

                                 SEAN
                        Does it matter? 
                             (long pause)
                        You have a lady?

           Henry chuckles.

                                 HENRY
                        That definitely doesn’t matter. 
                                 SEAN
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 HENRY
                        Never said I didn--

                                 SEAN
                        I know you don’t. Don’t women love 
                        safari guides?

                                 HENRY
                        Some of ‘em do.

                                 SEAN
                        Large ones? What’s the problem?

           The boys laugh. Sean painfully turns his head to look at 
           Henry.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s keeping you warm at night?

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t worry about me. 

           Henry pokes the fire.

                                 SEAN
                        Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah.

                                 SEAN
                        I have to tell you something, but 
                        you can’t mention this to anyone.

           Henry faces Sean, who is all of a sudden on the verge of 
           tears.

                                 HENRY
                        Of course.

                                 SEAN
                        I really don’t want to die. 

                                 HENRY
                        You ain’t gunna die. 

                                 SEAN
                        I won’t see Jess anymore. I won’t 
                        see my kid grow up. 
                                 HENRY
                        Stop, you--

                                 SEAN
                        The thought of her alone, is... 

           Henry starts to tear up.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        You have to tell her something for 
                        me. 

                                 HENRY
                        Whatever you’re gunna say, you tell 
                        her yourself.

                                 SEAN
                        Will you shut up. I need you to 
                        tell her that-- Tell her, she 
                        married an idiot. But one that 
                        really loved her.

                                 HENRY
                        Sean, you’ll see her tomorrow. 

           Henry lays down, facing Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        Why didn’t you write, Henry?

           Henry sighs.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want one of your bull shit 
                        answers. I’m dying. 

           Henry thinks it through.

                                 HENRY
                        I was afraid. I didn’t know what I 
                        was gunna say and the longer I 
                        didn’t say anything, the worse it 
                        got. 
                             (pause)
                        I was angry. At everything. 

                                 SEAN
                        I was the only person you had.

                                 HENRY
                        You still are. The second before I 
                        heard the whistle-- that was the 
                        worst moment of my life. I know 
                        where I need to be, now. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Right here. I have been angry until 
                        right now.
                             (pause)
                        And if I lose you. Nothing will 
                        have changed.

           The boys are silent a moment.

                                 SEAN
                        That can’t be true.

                                 HENRY
                             (confused)
                        Why?

                                 SEAN
                        You pissed yourself at the Castler 
                        wedding.
                             (beat)
                        That. Was the lowest point of your 
                        life.

           Henry laughs. Sean, wipes tears from his face and extends his 
           hand. Henry grips it.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not all on you. You’re my kid 
                        brother. I should’ve made it right. 
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 HENRY
                        We’re both sorry. Over and done 
                        with. 

                                 SEAN
                        Also, no matter what... You found 
                        me. I know you did. 

           Henry gets it, truly. Sean turns over. Henry watches him. 
           After a moment, he gets up and throws more wood on the large 
           fire. 

           Henry sits next to his brother. He lays back. The fire 
           crackles. He can’t. Keep. His eyes...open. 

           EXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT

           WIDE -- The big and little fires in the clearing.
           EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAWN

           The faint sound of thumping wakes up Henry. The camp site is 
           full of thick black smoke coming from the large fading fire.

           Henry, immediately awake, sits up. He scans the skies looking 
           for the origin of the SOUND. We see a small speck in the sky 
           coming towards us.

           Henry, wide eyed, grabs some more wood and takes off his 
           shirt. He throws the wood on the dwindling fire and uses his 
           shirt to fan the smoke and flames. 

                                 HENRY
                        Come on.

           The chopping gets louder and the speck gets closer. Henry 
           fans furiously creating more and more smoke. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        See us.

           It becomes clear that the speck is a HELICOPTER and it’s 
           coming their way. 

           Henry stops fanning and separates himself from the flames. He 
           jumps up and waves his shirt in the air.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        We’re getting out of here.

           The helicopter comes closer. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (overjoyed)
                        Sean! 

           It shoots right over the top of the camp site. On it’s side 
           we see SEARCH AND RESCUE.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sean! They’re here!

           The sound of the chopper mixed with his screaming should have 
           garnered a reaction from Sean.

           Henry is terrified to find out why it didn’t. He walks over.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sean?

           His walk quickly turns into a sprint. He takes the covering 
           off his brother and exposes his face.
           Sean, pale white and eyes open, lays lifeless. He has been 
           DEAD for hours.

           Henry knows immediately. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do this.

           He shakes Sean’s face and takes his pulse. He locks his 
           fingers, straightens his arms and pushes down on his chest 
           rhythmically.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           Henry blows air into Sean’s chest through his lips. He does 
           this on repeat a few times.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Come back. 

           Henry stops the CPR and hugs his brother. He pulls his 
           lifeless body up into his lap and holds him.

           Henry closes Sean’s eyes and rests his body on the ground. He 
           sits with his hands locked around his knees.

           In the background, the chopper lands in the clearing. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. DAVIS HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           HOME VIDEO

           CAMCORDER POV -- Susan records Sean’s eighth birthday party. 
           She enters the room where kids sit in a group eating chips, 
           hitting balloons and laughing.

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Sean, what are you doing? You’ve 
                        got underwear on your head.

           Sean, the crowd pleaser, sits in front of the laughing 
           children and wears tighty-whiteys like a hat. 

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                             (in a theatrical tone)
                        I am not guilty. The underwear was 
                        a gift and I can decide what it can 
                        be used for.
           More laughter. 

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Where’s Henry?

           The camera pans the children. Henry sits in the back, 
           quietly. We focus on him.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Henry, read Sean your note.

           The boys give an “ohhh”.

                                 YOUNG CHILD
                        Henry wrote Sean a love note!

           Young Sean comes to his Henry’s defense.

                                 YOUNG SEAN
                        He’s my brother, morons.

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Henry, hunny, don’t be shy, it’s so 
                        sweet.

           Henry gets up from the back of the room and slowly walks 
           towards the front. 

                                 SUSAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Baby, come here. Henry is giving 
                        his present to Sean.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        Coming!

           The home video pans and we see William Davis come into the 
           living room. He eats from a bag of chips. The whole family is 
           together.

           The children laugh and giggle softly amongst themselves, only 
           a few pay attention to Henry and Susan.

           Henry gets to Sean, who stands in front of the room. Henry 
           hands Sean a SLINGSHOT. He reads off a NAPKIN. 

                                 YOUNG HENRY
                        Dear Sean. This is my slingshot. I 
                        made it myself. I want you to have 
                        it because you are my brother. 
                        Happy birthday. Thanks.

           The boys quickly and awkwardly hug.
                                 YOUNG SEAN
                             (heartfelt)
                        Thanks, Henry.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                THE END
