           EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

           A GLOVED HAND presses a cellphone to the cheek of its owner.

                                 DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                             (through phone)
                        Metropolitan Police, what’s your 
                        emergency?... Hello?... Hello?

           The face of the SPECTACLED MAN with the phone is obscured, 
           but he’s 40s, posh, in a camelhair coat. His hand trembles.

                                 SPECTACLED MAN
                        Listen carefully: there’s a bomb in 
                        the basement of the cathedral. 

                                 DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                        Sir, what is your location?

           The man cocks his head, looking up at:

           AN ENORMOUS CATHEDRAL

           An ornate Gothic dome flanked by spires, reaching to the sky. 
           Marble statues of robed saints stare down at the man. 

                                 SPECTACLED MAN
                        St. Paul’s. 

           The surrounding square is bustling, packed with PEOPLE.

                                 DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                             (panicked)
                        Sir, I am transferring this call. 
                        Do not hang up. Do not hang-- 

           CLICK. The Spectacled Man steps off the curb, casual, and 
           drops the disposable cellphone into a rubbish bin. 

           EXT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY

           A tiny gallery nestled between brownstones on a quiet street. 
           Outside, a young MAN with TATTOOS, late 20s, a Formula 1 ‘F’ 
           inlaid on a wreath on his bicep, smokes by a rubbish bin.  

           A MAN, late 30s, in an impeccable slate-gray-SUIT springs up 
           the steps of the gallery. Confident. Playful. 

           THE SUIT is our male lead, who we’ll come to know later. 

           He moves past Tattoos, tosses a WATER BOTTLE into the trash. 
                                 SUIT
                        Pardon.

           The odd thing is, the water bottle is full.

           We’ll never see his face, but we follow The Suit inside... 

           INT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY

           ...past a few PATRONS trickling through the gallery’s rooms. 
           An aloof ASSISTANT clicks through e-mails. A rent-a-cop 
           SECURITY GUARD paces the floor. A WOMAN works the coat check.

           UPSTAIRS

           The Suit wanders upstairs, past a second GUARD who reads the 
           DAILY MAIL. He heads into a little room off the hallway. 

           The Suit is entranced by a large painting of a SUNSET over a 
           craggy coastline. He pulls up his sleeve, checks the time on 
           his rose-gold vintage Rolex. Tick, tick, tick...

           EXT. LONDON STREET - ACROSS FROM ST. PAUL’S - DAY

           The Spectacled Man sips a cappuccino at an al fresco cafe. He 
           watches as COPS swarm St. Paul’s cathedral across the street.

           On his laptop, several windows are open: one is a PROGRAM 
           rapidly scrolling through potential CODES. His eyes dart 
           between this page and a BROWSER WINDOW. His fingers dance 
           across the keyboard like it’s a piano. 

           INT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY

           Upstairs, The Suit stands, looking at that sunset painting. 
           Three SECURITY CAMERAS, two in the corners and one in the 
           center of the room, are oriented towards him. But, like 
           magic, the cameras TILT AWAY from where he’s standing. 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - ACROSS FROM ST. PAUL’S - DAY

           On the Spectacled Man’s SCREEN we see a stream of each of the 
           gallery’s CAMERA FEEDS. He’s manipulating the cameras. He 
           presses a small BLUETOOTH earpiece, and speaks low:

                                 SPECTACLED MAN
                        Perfect view from here.  
           INT./EXT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY

           A SERIES OF SHOTS in and around this unassuming gallery:

           -Upstairs, The Suit pulls a thin satchel from inside his 
           coat. He flicks it open, revealing an array of tools: knives, 
           scissors, pliers. He chooses a thick blade.

           -Outside, the Tattoos flicks his burning cigarette into the 
           trash can. BOOM!!! An explosion, and the can catches fire: it 
           wasn’t water in that bottle. Tattoos ducks inside. 

           -In the gallery, PATRONS turn, concerned at the activity. 

           -Tattoos pulls the FIRE ALARM and it SCREECHES.

           -Guard 1 rushes outside to find the flaming trash can. 

                                 GUARD 1
                        Call the police! Now!

           -Guard 2, upstairs, drops his Daily Mail, grabs an 
           EXTINGUISHER from the wall, and rushes downstairs. 

           -Outside, at this very moment, a TOUR BUS full of TOURISTS 
           arrives on the street corner. Guard 1 watches, daunted, as a 
           throng of people spill out and head toward the little museum.

           INT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY

           The Suit grabs the SUNSET PAINTING hard. TEARS it from the 
           wall, and SLASHES the suspension wires anchoring it to the 
           sheetrock. He slices the frame and discards the wood. 

           In one fluid motion, he rolls up the canvas. He takes a 
           plastic CYLINDER from inside his coat, and fights to wedge 
           the canvas, a tight scroll, inside. But it won’t quite fit...

           EXT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY 

           One guard struggles to evacuate guests as the tour group of 
           people try to enter the museum, another douses the trash can. 
           They’re totally overwhelmed. The assistant rushes outside.  

                                 ASSISTANT
                        The police are coming as fast as 
                        they can, but they’re strapped.

                                 GUARD 1
                        What do you mean?
                                 ASSISTANT
                        Some big emergency across town!

           INT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY

           The Suit can’t fit the painting in the tube. There’s SHOUTING 
           from downstairs... He freezes. Running out of time. Onto plan 
           B:

           The Suit wraps his scarf around his elbow like a bandage. 
           Timed with the cry of the alarm, he SMASHES the window. Glass 
           shatters, an external alarm SCREECHES. He HURLS the painting.

           It SOARS out the window. The canvas unfurls, SCRAPES a ledge, 
           SLAMS the lip of a dumpster, and BOUNCES twice on the ground.

           From his pocket, The Suit pulls what look like a couple of 
           black GOLF BALLS. He sets them on the ground, and they roll a 
           ways before silently EXPLODING IN A PLUME OF DENSE SMOKE. 

           As he leaves, The Suit presses his tiny BLUETOOTH EARPIECE. 

                                 SUIT
                        Slight change in plan.

           He shakes out his arm, and little shards of glass hit the 
           floor. The face of that beautiful Rolex is now CRACKED.

           EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE GALLERY - DAY

           A black ROLLS ROYCE glides up the alley. The painting lies in 
           an oily puddle, and a GLOVED HAND plucks it from the cement.

           INT./EXT. BRONSON AND WEBB GALLERY - DAY

           It’s chaos downstairs. Guard 1 perks up at the sound of the 
           new alarm. The Suit comes downstairs, joining the fold... 

           Guard 1 shuffles past the crowd to see, on the security 
           monitor, the UPSTAIRS ROOM IS FULL of SMOKE. Holy shit.  

           Meanwhile, a CRANKY OLD LADY argues with Guard 2 as he ushers 
           her out. But The Suit swoops in, takes her by the arm. What a 
           gentleman. Guard 2 is grateful, glad to be rid of her...

           But Guard 1 watches this, concerned. Did that man just come 
           from upstairs? He fights the crowd to follow The Suit out...

           OUTSIDE
           The Suit deposits the old lady on a bench. She opens her 
           umbrella. And when she turns to thank him, he’s gone.    

           When Guard 1 emerges, he’s met by the COPS and FIREFIGHTERS, 
           who have just arrived. He looks over their shoulders...

           The Suit walks briskly. He crosses the street and turns a 
           corner... The ROLLS ROYCE waits for him. He gets in, and the 
           car ZOOMS off, leaving the quiet street behind.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

           A hip, expensive part of town. Fine shops and restaurants.

           EMMA DOYLE, 27, bundled up in a knit cap, long raven hair 
           spilling over her shoulders, peers into the storefront of an 
           art gallery. She’s sweet-faced but serious. Smart. The belief 
           that the world is her oyster -- that she can have it all -- 
           has nearly been beaten out of her. But she can still dream... 

           She stares at a PICASSO drawing. Flecks of pencil, somehow so 
           alive: two simple shapes intertwined. A man and a woman. 

           Her breath fogs the window. She wipes it with her mitten. 

           A group of ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE practically plow over her 
           as they rush into the BAR next door. They’re drunk, laughing.

                                 EMMA
                             (American accent)
                        Oh, sorry. 

           She watches them tumble inside. She heads past the bar, but 
           then -- what the hell? -- changes her mind. She ducks in.  

           INT. COOL BAR - NIGHT

           Emma peels off her winter coat. She’s wearing the hell out of 
           her little sale-rack dress, knock-off Missoni scarf, art deco 
           earrings, and well-worn boots she’s had forever. She peruses 
           the cocktail list: £20 martini after £20 martini. 

                                 EMMA
                        I think I’ll start with water.

           She smiles at the BARTENDER, apologetic. He rolls his eyes. 
           Emma watches the sea of PEOPLE dance, laugh, flirt.

                                 MILQUETOAST GUY (O.S.)
                        Looks like you’re having an 
                        adventure.
           Emma turns. He’s sort of cute. He nods to her water glass. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m easing into my adventure, okay?

           She takes a gulp with a little smile. He laughs. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m going to be very well hydrated 
                        when the adventure starts.

           LATER

           Empty cocktail glasses litter the bar in front of them. 
           They’re both drunk, and Emma talks a mile a minute.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s a crazy life. The travel’s 
                        constant. Dinners with curators, 
                        parties, exhibits and openings. 
                        Sometimes I wake up in my hotel and 
                        I don’t even remember what city I’m 
                        in. It’s kind of fun -- I open the 
                        window and listen down to the 
                        street, try to hear what language 
                        people are speaking. Oh, man, I’m 
                        sorry, I’m going on and on, and--  

                                 MILQUETOAST GUY
                        No, no. It sounds incredible. 
                        Exciting. I don’t... I mean, I’m 
                        just an account manager...

                                 EMMA
                        It is. And the money’s great. But 
                        there’s nothing like the work. 
                        Today, I was restoring an actual 
                        Salvador Dali. You know, stunning, 
                        surreal, all about the gap between 
                        reality and illusion. But this 
                        painting’s covered in craquelure: 
                        dense little spiderweb cracks in 
                        the paint. So I took a very fine 
                        brush we special ordered... and as 
                        I work, I’m thinking... How many 
                        people has this painting touched? 
                        It’s a piece of history for sure, a 
                        huge influence on everyone from 
                        contemporary artists to graffiti 
                        crews... But... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        how many, just, regular people have 
                        seen it and cocked their heads and 
                        thought ‘what does it mean?’ It has 
                        this pull, this power, and I got to 
                        be a part of that. Even just for a 
                        few hours. I got to make it 
                        beautiful again. Touching a piece 
                        like that, it’s such a rush. It 
                        chills you, it terrifies you. 
                        You’ve never felt so alive.

           The milquetoast guy is rapt when Emma’s PHONE RINGS.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, sorry. 

           Her face falls when she checks the number. She considers. 

                                 EMMA
                        Shit. It’s work. I’m sorry. And 
                        thank you for... this.

                                 MILQUETOAST GUY
                        Don’t apologize. Take it.

           But he doesn’t expect her to leave, which she does.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

           Emma answers the call and fights to sound cheerful. 

                                 EMMA
                        Janine? Thank you so much for 
                        calling back. I know I’m behind, I 
                        think I left like ten messages-- 

                                 JANINE (O.S.)
                        Eleven. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m wondering if maybe we can find 
                        a way to extend the forbearance. 

                                 JANINE (O.S.)
                        I’ve stretched it as far as I can, 
                        Miss Doyle. You need to start 
                        making your minimum payment. 

           Emma’s heart sinks. Her voice is small.

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t.
           Over a SERIES OF SHOTS their phone conversation continues:

           -Emma heads home through foggy, cold, springtime London.

                                 EMMA
                        I make minimum wage and pay UK 
                        taxes. I can’t get a better job 
                        without experience and I can’t get 
                        experience without a better job. 
                        It’s a Catch-22. Janine, I’m... I 
                        need your help. If I can somehow 
                        just eek out another month, I can 
                        figure something out. Please. 

           A heavy sigh from Janine.

           -Down one cobblestoned street, Emma can’t help but stop. A 
           STREET VENDOR sells TACKY paintings on the sidewalk.  

                                 JANINE
                        Here I see U Chicago and then the 
                        Academy of Fine Arts in London. 
                        Federal subsidized, Federal 
                        unsubsidized, and private loans... 

           Emma ponders a hideous hot-pink pop art PORTRAIT OF ELVIS 
           PRESLEY. She puts her hand over her phone’s mouthpiece.

                                 EMMA
                             (into phone)
                        Yes, that’s correct.
                             (to vendor)
                        Four pounds.

           The vendor laughs and shakes his head. No way.

                                 EMMA
                             (covering the phone)
                        Give me a break. What did you use 
                        on this, crayon and sidewalk chalk? 

           She touches the edge of the painting and her mitten comes 
           back fuschia. She smirks at the vendor, who has no defense.

           -Emma rides a double-decker bus over the London Bridge. Big 
           Ben, the London Eye, the city illuminated in the distance. 
           The Elvis picture takes up the seat beside her. 

                                 JANINE
                        So your total account balance is--

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, do you have to say it? Please--
                                 JANINE
                        Three hundred fifty-eight thousand 
                        dollars and ninety-six cents. 

           Emma looks as though she’s going to vomit. 

                                 JANINE
                        I need a verbal response.

                                 EMMA
                        Yes. That is my account balance. 
                        The sum of all my stupid ambition 
                        and unrealized dreams that will 
                        haunt me for the rest of my life.

           Janine is quiet on the line.

                                 JANINE
                        Is help from family an option?

                                 EMMA
                        No... I can’t.

           -Emma trudges up the stairs of her modest building.

                                 EMMA
                        There’s got to be something we can 
                        do. An exception to the rules... 

                                 JANINE (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry. There’s just no way 
                        around it. If you don’t start 
                        making payments, you’ll default. 

           Emma stops. She looks up to the water-stained ceiling. 

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you for trying.

           INT. EMMA’S CRUMMY FLAT - NIGHT

           Emma trudges into her studio apartment. It’s a shoebox, but 
           she’s livened it up. Apple boxes for a coffee table with big 
           melted candles; a scarf framed as a tapestry; a huge MURAL in 
           progress on one wall -- a BANKSY recreation. A handcrafted 
           MOBILE hangs from the ceiling, by Emma’s only window. 

           It’s vibrant... on a budget. If it wasn’t clear before, it’s 
           obvious now: the story at the bar was a complete fantasy.

           Emma considers the ridiculous Elvis picture with intensity. 
           She sets it down on an easel. And cranks some HEAVY METAL. 
           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           -Emma’s hands claw the surface of the canvas. Shards of paint 
           chip away beneath her fingernails. 

           -Color drains from a section of the canvas as she holds it 
           beneath a shower faucet. 

           -A pizza-cutter glides across the painting, slicing it.

           -Emma blasts a corner of the canvas with her hair dryer.

           -A spoon from a jam jar splatters the painting. 

           Emma licks the rest of the jam from the spoon. She considers 
           the destroyed Elvis, turns up the music, and snaps open a 
           toolbox. Inside: brushes, solutions, thread, cotton swabs. A 
           mix between a doctor’s kit and an artist’s. 

           She chooses a small swab and begins cleaning the painting.

           LATER

           Morning. Pop-Art Elvis is fixed: restored to its original 
           ugliness. Emma smiles through a yawn. Happy. Fulfilled. 

           She places Elvis on a ledge amongst other restorations: a 
           giant pastel of an avocado, a watercolor of a whale, a Buddha 
           statue with cracks in its enamel, now glued back together.

           Her HANGING MOBILE catches the light pouring in her window, 
           and casts a shadow of a HEART on the wall. It’s a SUNDIAL.  

           She notices, checks the time on her iPhone. Shit! She’s late.

           EXT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           Umbrella overhead, Emma runs across a vast lawn to a grand, 
           sprawling Gothic museum. Spires and stone and history.

           She taps an electronic keycard to enter. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - MAIN HALL - LATER

           Cathedral ceilings, vaulted skylights, masterpieces on every 
           wall. GUARDS, DOCENTS, and RECEPTIONISTS begin their morning.

           Emma rushes through the halls. EDDIE, 70s, British, half-moon 
           glasses and meticulous security guard uniform, passes her.

                                 EDDIE
                        Look out. The shrew’s on the prowl. 
           Emma nods and continues on. But she’s intercepted by ISABEL 
           BENSON, 50s, tiny, broken-in frown, towering stiletto heels.

                                 EMMA
                        Good morning! 

           Benson slaps a heap of file folders into Emma’s arms. 
           Blueprints, notes. Emma clenches the stack with her chin.

                                 BENSON
                        These go upstairs for approval. 
                        Photocopy, file, originals back to 
                        me. Don’t bend them, my god. And 
                        I’ll take my tea in a quarter hour.

           Emma forces a smile and readjusts her grasp. At a locked 
           door, she punches in a security code. The door springs open.  

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - DAY

           DRILLING and HAMMERING. Tarps hang over sheetrock and exposed 
           beams. Plaster dust plumes. Emma walks past a sign that 
           reads: “Don’t mind our appearance. We’re restoring.”

           The corridor spills into a vast room. WORKERS install light 
           fixtures, moldings. Emma stands in the center for a moment.

                                 EMMA
                        Wow. It looks amazing. 

                                 FOREMAN
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        It looks amazing!

           He can’t hear her. She passes him the blueprints. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - MAIN HALL - DAY

           Emma leads different tour groups through the museum:

           LOBBY

           Wearing a docent’s nametag, Emma meets a GROUP. A mix of 
           FANCY RETIREES, BACKPACKERS, and STUDENTS watch her.   

                                 EMMA
                        Hi, everyone. Welcome to the 
                        Dulwich Picture Gallery.

           ETHEREAL SCULPTURE
           In front of a modern glass piece, Emma addresses a gaggle of 
           KIDS in uniforms. A BOY, 6, raises his hand. 

                                 BOY
                        What is it?

                                 EMMA
                        What do you think it is?

                            BOY
                                                          GIRL
           A witch’s head.
                                              A lava ball. 

                                 BOY 2
                        Well, um, I... an octopus! Am I 
                        right, Miss? Is that right?

                                 EMMA
                        It’s art. You can see what you want 
                        to see. Isn’t that cool?

           The kids debate it, LOUD, rowdy now. 

           BAROQUE ROOM 

           Leading a mix of ADULTS and a couple KIDS, Emma pauses by a 
           small portrait of a man: black cloak, white neck cuff. 

                                 EMMA
                        Rembrandt’s painting of Jacob de 
                        Gheyn the third. One of the smaller 
                        of the Dutch Golden Age. Rembrandt 
                        was known for capturing dynamic 
                        facial expressions in his 
                        portraits. Laughter. Anger. Shock. 

           Emma loses herself in the painting for a second. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, and-- it’s been stolen more 
                        times than any painting in history.

           This sparks everyone’s attention. Emma likes this part.

                                 EMMA
                        Jacob’s been taken a total of four 
                        times. On New Year’s Eve, 1966, 
                        thieves carved out a hole in a side 
                        door. Snuck in without setting off 
                        a single alarm. 
           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - 1966 - NIGHT

           A DRILL BUZZES, slicing out a small panel of an old door. A 
           very PETITE MALE THIEF squeezes through and into the museum.

           INT./EXT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - 1973 - DAY

           A YOUNG MAN sprints through the museum with the PAINTING in a 
           plastic grocery store bag. He runs down the steps outside...

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        The second time, a kid just grabbed 
                        Jacob off the wall and threw him in 
                        a plastic bag. In broad daylight.

           ...and hops on his BIKE. He pedals away, legs pumping.

           BACK TO EMMA

                                 EMMA
                        Another time, men dressed as cops 
                        came in and stole him in the middle 
                        of the day. In 1983... 

           EXT./INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - 1983 - NIGHT

           THIEVES dressed in black facemasks and catsuits climb a three-
           tiered ladder to reach the roof of the museum. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        ...it was a bigger job. Thieves 
                        broke open a skylight and rappelled 
                        down into the gallery on cables.

           One thief SINKS into the quiet museum on a wire. With a 
           crowbar, he POPS the painting off of the wall. The ALARM 
           BLARES, and the hanging thief ZIPS right up to the roof.

           BACK TO EMMA 

           MUTTERING amongst the crowd.

                                 EMMA
                        The painting’s been found in some 
                        weird places. Under a bench in a 
                        graveyard. In a taxi. At an army 
                        garrison in Germany. Tied to the 
                        back of that bicycle. But he was 
                        returned each time. 

           A lanky BOY, 11, full of energy, pipes up.
                                 BOY
                        Why’d they give it back?

                                 EMMA
                        Why do you think they gave it back?

                                 BOY
                        They didn’t fancy it?

                                 EMMA
                        No. They abandoned it. The thieves 
                        realized it wasn’t worth the risk. 
                        You see, you can’t take a  
                        priceless painting -- a trophy for 
                        thieves -- the most famous stolen 
                        painting in the world, and just 
                        sell it on the normal art market. 
                        It’s too recognizable. Too “hot.” 
                        And extorting a museum for ransom 
                        money is very complicated. None of 
                        these thieves had a plan. Some got 
                        caught, some got scared and had to 
                        backpedal. So, the painting 
                        survived, found its way home again. 
                        And that is why we call it “The 
                        Takeaway Rembrandt.” 

           The group buzzes. One VOICE cuts through the rest. 

                                 LEO (O.S.)
                             (British accent)
                        1634, I believe. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry?

           Emma has to stand on her toes to find... 

           LEO DESMARAIS, 40, piercingly handsome, confidence in spades. 
           She sizes him up: pointed gaze, scruffy-cool appearance. He’s 
           both sophisticated and effortless. A paradox. 

                                 LEO
                        You said 1632.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s right. 

                                 LEO
                        It was commissioned in 1632. 
                        Completed in 1634. 
                                 EMMA
                        No, it’s 1632. You can check the 
                        plaque, here...

                        The tag’s wrong. 

           Emma, caught off guard, shakes her head. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t think so. Rembrandt worked 
                        fast during this period, and I--

                                 LEO
                        You’re saying it’s impossible?

           He turns to the eleven-year-old boy.

                                 LEO
                        What do you think? Do you believe 
                        everything you read?

           The boy shrugs, looks to Emma. Leo glances at her nametag.

                                 LEO
                        Emma, how about this? Let’s bet. 
                        Twenty pounds. We’ll go look it up. 

           She looks at him. The plaque. Uncomfortable. Second guessing-- 

                                 EMMA
                        I guess it could be a mistake. 

                                 LEO
                        No bet?

           Emma shakes her head and leads the group down the hall. She 
           glances over her shoulder at Leo. What a jerk.

           LATER

           Emma leaves the dispersing tour group, where Benson catches 
           up and saddles her with a fresh stack of files. 

                                 BENSON
                        If you could make an effort not to 
                        get your fingers all over these...

           Leo watches Emma nod and take the blueprints. 

           When Benson leaves, Emma secretly makes a face behind her 
           back. Emma punches the security code and enters the new wing.

           Leo smiles, finding Emma funny. 
           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - RESTORATION AREA - DAY

           Emma and Eddie sit on a bench eating sandwiches. Through a 
           window, they look into the museum’s art restoration area, a 
           sterile room where a RESTORER tends to a corner of a canvas. 
           A RENOIR. She applies solution, dabs with a cotton swab. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Why don’t you ask again?

                                 EMMA
                        They won’t promote me here. It’ll 
                        never happen.  

           Eddie searches for something reassuring as this sinks in.

                                 EMMA
                        I think I finally have to give up. 
                        Move back to Vermont. Call the time 
                        of death on the grand European 
                        adventure. God. I am such an idiot.

           A RESTORER mists a painting with solution. Emma perks up.

                                 EMMA
                        Ooh, ooh. See her? Cleaning that 
                        section? Oils collect a lot of 
                        particles that can damage the--
                        oh, man, look, she’s going to have 
                        to touch up that water spot. Do you 
                        see it? That brown circle?

           Eddie watches Emma, who’s rapt as the painting comes to life.

                                 EMMA
                        She’ll have to go in with a fine 
                        brush. Match that aquamarine color.

                                 EDDIE
                        Just ask one more time. 

           Off Emma, thinking.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - BENSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           With shaky hands, Emma rests a cup of tea on the desk. A bit 
           of liquid sloshes into the saucer. She pats it with a napkin. 
           Benson doesn’t notice, and Emma bites the bullet.

                                 EMMA
                        While I have you, I was thinking... 
                        wondering... if I could follow up 
                        about my progress here.
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                             (no response...)
                        I don’t know if you remember, but 
                        I’m very interested in transferring 
                        into Restoration. I actually have a 
                        Master’s in R&C, and I’d love to 
                        help with the chemical analysis, 
                        the dating process, prep. 

           Benson looks up at Emma, squinty-eyed. Emma soldiers on.

                                 EMMA
                        I could work up to that, of course. 
                        Not trying to run before I can 
                        walk, you know, as they say! I 
                        could clean paintbrushes. Take 
                        notes. Errands. I’d do anything for 
                        the opportunity to be around the 
                        work, even just to observe--

                                 BENSON
                        Emma. 

           Benson sets down her pen, softened. Emma brims with hope.

                                 BENSON
                        People like your tours. And you 
                        know all the workers’ names. I need 
                        you where you are. I’ve given you a 
                        lot of responsibility, do you not 
                        appreciate that? 

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, of course I do--   

                                 BENSON
                        Good.

           Emma’s crushed. She wants to protest, but what’s the point?

           INT. COVENT GARDEN PUB - EVENING 

           A pub quiz. Emma huddles with ALISON, 29, mature, dark-
           skinned, and BERNIE, 28, impeccable, drinking £2 beers. The 
           M.C. holds up a bottle of GORDON’S GIN for all to see.   

                                 M.C.
                        The winning team will be going home 
                        with this saucy mistress, which 
                        retails at Sainsbury’s for 7.99. 

           Emma stares at it, eyes burning with focus. All the day’s 
           disappointment pouring into this moment.
                                 EMMA
                        It’s ours.

           Alison CLINKS her glass with Emma’s.

                                 M.C.
                        Will it be our reigning champions 
                        or these upstart new challengers?

           Bernie to the challengers, a table of BANKER GUYS in suits.

                                 BERNIE
                        You got something to say? You’ve 
                        got something to say about it?

           The banker guys have nothing to say about it. 

                                 M.C.
                        Your sudden death question: 

           Bernie, Alison and Emma do a complicated good luck ritual: 
           table pounding, slapping five, handshakes. 

                                 M.C.
                        When creating the famous Mona Lisa, 
                        painter Leonardo Da Vinci spent 12 
                        hours on which part of his muse? 

           Emma smiles, she’s got this. The BANKERS confer. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s her lips. Everyone thinks it’s 
                        her eyes, but I’m 100% positive.

           Alison and Bernie, trusting, push her up. 

                                 EMMA
                        The lips!

                                 M.C.
                        We have a winner!

           The pub goes WILD. The M.C. holds up Emma’s arm like a 
           boxer’s. Bernie, Emma and Alison celebrate, victorious! 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Emma holds their prized gin like a baby in her arms. Alison 
           and Bernie walk Emma to the mouth of the subway, LAUGHING.  
                                 EMMA
                        What if we did something crazy this 
                        weekend? Let’s take the chunnel to 
                        Paris for a night!

                                 BERNIE
                        I wish I could. Adam’s got a work 
                        party, it’s a whole thing. 

                                 ALISON
                        I’m buried. Brief to write. You 
                        should do it, though! Go alone, 
                        have some fun.

                                 EMMA
                        No. I can’t afford it anyway. I 
                        don’t know what I was saying. 

           They’ve reached the tube.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay, I better go. You guys take 
                        this. Pour one out for me, or 
                        whatever you do for miserable souls 
                        who have internships at age 27.

           Alison pushes the bottle back into Emma’s hands.

                                 ALISON
                        No, you keep it. You deserve it.

           Emma can’t argue with that. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NIGHT

           Emma, hair up, in that same sale-rack dress, this time with 
           cut-out tights, heels, and a thrift-store brooch-turned-
           necklace, sits behind a reception table lined with name tags. 
           Glamorous BRITS trickle in, check their coats, sign in. Emma 
           hungrily eyes a tray of canapes gliding by, for guests only. 

           Eddie, in his uniform, stands watch over the gallery.

           A GROUP of gorgeous, laughing people saunter in. Emma smiles. 
           The GUESTS find their nametags. Amongst them is LEO. 

                                 LEO
                        Oh, hello.

           Emma remembers him instantly, but pretends not to.

                                 EMMA
                        Hi. 
                                 LEO
                        You’re the tour guide.

           He unknots his scarf. His custom suit is perfect. He untucks 
           a corner of his shirt to clean his thick-rimmed glasses. Emma 
           glimpses a taught strip of flesh, just for a second.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s right. 

           Leo scans the nametags. His hands dance over the options.

                                 LEO
                        Dr. Carleton Montgomery? Sounds 
                        like a stiff, don’t you think? I 
                        don’t want to be boring.
                        Allastair Bradford. Prep school kid 
                        who needs his ass kicked. 

           Emma watches him, quiet, as he chooses another.  

                                 LEO
                        Sir Hans Berg. Don’t think I’ll 
                        ever be knighted. Maybe tonight’s 
                        my knight? Do you like word jokes? 
                        I don’t, typically, but that seemed 
                        a good opportunity, so I took it. 

           Emma can’t tell if he’s flirting or if he’s insane.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry. Do you not have a ticket 
                        to this party?

           Leo laughs. Benson rushes over and grabs him by the arm. 

                                 BENSON
                        Mr. Desmarais! We’ve been waiting.

           Leo smiles over his shoulder as Benson whisks him away. Emma 
           beckons urgently to Eddie, and he crosses to her.

                                 EMMA
                        Who’s that guy?

                                 EDDIE
                        Leo Desmarais. Big-time art dealer. 
                        He helped pay for the new wing.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh. Well. He’s also an arrogant 
                        asshole. 
           Across, Leo holds court with Benson and some CRITIC types. 
           When she looks up, she accidentally catches his gaze. The 
           reality is, he’s an extremely attractive arrogant asshole. 

           LATER

           Only a couple nametags remain. Emma touches LEO DESMARAIS’s. 
           Picks it up. Puts it down, catching herself. She watches him, 
           enjoying the party with his friends. 

           With a sudden burst of courage, she marches over to him. 

                                 EMMA
                        You were wrong about the date.

                                 LEO
                        Excuse me?

                                 EMMA
                        On my tour, when you felt the need 
                        to correct me. You can look it up 
                        if you want, I just did. I’m right. 

                                 LEO
                        Then I’m terribly sorry. 

           He means it, and it surprises her.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m here to collect on the bet.

                                 LEO
                        You didn’t take the bet.

                                 EMMA
                        Yes. That is true. I just thought 
                        maybe you’d appreciate the chance 
                        to redeem yourself. As a gentleman. 

                                 LEO
                        I look like a gentleman, huh? Tell 
                        me something. Why did you question 
                        yourself, on the tour?

           Leo pulls out his wallet and thumbs through.

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t. I didn’t. 

                                 LEO
                        You should be more aggressive.

           He produces a 20. Emma decides to takes his advice:  
                                 EMMA
                        The bet was 50.

                                 LEO
                        It was 20.

                                 EMMA
                        50. And... would you please steal 
                        me a canape. I’m starving. 

           He knows she’s hosing him. He sets down a 50. She takes it.

                                 LEO
                        I like you.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 LEO
                        Why don’t you stay? 

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t, I have to work. I’m 
                        supposed to be over there. 

           She turns back to the reception table.

                        Sometimes in life, you can’t worry 
                        about ‘can’t,’ you just have to 
                        join the party.

                                 EMMA
                        Wow. You should embroider that on a 
                        pillow.
                             (as she goes...)

           Fuck. It does...

           INT. PARTY - NIGHT

           Leo and Emma wander through the museum, drinking champagne. 
           Emma balances a little plate, eagerly eating canapes.

                                 LEO
                        So you’re moving home. What about 
                        restoring art?
                                 EMMA
                        I don’t know. We’ll see.

                                 LEO
                        You’re giving up?

           That stings. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s not giving up if you’ve tried 
                        everything.

                                 LEO
                        If you don’t want the answer to be 
                        no, don’t take no for an answer.

           She laughs, sort of annoyed and delighted by him at once. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, no. You are one of those 
                        people! Do you send positive energy 
                        into the universe when you’re 
                        hoping for the 57 bus to come?

                                 LEO
                        I don’t take the bus. 

                                 EMMA
                        Right, why would you?! You’re...   

           Rich. Successful. Posh. Handsome. She doesn’t finish...

                        I’m a lot of things. So are you, I

           They pause before a highly realistic painting of a GIRL 
           sticking her nose in a deep glass of wine. 

                                 EMMA

                        Sorry. The whole construction 
                        area’s sectioned off.

                                 LEO

                        We can’t.

                        want to see. It’ll be fun.

           Emma peers down the hall, away from the party. A GUARD rounds 
           a corner, disappears. Eddie’s preoccupied TALKING to a guest.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay, let’s go fast. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - NIGHT

           Emma punches the security code in the door. It opens, and she 
           and Leo slip into the dark, barren space. It’s quiet. Sacred. 
           Emma flicks on the light. The hardwood flooring is half set, 
           exposed beams run across the ceiling. Dust. Scattered tools. 

                                 LEO
                        Where will everything go?

           His voice echoes. Emma shows him as though it’s another tour.

                                 EMMA
                        They’re putting some Rembrandts 
                        here, the Vermeers over on the 
                        south wall. Jacob de Gheyn, there.

           She crosses to the other side.

                                 EMMA
                        But I would’ve put him here. With 
                        the natural light, it’d be perfect. 

           Leo stands beside her, looking at the empty wall. 

           Their shoulders touch. He extends his fingers, brushes her 
           hand. Unintentionally? Emma’s pricked with excitement.

                                 LEO
                        I have a question. 
           She holds her breath, waiting. He turns to face her.

                                 LEO
                        In my line of work, I acquire a lot 
                        of art that needs maintenance. I’ll 
                        buy pieces that require attention 
                        before I can sell them again, and 
                        sometimes my buyers look to me to 
                        help keep their collections in 
                        perfect condition. I usually go 
                        through Hamilton & Perry, but 
                        they’re too expensive and I want 
                        better quality control. No one 
                        wants to take a chance with a seven 
                        million dollar Picasso. So, I need 
                        someone to work directly for me. 
                        Exclusively for me.

                                 EMMA
                        A restorer?

                                 LEO
                        You should interview for the 
                        position.

           He hands her his business card. Stark, with tiny printing.

                                 LEO
                        Tomorrow, 3 p.m.

                        Mr. Desmarais?

           They turn to see Benson in the doorway. 

                                 BENSON
                        I wanted you to meet someone.

                                 LEO
                        Oh, of course. 

           He hands his champagne glass to Emma. Benson shoots a look--

                                 LEO
                        I asked your lovely docent here to 
                        show me around.

           Emma’s left -- two champagne glasses in one hand, Leo’s 
           business card in the other -- wondering what just happened. 

           I/E. TAXICAB - DAY

           Stately. Rich. Belgravia. Emma peers out the window.
           EXT. LEO’S HOUSE - DAY

           A tall, posh building: pillars and manicured trees. Emma’s 
           dressed up for her interview in her nicest skirt and a white 
           silk top. She walks up the steps. A gold placard above the 
           buzzer reads: Desmarais. This entire massive place is Leo’s. 

           Emma checks her reflection in the shiny gold doorknocker. 
           Rings the bell. ALEXANDER, 50s, professorial, laser-focused, 
           trouble with eye contact, answers the door with no fanfare. 

           He’s the SPECTACLED MAN from the heist we saw earlier.

           INT. LEO'S HOUSE - DAY

           A palatial space. Cool, modern decor mixed with classical 
           architecture. Paintings on every wall, sculptures around each 
           corner. A Cezanne, a Warhol. Emma fights the urge to gawk. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        I’m Alexander, Leo’s associate.

           He walks fast and doesn’t turn around to shake her hand.

                                 EMMA
                        Nice to meet you. Emma Doyle. 

           She spots one PAINTING and balks. Alexander looks back and 
           catches her staring, open-mouthed. She tries to recover.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, I love Gauguin. 

           STUDY

           A trendy twist on an old smoking room, with wrap-around 
           shelves full of books and art. But no Leo. 

           In the center of the room is an easel with a canvas. On the 
           easel: a colorful portrait of a woman’s face. Staggering use 
           of light, more whimsical than realistic in feeling.  

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Tools are in the cabinet to your 
                        left. Washes just below.  

           The painting is torn on one side. Cracks in the paint spread.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry?

           Alexander fans open the doors to a built in cabinet: it’s 
           full of restoration tools. Brushes, solutions, chemicals.
                                 ALEXANDER
                        Here’s a list of the pigments used. 
                        You’ve eight hours. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not sure I understand.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        To restore it. 

           Emma’s shocked. She looks from him to the painting. She 
           freezes for a moment, then pulls off her coat. Determined.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: Emma’s test

           -She puts on a goggles. Pulls gloves over her shaky hands.

           -She gingerly removes the painting from its frame and lays it 
           on a table, atop another, stabilizing liner.

           -With a wide brush, she applies a solution to the surface of 
           the painting. She paints slowly, hardly breathing, determined 
           to be gentle enough not to disturb the surface of the canvas.

           -She sets a sheet of paper on top of the wax-coated canvas. 

           -Day becomes night. Emma throws her hair up in a bun. Hunched 
           over the table, Emma mixes paint colors on a palate.

           -She peels the paper from the canvas. It collects most of the 
           wax; the rest is left in the valleys of the torn canvas. 

           -The woman’s cheek, once torn, now appears to have white 
           CRACKS across it. This is where Emma transitions from 
           scientist to artist. She paints. Careful, slow, precise.

           -Emma stands back, arms crossed, and looks at the painting. 
           The woman is complete, void of any lines or cracks.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Finished?

           Alexander appears and studies her work, judgemental.   

                                 EMMA
                        Is Leo going to look, or...?

                                 ALEXANDER
                        He’s busy. 

           Alexander snaps a photo of the painting with his iPhone. 
           Emma’s eyes flick from Alexander’s face to the painting, 
           searching for any indication of success. But there’s nothing.
           Alexander’s phone rings and he answers immediately. Emma 
           cracks her knuckles. She waits. Hopeful. Petrified.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Leo... Okay. Okay... Yes. 

           He hangs up and turns to Emma. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Thank you for your time.

           She waits for more, but... that’s it. He texts on his phone.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        The car will take you home.  

           Emma pulls on her coat. She looks down and sees her nice 
           white top is speckled with paint. Fighting tears, she goes.

           INT. EMMA’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Emma holds that silk top under the faucet. She scrubs. Hard. 
           Finally she drops the sopping blouse into the sink.

           She pours a shot of the pub quiz gin. Downs it. Grimaces. She 
           takes a deep breath, gathers resolve, takes her phone.

                                 EMMA
                        Hi, Mom. What’re you up to?

           INT. SMALL CAPE HOUSE - VERMONT - DAY

           KATE and MARK, 60s, Emma’s parents, sweet, down-to-earth, 
           fleece and flannel, position something over their mantle.  

                                 KATE
                        Oh, you’re going to laugh. We’re 
                        hanging the picture, the Van Gogh. 
                        I know. We’re provincial, we’re 
                        cliche. But we love it.

           INTERCUT EMMA’S FLAT AND SUBURBAN HOUSE

                                 EMMA
                        The poster? From the gift shop?

                                 KATE
                        We got it framed. We were headed 
                        out to the mall and I thought, they 
                        have a Michael’s, let’s do this 
                        right. It really looks great.

                        And... it reminds us of you. 
                        Everything you’re up to.  

                                 EMMA
                        You guys aren’t provincial. Or 
                        cliche. I miss you a lot.

           Emma’s voice cracks. Her mom hears it. In pep-talk mode:

                                 KATE
                        We miss you, honey. But we’re so 
                        proud that you’re over there--  

                                 EMMA
                        You know, that’s sort of why I 
                        called. Things here have become-- 

                                 KATE
                             (to Mark)
                        Tip it up, sweetie, a little more.

                                 EMMA
                        This is hard, Mom...

           Emma’s intercom BUZZES. She startles. She covers her phone 
           with her hand and presses the button to answer.

                                 EMMA
                        Hello?

                                 LEO
                             (through intercom)
                        Come downstairs.

           Emma’s shocked when she places the voice.

                                 EMMA
                        Mom, I have to call you back. 

           EXT. EMMA’S FLAT - NIGHT

           A Rolls Royce waits at the curb. Emma steps outside as Leo, 
           in a tuxedo, opens the car’s door. She can’t believe it. 

                                 LEO
                        Hurry. We’ll be late.

           Emma hesitates. She looks at his tux, then down at her white 
           t-shirt and holey Levis, her old leather jacket... 

                                 LEO
                        You’re perfect. Come on. 
           He beckons, serious. Off Emma, confused but charmed--

           INT. AUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT

           DEALERS and WEALTHY BUYERS tote numbered paddles. BROKERS 
           bark into phones. Emma and Leo have front row seats. 
           Anticipation ripples as the AUCTIONEER returns to the stage.

           It’s glamorous and exciting, but Emma looks around, wondering 
           what they’re doing here. Is this a date? 

                                 EMMA
                        Did you ever look at my work?  

           But he’s engrossed in his iPhone. Emma, tense, watches as an 
           elevated section of the stage swivels, revealing the next 
           item on the block, behind a wall. It’s a PAINTING.

           It’s small, a portrait in a gold frame. Emma leans forward, 
           realizing... it’s the PAINTING OF THE WOMAN she restored. 

                                 AUCTIONEER
                        We’ll start the bidding at 175,000. 
                        Do I hear 175? 175 do I hear 200? 
                        225? 225 from number 57 in the 
                        back. Do I hear 250? I see 250.   

           The moment is electric. Maybe the best in Emma’s life. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god.

           Leo reaches down and grabs her hand. She squeezes back.

                                 AUCTIONEER
                        Going once, going twice. And... 
                        sold to number 28 in the back 
                        corner for 250,000 pounds.  

           Her mouth falls open.

                                 LEO
                        I think you got the job. 

           Emma’s speechless, exhilarated beyond words. This is a dream.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT 

           Leo leads Emma down the foggy sidewalk. She mumbles, half-
           talking to him, half to herself, as she processes this.
                                 EMMA
                        What if I had screwed it up?

                                 LEO
                        Some people just have it. You have 
                        it. I could tell. 

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you. This is crazy.

           Their eyes lock. A charged moment between them. 

                                 LEO
                        Plus, it was only 250k. You’ll 
                        handle much more valuable pieces.

           Emma balks. Leo opens a door beneath a scalloped awning.

           INT. POSH RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

           A private party in the back room -- a converted bank vault. A 
           giant circular door with a wheel lock, thick mahogany tables, 
           ice sculptures piled with oysters, the POP POP of champagne. 

           Leo introduces Emma to SIMON, 30, shaved head, the badass of 
           the group... and the TATTOOED GUY from the earlier heist. 

                                 LEO
                        Simon’s in charge of operations.
                        He was a Formula 1 man when we 
                        snatched him up. 

                                 EMMA
                        Wow, really? 

                                 SIMON
                        Before I found Leo’s finishing 
                        school for derelict art lovers.  

                                 LEO
                        We’re still working on his manners, 
                        apparently...

           Leo pulls Emma over to Alexander, who speaks to some GUESTS.

                                 LEO
                        Alex you’ve met. My research 
                        consultant, organizational 
                        mastermind, my number two.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Yes. Hello again.
                                 EMMA
                        Alexander, thank you so much. I 
                        want you to know, I’m just so 
                        grateful for the opportunity to 
                        work with you. So... thanks. 

           He nods, cordial but distant. Leo lifts his glass in a toast. 
           As he does, his watch glints -- A ROLEX WITH A CRACKED FACE.

           Leo is THE SUIT from the heist we saw earlier.

                                 LEO
                        Let’s raise a glass. To brilliant, 
                        resourceful, lovely Emma. 

           “Hear, hears”s and applause. It’s incredibly bizarre. And 
           also wonderful. Emma’s glass knocks against Leo’s. 

           LATER

           The party has dwindled. Emma and the guys sit in armchairs. 

                                 SIMON
                        Did you ever want to become a real 
                        painter?

                                 EMMA
                        I like to think I am.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        He means an artist. Not a restorer.

                                 EMMA
                        I like old things. I’ve always 
                        loved the idea of working on 
                        something that had been around for 
                        hundreds of years, something that 
                        would be around for hundreds more.

                                 LEO
                        Something permanent.

                                 EMMA
                        Exactly. Permanence. And becoming 
                        good enough to work on a Cezanne or 
                        a Chagall or a Vermeer, my god. To 
                        me, that was always the goal. I 
                        figure I could aim for that, 
                        instead of, I don’t know, selling 
                        my oil paintings at coffeehouses.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        You’re ambitious.
                                 EMMA
                        Yeah. Of course. 

           When she speaks, Leo’s eyes don’t leave her. Alexander clocks 
           the energy between Emma and Leo. A little displeased--

                                 ALEXANDER
                        How are your skills at dating 
                        pigments and techniques?

                                 EMMA
                        They’re good. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Anything you can’t repair?

                                 EMMA
                        What do you mean?

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Grease damage? A burn? Acid?

           Emma’s unintimidated.

                                 EMMA
                        Yes. Yes. And what kind of acid?

           INT/EXT. HIRED CAR - NIGHT

           The car winds down a street blanketed in early morning haze. 
           Leo and Emma, drunk on champagne and scotch and the insanity 
           of the night, ride in the back, looking out their windows. He 
           passes her an envelope. She peeks -- it’s thick with CASH.

                                 LEO
                        5%. That work for you?

           Emma gapes. Catches herself. Tries to act professional. 

                                 EMMA
                        Couldn’t come at a better time.  

           A silence. Leo gazes at her, then out his window. Cooly-- 

                                 LEO
                        Is there a boyfriend?

                                 EMMA
                             (wry)
                        I don’t like distractions. 
                                 LEO
                        Of course. You’re in love with your 
                        work. That’s why you’re so good.

           She steals a quick glance at him.

                                 LEO
                        What about the Dulwich?

                                 EMMA
                        Not so much that. 

                                 LEO
                        It’s a good job, though. 
                        Prestigious place. Got your ear to 
                        the ground of the museum world... 

                                 EMMA
                        And I cannot wait to quit. 

                                 LEO
                        I was going to ask you about that.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 LEO
                        With my relationships there, I’m a 
                        little nervous. I don’t want them 
                        to come after me for poaching you. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t think they’ll miss me.

                                 LEO
                        Perhaps cut back, but don’t quit 
                        just yet. Let me figure out the 
                        politics of it all first. 

                                 EMMA
                        Okay.

           The car arrives at Emma’s building. She isn’t sure whether to 
           shake hands, to hug, or to let herself out. Leo leans in.

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you for everything.

                                 LEO
                        Thank you.

           He kisses her cheek. Lingers. When he moves to kiss her other 
           cheek, Emma tips her head and catches his mouth by accident.
                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god, I am so sorry. I didn’t 
                        mean to do that. Sorry.

           She’s halfway out the door, but Leo’s unfazed.  

                                 LEO
                        You’re always apologizing. 

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 LEO
                        Even when you’re not sorry. You’re 
                        a phony apologizer. 

           Leo hovers there, challenging. His lips curve into a smile.

                                 EMMA
                        No, I’m not.

                                 LEO
                        Then you’re sorry? 

                                 EMMA
                        Yes.

           He moves closer to her...

                                 LEO
                        You regret it?

           She draws her face to his...

                                 EMMA
                        I guess I’m not sure.

           Just as he’s about to kiss her, she pulls back. He’s left 
           hanging, and she laughs. He can’t help but smile.  

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, now I’m really sorry. 

                                 LEO
                        Fine. Apology accepted.

           He moves away. Emma hesitates. And then goes for it. Kisses 
           him. It’s spontaneous and intentional and hard and soft all 
           at once. He didn’t know she had it in her. Neither did she.

           She pulls away from him and slips out of the car, feeling 
           like she runs the fucking world.
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DAY

           Dressed for her first day of work, Emma quietly enters and 
           walks down the hall, full of nerves and sober regret. No one 
           appears to be home, so she moves down the hall to...

           EMMA’S STUDIO

           Leo’s study has been completely transformed into a workspace. 
           A couple large tables fill the center of the room. On a desk: 
           a microscope with a feed to a large flat-screen computer 
           monitor. And the tools: chemicals, brushes, paint.  

           It’s a laboratory. And an artist’s heaven. Emma’s Shangri-La.  

           Emma absorbs it all. She’s brought her own battered toolbox, 
           but she tucks it out of sight, under a table. When she looks 
           back, Leo’s standing there. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, I thought I’d bring tools just 
                        in case, but, obviously, nevermind. 

           Leo opens his mouth to speak, but--

                                 EMMA
                        I am mortified. I can’t apologize 
                        enough. Last night, that was not 
                        me. I’m here to work and this is my 
                        dream job and I will do nothing to 
                        disrupt that. If you’re okay being 
                        professional, so am I. 

           There’s a part of him that disagrees, but he buries it.

                                 LEO
                        Of course.

           LATER

           Emma wears gloves and a white coat as Leo shows her a 
           painting stretched and blocked over an easel. It’s faded and 
           marred with brown clouds of damage. But below the damage: 
           dots of paint. Pointillism. Barely discernible. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll start researching. Pointillism 
                        needs to be so precise. 

                                 LEO
                        I want it in a week. 

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry... that’s just not possible.
           Leo raises an eyebrow at ‘sorry.’

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. You’re right. I am not sorry. 
                        But that’s not how I work. This has 
                        to be meticulous, precise. You 
                        wouldn’t want me to do a rush job 
                        on this incredible piece.

                                 LEO
                        Get it done right. Get it done 
                        fast. You have one week.

           He turns and is suddenly gone. Emma’s left, miffed at his 
           curtness. Resolved, she slides on a pair of gloves.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           A series of shots as Emma restores:

           -Emma CLAMPS the pointillist painting to her workbench. 

           -One tiny section at a time, she applies solution. Blots each 
           blemish with a swab, cleaning it.

           -Emma makes a phone call as she pores over books. She thumbs 
           through the pages of “A Pointillist’s Toolkit.” 

                                 EMMA
                             (into phone)
                        Janine? Yes. No... Actually, you’re 
                        not going to believe it. I’d like 
                        to set up payments on my account.

           -Under a special LIGHT, Emma inspects some moisture damage. 
           She cringes. Coos to the painting like it’s a baby animal.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, what happened to you?

           -Over time, the film of grime and damage fades, and beneath, 
           flecks of color, dots of the paintbrush, become clear. Leo 
           walks by the door. She doesn’t notice his longing look.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - BENSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma, looking exhausted but satisfied, checks in.

                                 BENSON
                        The water boiler not working?
                                 EMMA
                        No, it is, I think.

                                 BENSON
                        Then are the tea bags not working?

           Emma bites back the urge to react, forces a smile instead.  

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll make you a fresh cup.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma mixes pigments with a mortar and pestel. She straightens 
           when Leo leads JOHN HAYSWORTH, late 30s, icy good looks, a 
           confident, entitled man-child billionaire. Haysworth’s 
           entourage -- KRONIN, 20s, beefy, tight black suit, and SAUL, 
           40s, tall, imposing, chiseled face -- silently trail them.  

                                 LEO
                        Right in here.

           Haysworth’s eyes scan each painting on the walls.

                                 LEO
                        This is Emma, our obscenely 
                        talented restorer. 

           Haysworth tips his head, but he’s focused on a piece nearby. 
           A JACKSON POLLOCK. Ribbons of paint streaked across canvas. 

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        How’d you wrangle this one, Leo?

                                 LEO
                        Isn’t there something about it? 
                        It’s seductive without being 
                        garish. No novelty. If you like it, 
                        fine, if you hate it, fine. It’s 
                        not trying to please you. It isn’t 
                        beautiful by design, or for 
                        anyone’s enjoyment. It just is.

           Emma listens. Haysworth’s poker-faced. Leo presses on.

                                 LEO
                        So much green in this corner. You 
                        think it would upset the eye. But 
                        instead, it’s just this incredible, 
                        bold, ‘fuck you,’ because it works. 

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        I don’t need it.
                                 LEO
                        But you want it. And it’s here, 
                        within reach. Why deprive yourself? 
                        Where’s the joy in that? Every day 
                        it spends here is a tragedy. In two 
                        hours, you could be having a Scotch 
                        in your den, looking at this, 
                        thinking, “that’s exactly where 
                        it’s supposed to be.”

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        My breakfast room.

           Leo catches Emma’s eye, just as Hayswoth breaks.

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        Fine, Leo. Pack it up.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma slides the painting under the microscope, magnifying it 
           on a flat screen monitor. Leo enters and she springs up.

                                 LEO
                        Don’t let me interrupt.

                                 EMMA
                        You were great about the use of 
                        green.   

                                 LEO
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry, I mean you were right about 
                        the use of green. Also you were 
                        great. Which I’m sure you know.

           He hangs onto the eye contact for a moment. 

                                 LEO
                        There’s a party tonight. Lots of 
                        art people. Would you like to come?

           Before she can object--

                                 LEO
                        Strictly professional. I promise.

                                 EMMA
                        Right. Okay. Thank you.

                        shopping. 

           He can’t be serious...

                                 LEO
                        Go. Call your friends. Have fun. 

           INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

           Emma, Bernie and Alison pick through shimmery racks-- 

                                 ALISON
                        Emma, this one!

           She reveals a red strapless dress, draped at the top.  

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, wow. It’s gorgeous. But no. 

                                 ALISON
                        You’re kidding. 

                                 EMMA
                        That’s a vintage Dior. I don’t even 
                        have to look. I can’t afford it. 

                                 ALISON
                        You earned it. You’re making real 
                        money now. Bernie, help me out.

           Bernie eats chocolate truffles from a tray. A HIP SALESGIRL 
           tops off his glass of champagne. He is in heaven.

                                 BERNIE
                        That. With your tits. Don’t be 
                        stupid. Just try it on. 

           Emma, mortified at ‘tits,’ looks to the SALESGIRL, who’s 
           nonplussed. Alison pushes Emma into the dressing room.

                                 BERNIE
                        Especially if you’re trying to 
                        sleep with this guy.

           Emma freezes, silent for a moment. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        I am not. That is not what this is.

           DRESSING ROOM
           Emma peels off her sweater, slips out of her leggings.

                                 EMMA
                        This is my work. My life’s work. I 
                        would never let that kind of thing 
                        get in the way. Plus, he’s a snob, 
                        and he’s impulsive. Temperamental. 
                        A know-it-all. Even if he is smart 
                        and charming and, yes, obviously, 
                        attractive, I still wouldn’t 
                        jeopardize my career for that. And 
                        he would never want... that... with 
                        me either, anyway, I’m sure.

           SHOP

           Emma steps out. She’s striking. Bernie CHEERS. Alison grins. 
           Bernie drags her over to the mirror, but first pulls her hair 
           out of its messy bun. The dress was made for her.

                                 ALISON
                        You’re Audrey Hepburn.

                                 EMMA
                        With student loans. 

           Alison peeks at the tag. Cringes. From across the shop--

                                 SALESGIRL
                        Oh. Your bill’s been taken care of. 

                                 EMMA
                        What? No, that can’t be...

                                 SALESGIRL
                        You’re to have whatever you want. 
                        All of you.  

           Bernie, Alison, and Emma share a glance. 

                                 ALISON
                        Right. He definitely doesn’t want 
                        to sleep with you.

           LATER

           Emma, Alison and Bernie burst out of the store, laughing. 
           Emma’s draped in shopping bags. They all wear fabulous hats.
           INT. MANSION - CONSERVATORY - NIGHT 

           A sleek space filled with stunning PEOPLE. $2000 heels click 
           on Italian marble, a spired glass roof overhead, art on every 
           wall. A JAZZ band plays. A typical party for this set. Emma, 
           hair down, looking killer in her dress, talks to Simon aside.

                                 EMMA
                        He bought a Pollock today.  

           Across the room, she indicates Haysworth, rapt in 
           conversation with Leo and Alexander. 

                                 SIMON
                        That’s Haysworth. Inherited Daddy’s 
                        private equity billions a few years 
                        ago. Now apparently he’s part of 
                        some contemporary Illuminati club, 
                        some Phi-Beta-Blue Blood power-
                        hungry bullshit. 

                                 EMMA
                        Really? What do they do?

                                 SIMON
                        Those creepy snobs? I don’t know. 
                        Steal away and talk about culture 
                        while eating caviar off crystal? 
                        Well. He commissions a lot from us, 
                        so Leo’s gotta kiss the ring.

                                 EMMA
                        What do you mean ‘commissions’? 

           Simon takes a sip of his drink, ignoring the question.

                                 SIMON
                        That was pretty ballsy, how you 
                        told him off.  

                                 EMMA
                        What? Leo thinks I told him off? 
                        That’s... Wow. What did he say? 
                        Tell me everything he said.

                                 SIMON
                        He said that he thinks you’re 
                        brilliant and sexy and perfect. And 
                        you told him to fuck off? 

           She absorbs all of this, completely surprised. 
                                 EMMA
                        That’s not what happened. I just 
                        didn’t want to screw up everything.

                                 SIMON
                        Probably wouldn’t work out, anyway. 

                                 EMMA
                        Why not?

                                 SIMON
                        Leo’s complicated. You’d try to fix 
                        him. He hates that.

                                 EMMA
                        I would never try to fix him. 

                                 SIMON
                        Ah. So you do fancy him, then. 

           Emma shakes her head, caught. She tries to hide a smile.

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Leo stands with Alexander and Haysworth as a waiter brings 
           champagne. Leo can’t help but notice Emma across the room. 

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        How’s everything on your end, given 
                        the timeline?

                                 LEO
                        We’re on track. It’s better we 
                        don’t talk strategy in detail, but--

                                 ALEXANDER
                        It’s a development process, and-- 

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        So we agree, then. Three months. 

                                 LEO
                        Four. Let’s say four.  

           A note of tension in Leo’s voice. Haysworth holds his gaze.

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        Fine. Four.

           Haysworth claps Leo’s shoulder, which rattles Alexander. Leo 
           cracks a smile and motions to the WAITER for another round.
           INT. MANSION - GLAMOROUS PARTY - NIGHT

           Emma plucks a flute of champagne from a SERVER’s tray. 
           Another. The server watches as she quickly guzzles three. 

           Emma gulps her last sip as she beelines to Leo. She motions 
           for him to follow her. She leads him to... a WALK-IN-CLOSET. 

                                 EMMA
                        Look!

           She flicks on the light to reveal a small PICASSO painting.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s authentic, I checked. A blue 
                        period Picasso. In their closet.

                                 LEO
                        Probably an investment piece.

                                 EMMA
                        But I mean, come on. What a waste. 
                        People would kill to have a 
                        painting like this, and look at it, 
                        it’s hidden away with the shoes 
                        nobody wears anymore! You know my 
                        parents have a Van Gogh print over 
                        the mantle in their living room?  

           She catches herself rambling, but can’t stop...

                                 EMMA
                        It’s actually a poster. Framed. You 
                        probably think that’s pathetic, a 
                        poster from a museum gift shop. 

                                 LEO
                        I don’t think that at all. 

           He turns to leave. Emma closes her eyes, gathers courage. 

                                 EMMA
                        I only said no to you before 
                        because I thought it would be bad, 
                        or dangerous, I don’t know. 

           He stops. Listens. Bites back a smile. She soldiers on. Maybe 
           she’s making a terrible mistake, but...

                                 EMMA
                        I want this job. I want you. I want 
                        everything. 
           She kisses him. Pushes his back against the wall. And it’s 
           like a knob that was stuck has been twisted, opened. 

                                 EMMA
                        Fuck me before I change my mind. 

           Emma presses into him with ferocity. Feeling his weight 
           against her... tracing the muscles under his jacket... He 
           touches her face, fills his hands with her long hair.

           He picks her up, bites her neck, kisses her chin. Holding 
           her. She reaches down and locks the door, shaking with 
           excitement. She stretches one leg over his shoulder and he 
           kisses her ankle, her calf, hungry...

           OUTSIDE THE DOOR

           PARTY GUESTS are close by, just in the hall. A scream of 
           bliss from inside the door. One GUEST turns around. 

           INSIDE

           Emma puts her hand over her mouth to muffle her cries. Then, 
           VOICES and FOOTSTEPS. Just outside the door. They freeze. 

                                 EMMA
                        Keep going.

           He does. They lock eyes, complicit in this amazing moment. 

           INT. EMMA’S CRUMMY FLAT - DAY

           Emma wakes up in bed with Leo, tangled in her sheets. Her 
           MOBILE casts a shadow of a BIRD on her wall...  

                                 LEO
                        What is that?

                                 EMMA
                        It’s a sundial I made. It works... 
                        sort of. A bird means it’s 9ish.  

           His eyes turn to her ledge of “restorations.”

                                 LEO
                        Whoa. How much for Elvis?

           She buries her face in his neck, embarrassed. 

                                 LEO 
                        I’m serious. 
                                 EMMA
                        You’re making fun of me.

                                 LEO
                        I am absolutely not.

                                 EMMA
                        What, are you moved by the color 
                        scheme? The use of texture?

           He reaches over to the nightstand for his wallet.

                                 LEO
                        It’s sexy.

                                 EMMA
                        Elvis?

                                 LEO
                        You. Your passion. All of this.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, man. Elvis, really?

           He turns to her, sincere. He’s serious, and she’s touched.

                                 LEO
                        I love it.

           Shaking her head, Emma climbs out of bed. She crosses the 
           room and carefully lifts Elvis off the wall. Hands it to Leo. 

                                 EMMA
                        Gratis. 

                                 LEO
                        Thank you. 

           Emma turns, but Leo pulls her back into bed. If earlier was 
           the greedy lust, this is something different. 

                                 LEO
                        I’d like to take you out properly 
                        tonight. Is that all right?

           She nods yes.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Back to work. Books splayed open, Emma reads on pointillism. 
           On her computer: a SLIDESHOW of pointillist paintings. 
           EXT. QUAINT TOWN - DAY

           A quiet British town. Charming shop-lined streets. TOURISTS. 
           The Rolls-Royce pulls over in a cobblestoned alley. 

           EXT. QUAINT TOWN - ROAD - DAY

           An older ELECTRICIAN adjusts a switchboard by a phone pole. 
           Alexander, wearing a trench coat, stands, watching his work. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        This cable here, correct?

           Alex slides a little ROUTER, a plastic clip, over one of the 
           cables in the box. He hands the electrician a thick envelope. 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Behind a cluster of shops, Simon reaches a particular 
           basement window-well. The sill is marked in CHALK. He 
           attaches a small DEVICE to the windowpane, and continues on.

           INT. GALLERY - DAY

           Walls full of antique art. Small, a bit cluttered, well-lit: 
           a lush, longtime place of business. A bell DINGS. Leo walks 
           in. A pretty SALES GIRL, 30s, notices him. 

                                 SALES GIRL
                        Good morning. 

           Leo flashes a smile. She watches him as he wanders, slow, 
           looking at the collection. Leo waits another moment, then:  

                                 LEO
                        Di Rosa, is that right? Or no? I’m 
                        a total neophyte. Just getting into 
                        all this.

                                 SALES GIRL
                        It’s Combas, a contemporary of his. 
                        Good eye. We’ve got some Di Rosa’s 
                        over here. Want to follow me?

                                 LEO
                        Only if you’re willing to be 
                        patient. Take it slow?

           Leo glances down at his watch.
           INT./EXT. ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

           In the backseat, Alexander’s laptop is open to an atomic 
           clock. Simon sits beside him, holding a burner cell phone.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Now. 

           Simon hits a button on the burner phone.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           The device affixed to the window -- a little bomb -- EXPLODES 
           with a BANG! It shatters the glass of the window.

           INT. GALLERY - DAY

           The salesgirl shouts, startled at the sound. Leo jumps.

                                 SALES GIRL
                        What was that?

                                 LEO
                        I don’t know. It sounds like... 
                        someone... Do you have a basement?

           She nods. Concerned, she moves towards the back of the shop.

                                 LEO
                        No. Wait. I’ll go.

                                 SALES GIRL
                        No! What if it’s dangerous?

                                 LEO
                        Fine, let’s call the police. I’ll 
                        stay here with you.

           She picks up her phone and dials.

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

           Alexander’s GOOGLE PHONE RINGS ON HIS LAPTOP. Simon hoots, 
           excited. Alexander shoots him a look, and he quiets down.

                                 ALEXANDER
                             (answering)
                        What’s your emergency?
                                 SALES GIRL
                             (through Google phone)
                        Hi, yes, send an officer to 213 
                        Standish Road. I’m afraid someone’s 
                        breaking in.

           Simon plays with a BASEBALL in his hands, full of energy.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Emma clicks through a SLIDESHOW OF 
           POINTILLIST PAINTINGS on her computer screen. 

           She stops, landing on something. She perks up. 

           She looks over at the pointillist painting she’s restoring. 
           Then back to the computer screen. She squints at the screen. 

           ON THE SCREEN: a banner reads, “Our permanent collection.”

           INT. GALLERY - BASEMENT - DAY

           Two POLICE OFFICERS enter the gallery with authority. Leo and 
           the salesgirl look relieved. Beneath the badges, the 
           uniforms, the hats, we see... they are SIMON and ALEXANDER. 

                                 SALES GIRL
                        Thanks for coming so quickly--

                                 SIMON
                        Stay up here, both of you, and 
                        we’ll check out the downstairs. 

           She nods, rubbing her forehead as they go...

           DOWNSTAIRS

           Simon and Alexander creep down the steps into the basement, 
           the storage section of the gallery. They begin searching. 

           Moving fast, they thumb through boxes and hanging artwork. 
           Tearing through racks. Simon wipes sweat from his forehead. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Over here!

           He’s found it: a stack of abstract sketches.
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma poises a brush over the pointillism. With quick, precise 
           strokes, she paints, dotting a section in vibrant color. 
           While the rest is dull and faded, Emma’s corner is alive. 

           She paints faster. Staccato flicks of brush against canvas. 
           She looks to the SCREEN. Back to the PAINTING. On the screen--

           REVEAL: The SUNSET PAINTING from the earlier heist! 

           She touches brush to palette. Her hand trembles.

           INT. GALLERY - UPSTAIRS - DAY

           The Sales Girl paces, uncomfortable. 

                                 LEO
                        Whatever it is, they’ll take care 
                        of it.

           He tries to make eye contact, but she’s distracted.

           DOWNSTAIRS

           They carefully separate the sketches from the pile.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Check the signature. 

           Alexander’s hands are shaky as he rolls up the sketches. 

           INT. GALLERY - UPSTAIRS - DAY

           The Sales Girl peers over her shoulder towards the basement.

                                 SALES GIRL
                        What’s taking them so long? 

           She’s already on her way, approaching the stairs, getting 
           closer and closer. Leo’s desperate. He needs to stop her--

                                 LEO
                        Can I ask you something? Is there a 
                        boyfriend?

           She chuckles, surprised, but she doesn’t stop. At the top of 
           the stairs, though, she pauses, turns back to Leo, just as...

           ...Simon and Alexander emerge. The Sales Girl halts. They 
           appear completely normal. Calm. Simon holds up a BASEBALL. 
                                 SIMON
                        Looks like some kids got carried 
                        away. Broken window. I’m sure your 
                        insurance will take care of it.  

           The Sales Girl smiles, relieved. Leo locks eyes with Simon.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           The image on Emma’s open computer browser is UNDENIABLY THE 
           SAME as the painting she’s restoring. Emma holds her cell 
           phone to her ear, concern on her face--

                                 EMMA
                             (into phone)
                        Yes. I see here on your website 
                        that you have “Copenhagen 37” in 
                        your museum, is that correct?

           She listens. Her face falls. 

                                 EMMA 
                        When was it stolen?

           INT. GALLERY - UPSTAIRS - DAY

           Leo checks his watch as the sales girl shows him options.

                                 LEO
                        I just don’t know. I might have to 
                        take your card and come back.

           She chews her lips.

                                 SALES GIRL
                        So, you asked if I was single--

                                 LEO
                        Yes. Tell me: if your new sort-of-
                        boyfriend got you one of these, 
                        would you think, too serious? Too 
                        much too fast? There’s this girl 
                        I’m seeing...

           The salesgirl deflates. 

           I/E. ROLLS-ROYCE - DAY

           The Rolls Royce idles on a narrow side street. Leo hops into 
           the back seat, next to Alexander. Simon hits the gas.
           Alexander rolls up the cuffs of his pants and opens his 
           jacket. Inside, attached to a system of strings and clips, 
           they’ve affixed about a dozen rolled-up sketches.

           Leo unlatches a sketch and inspects it. He smiles, content.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           A jittery Emma follows Eddie on his rounds.  

                                 EDDIE
                        Are you sure it wasn’t a copy, what 
                        you restored?

           She nods, positive. She’s frantic, talking fast--

                                 EMMA
                        I checked the Art Loss Register. 
                        How did we not hear about this? It 
                        was stolen three months ago.

                                 EDDIE
                        Happens all the time, I’m afraid. 
                        Racks up something like six billion 
                        quid a year, stolen art.  

                                 EMMA
                        I know, but paintings like this, on 
                        the private market?

                                 EDDIE
                        They sell ‘em fast, and no one ever 
                        knows. After a piece changes hands 
                        a few times, no one bothers to 
                        check. Buyers, dealers, they don’t 
                        know, or they look the other way.
                        Not their fault if they didn’t 
                        know. The law says so.

           She nods, wheels spinning in her mind. 

                                 EDDIE
                        It’s not like James Bond... laser 
                        beams, armed security systems... 
                        You know how it is here: art rich, 
                        endowment poor. We can only do so 
                        much, especially in this economy. 
                        Things slip through the cracks. I 
                        bet your boss had no idea. 

                                 EMMA
                        Sure. I’m sure you’re right.
           Off Emma, processing all of this.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Darkness. Emma inspects the pointillism under a blacklight.  

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god. 

           EMMA’S POV: More damage and HANDPRINTS on the painting!

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma sits at her workspace, deep in thought. Eyes glued to 
           that pointillist. Leo bursts in, looking handsome and cool. 

           She turns to him, cold. She opens her mouth to speak and-- 

                                 LEO
                        What do you say we go to Italy for 
                        the night?

           Emma’s taken aback. She considers this... 

           I/E. NAPLES - DAY

           A series of shots as Leo takes Emma out properly:

           -Emma, in a colorful sundress with a low-cut back and a big 
           floppy hat,steps down the staircase of a private plane.

           -Emma and Leo wander down a cobblestoned alley to a piazza. 
           Some KIDS play soccer. When their ball bounces away, Leo 
           kicks it high. Emma steals it, and kicks it back to the kids.

           -The National Galleries. Emma pulls Leo over to a BAROQUE 
           painting of a FEAST. A luscious roast, plump grapes, crusty 
           bread, a wheel of cheese. Emma’s stomach GROWLS. They laugh. 

           -Along the Lungomore seaside promenade, padlocks are chained 
           to poles, marked with initials. Love knots. Emma tugs on one.

           -The Pio Monte della Misericorda. Above an ornate altar hangs 
           a dark, haunting, painting: Caravaggio’s “Seven Works of 
           Mercy.” Two angles wrestle in the sky over human chaos below. 
           Emma and Leo stand before it, debating MOS. She’s in heaven.

           -Leo leads Emma down the street, to a dock where a SPEEDBOAT 
           waits for them. Emma turns to him and laughs, in disbelief.
           -Dinner on the boat’s deck. On a white linen table cloth is 
           an EXACT RECREATION of the feast painting Emma liked at the 
           museum, except it’s made of real, delicious food. Emma GASPS. 

                                 EMMA
                        How did you do that?!

           She circles the table, awed. 

           EXT. SPEEDBOAT - CAPRI - LATE AFTERNOON

           Emma and Leo drink wine on the bow while the sun sets.

                                 LEO
                        My dad was an alcoholic and a two-
                        bit crook and my mum was always in 
                        her own world. Like... once she 
                        decided we were going to have a 
                        fruit stand, because she got a deal 
                        from some wholesaler on all these 
                        crates of apples and she’d found a 
                        shop to rent. I don’t even know 
                        how, but it was quite fun at first, 
                        planning it. We got a chalk-board 
                        sign. But when it was the day to 
                        start we showed up at the 
                        storefront and the man we were 
                        supposed to meet never came. There 
                        was a big padlock on the grates. We 
                        waited on the sidewalk. Two hours. 
                        Three. Finally she said she’d 
                        changed her mind, and the fruit 
                        shop was a shit idea. As we were 
                        walking back I realized she 
                        probably dreamt the whole thing up, 
                        maybe walking by that empty 
                        storefront, maybe watching TV. We 
                        ate apples for weeks. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, Leo.  

           He shrugs it off and turns all of his attention back to her. 

                                 LEO
                        I want to hear more about Vermont. 
                        What your house looks like and what 
                        other framed prints are there.

           Emma laughs.
                                 EMMA
                        God. We bought that when they came 
                        to visit after I finished school... 
                        someday I’ll get them a real one. 
                        My dad would go out of his mind. 
                        Once a month, when I was little, 
                        we’d go into Boston to the Museum 
                        of Fine Arts and see the exhibits, 
                        and they had these free Sunday art 
                        classes for kids so I’d do that... 
                        It was like a six hour drive each 
                        way. But. They taught me to love 
                        art. I’d bring home sand paintings 
                        and Popsicle-stick sculptures and 
                        my mom would put them up. Top shelf 
                        of the bookcase.

           Emma takes a gulp right from the wine bottle.

                                 EMMA
                        And they’re both convinced I’m 
                        going to be an outrageous success! 
                        So it’s like, you only want to call 
                        them when there’s good news. How 
                        messed up is that? It’s easier for 
                        me to not have a relationship with 
                        them until I can fly them out first 
                        class, announce I’ve met all my 
                        goals, and, you know, buy an 
                        original Van Gogh for my dad and a 
                        house on Nantucket for my mom.  

                                 LEO
                        Nantucket? 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s an island off the East Coast. 
                        Massachusetts. When I was in fifth 
                        grade we took a week vacation 
                        there, rented a cottage. 3 Beach 
                        Street. Right on the water. My mom 
                        said it was heaven. And it was. I 
                        want to go back. Do you like 
                        listening to me drunk ramble?

                                 LEO
                        I love it. 

           Leo leans in close, serious.

                                 LEO
                        We can have all those things. We 
                        can buy Three Beach Street!
           He raises the bottle and she clinks her glass in cheers. Leo 
           stands up, and unbuttons his shirt. Undoes his pants.  

                                 EMMA
                        What are you doing? 

                                 LEO
                        Going for a swim.

                                 EMMA
                        It’ll be freezing.

                                 LEO
                        So what? 

           She watches as he dives off the bow into the cold water. He 
           HOOTS, laughing. Left alone in her blanket, Emma has no 
           choice... She pulls off her clothes, shivering, and jumps in.

           EXT. NAPLES - STREET - NIGHT

           Emma, hair still wet from the swim, looks tan and freckled 
           and happy as she guides Leo down a little side street.  

                                 EMMA
                        We might get mugged but this is 
                        worth it, wait til you see....

           She stops him at a MASSIVE SURREAL MURAL. A huge robot turtle 
           creature embraces a bird. It’s totally bizarre and beautiful.  

                                 LEO
                        Wow.

                                 EMMA
                        Kraser Tres. He’s a genius.

           They stand there in the moonlight, the manic energy of the 
           night finally settling. And Emma takes a deep breath...

                                 EMMA
                        The pointillist is stolen.

           She searches his face for a reaction... any reaction...

                                 EMMA
                        Let me try out a theory. You bought 
                        it at auction. You forgot to check 
                        the chain of custody...  an 
                        oversight... you had no idea...

           He looks at the ground, smiling slightly. Emma’s jaw drops.  
                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god.  

           His smile fades as he registers the horror on her face. She 
           turns and walks down the cobblestoned street, and he follows.

           She moves faster down the street, and he keeps up--

                        more. We’re just rearranging the

                                 EMMA
                        That logic... it’s perverse.

           She finally stops and turns to face him. 
                                 EMMA
                        How do you do it?

           He seizes on this hint of curiosity. He moves closer, speaks 
           into her ear, slow, his breath hot on her neck--

                                 LEO
                        Confidence. Move quickly. Don’t let 
                        anyone question you. Sometimes it’s 
                        a smash and grab, sometimes a wink 
                        and a smile. Sometimes there’s more  
                        planning involved. But it’s easy.  

           It feels good, his lips so close to her skin, but she shirks 
           away, angry. She stalks off, and Leo grows desperate.

                                 LEO
                        Join me.

           She stops in her tracks. 

                                 EMMA
                        What? 

                                 LEO
                        Join the team. Help us. I mean... 
                        really. Be a partner. I could sell 
                        the guys on it, we need another...

           Over her shoulder, Leo wrestles with the fact that he has 
           just played this card. He kneads his temples. Panicking.

                                 EMMA
                        Help you steal? Who do you think I 
                        am?

           She’s turned away from him, and WE SEE, but he doesn’t, a 
           hint of a satisfaction from Emma, a crooked little smile. 

                                 LEO
                        I think... you’re perfect for this. 
                             (gaining momentum)
                        I think this is exactly who you 
                        are. You want to work with 
                        masterpieces. That’s what you were 
                        put on this earth to do. 

           He stands up and approaches her, his eyes intense.

                                 LEO
                        You want to have fun, and travel,

                        new things. You want passion. 
           He presses against her back, runs his hands down her arms. 
           She lets him. Just as she’s getting chills he breaks away. 

                                 LEO
                        You could stick to the standard

                        your life and die frustrated and in

                        excitement. You want everything.  

           Their eyes lock. A charged moment between them. He moves to 
           her again, his eyes trace her lips, her cheeks...

                                 LEO
                        Stop pretending you don’t. 

           A wry smile creeps across Emma’s face.

                                 EMMA
                        You’re right. 

           She steps close enough to kiss him but stops just short.

                                 EMMA
                        I want in.

           He’s shocked, and she loves it, relishes it. She laughs.

                                 EMMA
                        I told you. I’m meticulous. I 
                        didn’t miss a dot on that 
                        pointillism, you think I didn’t see 
                        the smudges, the tiny glass tears. 
                        Someone threw that painting out of 
                        a window. You, given the left-
                        handed glove print in the oil. You 
                        should really be more careful.

           He’s never been more amazed or surprised or turned on by her.

                                 EMMA
                        You made me sweat. Now we’re even. 
                        And I want equal partnership, 25%. 

           Leo’s frozen. And she gives him the sexiest kiss of his life.

                                 EMMA
                        Now we have to trust each other. No 
                        lies. No secrets. Not like this.
                                 LEO
                        This is a deal?

           Emma can’t believe it, she’s never done something so crazy-- 

                                 EMMA
                        Yes.

           Leo moves to kiss her, but Emma takes his hand instead.

                                 EMMA
                        Come on. We have more to see. 
                        There’s a Zilda over here, and a 
                        Roa, oh, and a huge graffiti 
                        wall...

           Off Emma, eyes wild, high on the power of this moment.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - BENSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma sets down the cup. Turns to leave as Benson takes a sip.

                                 BENSON
                        Sometimes I really wonder what’s 
                        wrong with you.

           Emma spins around.

                                 BENSON
                        This is ice cold.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m so sorry. I got distracted. 
                        I’ll make you a new one. 

                                 BENSON
                        Do you think they offer a graduate 
                        degree in boiling water?  

           Emma forces a breath. Her eyes water, anger bubbling over. 

                                 BENSON
                        If so, perhaps I’ll endorse your 
                        application. 

                                 EMMA
                        Ms. Benson. 

           Benson cranes her neck as though it’s a great effort. 

                                 EMMA
                        For two years I’ve smiled. I’ve 
                        kept my head down and done my job. 
                                 (MORE)

                        I’ve stomached your demeaning 
                        remarks because I thought working 
                        here was my dream. But guess what? 
                        This is bullshit. And I don’t have 
                        to put up with it anymore.  

           Benson gapes. Emma pivots to the door.

                                 EMMA
                        I quit.

           Benson’s jaw nearly hits her desk when Emma leaves.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Emma hovers beyond the closed door. She cranes to listen in, 
           touches her cheek to the door, but she can’t hear anything.

           INSIDE

           Leo confers with Simon and Alexander. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        25%?

                                 LEO
                        I had to make it appealing. This 
                        was all ahead of schedule. 

                                 SIMON
                        When will you tell her?

                                 LEO
                        When I have to. 

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LATER

           Emma has now joined Simon, Alex, and Leo at their meeting. 
           Amidst papers and computers, cigarettes, coffee cups and wine 
           bottles litter the table. The group has been at this all day.  

                                 LEO
                        Let’s catch Emma up on this. We’ve 
                        tracked the ownership of this 
                        particular Manet for the last four 
                        years. Six months ago the Johnson 
                        family sold this to Edouard LeFevre 
                        at Sotheby’s Impressionist/Modern. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Sold it cheap, too. 
           INT. SOTHEBY’S - NIGHT

           Big business and fine art converge here. A banner announces 
           the Impressionist/Modern sale. BROKERS and fancy BUYERS spill 
           into the live auction. Alexander sits in the crowd. 

                                 AUCTIONEER
                        Do I hear six million?

           Alexander clocks the bids as paddles pop up.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Leo shows a blown-up image of the Manet on the screen. A 
           round naked woman, lounging, chin tipped towards the light. 

                                 LEO
                        Our client is Murray Largman. The 
                        Largman family’s generations-old 
                        collection of impressionistic and 
                        post-impressionistic art was looted 
                        from their Bucharest home during 
                        WWII, before they fled to France. 
                        We haven’t been able to locate the 
                        Renoirs or one large Matisse, but 
                        we’ve got a window on this Manet. 

                                 EMMA
                        If we’re talking about Nazi 
                        looting, can’t he go to the police?

           Leo, annoyed at the interruption-- 

                                 LEO
                        No provenance or proof of 
                        ownership. Everything was 
                        destroyed. That’s why he needs us.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s terrible.

                                 LEO
                        And LeFevre’s Paris apartment went 
                        on the market last week.

                                 EMMA
                        How do you know the Manet is there?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s a small world, people talk. A 
                        contact who went to a salon at 
                        LeFevre’s said she saw it. 
           INT. INDUSTRIAL LOFT - NIGHT

           A vast, open apartment full of structural installation art. 
           Simon talks to a HOT GIRL in a giant skirt made of feathers.  

                                 ALEXANDER (O.S.)
                        By contact, he means some socialite 
                        he used to shag.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Simon shrugs. Leo clicks through EXTERIOR PHOTOS of LeFevre’s 
           flat, the penthouse of a historic downtown building.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        More importantly, we went to the 
                        source. I had my broker get in 
                        touch with LeFevre’s. Told him I 
                        was very busy, and asked if he’d 
                        sell the place furnished, and if 
                        so, what was included.

           INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DAY

           A well-dressed BROKER in an elegant office faxes a document.

                                 ALEXANDER (V.O.)
                        As an art lover, I made sure I was 
                        clear that I was interested in any 
                        and all decoration. If we’d come to 
                        an agreement about the price, I’d 
                        wire the deposit.

           CLOSER on the document: it’s a list of accoutrements, pieces. 
           A VICTORIAN CHAISE LOUNGE, A LOUIS XIV CLOCK.... A MANET... 

           INT. DIFFERENT REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DAY

           Alexander sits across from a respectable looking REAL ESTATE 
           BROKER, who passes him a document. Alexander peruses it.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Sadly, negotiations got sticky, and 
                        we couldn’t come to an agreement.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - BACK TO SCENE

           Emma listens, completely engaged.
                                 EMMA
                        So you know the Manet is there. 
                        It’s so simple. But it’s brilliant.  

                                 LEO
                        We don’t know where it is, exactly. 

                                 SIMON
                        We can make educated guesses.

           EXT. LEFEVRE’S FLAT - DAY

           Simon snaps photos from across the street. He looks like just 
           another hipster with a fancy camera, but...

           THROUGH HIS LENS: Glimpses inside LeFevre’s building. The 
           first floor lobby, with the SECURITY DESK. Peeks at the 
           penthouse itself. The public cameras mounted outside. 

                                 SIMON (O.S.)
                        By the way, security cameras in the 
                        lobby. Internal alarm system. Which 
                        won’t matter because someone’s 
                        going to let you in. 

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           They look at the exterior of the building on Google Earth.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        CCTV on the street corner. We can’t 
                        get into that system, so remember, 
                        when you get outside, keep walking.

                                 EMMA
                        You mean you can get inside the 
                        security cameras?

                                 ALEXANDER
                        If they stream online, which almost 
                        everything does. 

           She’s amazed, but she tries to play it cool. 

                                 LEO
                        We expect the Manet is in the 
                        living room, but we’ll have to 
                        locate it in the moment. Take it, 
                        and replace it with the print 
                        without alerting the broker. 

           Suddenly that doesn’t sound so easy. Emma swallows.
                                 EMMA
                        What will I do?

                        You’re our secret weapon.

           Leo gives Simon a funny look. Simon hurries to clarify--

                                 SIMON
                        What I mean is, we try not to 
                        adhere to any sort of pattern. No 
                        two thefts or sales can look 
                        exactly alike, and you... well, 
                        you’re different. You’re authentic 
                        and new and perfect for this. You 
                        going with Leo, you guys can play a 
                        couple. As long as you two aren’t 
                        suspicious, you’ll get your chance 
                        alone in the apartment. 

           Emma senses tension in Leo as Simon speaks. Jealousy? Leo 
           looks to Alex, who pulls a PRINT of the Manet out of a file. 

                                 LEO
                        This is our decoy.

                                 EMMA 
                        We’re going to replace the original 
                        with this?

                                 LEO
                        They won’t notice right away.

                                 EMMA
                        But it’s so flat.

           She holds the paper further from her face, squinting. 

                                 EMMA
                        I can do better.

           INT. THE BRITISH MUSEUM - DAY

           Emma and Leo, hand in hand, consult a real life MANET.

                                 EMMA
                             (taking notes)
                        See the shadow, here?

           Leo kisses her neck. She laughs, loving this ‘research.’

           LATER
           Down a hallway, Emma peers over each shoulder, mischievous. 
           She drags Leo into a SUPPLY CLOSET, shoves him against a 
           wall, undoes the button of his jeans. Leo, in disbelief--

                                 LEO
                        What are you...? Oh my god.

           She pulls up her skirt, leans back on a little ledge, and 
           brings him close to her. Whispers something in his ear. 

           Someone BANGS on the door. A GUARD tears it open.

                                 GUARD
                        What the hell is going on?!

           Emma and Leo separate. On either side of the guard, they lock 
           eyes, and then RUN FOR IT, laughing like crazy teenagers.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma mixes paint on her palette. Affixed to the window: an 
           image of the Manet she’s copying. The beautiful naked woman. 

           QUICK SHOTS of preparation: 

           -Emma prepares the forgery. She sketches, she paints, she 
           shades. Adding texture.  

           -Alexander shows Leo the listing of LeFevre’s property.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Adorable Holocaust angle, by the 
                        way. You’re going straight to hell.

                                 LEO
                        I’ll see you there.

           -Simon shows Leo and Emma a mock-up floor plan of the flat.

           -Emma and Leo practice entering the study, with Simon playing 
           the broker. Alexander watches, giving notes. 

           -Drinking a beer, Emma watches a HEIST MOVIE on Leo’s couch.

           -Day becomes night as Emma labors over the copy, obsessed. 

           -She dries her painting with a fan, considering her work.
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DAY

           Emma’s dressed the part, and she’s never looked better: thigh-
           high boots and a sheath dress, a diamond statement necklace. 
           She pulls a pair of leather gloves from a Chanel box. 

           Simon lines her handbag with foam and cotton. He slides a 
           crowbar inside.

                                 EMMA 
                        Oh, Jesus.

                                 SIMON
                        Don’t worry. You’re not clubbing 
                        old ladies, it’s just for Leo to 
                        wedge the frame off the wall.  

                                 EMMA
                        Uh huh.

                                 SIMON
                        Want a drink?

                                 EMMA
                        God, yes.

           He produces whiskey and a glass. She undoes the cap and takes 
           a pull straight from the bottle. 

           Leo rushes in, and he stops in his tracks when he sees Emma. 
           She pulls on a beautiful tailored coat. 

                                 EMMA
                        What? Is it too much?

                                 LEO
                        No. You look perfect.

           EXT. LEFEVRE’S BUILDING - DAY

           Emma and Leo look fantastic together: hip and sophisticated. 
           Hand in hand, they approach the entrance. A DOORMAN stands 
           outside. Simon idles in a PORSCHE behind them.

                                 LEO
                        You’ll be brilliant.

           I/E. PORSCHE - STREET - DAY

           Simon waits down the block from the apartment. He checks his 
           rearview mirror: the building’s entrance is clearly in sight. 
           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Simon startles. It’s a COP, banging his 
           knuckles on the window. Simon breathes, rolls down the glass.

                                 COP
                        No standing here.

                                 SIMON
                        Isn’t this passenger loading? I’m 
                        just waiting for my boss.

                                 COP
                        Not on Saturdays.

           He indicates a sign.

                                 COP
                        Move it along. 

           Simon slowly rumbles off, leaving the apartment behind him. 

           INT. LEFEVRE’S FLAT - DAY

           A REAL ESTATE BROKER, 40s, blazer and pearls, shows Leo and 
           Emma the penthouse. She walks them through the palatial 
           living room. Emma’s eyes scour every inch of the place. 

                                 BROKER
                        Are you married?

           Emma’s so tense she nearly jumps at the question. 

                                 LEO
                        Someday, if she ever lets me tie 
                        her down. What do you think, if I 
                        lived in a place like this? Maybe?

                                 BROKER
                        You two are darling. Let me show 
                        you through to the master.

           I/E. PORSCHE - DAY

           Simon takes a turn and finds himself in a long line of 
           traffic. Someone pulls up behind him. He’s stuck.

           INT. LEFEVRE’S FLAT - DAY

           Through two pocket doors is another sprawling, decadently 
           furnished space. Blue and white porcelain, oriental rugs. 
           Emma’s POV: she scans the room, her eyes taking stock of each 
           piece of art, each photograph on the wall, every shelf. 

           She looks at Leo, biting her lips. The Manet is nowhere to be 
           found. Emma stalls, voice wavering--

                                 EMMA
                        Is this Italian marble?

           The Broker nods. Leo paces, also looking for the painting. 
           Emma clenches her fists. Catches herself. Relaxes. 

                                 EMMA
                        Well... it’s lovely...

                                 BROKER
                        And the ensuite is just behind you.

           Emma forces a smile. Playing her part, she peeks into the 
           bathroom. Tile. Enormous tub. Emma JUMPS when she sees...

           ...THE MANET, hanging over the double vanity!

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, honey...

           Leo is preoccupied, retracing his steps in the bedroom, 
           looking for the painting. He doesn’t get the hint.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, honey. I really think you’d 
                        like this. Gorgeous mosaic work.

           It clicks. Leo joins her in the bathroom. He sees the Manet. 
           A shared glance of relief between them. The broker follows.

                                 BROKER
                        The tile is all original. 

                                 EMMA
                        I love it. What do you think, baby? 

           Leo plays the pensive husband, thinking. No one moves. All of 
           them trapped in the bathroom, Emma is suffocating, sweating-- 

                                 EMMA
                             (quiet, to the broker)
                        I may have to twist his arm.

                                 BROKER
                        I’ll give you two a minute.

           Smiling, the broker slinks out. Emma and Leo freeze, listen 
           to her CLINKING footsteps on the marble. When she’s gone...
           ...they move. Emma unsnaps her purse, produces the copy. 

           Leo peeks out the door. Coast clear. He pulls on gloves. 
           Climbs onto the sink and dislodges the original MANET. 

                                 EMMA
                        In the goddamn bathroom.

           Leo flips over the ORNATE FRAME of the original, unsnaps it. 

                                 EMMA
                        What a sick joke. It’s gonna be 
                        saturated with water damage. 

                                 LEO
                        Emma, stop talking. Just go. 

           He slides the glass of the frame and Emma removes the 
           painting. For a bated moment she is holding an original Manet  
           inches from her face! She grins. Slides it into her bag.

           Then: FOOTSTEPS on marble. The broker is coming.

           Emma looks at Leo: what the fuck? The undone frame is still 
           sitting on the counter, the copy beside it. CLICK-CLACK. 
           CLICK-CLACK. She’s getting closer. Emma thinks--

                                 EMMA
                             (loud)
                        What aren’t you telling me then?!

           Leo balks, confused. But she motions, urging him on--

                                 LEO
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Is there someone else? 

                                 LEO
                        What are you talking about?

           Emma places her copy under the glass. Leo affixes the frame.

                                 EMMA
                        Is the business doing poorly? 
                        Because you said we could afford 
                        this place, and I want it.

           MASTER BEDROOM

           The broker overhears. Feeling awkward, she stops. Waits.

           BATHROOM
           Emma’s loud enough to muffle the sound of their framing job-- 

                                 EMMA
                        You promised me a certain type of 
                        life. Maybe I should just buy this 
                        place for myself! Without you!

           Leo balances on the sink, setting the framed copy just so. He 
           looks at it, adjusts it, angling it perfectly.

                                 LEO
                        Please, love. I’m begging you. 

           MASTER BEDROOM

           A moment of quiet from the bathroom. Weird. The broker moves.

           BATHROOM

           Emma grins. The copy looks perfect. She takes a step back, 
           admiring it. Leo hops down, kisses Emma, ecstatic. Just as he 
           does, the broker appears. She sees them kissing and laughs. 

           Emma holds her breath as the broker looks around the 
           bathroom. Will she notice? Is everything perfect?

                                 BROKER
                        Any questions?

           Emma rubs Leo’s arm, shaking her head. 

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry. Apartment hunting is so 
                        stressful! We need to sleep on it.

           The broker smiles, making a big gesture of being supportive. 

                                 BROKER
                        I’ll give you my card.

           Emma picks up her purse and holds it tight against her body.

           I/E. PORSCHE - DAY

           Finally at the front of the line of traffic, Simon cuts a 
           hard right. But he’s thwarted by a ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. 
           He pulls a U-turn and guns it back down the street. 

           EXT. LEFEVRE’S FLAT - DAY

           Heart pounding, Emma steps onto the curb, her purse pressed 
           tight against her side, ready to get out of there fast...
           But Simon is no where to be seen. He’s fucking gone. 

           Emma sees the terror on Leo’s face as his eyes search the 
           street. He swallows. They’re frozen. Clenched by panic. 

                                 LEO
                        Don’t stop moving.

           He pulls her across the street.

           I/E. PORSCHE - DAY 

           Simon zooms the WRONG WAY down a one-way street.

                                 SIMON
                        Fuck fuck fuck. 

           When he pops out at the end of the road, he’s met with 
           another one way street, so he throws the car in reverse, just 
           in time to pull up in front of the building.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Leo and Emma walk down the street, foot COMMUTERS pushing 
           past them. Someone knocks into Emma and she instinctually 
           clutches her purse. She’s shaky. Leo pulls her along.

                                 GUY
                        Sorry.

           They walk past a MOUNTED COP. The HORSE whinnies. Emma looks 
           down at the sidewalk. She can hardly breathe. 

           She grabs Leo’s hand. Finally, up ahead, he spots Simon. He 
           and Emma run across the street, cutting through cars in 
           traffic. They throw themselves into the back seat, fast--

                                 LEO
                        Where the fuck were you?

           Simon hits it, peeling off the road. He’s about to turn away 
           from the traffic when, from behind them, SIRENS SCREECH. 
           Simon checks his mirror. It’s a cruiser. Right behind them. 

                                 SIMON
                        Maybe it’s not for us. 

           He careens around a turn, guns it through a yellow light, and 
           the COPS accelerate, on their tail. There’s nothing to do...

                                 SIMON
                        Fuck.
                                 LEO
                        Just pull over!

           He does, and the cruiser stops. They wait. Emma can hardly 
           breathe. She clenches her purse between her legs.

                                 EMMA
                        Does this normally happen?

           Leo doesn’t answer. Simon locks eyes with Emma in his rear-
           view. She sees the fear in him. The cop -- the same one who 
           accosted Simon earlier -- approaches the window.

                                 COP
                        What’s going on with you, Sir?

                                 SIMON
                        I’m a driver. These are my bosses. 

           Leo’s jaw tenses. Emma grabs Leo’s hand.

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry, we were rushing him.

           The COP cranes to get a look at her. She holds his gaze.

                                 COP
                        I didn’t stop you for speeding. 

           A sharp intake of breath from Simon. The cop rests his hands 
           on the roof of the car, leaning over, eyes scanning everyone 
           and every thing in the car. Each second is torture.

                                 COP
                        Are you aware you traveled the 
                        wrong way down a one-way street?

           INT. LEO’S PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Simon SCREECHES the car to a stop in Leo’s parking space. He 
           plucks Emma’s purse from the backseat. As he moves around the 
           car, he pulls a FAKE LICENSE PLATE cover off the back plates. 
           Emma can barely move. She’s stunned. In shock. About to cry.

                                 LEO
                        It’s not usually like that.

           She bursts into adrenaline-fueled laughter. 

           The danger, the relief, the victory bubbling over. She hikes 
           up her beautiful dress and straddles Leo, grabs his 
           shoulders. Kisses him hard, with a crazy sense of power.
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Alexander inspects the stolen Manet. Leo appears in the door. 

                                 LEO
                        She’ll touch this up for Largman.

           Alexander looks at the painting, satisfied. But he’s uneasy.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Sure you know what you’re doing?

                                 LEO
                        Relax. She’s doing great. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Haysworth called. The drawings will 
                        only tide him over for so long. 

                                 LEO
                        Tell him we’re on track. 

           INT. LYLE’S PRIVATE CLUB - NIGHT

           A speakeasy-style restaurant, straight out of the 20s. Dark, 
           sexy, fancy. The kind of place that reeks of exclusivity. 
           Alison and Bernie are a little uncomfortable and a lot under-
           dressed compared to Emma, but they’re overjoyed to see her.

                                 BERNIE
                        Can’t believe you got us in here.

                                 ALISON
                        I know, this is very cool.

                                 EMMA
                        The food’s okay. We mostly like the 
                        cocktails.

           Leo arrives with drinks for everyone. He passes them out.

                                 LEO
                        She’s got a very good palate. I’m 
                        always learning from her. 

           He squeezes her shoulder, playful, and sits down. Alison and 
           Bernie wonder if he’s talking about their Emma. 

                                 LEO
                        I want to know everything about 
                        each of you, and it’s very 
                        important you skip nothing. Loads 
                        of detail. Alison, you first. 
                                 ALISON
                        Oh. Well, I’m a solicitor. It’s 
                        very boring, I’m sure Emma told 
                        you... the biggest excitement in my 
                        week is our Thursday pub quiz.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s not true--

                                 LEO
                        Wait wait wait. Thursday night is 
                        the quiz? Today’s Thursday.

           Leo looks around at all of them.

                                 LEO
                        What are we doing here? Let’s go.

                                 EMMA
                        No, no. This is so nice.

                                 BERNIE
                        It’s really not important.

                                 ALISON
                        Trust me, it’s far from elegant.

           But Leo’s up in an instant. He makes the “tab” motion to a 
           waiter in suspenders. Emma looks down, a little hesitant to 
           leave. Alison notices and feels bad.

                                 ALISON
                        We don’t have to... are you 
                        embarrassed?

           Emma doesn’t answer. Leo’s back, clutching everyone’s coats.

           INT. THE QUEENS’ ARMS PUB - NIGHT

           Two pitchers of beer, a basket of soggy fries, and all around 
           drunken merriment. They huddle over a paper. Emma’s intense:

                                 EMMA
                        No, no, no. Listen. The fastest way 
                        to do it is the anagrams first, 
                        then we can discuss all the hard 
                        questions, leave more time. Leo 
                        knows football. I’ll take history, 
                        obviously, you two politics and pop 
                        culture. Leo doesn’t know pop 
                        culture. I’m sorry, but you don’t!
                                 ALISON
                        She’s extremely competitive. She 
                        can’t help it, it’s compulsive... 

                                 BERNIE
                        Our secret weapon. 

           Leo watches Emma scribble away, in her own world. He can’t 
           help but smile at her furrowed brow, her pencil flying. Her 
           passion. Emma looks up and catches him staring. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey, hey, get to work!

           They laugh. Emma does, too -- she feels like she has it all.  

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Slow, languid sex on Leo’s bed. Emma pushes his shoulders and 
           flips on top of him, in control. He touches her face. 

                                 LEO
                        I’m in love with you. 

           Her mouth falls open a little. She covers it with her hand.

                                 LEO
                        Don’t look so surprised.

                                 EMMA
                        I love you, too. 

           She sort of giggles, suddenly shy. He kisses her, then throws 
           her down onto the bed and she screams with delight.

           I/E. PRIVATE JET - DAY

           Emma, next to Leo, sips a glass of wine. He reads from his 
           iPad. Simon and Alexander sit behind them, talking MOS. 

                                 LEO
                        Will the museum mind that you’re 
                        leaving for a while?

                                 EMMA
                        The museum?

                                 LEO
                        What will they do with your tours?

                                 EMMA
                        What do you mean?
           She gives him a strange look.

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t work there anymore.

                                 LEO
                        I told you to keep that job.

                                 EMMA
                        Well, I quit. I can’t believe you 
                        didn’t know that.

           A flash of rage in Leo’s eyes. He suppresses it.

           INT. CHATEAU - DAY

           Leo turns the key to a gorgeous CHATEAU. “Rustic chic” 
           colorful, beautifully curated. Emma is floored. It’s 
           extravagant like nothing she’s ever seen. She tries to 
           conceal her giddiness as she explores each room. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        A little much, don’t you think?

           From the other room, Emma yelps, ecstatic.  

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Glad we’re spending our advance 
                        spoiling your girlfriend.

           Leo gives Alexander a searing glance and then a little smile.

           BATHROOM

           Emma, in all her clothes, lies in a giant claw-footed tub. 
           The bathroom has a sparkling chandelier and a flat screen TV. 

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe I want to look at the TV, 
                        maybe I want to look at the 
                        crystal.

           BEDROOM

           A lush canopied bed, a textured ceiling, giant gold tassels 
           around the bedposts. Leo finds Emma admiring the opulence.

                                 EMMA
                        Thank god you decided to spring for 
                        the big tassels. What would we have 
                        done without them?

           She clocks the tension in Leo.
                                 EMMA
                        Hey, are you upset with me?

           He grabs her waist, tugs her close to him.

                                 LEO
                        Of course not. 

           He kisses her neck, her collarbone. 

                                 EMMA
                        But you seem like something’s 
                        bothering you and I want to...

           They tumble onto the giant bed and he sinks down, lower and 
           lower. He pulls off her shoes... reaches up her dress...

                                 EMMA
                        Okay, okay.

           INT/EXT. FRANCE - DAY

           A MONTAGE OF “ACQUISITIONS” IN FRANCE: 

           -At the chateau’s grand table, over cigars and scotches and 
           scattered documents, they plan their targets. Leo clicks 
           through images of PAINTINGS on the TV screen.

                                 LEO
                        We’ve got twelve targets in France.  
                        Eight oil paintings, a small 
                        sculpture, a drawing, two pastels.

           -Alexander HACKS into what appears to be a GOOGLE CALENDAR. 

           -Dressed in business attire and holding briefcases, Emma and 
           Leo ring a mansion’s doorbell. A TIMID ASSISTANT answers. 

                                 LEO
                        Hello, we’re the insurance 
                        adjusters from Petersen’s.

           The assistant looks at a schedule on his iPhone. 

                                 EMMA
                        Monsieur Cote made the appointment.

           Emma flashes a smile, assertive but sweet. 

                                 EMMA
                        Are you sure you don’t see it?
                                 ASSISTANT
                        Oh, oh, yes. Here it is...

           -They’re in. Leo and Emma, wearing gloves, pick through an 
           over-stuffed vault. Some paintings are hung in neat, climate-
           controlled sleeves, others are stacked in cluttered corners. 

                                 EMMA
                        Got it.

           Leo opens purse so she can slide a painting inside.

           -Leo and Emma have a lovely picnic lunch amidst the tall 
           grass, just over the hill from a little stone church.

           -The country church. Light spills across the stone floor, the 
           wooden pews, a simple altar, the stained glass. Leo and Emma 
           use a BLOWTORCH to free a MADONNA painting that is bolted to 
           the wall. Stone shards tumble.   

           -Emma restores the church painting, sewing a large tear. The 
           Madonna’s eyes are smiling slits. She seems to watch Emma. 

           -Spread across the chateau’s table: the stolen paintings.

           -At her easel, Emma paints a COPY of a WARHOL CAMPBELL’S SOUP 
           piece, working from an image on an Ipad. She works with paper 
           and an EXACTO KNIFE to create a stencil.  

           -A small, minimalist art gallery. A real WARHOL rests on a 
           stand in the front window. No cables or tethers connect it. 
           Leo and Emma, disguised, talk to the YOUNG GALLERY OWNER. 

           -When the men disappear into a back room, Emma snatches the 
           Warhol and replaces it with her copy in one fluid motion. 
           Simon pops in from the street and she hands off her purse. He 
           trades her for an identical bag.

           -Out at a smoky club in Paris, the team celebrates. A sexy 
           BULESQUE DANCER pulls Emma on stage. Emma dances, losing 
           herself, awash in the moment as Leo and the guys watch.

           INT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

           Leo, Simon, and Alexander work. Alexander gives Simon a nod, 
           encouraging. Now’s the time. Simon stands. 

                                 SIMON
                        Haysworth called again. Ten weeks. 
                        We need to start preparing her--

                                 LEO
                        We have been preparing her. 
                                 ALEXANDER
                        You said it yourself, and you were 
                        right. She’s good. She’s ready.

                                 SIMON
                        You’re afraid that if you tell her 
                        now, you’ll lose her.

           Leo explodes.

                                 LEO
                        I’m afraid that if I tell her now, 
                        before she’s comfortable, we’ll 
                        lose her. And then, guess what? 
                        We’re fucked. There is no Plan B.

           Alexander isn’t afraid. He gets in Leo’s face.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        You need to get things straight. 
                        You’ve let fucking this girl go to 
                        your head, and it’s like you forget 
                        the whole reason she’s here--  

           Leo lunges and GRABS Alexander’s neck, MASHES his face 
           against the window. Alexander coughs, reaches for Leo’s 
           fingers, trying to break free. He can’t breathe...

                                 LEO
                             (slow, quiet)
                        Don’t talk like that. 

           Alexander GASPS for air. Simon’s watches, silent, as Leo 
           finally lets go. Alexander cowers and rubs his neck. 

                                 LEO
                        She’s worth 1,000 times what you 
                        are, and we all know it.

           Leo leaves them.

           INT. CHATEAU - DAY 

           Emma blinks awake to find Leo’s dressed, throwing clothes 
           into a bag. She sits up on her elbows, bleary-eyed.

                                 LEO
                        Let’s go away for the night. Just 
                        the two of us.

                                 EMMA
                        A new job? What is it?
                                 LEO
                        Just come on.

           She crawls out of bed, her interest piqued. 

           I/E. JAGUAR - DAY

           With the top down on Leo’s Jaguar, they cruise through the 
           French countryside. Past farms, fields of lavender. 

           The wind blows through Emma’s hair as they fly down a hill. 
           She SCREAMS! Leo laughs and hits the gas even harder.

           EXT. LA COLOMBE D’OR - DAY

           A gorgeous boutique hotel. A terra cotta roof stretches over 
           stone buildings, connected by terraces. Shuttered windows 
           peer over the countryside. Emma and Leo leave the car with a 
           VALET in a white tux, and Emma GASPS when they see... 

           INSIDE

           The walls are papered in ART. Masterworks everywhere you 
           look. It’s like a museum, but more intimate, more rustic.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god. 

                                 LEO
                        One of the biggest private 
                        collections in France.

           Emma is awestruck.

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t believe this place is real.

                                 LEO
                        I knew you’d like it. They have 
                        more art here than they can fit on 
                        the walls, so the collection’s 
                        always rotating. There’s a pool, 
                        too, and gardens. Wait until you 
                        see our suite....

           She can’t tear herself away from the paintings. She’s lost in 
           a cubist Picasso, flanked by a Salvador Dali, and a Rothko. 

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry, what?
           INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Tucked into a stone alcove, Emma and Leo eat by candlelight.

           Wax drips onto the white tablecloth. Emma smears bread with 
           salted butter. There’s wine, leek tarts, marrow. And a giant 
           Leger mural hangs across from them, nestled in the ivy. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m shocked they leave that 
                        exposed. I guess it’s designed for 
                        the elements. Did you know it’s a 
                        Leger? It’s completely ceramic. And 
                        there’s a Calder mobile by the 
                        pool, did you see it? Incredible.   

           Emma looks up at him, catches him watching her.

                                 EMMA
                        I am obsessed, I know.

           Leo sets down his knife and fork.  

                                 LEO
                        I wanted to tell you something 
                        important. 

           She chews, mouth full, like a kid. Looks up at him. Leo 
           searches for words, hesitant. As nervous as she’s seen him.

                                 LEO
                        I think we should change course. 
                        Not right now, but soon. I care 
                        about you, and I don’t want to do 
                        this forever. At some point, we 
                        could have a real life. 

           Emma thinks this bout of seriousness must be a joke. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, come on. You? Get out?

                                 LEO
                        One more big job, and we could set 
                        ourselves up. We’d have the money 
                        to live here, or the States even--

                                 EMMA
                        You’re really going soft on me. 
                        What happened to, “join the party!” 

           He’s vulnerable, and doesn’t know what to say.
                                 EMMA
                        Let’s order dessert.

           INT. COLOMBE D’OR - SUITE - DAY

           Leo and Emma are packed. Leo grabs their bags.

                                 LEO
                        I’ll take these and get the car.

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t believe there was really no 
                        job. I can’t believe it. 

                                 LEO
                        I just wanted us to get away.

           He leaves. Emma paces the room, wistful, even disappointed. 
           On the bathroom sink she sees that he has left his silver 
           razor. She puts it in her purse and leaves.

           INT. LA COLOMBE D’OR - DAY

           Emma walks down the hotel’s grand staircase, eyes tracing the 
           paintings that run down the steps. She pauses, accosted by 
           one, tiny, whimsical little Chagall. It’s weird and sweet: a 
           brown-haired girl with striped tights soars in the night sky.

           Emma’s face lights up. She loves it. She wants it. And in 
           that greedy, lustful moment, a crazy instinct kicks in...

           ...she looks over her shoulder. Scans the ceiling for 
           cameras, the upper landing for people. Everyone below her is 
           going about their business, and no one is coming up above. 
           She bites her lip, reaches into her purse.

           She clutches THE RAZOR. Hand concealed within the bag, she 
           CLICKS its blade free. She wields it between her finger and 
           thumb. One more breath, one more look over each shoulder...

           She leans against the wall, shielding the painting with her 
           body. She breathes hard. Her makeup melts on her skin. She 
           brings her shaking hand to the canvas, and in four quick 
           SLASHES, she CUTS THE CHAGALL OUT OF ITS FRAME. 

           She curls it in her hand and shoves it into her purse. Head 
           down, Emma runs out the front door...
           EXT. LA COLOMBE D’OR - DAY

           ...where Leo is loading the car. Emma hurls herself into the 
           front seat, shaking, terrified but grinning like a maniac.

                                 EMMA
                        Drive!

                                 LEO
                        Just a second.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m serious, Leo, go now!!!

           She practically screams it, and he knows something is very 
           wrong. He throws the car into gear and they blast away. 

           I/E. LEO’S JAGUAR - ON THE ROAD - DAY

           Emma turns around in her seat, watching the road behind them.

                                 EMMA
                        Faster.

                                 LEO 
                        What the hell happened, Emma?

           She faces forward, unzips her purse and reveals the Chagall 
           painting. A wry smile. She looks at him, proud...

           ...but Leo is absolutely horrified. 

                                 LEO
                        What were you thinking? Do you know 
                        how easily you could’ve gotten 
                        caught?  

                                 EMMA
                        But we didn’t! I knew we wouldn’t. 

                                 LEO
                        No. No. That was crazy. Stupid. 
                        That was an incredible waste.

           She’s jittery, wired, floored by his reaction.

                                 EMMA
                        What’s wrong with you? I just got 
                        us an original Marc Chagall. You 
                        said yourself they’ve got so much 
                        art they don’t even display it all. 
                        They won’t even miss it. They 
                        probably don’t even care. 
                                 LEO
                        That’s not what I said. Not at all. 
                        Show it to me again.

           She holds the painting on her lap. It’s nearly destroyed.

                                 LEO
                        Jesus Christ. You would’ve gone to 
                        jail... for that? It’s ruined. 

           He’s screaming over the roaring engine, and his words sink 
           in. Emma looks at the sliced up painting. All of a sudden 
           it’s real to her, tactile, and it’s grotesque. Destroyed. 

                                 LEO
                        I meant what I said last night.

                                 EMMA
                        I didn’t realize you were serious.

           He hits the gas and they plunge over the hills. Emma stares 
           out the window. The scenery flies by, a blur. She tries to 
           touch his arm but he pulls away. He won’t even look at her.

           INT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

           Emma and Simon talk over whiskey as Leo sleeps on the couch.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m messed up over it. 

                                 SIMON
                        We’ve all gone too far before. It 
                        gets to you. Like a drug.

                                 EMMA
                        I used to be afraid to stand too 
                        close to paintings at a museum. I 
                        wanted to touch them so badly that 
                        I was scared I’d somehow do it by 
                        accident.

                                 SIMON
                        I believe the word for that is 
                        ‘nerd.’ 

                                 EMMA
                        Were you really a Formula 1 racer, 
                        before you started working here?

                                 SIMON
                        Hell, no. I was the mechanic for 
                        the MacLaren team for a while. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SIMON (CONT'D)
                        They let me hang around. I was 
                        never good enough to drive for 
                        them.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh.

                                 SIMON
                        I owe Leo a lot. I was a little 
                        lost when he found me.

           He takes a puff of his cigar.

                                 SIMON
                        I guess we all sort of were, huh?

           Emma pulls her blanket around her, stricken. 

                                 EMMA
                        He said he wanted a “real life” 
                        with me. Do you think that’s true?

                                 SIMON
                        He said that?

           Simon looks off, and Emma doesn’t get her answer.

           INT. CHATEAU - DAY

           Leo bursts in and throws a newspaper at a groggy Emma who’s 
           still half asleep. He’s fuming, pacing the room.

                                 LEO
                        Wake up. Hey. Look at this.

                                 EMMA
                        You know I can’t read French.

                                 LEO
                        The police are looking for the 
                        stolen Colombe D’Or painting, and 
                        their security camera got a photo. 

           Emma sits up, petrified. She flips to a photo in the paper. 

                                 LEO
                        Great work. I hope you’re very 
                        proud.

           THE PHOTO: it’s grainy, their faces aren’t completely clear. 
           But the make and model of the car is totally discernible.
                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god. I am so sorry.

           Leo storms out of the room.

           LATER

           Everyone strategizes at the table. Simon tries to stay calm. 
           Leo won’t even look at Emma. Alex is enjoying her punishment. 

                                 SIMON
                        We can’t drive back. We’ve got to 
                        ditch the car, destroy the plates. 
                        The photo barely shows your faces, 
                        I’m sure we can fly home. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        But we can’t ship the art. The plan 
                        was to drive because we don’t have 
                        a trustworthy shipper here, that 
                        was the whole bloody point--

                                 LEO
                        Fuck the paintings. We just need to 
                        get back to London. 

                                 SIMON
                        Who are you? Alex, who is he?

                                 ALEXANDER
                        He’s gone absolutely mad, like I 
                        said the other night. 

           Leo looks like he might maul Alexander. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Obviously we cannot afford to 
                        sacrifice the paintings.

           Emma lights up with an idea. 

                                 EMMA
                        We’ll take the paintings with us. 
                        On the airplane. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        You see, there’s this thing called 
                        customs? Nice idea though. Genius.

                                 EMMA
                        We conceal them.

           She has Simon’s attention, and Leo is listening.
                                 EMMA
                        I’ll apply a wash. A facade. It 
                        wouldn’t harm the painting 
                        underneath, just hide it. Then, 
                        they travel with us on the plane, 
                        we declare a total value of like 
                        two hundred euro. Tell customs that 
                        they’re souvenirs. Street art. 

           Alexander opens his mouth to object. Leo holds up a hand.

                                 LEO
                        You can do that? Fast?

                                 EMMA
                        That’s how I work.

           Leo finally meets her gaze. She’s resolved, he can tell.

                                 LEO
                        Fine. We fly tomorrow.

           INT. CHATEAU - DAY

           A row of about ten STOLEN PAINTINGS line the table. At her 
           easel, Emma paints over one of them. ON THE PAINTING: a very 
           serious portrait of NAPOLEON. Finished, she sets it aside.

           She turns to the Chagall. She runs a finger along its ravaged 
           edges, the deep gashes in its paint. Tears in her eyes.

                                 EMMA
                        What did I do to you?

           I/E. TAXI - DAY

           Emma stares out the window as they approach the AIRPORT. She 
           clutches her bag at her side. Reminds herself to breathe.

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Before the gate, Emma, Leo, Alexander and Simon watch CUSTOMS 
           OFFICERS tear through their bags. Inspecting. Emma fidgets, 
           eyeing a large TRUNK. One officer OPENS it. Emma looks ill. 

           She looks out the window, where the plane waits.

           The officer unpacks each piece of stolen art, but Emma has 
           PAINTED OVER THEM. There’s Napoleon, a cat playing poker, the 
           Eifel Tower, and a very serious still life of a fruit bowl.
           Emma picks at her lips. The officers JOKE in French, making 
           fun. Emma clocks Leo, who refuses to acknowledge her. 

           One officer’s gaze hangs on Napoleon. He picks it up, holds 
           it close to his face. Emma watches. Frozen. Petrified. 

           Finally, he scoops the paintings, throws them back into the 
           trunk, knocking the canvases together. Emma, anxious, bursts--

                                 EMMA
                        Careful!

           Alexander clenches his fists. They officers give her strange 
           looks. She smiles, recovers. 

           They roll their eyes and place the paintings back in the 
           trunk just as roughly as before. 

           INT. PRIVATE PLANE - DAY

           Emma watches out the window as they soar away, safe. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LEO
                        I’ve been thinking. 

           Emma tenses, bracing herself for something awful. 

                                 LEO
                        What about Nantucket, for the 
                        summer?

                                 EMMA
                        Really?

                                 LEO
                        Your parents could come. Your 
                        friends, too. Maybe we stay a 
                        while. Get a break. If you want.

                                 EMMA
                        What you said before, about things 
                        changing... about a real life...
                        I want that, too. More than 
                        anything. I got out of control, but 
                        it’s so clear now. This is it. 

                                 LEO
                        Good.

           He looks back out the window. She closes her eyes, relieved. 
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Leo ushers Simon and Alexander in and locks the door.

                                 LEO
                        I’m getting out of the deal with 
                        Haysworth.

                                 SIMON
                        You cannot do that.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        You can’t fuck us, Leo, we won’t 
                        let you.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        I won’t do it to her. And I’ll pay 
                        you both. You’ll get your share. I 
                        don’t care if I have to sell this 
                        place, the cars, everything. I’m 
                        not doing it. 

           Alexander moves to Leo, and this time Simon’s with him.

                                 LEO
                        This is what’s happening.

           Alexander is ready to kill him. Leo walks away.

           EXT. BELGRAVIA STREET - NIGHT

           Emma rushes out of Leo’s house, dressed for dinner in a chic 
           blazer and a sparkly little skirt. She hurries, running late.

           A MAN rounds the corner and walks behind her, close, moving 
           at exactly her pace. She looks back. He’s vaguely familiar... 
           and we’ll recognize him as SAUL, one of Haysworth’s guys. 

           She motions like, ‘do you want to pass me?’ 

           But he just STARES at her silently and continues walking.  

           It’s chilling.

           Emma breathes a little faster. She can feel him right on her 
           heels, so she picks up speed. Turns left. Crosses the street.

           When she peers back over her shoulder, he’s gone.

           INT. QUEEN’S ARMS PUB - NIGHT

           Emma sits with Bernie and Alison at the bar. 
           They’re cheerful, laughing and teasing, but Emma is rattled, 
           tense from the walk, and she can’t quite shake it off.

                                 ALISON
                        I feel like we still haven’t heard 
                        about the buying trip. 

           The BARTENDER delivers a cocktail to Emma. She looks at it.

                                 EMMA
                        I can tell you right now there’s 
                        too much St. Germain. 

           The bartender can’t believe she’s not even going to try it. 
           Neither can Alison or Bernie. But Emma isn’t kidding. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        I’ll remake it. 

           Emma nods like, ‘yes, you will.’ She sighs.

                                 EMMA
                        Anything more complicated than beer 
                        appears to be a problem here.

                                 BERNIE
                        So the trip...

                                 EMMA
                        Oh. You know. Buying art. It’s kind 
                        of an esoteric thing. I don’t want 
                        to bore you guys. 

           Bernie’s stung by the condescension. Alison leans in.

                                 ALISON
                        Hey, is everything all right?

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah. Everything’s great.

                                 ALISON
                        Oh, okay.

                                 EMMA
                        Why? What?

           Bernie looks at Alison like, ‘please don’t do this.’

                                 ALISON
                        I just get a funny feeling that 
                        something’s a bit off. Like, maybe 
                        you’re not so happy. Did anything 
                        bad happen on the trip? Is it Leo? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALISON (CONT'D)
                        You wouldn’t be the first person to 
                        fall headfirst into a new job, or a 
                        new love, and find that it’s not-- 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey. Don’t be judge-y.

                                 BERNIE
                        She’s not, she’s not.

                                 ALISON
                        I’m not. Sorry. It’s just, you were 
                        kind of snippy. The cocktail thing? 
                        I mean, come on... 

           She’s trying to laugh about it, but this sets Emma off.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. Yeah, I’m under stress. And 
                        yes, things are changing. My work. 
                        My money. God forbid, better 
                        cocktails, better food, travel. 
                        Leo, who has been fantastic to me-- 

                                 ALISON
                        Whoa. I didn’t say... Look, I like 
                        Leo, you’re the one who seems--

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not the friend who doesn’t have 
                        it together anymore. Sorry if 
                        that’s a problem for you.

           Bernie is positively paralyzed by the awkwardness of this.

                                 ALISON
                        It’s like you’re having this 
                        conversation with yourself.

           Emma’s face falls. Over Bernie’s shoulder, she sees the TALL 
           MAN FROM THE STREET walk in and take a seat at the bar. He 
           holds her eye contact. He wants her to know he’s watching... 

                                 ALISON
                        Emma, I’m just trying to check in. 
                        I care about you.

           But she’s a million miles away. She gets up.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m going to the bathroom.
           INT. HAYSWORTH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The eerie, windowless bottom floor of Haysworth’s ultra-
           contemporary $30 million house. While he and Leo sit and 
           talk, a meeting of Haysworth’s private club is going on. 

           A dozen MEN in matching jackets drink whiskey and pore over 
           an EXHIBIT OF PAINTINGS. Masterworks. Kronin hovers...

           Aside, Leo sits across from Haysworth in an armchair. 

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        I’m very disappointed to hear this.  

           Leo’s distracted by one of the paintings over his shoulder. 
           It’s familiar. He stares... and registers the image, shocked.  

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        Oh, do you recognize it? It’s from 
                        the Gardner Museum, a little place 
                        in Boston. My friends have a big 
                        appetite for rare art, which is why 
                        I just can’t accept that you’re not 
                        willing to get me what I ordered.

                                 LEO
                        I’ll repay your advance. With 
                        interest. Name your rate. 

                                 HAYSWORTH 
                        The problem is, I want what I 
                        ordered. We had a deal. We timed it 
                        perfectly. If we don’t do it now, 
                        I’ll miss my chance. I can’t just 
                        go and find someone else in the 
                        next couple weeks. You said you 
                        could get it for me. But it seems 
                        I’ve been taken for a ride. 

                                 LEO
                        No, that’s not the case--

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        Maybe I haven’t been sufficiently 
                        clear about how serious I am.  

           Haysworth motions to Kronin, who brings him a FOLDER. 
           Haysworth takes a stack of PHOTOGRAPHS, slides it to Leo.

           ON THE PHOTOS

           Images of Emma: Alone on the street at night, walking out of 
           Leo’s house, getting into a cab, a close-up of her face.
                                 HAYSWORTH
                        If you break our deal, there will 
                        be repercussions.  

           Leo looks up at Haysworth, seething. 

                                 LEO
                        Fuck you, you pathetic child.

           He stands up to leave, furious, but Kronin blocks him.

                                 HAYSWORTH
                        We’re still not understanding each 
                        other, Leo. Look around you. Look 
                        at all these fine, cultured 
                        gentlemen, these leaders of 
                        civilization. There’s no version of 
                        not giving us what we want, you 
                        see, because... well, you won’t get 
                        away with it. You’ll be destroyed.  
                             (a fluttering laugh)
                        This is all so abstract! I should 
                        prove my good faith. Why don’t you 
                        and Kronin take a walk? 

           Kronin GRABS Leo’s arm and pulls him around the corner, out 
           of the party. Before Leo can react, Kronin SLAMS him in the 
           face, crushing his nose. Leo holds in a YELP of pain, throws 
           a fierce punch back, then an elbow to Kronin’s jaw...

           Wrong decision. Furious, Kronin UNLEASHES on Leo, pummeling 
           him. Blood and spit spackle the walls of Haysworth’s home. 

           INT. TRENDY BAR - BATHROOM - LATER

           Emma, in a stall, presses her phone to her cheek.

                                 EMMA
                             (whispering into phone)
                        Leo. Call me back as soon as you 
                        get this. It’s an emergency, and...

           She hears the SWISH of the door. Someone else has come in.

                                 EMMA
                             (into phone)
                        Please. I’m serious.

           Emma hangs up. When she emerges from her stall, she freezes.

           The TALL MAN who followed her is standing at the sink.

           He stares at her in the mirror. 
           He reaches up and flicks the faucet off. 

           Emma’s chilled. She looks past him. Moving to the door--

                                 TALL MAN
                        He won’t call back.

           Emma stops. The faucet DRIPS in the silence. 

                                 TALL MAN
                        I’m afraid he’s indisposed. 

           Emma turns to him... immediately sensing how big he is... how 
           alone they are... the menacing coldness in his eyes...

                                 EMMA
                        What? 

                                 TALL MAN
                        People who don’t do their jobs are 
                        usually terminated. You ought to 
                        know that, Emma. He’s lucky we 
                        still need him. So are you.  

                                 EMMA
                        Where is he? What did you do to 
                        him?

           The Tall Man dries his hands and moves to the door. Emma, 
           terrified, takes a step back, away from him. He sees her 
           fear, and he smiles. Moves toward her a little. 

                                 TALL MAN
                        He’s getting a good night’s rest at 
                        Charing Cross. 

           He leaves. Emma GASPS as the meaning of this sinks in. 

           INT. TRENDY BAR - NIGHT

           Back at the table, Bernie and Alison soldier through dinner.

                                 BERNIE
                        She’ll be back soon. It’ll be fine.

           Emma rushes past their table. She doesn’t stop to talk.

                                 EMMA
                        I have to go.

                          BERNIE
           No, no, don’t leave.
                                                         ALISON
                                              Oh, please, Emma--
           Emma races off without responding.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Leo lies on a bed. His face is bloodied and bruised, his nose 
           covered in bandages, stitches on one cheek. His left eye is 
           so swollen it can’t quite open. Emma sees him through the 
           window in the hallway. She barrels in, tears in her eyes.

                                 LEO
                        Told the doctors I got into a fight 
                        over a pub quiz.

           She’s overwhelmed, absolutely not in a joking mood--

                                 EMMA
                        What happened? Who did this? This 
                        man, he knew you were here... 

           She’s nearly crying. He takes her hand. She touches his face.

                                 LEO
                        I’m fine.

                                 EMMA
                        They followed me, I thought they 
                        were cops, and--

                                 LEO
                        I know.

                                 EMMA
                        What? What do you mean, you know?

                                 LEO
                        They’re sending a message. 

                                 EMMA
                        The police?

                                 LEO
                        No, worse.

           She’s had enough of this cryptic bullshit. 

                                 EMMA
                        What? Then who?

                                 LEO
                        Haysworth. I’m in trouble, Emma. It 
                        will be fine, but I need your help.
           She doesn’t move. She doesn’t breathe. The fear, the waiting 
           for the truth, is the worst part. 

                                 LEO
                        Haysworth hired us to steal a 
                        painting he’s wanted forever. 
                        Simple deal, with a big advance 
                        because it’s a little more 
                        complicated... more preparation, 
                        more obstacles. A bigger job--  

                                 EMMA
                        Spit it out.

                                 LEO
                        He wants Jacob de Gheyn III.

                                 EMMA
                        The Takeaway Rembrandt? 

           She’s shocked. Leo confirms it with a nod, avoiding her eyes.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s impossible. It’s a priceless 
                        painting. That’s a suicide mission.

                                 LEO
                        I tried to get out. I told him I 
                        couldn’t do it, that I’m getting 
                        out of the business, that I’d repay 
                        the advance--

                                 EMMA
                        And you’ve just been keeping this 
                        to yourself, this tiny facet of our 
                        business plan. 

                                 LEO
                        I was hoping I could make it go 
                        away. But I couldn’t. I can’t. 

           She paces, adrenaline coursing through her.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s just a painting.

                                 LEO
                        No. That’s not true. These guys, 
                        they’re narcissists. It’s about 
                        power... greed... Haysworth’s got a 
                        whole network behind him. We’re 
                        nothing up against them.
                                 EMMA
                        Let’s go to the police. Right now.

                                 LEO
                        And say what, we’ve been 
                        threatened? We’re criminals. We’d 
                        spend the rest of our lives in 
                        jail. 

                                 EMMA
                        What if we just disappeared?

                                 LEO
                        Are you listening? Haysworth, these 
                        people, they run deep. He wants his 
                        painting now. The new wing... he 
                        knows this is his chance. The only 
                        way out is to give it to him.

                                 EMMA
                        You said you wanted a real life.

                                 LEO
                        I do.

                                 EMMA
                        But you’re asking me to help you 
                        forge and steal a Rembrandt. 

           Emma leans against the wall, mind spinning, searching--

                                 LEO
                        He’ll come after me if we don’t get 
                        him his painting. He knows who you 
                        are. Where you are. He’ll come 
                        after you too. 

           Emma’s chilled to her core. The gravity of this sinks in.

                                 LEO
                        If we can’t pull this off...

           ...Leo will die. This hangs in the air between them for a 
           long moment. But something strikes her.

                                 EMMA
                        When did this start, this deal?

                                 LEO
                        Since before you came on.
                                 EMMA
                        Since before I came on. So... the 
                        funding of the new wing, the 
                        renovation, it was all for this.

                        Are vulnerable. 

           Something CLICKS for Emma, but she doesn’t reveal it.   

                                 EMMA
                             (quiet, with gravity)
                        Fuck you, Leo.

                                 LEO
                        I’m sorry. You’re the only one who 
                        can help.  

           Emma processes the implications of this. Reeling. He watches 
           her, desperate, waiting for a response. She leans in:

                                 EMMA
                        I won’t let you back me into a 
                        corner. That’s not how this works. 

           He closes his eyes. He’s lost this battle, he’s sure--

                                 EMMA
                        I will help you. But listen to me, 
                        it’s going to be on my terms. I’m 
                        planning this one. 

           He exhales deeply, accepting this.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m going to fix everything.

           Emma looks off, her mind ablaze. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - BENSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma sits in her old spot, opposite Benson’s desk. Benson 
           holds a copy of Emma’s resume. She squints at it. 

                                 EMMA
                        Please, I’ll do anything for a 
                        second chance.

                                 BENSON
                        After how you behaved.
                                 EMMA
                        I’m so sorry. I was brazen and 
                        disrespectful and wrong. You were 
                        right. Support staff is where I 
                        belong. I was trying to cut 
                        corners, and I shouldn’t have. 
                             (another angle...)
                        You must be drowning in work with 
                        the new wing opening. I can help. I 
                        already know how everything works.

           Emma holds her breath, wondering if she’s gone too far...

                                 BENSON
                        Well. It’d be unpaid to start.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Emma, Leo, Simon, and Alexander eat dinner. She pitches them--

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll stay overnight at the museum. 
                        Linger at my desk, when everyone’s 
                        gone, sneak in and steal it-- 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        No way. She’s not doing this alone. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s the simplest way. 

           She looks to Leo, expecting him to defend her idea.

                                 LEO
                        We’re doing this together, all of 
                        us. It’s safer that way. Haysworth 
                        would never approve of just you... 
                        So... figure out something else.

           Emma takes in this obvious distrust. She sips her wine. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - DAY

           Emma is back in her old routine. She punches a code and walks 
           down a corridor to the new wing. She delivers a set of forms 
           to the CONTRACTOR. She assesses the room: the flooring is 
           half-installed, the ceiling still covered in scaffolding. 

           She clocks the latest set of BLUEPRINTS on a table. 

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        The rumors are true! 
           Emma jumps, startled, turns to find Eddie. She hugs him. 

                                 EDDIE 
                        What are you doing back here?

                                 EMMA
                        Believe it or not, I actually 
                        missed this place.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’ve gone entirely mad. Come on, 
                        let’s have lunch.

           She steals another look behind her as he leads her off. 

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

           Prep for the heist. A blown-up DIAGRAM of the NEW WING -- two 
           large, adjoined rooms -- with points marked in RED. 

           The future location of the TAKEAWAY REMBRANDT is noted with 
           an X, and the placement of the security camera is CIRCLED. 

           Emma leads this planning phase, the guys listen. Alexander is 
           skeptical, Simon is patient but unsure, and Leo is tense. 

                                 EMMA
                        They move the paintings from the 
                        old baroque section to the new wing 
                        after closing on the 17th. But the 
                        new wing isn’t scheduled to open to 
                        the public until the 19th. So we’ve 
                        got 24 hours when those paintings 
                        are sitting on their freshly 
                        painted walls, alone. No people. 

                                 SIMON
                        If it’s closed, how will we get in?

                                 EMMA
                        Leo, as a donor to the new wing, 
                        you’ll request a private tour. I’ll 
                        be happy to show you and a couple 
                        of your friends around before it’s 
                        open to the public.
                             (continuing)
                        There will be a guard on rotation, 
                        but I’ll make sure my friend 
                        Eddie’s on the schedule so we can 
                        get him out. The security camera 
                        will be installed here... so we’ll 
                        have to contend with that...
                                 ALEXANDER
                        “We’ll contend with that.” Sounds 
                        like you have an airtight plan--

                                 EMMA
                        I’m figuring it out. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Really? You’re figuring it out. I’m 
                        so relieved. Leo, honestly, we 
                        should handle this part ourselves--

                                 EMMA
                        No. This one’s mine. 

           Emma looks at Leo, testing him, testing his promise...

                                 LEO
                        She’s right.

           Alexander shakes his head. Even Simon looks nervous.

                                 LEO
                        And what about our painting?

           Emma looks at him, eyes leveled.

                                 EMMA
                        It’ll be done.  

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           A series of shots over time as Emma creates her forgery:

           -Emma has blown up a gigantic computer image of the Takeaway 
           Rembrandt and separated it into quadrants. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        A forgery like this takes 
                        painstaking work. 

           -On a canvas, she delineates the same quadrants in pencil 
           with brutal accuracy.

           -Emma’s canvas is covered in pencil markings: an incredible 
           sketch copy of the Takeaway Rembrandt.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        It has to be so good that the 
                        museum won’t notice for a long, 
                        long time. Maybe ever...
           -Emma pores over books on Baroque portraiture. Her finger 
           traces down the page, landing on a section: AUTHENTIC PAINTS. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        It’s possible. Fake Rembrandts have 
                        passed for real ones, only to be 
                        discovered decades later... 

           -With a mortar and pestle, Emma grinds pigments. 

           -Using the giant photo as a guide, she begins painting. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        ...but it requires almost divine-
                        level precision. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Emma sits on the edge of the security desk with Eddie, as 
           they eat bagged lunches. The bay of screens before Eddie 
           flicks through SECURITY FEEDS of all the museum’s rooms. 

                                 EMMA
                        Do you ever get lonely in the 
                        museum at night? 

                                 EDDIE
                        Oh, I haven’t worked a night shift 
                        in fifteen years. 

                                 EMMA
                        But when you used to?

                                 EDDIE
                        Nah. Kinda nice here at night, 
                        actually. Quiet. You read... I like 
                        that Stephen King, did you ever 
                        read anything by him? And you can 
                        play whatever TV show you want, 
                        plus you have to go on rounds every 
                        three hours... makes the time go. 

           As he rambles she STUDIES the room... A white-board SCHEDULE. 
           THE ROUNDS LOG, a clipboard mounted on the wall. 

           And the MONITORS: they show black and white surveillance 
           footage, the images are crisp but VERY BRIGHT.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s so bright. The exposure...

                                 EDDIE
                        What?
                                 EMMA
                        Nothing. You have to go on rounds 
                        every three hours, really? 

           She can’t tear her eyes away from the monitors...

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - MAIN HALL - DAY

           Emma’s face is inches from the Takeaway. She looks over her 
           shoulder, moves even closer, inspecting it. She makes pencil 
           dots on a PAD OF PAPER, held low against her side. 

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

           Emma shades the face of Jacob de Gheyn with a fine brush. 
           Now, it’s less of a copying process and more of an intuitive 
           one. The image bursts to life on the canvas. His eyes are 
           eerily blank, those are next. She’s about to begin when...

           She stops. Pulls back. She realizes her hand is shaking. 

           The pressure of this is all so much. She clenches and 
           releases her hand, terrified that she can’t handle this. 

           INT. EMMA’S FLAT - DAY

           Back at her old place, Emma looks through her art supplies. 
           She finds what she needs: a special black TUBE for a canvas. 

           She stops and takes in her messy apartment. Her old home.

           Something catches her eye: that sundial MOBILE, projecting a 
           SMILING FACE onto the wall. Emma slumps... the irony of it...

           And then... an idea strikes her. 

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

           Emma is talking a mile-a-minute to Leo, Simon, and Alexander--

                                 EMMA
                        We don’t disconnect the security 
                        camera: we outsmart it. The same 
                        way artists use light to create a 
                        shadow, a highlight, a bright spot, 
                        we can use the light to disappear. 

           Leo locks eyes with Emma, impressed and curious.
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma has built a homemade MINIATURE REPLICA of the Takeaway 
           Rembrandt’s room. Her computer is open to an application that 
           shows the SUN’S POSITION IN THE SKY. She uses a FLASHLIGHT to 
           represent the sun moving over the room and a piece of 
           cardboard with a CUT-OUT SKYLIGHT for the ceiling.  

                                 EMMA
                        Sun pouring through a 3-foot-by-4 
                        foot skylight will create a 
                        rectangle of light that moves 
                        across the room from 8:15 a.m. to 
                        approximately 6:52, according to 
                        sunrise and sunset times for the 
                        18th. You see? This shaft of light 
                        will shift based on the position of 
                        the sun. So when the sun is here...
                             (moving the flashlight)
                        ...from 12:58 to 1:01 or 1:02, the 
                        sun will hit the south wall, here. 
                        And we can harness it. Shoot it 
                        back to the camera. These security 
                        cameras, they’re pre-set, they 
                        don’t have an iris that adjusts 
                        automatically. If they receive a 
                        burst of light, they won’t be able 
                        to read... Do you see? The sun will 
                        allow us to--

                                 LEO 
                        Steal the painting in plain sight.

           The guys are rapt. Even Alexander is amazed by this. 

                                 EMMA
                        Totally undetected by the cameras. 
                        For a window of two, three minutes.

                                 SIMON
                        Won’t the guard, or whoever’s 
                        watching the cameras, notice? I 
                        mean, if I just see some ghostly 
                        burst of light in the gallery...

                                 EMMA
                        They might see it, and think, oh, 
                        well, tomorrow we should move the 
                        camera, or get a screen for the 
                        skylight. But remember, this is the 
                        first day there will even be 
                        paintings in this section. They 
                        won’t notice before it’s too late.  
           Simon considers this, content. He looks to Leo.

                                 LEO
                        It’s brilliant. You’re brilliant. 
                        But I know you. What’s the catch?

                                 EMMA
                        The skylight in the new wing... is 
                        not quite big enough.

           Alexander throws his hands up, about to object--

                                 EMMA 
                        Don’t worry, I have a plan. 

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma works feverishly on something at the table. She’s using 
           a ruler, protractors, tracing paper. She’s laser-focused... 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I’ll create new blueprints, and 
                        then swap them out. 

           She’s creating an incredible version of the new wing’s 
           BLUEPRINTS, with one addition: THE SKYLIGHT.  

                                 ALEXANDER (V.O.)
                        How will that possibly work?

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - DAY

           Emma enters. On the workers’ table are the REAL BLUEPRINTS. 
           In one fluid motion, Emma SWAPS THEM with her FORGERY. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        First of all, my copy will be 
                        perfect, except for the necessary 
                        changes, of course.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - DAY

           HAMMERING and SAWING. The construction team works away. A 
           BIGGER SKYLIGHT is being built in the new wing.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Second of all, they know me. They 
                        trust me. They see me every day. 
           Emma stands below as sawdust flies. BENSON storms in, arguing 
           with the CONTRACTOR, MOS. She points to the skylight. He 
           shows her EMMA’S FAKED BLUEPRINT. 

           For an excruciating moment Emma watches, waits, wondering if 
           this will satisfy Benson. Benson’s eyes narrow on the page...

           ...she hands the BLUEPRINT back to the contractor, sheepish. 
           She apologizes MOS for what is clearly a misunderstanding... 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        They would never suspect me.

           Satisfied, Emma turns and leaves. 

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           A SERIES OF SHOTS over time as Emma finishes her painting:

           -With a thick brush, Emma coats the painting in chemicals. 

           -She dries it under a special fan. The canvas is softer, more 
           delicate. This process has aged the painting.

           -She stretches the painting over a wooden frame and secures 
           it. She consults the pad lined in dots. Turns on a DRILL. 

           Its rotating point is fine, a pinprick. 

           Her little PAD OF PAPER marked in DOTS is poised in front of 
           her. She PUNCTURES the HER CANVAS in spots corresponding with 
           the DOTS on the pad. The drill BUZZES, loud.

           Emma is so focused she doesn’t hear Leo come in behind her...

                                 LEO
                        Looks fantastic.

           Emma jumps, her hand slips, and the drill dips back to the 
           surface of the painting. A HOLE, larger than the rest.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god!

                                 LEO
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        No! The wormhole. This is supposed 
                        to be tiny, a flaw, exactly like 
                        the original. Why would you sneak 
                        up on me? This needs to be perfect!
                                 LEO
                        It is perfect.

                                 EMMA
                        What’ll happen if someone at the 
                        museum recognizes this? 

                                 LEO
                        They won’t. You need to relax. 

                                 EMMA
                        Get out! Just let me work!

           She’s serious. He pivots and goes, leaving her alone.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY

           Emma looks weary, like she hasn’t left her workspace in 
           weeks. But the painting’s nearly complete, and it’s stunning.

           The DAYS marked off on her CALENDAR tell us its the 17th.

           She looks at the enlarged photograph of the Takeaway, then at 
           her forgery. They’re identical. There’s just one thing left. 

           REMBRANDT’S SIGNATURE. On a sheet of paper, she has practiced 
           it dozens of times. Now it’s time for the real thing.

           Her brush hovers over the canvas’s corner. She steadies her 
           hand, steadies her mind. One wrong move and it’s all over. 

           She signs. Fast. Confident. 

           ON THE PAINTING: Emma’s Rembrandt signature is perfect.

           She takes this in, all alone. After a moment, Emma gets up. 
           She moves to the door, and with a decisive calm, LOCKS IT. 

           Emma ROLLS UP HER PAINTING. She slides it into the BLACK TUBE 
           and puts the tube inside her purse. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           A series of shots as Emma goes about her day at work:

           -She brings a perfect cup of tea to Benson, surrounded by 
           paperwork. Benson, for once, doesn’t bark at Emma. 

           -She walks up to the NEW WING. It’s complete, but the walls 
           are empty. Light STREAMS in through that skylight.
           -She walks alongside Eddie on his rounds. A MUSEUM-GOER stops 
           to ask Eddie a question, MOS, and Emma reaches into Eddie’s 
           loose blazer pocket... she STEALS his ID CARD. 

           -Emma puts Eddie’s ID CARD in the BOTTOM DRAWER of her desk. 

           -Emma watches as WORKERS carefully move paintings, frames and 
           all, from the walls of the main hall. She follows them...

           -One worker gingerly carries the Takeaway Rembrandt... 

           -And sets it on the wall of the new wing. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - NIGHT

           Emma intercepts a WORKER who is hanging a BAROQUE MIRROR. 

                                 EMMA
                        Excuse me? Hi. That piece goes on 
                        the south wall. 

                                 WORKER
                        Really? But my instructions say--

                                 EMMA
                        No, no, no, listen to me, it 
                        absolutely must go on the south 
                        wall. It’s too cramped on the north 
                        wall, come see-- over here-- it 
                        will totally open up the space. 
                             (when he doesn’t follow)
                        I can call Benson and she’ll tell 
                        you herself, but she really doesn’t 
                        like to be bothered this late...

           The worker caves, brings the mirror to the south wall.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

           Emma pokes her head in. A GUARD, TED, 30s, chubby, friendly, 
           sits. Her eyes scan his ROUNDS LOG mounted by the doorway. 

                                 EMMA
                        Goodnight, Ted. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - BASEMENT - NIGHT 

           Emma’s back in her office. She slumps in her chair, cheek 
           pressed to her desk. She falls asleep...  
           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NIGHT

           The lights flick off in the different sections of the museum. 

           The lobby. The main hall. The basement. The new wing.  

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Early morning. Emma staggers in, wearing yesterday’s clothes.  

                                 LEO 
                        Where have you been?

                                 EMMA
                        I stayed at my place. 

                                 LEO
                        Okay... I missed you.

                                 EMMA
                        The painting’s finished. I’ll be 
                        waiting for you guys in the lobby 
                        at 12:45 sharp. I’m ready. 

           She unbuttons her shirt and slips out of her clothes. He 
           looks at her, betraying a bit of longing... 

                                 EMMA 
                        It’s not lost on me, you know. I 
                        get it. Your whole plan.

                                 LEO
                        What are you talking about?

                                 EMMA
                        I was a mark. A pawn. Haysworth 
                        hired you to steal The Takeaway 
                        Rembrandt, you orchestrated the 
                        timing perfectly, the whole plan. 
                        But you needed someone you could 
                        use. On the inside. And you got me.

           He’s speechless... exhausted... he has no defense.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Access to the museum. Knowledge of 
                        the security system, the Rembrandt, 
                        the new wing. Didn’t hurt that I 
                        could copy a painting. Most of all, 
                        someone you could leave with the 
                        smoking gun if things went to shit. 
                                 LEO
                        No, that part’s not true.

                                 EMMA
                        Everything was a con. You said you 
                        wanted a life together, that I was 
                        enough. Did you ever care about me?     

                                 LEO
                        When we chose you for this job I 
                        didn’t know I’d fall in love.

           She shakes her head as she pulls on her work clothes.

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t know what’s real anymore.

                                 LEO
                        Listen. After we survive this, you 
                        can leave. With me or without me. 
                        But you need to know that I meant 
                        everything I said. I didn’t mean to 
                        love you, but I did. And I do. 

           Emma turns her back to him. 

           EXT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           As Eddie approaches the Employee Entrance, he looks for his 
           ID CARD. But it’s not there. Benson struts in behind him. 

                                 BENSON
                        What’s the problem, Eddie?

                                 EDDIE
                        Sorry, Boss, I can’t seem to find 
                        my ID Card...

           Benson sears him with her glare. Eddie cowers.

                                 BENSON
                        That’s a major security breach. 

                                 EDDIE
                        I had it yesterday. It must be in 
                        the museum.

                                 BENSON
                        Find it by the end of today or 
                        there will be serious consequences. 

           She opens the door for him. Off Eddie, terrified...
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

           Leo, Emma, Alexander and Simon stand before the easel, where 
           the painting is affixed. 

           Leo has a LEATHER ENVELOPE inlaid in a special BRIEFCASE to 
           transport the painting. Emma whimpers as he reaches for it.

                                 EMMA
                        Careful...

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           Emma rushes in, through the MAIN HALL, and straight to...

           THE NEW WING

           ...where everything is perfect. The paintings hang on the 
           pristine walls, the MIRROR is in place, and the sun cascades 
           through the skylight. 

           Content, Emma eyes THE TAKEAWAY REMBRANDT. 

           But when she turns to leave, Emma’s face falls... 

           A group of PEOPLE are huddled at the new wing’s entrance.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           Emma trails Benson, who explains, to Emma’s horror--

                                 BENSON
                        ...We always let our members see a 
                        new exhibit a day before the 
                        public. How do you think we get 
                        them to pay 100 pounds a year? 

           Emma’s dumbstruck... practically shaking as she takes in the 
           gravity of this... she has made a fatal mistake.  

                                 BENSON
                        Go on, they’re waiting for you. 

           EXT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           Emma meets Leo, Simon, and Alexander in the lobby. She moves 
           close to Leo, speaks low, trying to contain her utter panic-- 

                                 EMMA
                        We have a problem. They... I didn’t 
                        know... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        they let the museum members in for 
                        tours a day early. I guess they do 
                        that, and I didn’t know--

                                 SIMON
                        You mean people, in the new wing? 

           Leo’s gobsmacked. Emma nods, she can barely form words.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        This is over. I’m calling it off. 
                        It’s too big of a risk. 

                                 EMMA
                             (a spike of resolve)
                        No. We can’t. This is our only 
                        chance. In another day they’ll 
                        notice the glare from the light-- 
                        they’ll move the camera. We have to 
                        do this now.

           Eyes wild, she means this with every fiber of her being.

                                 LEO
                        How do you expect to--

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll distract them. You’ll need ten 
                        seconds... I’ll find it somehow. 

           Leo looks at Emma, a pang of distrust in his heart.

                                 EMMA
                        When we’re in the room, I’ll spot 
                        you. You wait for my signal. 

           Emma stalks off. Leo’s still, weighing this, considering...

                                 ALEXANDER
                        This is insane.

                                 LEO
                        I trust her. Let’s go.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - DAY

           Emma meets a group of about 25 PEOPLE outside the new wing. 
           Leo, Simon, and Alexander join the group, at the back.

                                 EMMA
                        Hi, everyone. Welcome to the 
                        Dulwich Picture Gallery.
           As the crowd assembles to follow her, Emma sees Eddie--

                                 EMMA
                        Eddie, Eddie-- I found your ID 
                        card, on the floor in the lobby.

                                 EDDIE
                        Oh, thank god! Benson was going to 
                        have my head--

                                 EMMA
                        Go get it, it’s in my cube. On the 
                        bookshelf, I think. 

           He looks at the group. He’s really not supposed to leave...

                                 EMMA
                        Go ahead, I can handle this crowd. 

           He smiles, grateful, and rushes off. 

           Emma’s eyes lock with Leo’s as this part clicks into place.

           She looks down at her watch: 12:51.

           Her heart pounding like a drum, she leads the group into... 

           THE NEW WING

           Emma’s eyes scan the gallery. She’s gut-punched when she 
           realizes... there is NO LONGER ANY LIGHT IN THE ROOM. 

           THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT: gray clouds have obscured the sun.

           Her eyes search the floor... but there’s no strip of light, 
           nothing... their whole plan... it’s ruined... 

                                 EMMA
                        Okay, everyone... Let’s start over 
                        here, with the Vermeers. 

           Over her shoulder, she shares a devastated glance with Leo. 
           She looks at her watch -- 12:52. Time is slipping away...

           ...but she presses on, not knowing what else to do. 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           -MOS, Emma speaks before the VERMEERS.

           -She showcases THE TAKEAWAY REMBRANDT. She looks at it, 
           desperate, an almost crazed sense of longing in her eyes... 
           -Before a STILL LIFE, Emma’s eyes flick to the skylight 
           again. There’s still no shaft of light, no light at all. 

           -On her watch: 12:59. Emma swallows a lump in her throat.

           -Leo and the guys stay at bay at the back of the room. Emma 
           looks at Leo. She shudders as if to say it’s all over. 

           -At the back of the group, Alexander whispers to Leo.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        We’re dead, Leo. 

           Leo, steely, holds in a boiling flood of emotion. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - MAIN HALL - DAY 

           Eddie, rushing to Emma’s office, crosses with Benson.

                                 BENSON
                        What are you doing?

                                 EDDIE
                        I found my card. Well, Emma did, 
                        it’s in her office, I’m going to--

                                 BENSON
                        You left your post?

           Eddie’s not sure what the right answer to this is...

                                 BENSON
                        Go ahead, get that card. I’ll make 
                        sure all’s well up there.

           Exasperated, Benson saunters off.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - DAY

           Emma’s watch reads 1:01. She’s about to give up, when, just 
           as she’s turning to lead the group away...

           ...majestically, miraculously, those fickle London clouds 
           part and SUN STREAMS in through the skylight.

           A bright, CONCENTRATED SHARD OF LIGHT hits the mirror and 
           shoots up to the CAMERA where it FLOODS THE LENS!

           Emma’s mouth falls open. Her head snaps to her watch. They 
           have mere seconds to complete this, but she gives the signal 
           to Leo -- an intense glare and a nod of her head. NOW.
           He doesn’t believe it at first, but then he sees-- they have 
           a chance. His gloved fist TIGHTENS around his briefcase.

           And the careful, painstaking dance begins: 

           Leo, Simon and Alexander retreat towards the back of the room 
           where the Takeaway is mounted on the far wall. Emma corrals 
           her tour over to a painting so that the crowds’ backs are to 
           the guys. Emma is facing the guys. Her eyes locked on Leo. 

                                 EMMA
                        Everyone, let’s come over here to 
                        our old friend Rubens and talk a 
                        little about his depiction of 
                        femininity. Come on, closer.

           Emma ushers everyone extremely close to a RUBENS PAINTING. 

           And right at this moment, BENSON walks into the room. She 
           joins Emma’s tour. Emma looks like she’s about to vomit. 

           Benson faces Emma, but if she were to turn around, she’d see 
           Leo, Simon, and Alexander hovering over the Takeaway...

                                 EMMA
                             (hanging on by a thread)
                        We see in this representation... an 
                        obvious affection for the subject. 

           AT THE TAKEAWAY

           Switchblades snap open from gloved hands. A TICK-TICK sound. 

           AT THE RUBENS

           Emma hears that TICK. No good. She glares at Leo, frozen. 

                                 EMMA
                        The way that the light hits her...

           Emma’s heart is in her throat. She looks at the sun -- time 
           is running out -- and at her group: EYES wander... SOMEONE 
           looks off to the side... This isn’t enough... she has to 
           distract them... Can she do it? Will she do it? 

           Leo’s stare burns into Emma. A bead of sweat drips down her 
           face. She blinks hard. Breathes. Her lips dry and quivering.

           Benson glances to the side, and is about to TURN AROUND WHEN--

                                 EMMA
                        Hey.

           Benson looks to the front, and Emma SCREAMS:
                                 EMMA
                        HEY! Look up here, FUCKING LOOK UP 
                        HERE, this is art--Do you not think 
                        this is important? THIS IS FUCKING 
                        IMPORTANT! You’re lucky to be 
                        standing here, at least fucking 
                        LOOK AT IT!!!! 

           She’s completely LOSING IT, and as she SCREAMS:

           AT THE TAKEAWAY

           A symphony of movements over mere seconds: 

           -Two FAST SLICES. Simon and Alexander, on either side of the 
           painting, use their KNIVES to wedge open the frame.

           -Without taking the painting down from its wire cables 
           anchored to the wall, Leo SEPARATES the bottom of the frame.

           -Alex peels Emma’s FORGERY from its leather envelope.

           -Leo slips out the ORIGINAL and inserts the FORGERY.

           -Leo double-checks Emma’s FORGERY ON THE MUSEUM WALL.

           AT THE RUBENS

                                 EMMA
                        I SAID THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT!!!

           The people on the tour can’t tear their eyes away from her... 
           She’s crazed, red-faced... She has completely lost herself...

           When Emma looks up, shaking, panting, as though coming out of 
           a trance, the guys are gone. The Takeaway appears untouched. 

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - LOBBY - DAY

           Emma walks through the museum, scanning the area for the 
           guys, who are nowhere to be found. Benson approaches... 

                                 BENSON
                        Emma!

           Emma doesn’t move a centimeter. She doesn’t breathe.

                                 BENSON
                        You’re a very bizarre girl. 
                             (Emma doesn’t react)
                        And you’re fired, obviously. 

           Emma quietly absorbs this. Benson walks off, annoyed. 
           EXT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

           Emma bursts out of the front doors, alone. She hurries down 
           the museum’s grand steps and into the courtyard...  

           She stops for a moment, taking in the PEOPLE around her. 

           TOURISTS move happily to the museum’s entrance. A group of 
           SCHOOL KIDS in uniforms eat lunch in the courtyard. A cute 
           COUPLE sits on the steps and looks at the Dulwich pamphlet. 

           She’s struck by all these people... all types, all walks of 
           life. All connected to the museum. And she smirks to herself. 

           Emma continues on, leaving the Dulwich behind.

           INT. HAYSWORTH’S PRIVATE VAULT - NIGHT

           Mahogany, recessed lighting, and illicit art. The collection 
           is incredible. There’s a Degas statue, a huge Francis Bacon. 

           Leo and Haysworth sit while thugs Kronin and Saul enter. 
           Kronin carries the briefcase. He snaps it open, unrolls... 

           THE TAKEAWAY REMBRANDT. Haysworth beams. He looks over the 
           canvas... the image... the signature. He smells it. 

           And grins. As he does, Leo squints at the painting, too. In 
           the center is that WORMHOLE. 

           It’s just a little too big.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NEW WING - DAY

           Benson, Eddie, and another GUARD inspect the new wing. 

                                 BENSON
                        I don’t understand. It’s a brand 
                        new camera.

                                 TED
                        Not the camera, Ma’am, the amount 
                        of light. Makes it hard to see.

                                 BENSON
                        Fine. We’ll fix it tomorrow. 
                        Nothing’s been touched in here.

           Eddie walks past the Takeaway. Its frame is slightly askew. 
           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Emma’s suitcase is open. She packs clothes, jewelry, her old 
           paintbrushes. Leo peeks in. He can’t hide his wry smile. 

                                 LEO
                        How did you do it? 

           She sees that he gets it, and she loves that about him. 

           Their conversation continues over a SERIES OF SHOTS:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A familiar scene. Emma leans in, whispers in Leo’s ear:

                                 EMMA
                        I’m going to fix everything.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        You went too far. I had to stop it. 
                             (thinking)
                        Haysworth will get a professional 
                        pair of eyes on that painting soon.

           INT. LEO’S HOUSE - EMMA’S STUDIO - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Emma rolls up her copy and puts it inside the BLACK TUBE.

                                 LEO (V.O.)
                        And when he does I’ll take the 
                        fall. He’ll come after me.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Emma says goodnight to Ted, the night guard. She clocks his 
           ROUNDS LOG and notes the time of the last entry -- 10:15 p.m.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I know. That’s why I suggest you 
                        get out of the country. Now.

           INT. DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Emma sleeps, head on her desk. An alarm on her phone wakes 
           her: ROUNDS, 1:15 a.m. She takes the BLACK TUBE from her bag. 

           Emma stalks down the main hall, past the...

           CONTROL ROOM
           She peers in. On a monitor marked IMPRESSIONISTS, she can see 
           Ted’s figure on the screen. He’s doing his rounds.

           Emma disappears into the darkened museum. 

           INT. NEW WING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Emma punches the code into the door’s keypad, and moves into 
           the new wing. She stands, alone, before the TAKEAWAY.

           She opens the black tube and pulls out her FORGERY. Emma 
           reaches up around the Takeaway’s frame. She’s wearing GLOVES, 
           and she opens an Exacto KNIFE. She WEDGES the frame open. 

           And removes the ORIGINAL REMBRANDT, slow, careful, barely 
           touching it as she does. Her body shaking. Breathing hard.

           She calms herself. Rolls the ORIGINAL into the tube.

           Emma slips her forgery into the frame. For a moment, she’s 
           mesmerized, looking at her masterpiece hanging on the wall...

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 LEO
                        I’ll leave tonight. The question 
                        is, are you coming with me?

                                 EMMA
                        No.

           He’s crushed, but he knows better than to fight her.

                                 LEO
                        You said you’d fix everything, and 
                        you did. Thank you.

           She’s surprised to hear this... it’s oddly touching.

           DOWNSTAIRS

           Emma crosses with Simon as she walks out. 

                                 SIMON
                        Hey. Good job, Emma. Brilliant.

           She smiles sadly at him, this friend she’ll never see again.

           INT. EMMA’S FLAT - DAY

           Lugging her suitcase, Emma flicks on the light. Her place is 
           a depressing mess. Her phone RINGS. On the screen: MOM. 
           She silences it. She unzips her suitcase and dumps the 
           contents on her bed. Starts unpacking. Her phone RINGS again. 
           This time she answers.

                                 EMMA
                        Hey, Mom, I’m so sorry we haven’t 
                        talked, I’ve been so busy, I just-- 

           INT. SMALL CAPE HOUSE - DAY

           Kate runs into the living room, holding up the phone.

                                 KATE
                        Mark! I got her! Honey, you haven’t 
                        answered your phone in forever!

           INTERCUT APARTMENT AND SUBURBAN HOUSE

           Emma searches for the words to explain...

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Well... we love it. We don’t know 
                        what to say. We’re just ecstatic.

           Behind Kate, their home is full of people.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Your father’s running a museum in 
                        our living room!

                                 EMMA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 KATE
                        What? The painting, the Van Gogh.

           On the mantle where the poster once hung is a REAL VAN GOGH.

                                 EMMA
                        When did you... I’m sorry, I... 
                        When did you receive that? How?

                                 KATE
                        The papers came first from a 
                        courier, then a delivery company 
                        brought it in an armored truck.

                                 EMMA
                        It has its papers? It’s... real.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, we know. Dad was so excited 
                        that he cried. I’ll put him on.
           Emma shakes her head... and something catches her eye. 
           Something in the pile of clothes she’s just dumped out. 

           A piece of paper. A POSTCARD, slipped between her things.

           ON THE POSTCARD

           A drawing of a towel on the beach over a seal: NANTUCKET, MA. 
           The very emblem of a simple life. 

           On the back a message: “The key is under the mat.” 

           There’s no postmark. 

                                 KATE 
                        You all right?

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, sorry Mom, I’m all right. 

           Emma closes her eyes. Drops the postcard back to the pile.  

           INT. MODEST APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Emma approaches a doorway with a wilted plant and a worn 
           welcome mat. She touches the door with the palm of her hand, 
           and carefully slips an ENVELOPE under the door. 

           She rings the bell. By the time Eddie answers, she’s gone. 

           He picks up the envelope and looks inside. It’s full of CASH.

           INT. EMMA’S FLAT - NIGHT

           A KNOCK at the door. Emma answers. It’s Alison and Bernie, 
           and her whole body sighs in relief. She hugs Alison tight.

                                 EMMA
                        You came. I can’t believe you came.

                                 ALISON
                        Had to see if you were truly alive.

                                 EMMA
                        I am now. Somewhat. I promise.

           EXT. FERRY - NANTUCKET - DAY

           A small ferry glides over gray water. 
           On a bench at the back of the boat, LEO sits, suitcase at his 
           feet, sunglasses on. An OLD LADY reads a book nearby. 

                                 OLD LADY
                        First time to Nantucket?

                                 LEO
                        Yes.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Looking for some peace and quiet?

           He smiles, ‘yes.’ The horn BLOWS as they approach the harbor. 
           He collects his bag and a lone PAINTING wrapped in paper.

           Through a tear, we see... it’s Emma’s Elvis.

           EXT. THREE BEACH STREET - DAY

           A tiny cottage, weathered by wind and rain, built into the 
           sand dune. Leo takes a breath of fresh air. He approaches the 
           front door...

           He peels up the sea-shell print mat, hopeful... 

           ...but the spare HOUSE KEY is still there. Leo deflates.  

           INT. THREE BEACH STREET - DAY

           Leo trudges inside. In the entryway, he freezes. Senses 
           movement. He takes a careful step down the hallway. Another. 
           Braced for danger... He hears, in the bathroom, a CLINKING...  

           He steps around the corner, tense...

           ...and finds Emma, in the bathtub, drinking a glass of wine.

                                 EMMA
                        I decided we could call it even. 
                             (off his look of awe)
                        Oh, I broke in. The back window’s 
                        loose, always has been. 

           Leo drops to his knees.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        We’ll have to fix that. 

           She gives him a long, luxurious kiss.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
