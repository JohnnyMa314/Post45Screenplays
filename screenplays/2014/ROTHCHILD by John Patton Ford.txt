           THERE ARE NO OPENING CREDITS, JUST A 

           MAXIMUM SECURITY JAIL CELL - NIGHT 

           where, sitting with immaculate posture and great patience, is 
           BECKET ROTHCHILD (30-ish). Our Hero.  

           He is tall. He is handsome. And even in his prison jumpsuit, 
           he looks like a scoundrel of aristocratic bearing. Like John 
           Wilkes Booth, born a century-and-a-half late. 

           Footsteps approach. They belong to FATHER MURPHY, who appears 
           at the bars. Hunched. Brow furrowed. 

           BUZZZ. The bars open and the priest shuffles inside, pulls 
           out a TAPE RECORDER... 

                                 FATHER MURPHY
                        I asked for a typewriter, but they 
                        said you might do something 
                        dramatic with such a heavy object. 

           Becket looks at him. Takes the tape recorder.  

           And Father Murphy settles across the room, sweating in his 
           linen cassock. Becket unfurls a crisp handkerchief, offers. 

           The Priest considers. Takes it. Wipes his brow.   

                                 BECKET
                        Alright then.
                             (presses record)
                        July sixteenth, God’s great year of 
                        two-thousand and thirteen. This is 
                        your hero and faithful narrator, 
                        Becket Rothchild. Rightful heir to 
                        the Rothchild fortune. Convicted 
                        killer of one. Suspected killer 
                        of...  

           Father Murphy eyes him. Looks away.  

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        ...quite a few. Now it appears I 
                        have just several hours remaining 
                        upon this earth, in which to tell 
                        my story. My true story. Which you 
                        may have gathered is a tragedy. I 
                        should add that the good clergyman 
                        Peter J. Murphy has agreed to bear 
                        witness to my narrative -- thank 
                        you, Father -- so with the Lord as 
                        my witness, let’s go.  
           EXT. FRONT GATE OF THE ROTHCHILD FAMILY ESTATE - DAY - 1982 

           The gate rises, revealing a MANSION atop a long driveway. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        You’d think this all begins with 
                        me. But I suppose like any story 
                        worth telling, it begins with a 
                        girl. 

           INT. / EXT. RAPID SERIES OF SCENES

           -A TEENAGE GIRL pulls back an archery bow. She is MARY 
           ROTHCHILD.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        My mother. The youngest daughter of 
                        the Rothchild family.

           -Mary eats lobster at a long dinner table alongside elegant 
           house guests.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        An heiress to the fourth largest 
                        industrial fortune in the world. 

           -She sits in the local multiplex watching a movie with her 
           brothers and sisters. All older, some with children.    

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And a human being like any other. 
                        Living, breathing, laughing. 

           -She waterskis. Beautifully happy. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Now, there’s a rumor that money 
                        doesn’t buy happiness. 

           INT. JAIL CELL - SAME AS BEFORE

                                 BECKET
                        Dead wrong. Money does buy 
                        happiness. We’re all adults here, 
                        let’s move on, yes?

           EXT. PARTY - ROTHCHILD ESTATE - NIGHT 

           The rich and elite mingle together. Mary chats among them. 
                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Now I’ll tell you as I was told 
                        myself. It was July fourth. Our 
                        good nation’s birthday. 

           In mid-conversation, Mary spots someone across the party: the 
           shaggy BASS PLAYER in the smooth-jazz band.

           INT. MANSION - THE NEXT MORNING 

           A MAID waddles up a winding staircase. To a door. She knocks. 

                                 MAID 
                        Mary? You’re missing brunch. 

           She peeks inside. The room is empty. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - THAT MOMENT

           A Dodge Pinto sits parked. 

           INT. DODGE - THAT MOMENT 

           Mary sleeps in the Bass Player’s arms. Suddenly she wakes up. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh no. 

           She sits up. Squints in the sunlight. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh no no no no. 

                                 BASS PLAYER 
                        Is it the cops? 

                                 MARY
                             (laughing)
                        I gotta go, I gotta go.  

           She gathers her things in a rush, jumps from the car -  

                                 BASS PLAYER
                        Wait, your shoes. Here. 

           She grabs her shoes. Dashes off. But she comes back -- and 
           KISSES the Bass Player like a woman in love -   
           INT. MANSION - LATER 

           Mary creeps in through the laundry room. She smiles nervously 
           at the house staff as they fold laundry... 

           INT. MANSION - MARY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Mary does homework at her desk. Suddenly a radio-controlled 
           HELICOPTER whirs into the room through an open window. 

           It smacks into the ceiling fan and plummets to her bed. Mary 
           spots a NOTE tethered to the tail fin.  

           She unfolds the note, which reads: THE DOCK. 

           EXT. THE DOCK - MINUTES LATER 

           Mary prances down the dock. The Bass Player stands at the end 
           holding a big remote control. He collapses the antennae. 

           EXT. WATER = LATER 

           They drift in a canoe. 

                                 MARY
                        What kind of store? 

                                 BASS PLAYER
                        A music store. 

                                 MARY
                        Like records? 

                                 BASS PLAYER
                        No, instruments and electronics, 
                        and -- I got everything lined up, I 
                        can’t wait. I’ll give bass lessons 
                        to little kids, and...  
                             (then)
                        Come live with me. 

           He’s so genuine. Mary smiles. But she looks away. 

           INT. MANSION - MORNING 

           A white-haired BUTLER serves Mary eggs Benedict. She eats. 
           Suddenly she pauses.

                                 MARY
                        I think I’m lactose intolerant.
           A moment. And she PUKES -   

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER 

           She shakes a pregnancy test. Looks. Her eyes widen. 

           INT. MANSION - TROPHY ROOM 

           Mary sits alone in this cavernous room. Elk, Zebra, Rhino 
           heads watching from the wall. A fireplace roaring, crackling.

           Footsteps approach. 

           And a MAN sits across from her, his back to us. We can’t see 
           his face. But we can see his hand drumming the arm of his 
           armchair -- and good lord, he has only TWO FINGERS. 

                                 PATRIARCH
                        Mary. 

                                 MARY
                        Yes Sir? 

                                 PATRIARCH
                        Let’s get rid of it. 

           His voice black as oil. Mary tries not to cry. 

                                 PATRIARCH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, now. I suppose I sound 
                        unreasonable. But understand, all 
                        we have is our reputation. It’s the 
                        bedrock upon which I’ve built our 
                        empire -- brick by brick, stone by 
                        stone, for the world to see. I’ve 
                        done that for you, now, Mary. 
                             (then)
                        And for your brothers and sisters. 
                        Do you want them to suffer because 
                        of your poor judgement?

                                 MARY
                        No, Sir - 

                                 PATRIARCH
                        Well, then.  

                                 MARY
                        But don’t I...I dunno, don’t I have 
                        a choice in all this? 
                                 PATRIARCH
                        You’ve left yourself only two.  

           He holds up two fingers. His only two fingers, actually.  

                                 PATRIARCH (CONT’D)
                        Get rid of the bastard, and remain 
                        a part of this good and reputable 
                        family. 
                             (or)
                        Or be gone. For good. And you know 
                        I mean it, now, Mary. Man of my 
                        word. For good. 

           A moment. And she BURSTS into tears. 

           EXT. MANSION - FRONT DRIVEWAY 

           Mary bids goodbye to her family. The Butler helps her carry 
           suitcases down the fronts steps... 

           ...to the Bass Player and his Dodge Pinto. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And so it was, that my mother went 
                        from being Mary Rothchild of New 
                        Canaan, Connecticut... 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - NEWARK, NEW JERSEY 

           Mary decorates as the Bass Player assembles a baby crib.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...to being Mary Westburger of 
                        Newark-on-Passaic, New Jersey. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - MARCH, 1983

           Mary is in the throes of labor. The Bass Player watches, 
           overjoyed. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I was soon born unto the world. 

                                 DOCTOR 
                        It’s a healthy boy! 
                        Congratulations! 
                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Upon seeing me for the first time, 
                        my father, perhaps suffering from a 
                        lifetime absorbing low-frequency 
                        tones, expired from an undetected 
                        aneurism.  

           The Bass Player keels over and hits the floor. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES - DAY 

           Mary clocks in. She looks older.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        So it was. My good mother was left 
                        to toil at the Newark Department of 
                        Motor Vehicles for the remainder of 
                        her days. 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Mary pulls cream-of-lobster soup from the microwave. Places 
           the bowl in front of: 

           YOUNG BECKET. He’s not yet a scoundrel. Just a kid. Mary sits 
           and stares into nothing like a Vietnam veteran. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        As one might imagine, she began to 
                        miss her life of privilege.  

           INT. ROW HOUSE - LATER 

           Above the piano, Mary hangs a PAINTING of the Rothchild 
           Mansion. She lectures. Becket’s eyes widen, hypnotized.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        She was keen to remind me that 
                        although she was no longer a 
                        Rothchild, I most certainly was. 
                        The youngest Rothchild, in fact. 
                        Which gave me the strange 
                        distinction of being the one who 
                        might inherit the entire estate 
                        some day, provided I outlive the 
                        others.      

           She flips the painting, revealing an elaborate family tree on 
           the backside, complete with portraits of each member.  
                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I simply had to wait -- for all of 
                        them to die. And oh, how I felt 
                        destiny in my marrow...  

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - 1992

           We pass THIRD GRADERS, each dressed as a professional: 

                                 GIRL
                        I want to be a doctor. 

                                 BOY
                        I wanna be a cop. 

                                 GIRL
                        I want to be an artist.

                                 BECKET
                        I’m going to be rich. 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Becket and Mary shuffle inside. Becket gazes up at the 
           towering shelves of books. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Now, one might assume that a 
                        penniless upbringing makes for an 
                        uncultured young man. Especially in 
                        New Jersey. 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - READING ROOM - LATER

           Mary reads aloud from GREAT EXPECTATIONS. Becket listens.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        But friends, quite the contrary. 
                        Because the penniless son of Mary 
                        Rothchild had nothing but culture.

           INT. ROW HOUSE - DAY 

           Mary teaches him piano.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And art.  
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY 

           Becket orates on stage, dressed as Winston Churchill.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And language.

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 

           Becket slips into a trim sports coat. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Style.

           EXT. ARCHERY RANGE - DAY 

           Mary teaches Becket to shoot. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And sport. 

           Becket fires an arrow. It STRIKES the target, a bit off-
           center. He steadies a new arrow, aims... 

           But before he can shoot, another arrow STRIKES bull's-eye.

           Becket looks and sees a BLONDE GIRL HIS AGE admiring her 
           perfect shot. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Which brings me to this lovely 
                        juncture in our story. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER 

           Mary and the Girl’s MOTHER chat politely. 

           Becket and the Young Girl peek at each other from behind 
           their respective moms. She has confidence, this one.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Julia. 

           EXT. BACK YARD - LATER 

           A birthday party for Julia. She unwraps one sparkling, 
           expensive gift after the next. 

           She gets to Becket’s. Unwraps it. Finds a plate of cookies. 
           There’s murmuring and laughter from the kids and parents. 
           Becket sinks down, tries to hide. Julia eyes him curiously 
           through the crowd, takes a bite from a cookie. 

           EXT. BACK YARD - LATER 

           They walk to a swing set. 

                                 JULIA 
                        Why do you talk like that? 

                                 BECKET 
                        Like what exactly. 

                                 JULIA
                        Like that. 

                                 BECKET
                        Are you going to make fun of me 
                        like everyone else?    

                                 JULIA
                        No.

                                 BECKET
                        Thank you.
                             (then)
                        I’m going to be rich, you know. I’m 
                        going to inherit a fortune someday. 

           She looks at him. Sizing him up.  

                                 JULIA
                        Will you buy me a big house with 
                        all your money?

                                 BECKET
                        Okay. 

                                 JULIA
                        Think you can push me in that 
                        swing? 
                             (jumps in a swing)
                        C’mon gimme a push, let’s go.  

           Becket pushes her. Watches her swing through the air in slow 
           motion, her ponytail eclipsing the sun. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Strange how many emotions a child 
                        discovers at once. How many did I 
                        find that day? One, love. 
           EXT. BACK YARD - LATER 

           Julia chats with a well-manicured YOUNG BOY with wavy hair. 
           He looks like a miniature politician. She holds his hand. 
           Becket watches from afar.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Two, jealousy. 

           INT. CAR - LATER 

           We pull away from Julia’s house -- and from Julia, who waves 
           on the front steps. Smiling in cool confidence.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And three, I’m unsure what to call 
                        it. I think there might be a word 
                        in Portuguese. 

           INT. RECITAL HALL - NIGHT 

           Becket plays piano for a small crowd. He spots Julia. 

           LATER 

           He shuffles into the audience and sits beside her. 

                                 BECKET 
                             (whispering)
                        I think I played it too fast. 

                                 JULIA
                        Better than too slow. 

                                 BECKET
                        Thank you - 

                                 PIANO TEACHER 
                        Next we have Lyle Archdale.

           LYLE sits at the piano. The kid from before, the miniature 
           politician. He rips into Claude Debussy’s CLAIRE DE LUNE.

           Suddenly the power cuts off. The whole room goes black. 

                                 PIANO TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay everyone. Keep playing! 

           Lyle continues playing in the dark. Becket feels something -- 
           Julia’s hand. She holds his hand. 
           And she KISSES HIM. Claire de Lune in the background. Becket 
           is in heaven. 

           Suddenly The LIGHTS GO BACK UP. The kiss is over. Lyle 
           finishes the piece -- and Julia stands up and applauds like 
           nothing happened. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Isn’t there an expression? A proper 
                        secret never sees light, or 
                        something along those lines?  

           The applause carries into the

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           where Becket, now eighteen and very much a grown adult, gazes 
           off into space. Remembering. 

           SUBTITLE: Nine years hence. 

           A DOCTOR shuffles up, removes his mask. Looks at Becket.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER  

           Mary lies in bed. Dying. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Well. Some secrets you can’t keep 
                        in the dark so neatly.  

           Becket sits on the edge of her bed. Holds her hand.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        The doctors had a fancy name for 
                        her illness. But I tell you this: 
                        My dear mother had a broken heart.  

           INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE - LATER 

           A DOCTOR lectures Becket. We hear words like HMO, coverage.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Now, it’s a terrible thing, to be 
                        poor and sick. We had but one 
                        option.   
           EXT. FRONT GATE - ROTHCHILD ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Ask for help. 

           The front gate is open. The Mansion looming atop the drive. 

           Suddenly a BUS pulls up, breathes air. Pulls away, revealing 
           Becket and Mary. She’s in a wheelchair. 

           He pushes her to a BUZZER. She presses it. And pretty soon 
           someone hobbles from up the drive: the Butler.   

           He slows. Gazes at Mary. Presses a button... and the gate 
           LOWERS gradually. Shutting them out. He hobbles off.

           A moment. And Mary pulls out a pair of shears, slices off a 
           lock of her hair. Hands it to Becket. 

           And she cries. Becket’s face going hot. A new look washing 
           over him.  

           EXT. PUBLIC CEMETERY - NEWARK, NEW JERSEY 

           Funeral. Barely anyone in attendance. He watches her pine box 
           being lowered into the dirt. Rubs her lock of hair like a 
           rabbit’s foot...  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        My friends. It was at this juncture 
                        that I began to develop something 
                        of a distaste for my relatives. 

           He looks up and sees Julia and Lyle in attendance. She’s 
           grown into an unfairly beautiful woman, unattainable to all.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        So it was, that I inherited my 
                        mother’s personal fortune of three 
                        thousand dollars -- and her unpaid 
                        medical balance of one hundred and 
                        fifty thousand dollars. Luckily I 
                        stumbled upon a government program 
                        designed for young men without a 
                        ways or means to pay for their 
                        educations.

           EXT. IRAQ - DAY 

           Oil fields burn in the distance. Suddenly two Humvees ROAR 
           into view, racing toward the fires.   
           SUBTITLE: Khafji, Iraq, February 4, 2003. 

           INT. HUMVEE - THAT MOMENT 

           Private First Class Becket Rothchild rides shotgun. Everyone 
           YELLS over the rumble:

                                 MASTER SERGEANT
                             (at the wheel)
                        Big ass oil derrick, northwest 
                        corridor! That’s our destination! 

                                 BECKET 
                             (passenger seat)
                        I suggest we make a slight left in 
                        two hundred meters! 

                                 MASTER SERGEANT 
                        Rothchild what the fuck, just say 
                        left! 

                                 SPECIALIST 
                             (backseat)
                        This is shit, man! I know where 
                        we’re going! Saddam rigged it!

                                 MASTER SERGEANT
                        Shut up!

                                 BECKET 
                        Left in one one-hundred fifty 
                        meters!

           Suddenly: a DIRTY MERCEDES wheels up alongside them. Looks 
           like trouble. 

                                 MASTER SERGEANT
                        Who’s this asshole?

           A FIGHTER rises from the sunroof with an RPG. He FIRES -- 
           KAMOOM! The Humvee in front of them EXPLODES -       

                                                     MASTER SERGEANT
                    SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
           Aaaaa holy shit! Go back!
                                              Negative! Negative! 

           They swerve around the flaming wreckage.  

                                 MASTER SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                             (into radio)
                        Infantry column under fire! I got 
                        eyes on an RPG, copy! Rothchild 
                        where the fuck do we go?!
                                 BECKET 
                             (looking at map)
                        Northwest, Master Sergeant!

           They ACCELERATE across the oil fields, through plumes of 
           solid black smoke. Becket looks back -- and sees the Mercedes 
           burst through the haze behind them. A desert car chase. 

                                 MASTER SERGEANT
                        Specialist, get on that fifty! Now!

                                 SPECIALIST
                             (climbing up)
                        I just wanted to travel, man! 

           EXT. ATOP THE HUMVEE 

           The Specialist mans the fifty caliber machine gun. SHOOOOOM -- 
           An RPG zings past his helmet. 

                                 SPECIALIST
                             (firing)
                        AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  

           He lights up the Mercedes. Pops tires, shatters glass. Oh 
           shit -- a SECOND MERCEDES bursts into view -    

           INT. HUMVEE - THAT MOMENT 

           The second Mercedes zooms up alongside them. Fighters lean 
           from the windows with AK-47s. 

                      MASTER SERGEANT
           Un - be - fucking - lievable!
                                                         BECKET 
                                              That’s unfortunate!

           The Master Sergeant whips out his handgun, fires at the car.  

                                 MASTER SERGEANT
                        Are we close or what?!

                                 BECKET 
                        That’s it right there, Master 
                        Sergeant! 

           Becket points to their destination: a MASSIVE OIL DERRICK a 
           few hundred meters in the distance - 

           POP! The Master Sergeant just got shot in the head. He slumps 
           forward -- just as the Specialist tumbles down, SHOT UP. 

                                 SPECIALIST
                        I’m gone, man - 
                                 BECKET 
                        Hold on please, Specialist!

           Becket ducks down and steers from the passenger seat. 

           EXT. OIL DERRICK - THAT MOMENT 

           The Humvee and Mercedes race toward us like a mirage. 
           Suddenly we BOOM DOWN to reveal: A LAND MINE.  

           INT. HUMVEE - THAT MOMENT 

                                 SPECIALIST 
                        We gotta stop this shit -  

                                 BECKET 
                        It appears his weight is on the 
                        accelerator - 

                                 SPECIALIST
                        We’re heading for a minefield, the 
                        place is rigged I’m telling you - 

           The speedometer reads 80 MPH. They rocket past the Mercedes.   

                                 BECKET
                        Again, hold on please Specialist! 

           Becket shoves the Master Sergeant from the door. Climbs into 
           the drivers seat. 

           And SLAMS on the brakes. SKIDS to a curving stop in front of 
           the derrick. Sand kicking through the air. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                             (into radio)
                        Checkpoint.

           EXT. OIL DERRICK - SAME 

           Becket kicks open the door. Throws a FLAIR onto the sand. 
           Florescent pink smoke billows into the desert wind.  

           He drags his bleeding comrade from the Humvee. Suddenly he 
           sees the Mercedes zooming up, closer every second.    

           He pulls his handgun in desperation. Fires single shots:

           POP! The Mercedes draws closer. 

           POP! 
           Closer. 

           POP! 

           KABOOM! The car hits a land mine. It tumbles end-over-end 
           before SLIDING to a halt just inches from his feet. 

           The dust settles. Becket exhales. All things quiet. Suddenly 
           the CHUG CHUG CHUG of rotors. Becket looks up. 

           And a HELICOPTER emerges from the pink smoke overhead like a 
           hallucination. And there, written on the side in bold white 
           lettering, is this: ROTHCHILD. 

           Becket stares. 

           The helicopter lands. MERCENARIES jump out, followed by a MAN 
           IN A SUIT who has no earthly business in a war zone.

           Becket staggers to his feet, broken glass falling from his 
           face. He limps toward the Man In A Suit. Stops.  

           They look at each other. A few Mercenaries gather around, 
           detecting tension. 

                                 MAN IN SUIT
                        Thank you, soldier. 

                                 BECKET 
                        For what, sir?

                                 MAN IN SUIT
                        Securing the road to our new 
                        property. 

           Becket’s face goes hot. Something repressed boiling over. He 
           removes a glove from his hand. And GLOVE SLAPS the Man. 

           The Mercenaries break into confused laughter. Becket looks 
           around, humiliated. Then without warning: 

           He pulls his gun and SHOOTS the Man in the foot. A moment of 
           utter disbelief all around... 

                                 MAN IN SUIT (CONT’D)
                        aaaaaAAAAAAAA WHAT THE FUCK! 

           The Mercenaries break into action and chase Becket...  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Now don’t get me wrong. My first 
                        act of unprovoked violence against 
                        the Rothchild family did give me a 
                        thrill. But oh, at such cost. 
           INT. COURTROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER 

           The Man sits at the prosecution table. His foot in a cast. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Because the victim I chose was the 
                        CFO of foreign operations. 

           Becket stands at attention as the court martial hands down a 
           sentence. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        There I was. Convicted of a federal 
                        offense. No chance for an 
                        education, an insurmountable debt, 
                        and an unforgivable haircut. 

           The gavel comes down. We hear a SLAM -- but it’s a 

           INT. JAIL CELL

           where Becket just got slammed behind bars. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And so it was, that I would serve 
                        my time, and settle into a life of 
                        thankless labor. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. THE GAP - LOWER MANHATTAN - TWO YEARS LATER

           SLAM. Becket lifts the security gate. Unlocks the entrance.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Albeit with Dignity. 

           INT. THE GAP - LATER 

           He works at the Gap. Folding khakis. Place empty. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Always dignity.  

           INT. TRAIN - LATE NIGHT

           He rides home, flanked by slumbering homeless people. Rain 
           pouring outside.  
           INT. ROW HOUSE - NEWARK - NIGHT 

           Dingier than last time. Water drips from the ceiling into a 
           strategically placed pot on the floor.  

           Becket steps inside, slumps in an armchair. Looks at the 
           dusty painting above the piano -- the MANSION.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I began to keep track of their 
                        fates, and my future wealth. 

           He unfolds a newspaper. Reads the obituaries.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Some days, the paper brought good 
                        news. 

           Becket stands, flips the painting -- and crosses a name from 
           the family tree. One down. Albeit an unimportant one.  

           INT. ROW HOUSE - MONTHS LATER 

           Even dingier. More water drips into more pots. Becket steps 
           through the front door, opens a newspaper. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        But most days, the paper brought no 
                        news at all. And I could only wait. 
                        And wait. 

           INT. THE GAP - DAY 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And then came Monday. 

           Becket is busy folding polo shirts when he spots a GIRL 
           across the store, perusing scarves. And not just any girl.  

           Julia. Becket freezes. Turns his back and hides. But: 

                                 BECKET
                        No. 

           He turns around and stands tall with pride. Julia sees him. 
           After a moment of disbelief, she strolls over.

                                 JULIA
                        Really? 

                                 BECKET
                        It appears so. 
           An awkward silence. 

                                 JULIA
                        What’s the headset for? I always 
                        wondered about that. 

                                 BECKET
                        A secret device, actually. I can 
                        hear people’s thoughts. 

                                 JULIA 
                        Oh yeah? What’s she thinking? 

           Julia points to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN holding up a striped 
           blouse to her body.  

                                 BECKET
                        She’s realizing that horizontal 
                        stripes emphasize width.   

                                 JULIA
                        What about him? 

           She points to a mannequin. Wait, that’s a person. Hovering 
           near the register, perfectly still. Clearly up to something.   

                                 BECKET
                        That’s my manager, Darryl, and I 
                        can assure you he is incapable of 
                        abstract thought.  

                                 JULIA
                        And what about me.

           Becket shifts around, straightens his outfit.

                                 BECKET
                        Uh, to be honest I rather not say 
                        aloud - 

           She laughs.  

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        Ah, good. I’ve still got it.
                             (gathering himself)
                        I haven’t seen you in ages. We 
                        should, um. Catch up. Properly. 

           She smiles. But looks away. And it’s now that Becket notices 
           the giant, disgusting RING on her finger - 

                                 JULIA 
                        Oh that sounds great but the timing 
                        is sort of, y’know - 
                                 BECKET 
                        Sure sure sure -  

                                 JULIA
                        But it’s nice seeing you. I’m glad 
                        you’re still...like this. 

                                 BECKET
                        Like what. 

                                 JULIA
                        Like you. 

           Becket stands there holding polo shirts. Julia leaves. 

           But she stops. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Hey I thought you were gonna 
                        inherit the, uh. “Rothchild Family 
                        Fortune.” 

                                 BECKET
                        Someday. I just have to wait.  

           She smiles. That icy, confident smile.  

                                 JULIA
                        Well. Call me when you’ve killed 
                        them all. 

           A joke. But one look at Becket, and you can tell he is struck 
           by the idea. Julia glides outside...

           ...where she joins LYLE, who sits on a silver moped.  She 
           whispers in his ear. Lyle spies into the Gap, sees Becket...

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I was taken by a realization. There 
                        are two breeds of people in this 
                        life.

           Lyle and Julia MOTOR away. Becket peers across the store. At 
           the miserable employees toiling away like cattle. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Those who play by the rules and 
                        work hard...

           He notices something -- DARRYL (The Manager) discreetly 
           sliding cash from the register. Stuffing it in his khakis.  
                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...and those who seem to know 
                        better.   

           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 

           Becket rides home. Crack heads babble on either side of him.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I had chosen to work, and wait for 
                        my fortune to arrive. And here I 
                        was. Still a peasant. 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - NIGHT 

           The place sounds like a fountain from all the leaks. Becket 
           Slumps in the armchair, picks up the obituaries.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Good God, what had I expected?

           He drops the newspaper in the trash can. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Great wealth has never been awarded 
                        to those who work an honest living. 
                        No, wealth is taken by bloody 
                        force.  

           He pulls something from his pocket: his mother’s LOCK OF 
           HAIR. His face suddenly hot. Eyes watering. That old feeling 
           boiling over. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And for the sake of my mother.    

           Becket’s gaze shifts to the painting across the room. He 
           grabs his old ARCHERY BOW, aims...

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I would damn well take it. 

           He FIRES an arrow. 

           And, in a movie full of pianos and harpsichords, bloodthirsty 
           HEAVY METAL rips to life as 

           OPENING TITLES APPEAR. 

           We follow the arrow as it RIPS through the painting. RIPS 
           through the wall behind it. And BLASTS like a missile down 
           the street and:
           -through a living room, SHATTERING wine glasses on a mantle. 

           -through a luxury car, EXPLODING through the windows.  

           -through a opulent bedroom, GRAZING a couple having sex. 

           -through bank, BURSTING through a stack of hundreds. 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - BACK TO SCENE

           The music cuts. The arrow sticks from the painting, where it 
           really lodged.

           Becket lowers the bow. Looks at it like a foreign object. 
           What did he just commit to? 

           LATER

           He yanks the arrow from the painting, flips it. Examines the 
           family tree on the backside. Rain drumming the roof. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        There were nine Rothchilds 
                        remaining. From youngest to eldest, 
                        they were as follows:    

           CLOSE on each portrait:  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Cousin Taylor. 
                             (frat boy)
                        Cousin Noah.   
                             (hipster)
                        Uncle Steven.  
                             (Minister) 
                        Twins Beverly and Blair.
                             (reality TV-stars)
                        Aunt Cassandra.
                             (trash)
                        Uncle Warren
                             (business man)
                        Great Uncle McArthur.     
                             (Military)
                        And my grandfather. The great old 
                        patriarch. Whitelaw. 

           Shadow obscures Whitelaw’s face. His mangled hand hidden 
           between the buttons of his shirt like Napoleon. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Them gone, I’d inherit seventeen 
                        billion dollars. Doing off with 
                        them would be a tough nut to crack. 
           Suddenly a BIG CHUNK of the ceiling falls and BREAKS into a 
           dozen wet pieces across the floor. Becket stares. Gazes up at 
           his dingy, piss pathetic surroundings.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        But crack it I would try.  

           EXT. WALL STREET - GOLDMAN SACHS - DAY 

           Closing time. Men in fancy suits pour through the revolving 
           doors. Bringing up the rear is TAYLOR ROTHCHILD (20s).  

           Built like a swimmer. Wind-blown hair. Taylor jabbers with 
           his buddies as he passes: 

           BECKET, who just happens to be reading a Russian-language 
           newspaper nearby. He wears sunglasses and smokes.   

           Becket lowers the newspaper. 

           EXT. STREET CORNER - LATER 

           Taylor climbs in a limousine. SWISH PAN TO: Becket, who 
           catches a cab right behind him. 

           INT. BECKET’S CAB - DRIVING 

           He rides. Expressionless behind those sunglasses. 

           INT. TAYLOR’S LIMO - DRIVING 

           Taylor barks on the phone, nursing a beer.

                                 TAYLOR 
                        How much time could you possibly 
                        need to get ready? 
                             (then)
                        Well I’m almost there, I’m -   
                             (then)
                        Are you talking to me or your 
                        dumbass friends? 

           INT. BECKET’S CAB

           Becket sees the limo park in front of an apartment. 

                                 BECKET 
                             (to Driver)
                        Stop right here.
           He watches a PRETTY GIRL sashay to Taylor’s limo and open the 
           door. But instead of getting inside she just YELLS at him... 

           ...and SLAMS the door. Taylor leans from the window and hurls 
           the beer bottle at her feet. It SHATTERS.  

                                 PRETTY GIRL 
                        Oh my God! OH MY GOD! You are an 
                        ANIMAL! 

           EXT. BRO BAR - 84TH AND LEXINGTON - NIGHT 

           The limo pulls up. Taylor stumbles out. He pushes his way 
           into the bar...

           A cab pulls up not a second later. And Becket climbs out 
           casually. Flicks his cigarette. 

           INT. BRO BAR - MOMENTS LATER 

           Becket sits at the bar, incognito. He watches: 

           Taylor commiserate with his buddies. We hear snippets of 
           their conversation: 

                                 TAYLOR 
                        I called her a butterface. 

                                 FRIEND
                        That’s cold, man. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Maybe so. But I mean -- I told her, 
                        I said honey, your face is on my 
                        cock so much I forgot what it looks 
                        like anyway HAHAHAHAHAHA!

           They all laugh together.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                             (pulling out his wallet)
                        Goddamn, I got a picture of the 
                        back of the chick’s head in my 
                        wallet bro HAHAHAHAHA!

           INT. BRO BAR - LATER 

           Taylor sings karaoke, piss drunk. He belts out Ants Marching 
           by the Dave Matthews Band.   
                                 TAYLOR
                        WE ALL DO IT THE SAAAAAAAME! WE ALL 
                        DO IT THE SAAAAAAAAAME WAAAAAAAAYY 
                        BUM! BUM BUM BUM!

           Becket watches.

           EXT. BRO BAR - END OF THE NIGHT 

           Taylor stumbles out of the bar. His buddies take off. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Fuck you assholes! Get a room! 

                                 FRIEND
                        See you tomorrow man - 

                                 TAYLOR
                        I’ll see your mom tomorrow! 

           Taylor staggers down the sidewalk. Finds himself alone under 
           the streetlights. He straightens up, rubs his eyes. 

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’...hang on. 

           He stuffs a cigarette in his mouth. Searches his coat for a 
           lighter. No luck. Suddenly he spots a shadowy FIGURE.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Lookin’ shifty as hell, man.  
                             (then)
                        Shit. Yo homeboy, you got a 
                        lighter?

           Becket steps into the light. Strikes a match. 

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Matches! Matches, priceless.  

           Becket lights the cigarette. And suddenly -- his HAND 
           trembles. 

           Taylor notices. He looks at Becket. Becket looks back. A 
           long, odd, quiet moment. 

           And Taylor raises his eyebrows like check out this fuckin’ 
           weirdo. He steps away, hails a cab. 

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        That was intense. See you...never 
                        again.  
           He SLAMS the door and the cab pulls away. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        There’s a learning curve to 
                        everything. And it appeared murder 
                        would be no different. 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - LATER 

           Becket steps through the front door and removes an ANTIQUE 
           PISTOL from his coat pocket. Places it on the mantle.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Yes, your humble narrator was 
                        filled with fear and apprehension. 
                        Because let’s get down to brass 
                        tacks: what the devil was I doing. 

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER 

           He buttons up his pajamas. Lies in bed.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Even if I did it -- by God -- would 
                        I collapse in regret? Turn myself 
                        in? 

           INT. THE GAP - THE NEXT DAY 

           Becket hunches over, folds khakis. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I needed a push over the edge. A 
                        kick in the britches.  

           Suddenly he FREEZES. Because Darryl is standing inches away. 
           Perfectly still like an assassin. Becket peers up.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        It would soon arrive with force. 

           INT. THE GAP - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 

                                 DARRYL
                        You’re fired. For stealing cash out 
                        of the downstairs register. Over 
                        the course of several weeks. 
                        Discreetly.  
           They sit across from each other. Darryl looks even more like 
           an android up close, eyes dead like a shark.  

                                 BECKET
                        Darryl you’re mistaken. I think you 
                        know who’s the thief. 

                                 DARRYL
                        It wasn’t me. 

                                 BECKET
                        It certainly was.     

                                 DARRYL
                        No it wasn’t -    

                                 BECKET
                        And now you’re pegging this on me 
                        because you have to hold someone 
                        accountable, and I have a criminal 
                        record, am I correct?

           Darryl expressionless. And:

                                 DARRYL
                        You’re fired. For stealing cash out 
                        of the downstairs -   

                                 BECKET
                        Oh GOD’S sake - 

           INT. THE GAP - MOMENTS LATER 

           Becket marches past happy customers. WHIPS off his headset.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Friends, I tell you this: there is 
                        nothing more invigorating than the 
                        moment you find yourself with 
                        nothing to lose. 

           He passes the register. And STOPS. Has an idea. 

           EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN - MOMENTS LATER 

           Among the masses, Becket walks with steam. Gaining momentum. 
           He’s counting a thick WAD OF CASH. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        The air is crisp. The sunshine 
                        sweet. 
           He stops and takes in a sight: WALL STREET.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And the possibilities limitless. I 
                        was a new Becket.  

           INT. CLOTHING STORE - LATER 

           He makes his way past isles of button-downs and slacks. To a 
           STYLISH MALE EMPLOYEE holding an espresso. 

                                 BECKET
                        Hi. 

           EXT. 5TH AVENUE - LATER 

           Becket strides down the sidewalk, wearing a brand new linen 
           suit and Kashmir scarf.  

           Suddenly he spots something in a store window: a SILVER 
           MOPED. Just like Lyle’s.

           EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY 

           He ROCKETS through the countryside on his new moped. 
           Apparently he sprang for the helmet / goggles / gloves combo.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Now bear in mind that to penetrate 
                        the world of the rich, I would need 
                        to appear rich myself. It was an 
                        anthropological study, if you will. 
                        And I would go all the way --- up 
                        the river, into the tribe, into 
                        that great heart of darkness. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - UPSTATE NEW YORK - AFTERNOON 

           Becket skids to a stop. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I had but one last item on my list.

           He removes his goggles and looks up -- at an immense SPORTING 
           GOODS STORE. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And it would be a doozy. 
           INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - MOMENTS LATER 

           A MAN moseys down the isle. It takes us a moment to realize 
           it’s Becket. In disguise. Wearing glasses and a cabbie hat.

           He grabs an aluminum baseball bat. Tests the feel.  

                                 OLD EMPLOYEE 
                        Can I help you out with something? 

           His name tag reads HARVEY. 

                                 BECKET 
                        Oh. Yes, I’m looking for...
                             (puts down the bat)
                        ...hunting supplies. 

                                 HARVEY
                        What are you hunting? 

                                 BECKET
                        Rich people.

                                 HARVEY
                        Rich p -
                             (chuckles)
                        Well, can’t blame you there. 

           INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - GUN COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

           He hands Becket a rifle with a scope. A ruthless thing.  

                                 HARVEY
                        Browning K-Seventeen. It’ll drop a 
                        buck from, oh, mile- and-a-half.

                                 BECKET
                        Right, do you perhaps have 
                        something a bit less, uh. Severe?

           Harvey unhooks a small rifle from the rack, hands it over.

                                 HARVEY
                        Classic Remington twenty-two. Easy 
                        to load, easy to clean... 

           But Becket spots something atop the highest shelf: A BOW. And 
           not a clunky old heap like the one he has. But a sleek, 
           supple, sinuous piece of coiled tension. Harvey notices. 
                                 HARVEY (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        ‘Course, a better man than myself 
                        once said that a true sportsman? 
                        Well. He hunts with a bow. 

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET

           Becket rides. Scarf flapping. And on his back: The BOW. He 
           looks like Michael Caine in Alfie, if Alfie went postal. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Was I happy? Perhaps happiness is 
                        the wrong term. What I felt was a 
                        rush of blood, a tingling in my 
                        extremities. Only one thing was 
                        certain... 

           He passes a sign: WELCOME TO EAST HAMPTON. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...I had work to do.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           TAYLOR ROTHCHILD LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY IN EXTREME CLOSE UP.  

           He wears sunglasses and a radio headset. Because he’s 
           piloting a 

           INT. PRIVATE HELICOPTER - DAY 

           somewhere over Long Island Sound. He sits next to his buddy, 
           Brett. Both guys laughing their faces off. 

                                 BRETT
                        I can’t believe...you have...a 
                        fucking helicopter bro! 

                                 TAYLOR
                        I know! It’s so...ridiculous...holy 
                        shit.
                             (flipping switches)
                        Alright, let’s get this party 
                        started. 

           EXT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT 

           A powerful set of SPEAKERS have been rigged on either side of 
           the chopper. 
           Suddenly -- MUSIC plays. And even for those unfamiliar with 
           classical music or Apocalypse Now, it sounds familiar:

           WAGNER’S RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES. 

           INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT 

                                 BRETT
                        Is that music?  

                                 TAYLOR
                        I like to play Wagner. Scares the 
                        natives, you’re gonna love it. 
                        Alpha alpha zulu... 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - THAT MOMENT 

           Mexican migrant workers labor quietly. Suddenly they look up 
           and hear -- as if emanating from the Gods -- WAGNER. 

           EXT. OCEAN - THAT MOMENT 

           The helicopter ROARS toward us, just feet above the 
           whitecaps. Wagner BOOMING impossibly loud. 

           INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT 

           Taylor yells over the din of rotors and classical music:

                                 TAYLOR 
                        Here we go! These bastards wanna 
                        build a bigger beach house than 
                        mine? Oh hell no! Let’m have it!

           They ROCKET over the beach, over the treetops, right over the 
           Workers. Wagner BLASTING across the countryside.

           Brett grabs a BOX OF CHAMPAIGN BOTTLES, THROWS them down at 
           the Workers one by one - 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME

           The first bottle EXPLODES across a stack of cement blocks. 
           Another SHATTERS onto pickup truck. Workers SCREAM, RUN.  
           INT. HELICOPTER - SAME

                                 BRETT
                        RUN, CHARLIE! 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 

           Workers SPRINT for cover -- but a rain of EXPLODING CHAMPAIGN 
           BOTTLES sends them tumbling into a swimming pool -  

           INT. HELICOPTER - SAME

                                 TAYLOR
                        I love the smell of Champaign in 
                        the morning. Alright, let’s light 
                        up this shit hole and go party.  

           Brett lights a FIREWORK with his cigar... 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Fireworks BLAST into the site, leaving tracers of smoke in 
           the air. A FIRE breaks out. Paint cans EXPLODE -  

           EXT. BACK LAWN - ROTHCHILD SUMMER HOME - THAT MOMENT

           A party. Girls in the pool. Guys wearing Ray-Bans and 
           loafers. Prince Harry might be there, just a guess. 

           Then -- faintly -- the sound of WAGNER in the distance. 
           Everyone stops, looks around...  

           ...and the helicopter THUNDERS past the house. Wagner 
           BOOMING. Everyone watches in shock and awe.  

           The old Butler pulls a cord -- inflating a CRASH PAD. The 
           thing stunt men fall into when they jump off a building. 

           INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

           Brett takes the controls. Hovers the chopper over the party.

           Taylor steps to the door and raises his arms like Jesus. 
           Wagner BLASTING. Party going insane down below. 

           He releases a huge wad of CASH into the air. Everyone GASPS 
           as the dollar bills flutter down... 

           ...and he LEAPS from the helicopter and lands 
           EXT. ON THE CRASHPAD - CONTINUOUS

           just in time to bathe in a RAIN OF HIS OWN MONEY. It showers 
           him like the rose petals in American Beauty.

           Taylor eases to his feet, covered in hundreds. A cigar in his 
           mouth. Two BEAUTIFUL GIRLS greet him.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Who wants to take an Ambien and 
                        drive a hovercraft?   

           EXT. STREET - EAST HAMPTON - DAY

           Empty. Suddenly we hear a distant BUZZING. Like a go-kart. 

           It’s a moped. Becket appears on the horizon.  

           CLOSER 

           He rides. An anxious look in his eye. 

           He passes a parked Ferrari. And a Lotus. Pretty soon he’s 
           navigating through a maze of fancy cars - 

           EXT. ROTHCHILD FAMILY SUMMER HOME - MOMENTS LATER 

           He strolls toward the gate. Bow wrapped in a beach towel. Two 
           beefy GUARDS stand duty. One holds a VIP list on a clipboard.  

                                 GUARD
                        What’s the name. 

                                 BECKET
                        Rothchild.  

                                 GUARD
                             (dubious)
                        Uh huh. Got a first name?   

           Becket thinks. Too risky. He reaches into his breast pocket -    

                                 BECKET
                        Alright. Name your price, 
                        gentlemen.  

                                 GUARD
                        Five hundred bucks.   

           Becket pauses. 
                                 BECKET 
                        A cool twenty-five, how’s it suit 
                        you.     

           EXT. SUMMER HOME - SIDE YARD - MOMENTS LATER 

           The BOW is tossed over the fence. And Becket CLAMBERS into 
           view, covered in leaves and dirt. He TUMBLES into a bush - 

           INT. SUMMER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Becket steps through an open door - 

           A MIDGET in a bathing suit FLIES at him. Becket JUMPS aside -  

                                 FRAT BOY (O.S.)
                        MIDGET SLIP’N SLIDE! 

           He looks up -- and sees a bunch of FRAT BOYS throwing midgets 
           down a slip’n slide, indoors.    

           Becket glides through the party. Bodies everywhere. A girl in 
           a kiddie pool filled with Cristal. Someone revving a crotch 
           rocket in the kitchen.    

           He glances around for Taylor. Nothing. He toes to a window, 
           peers outside.  

           BECKET’S POV: throngs of people on the back lawn. The 
           helicopter resting on the grass. 

           And there’s Taylor. He brandishes a golf club. Reaches into 
           his khakis, pulls out a tee. Bends over, sets the tee - 

           - between the clenched teeth of the Midget in a Bathing Suit.   

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MOMENTS LATER 

           Becket jogs up the staircase. Pads down the hall. Cracks a 
           door. Sees the BUTLER dozing off in an armchair.  

                                 BECKET
                        Excuse me -  

           The Butler snaps awake -    

                                 BUTLER 
                        Can I help you, Sir. 
                                 BECKET
                        Just looking for a quiet room, 
                        actually.

           The Butler rises on creaky knees... 

                                 BUTLER 
                        I’ll leave you be, then.   

           He goes to leave. But pauses in the doorway. Peers at Becket. 

                                 BUTLER (CONT’D)
                        Have we met someplace?   

                                 BECKET
                        Perhaps in a previous life, my 
                        friend.

           The Butler mystified. He lumbers away. And Becket swings 

           INSIDE THE BEDROOM 

           and SHUTS the door. LOCKS it. UNFURLS the bow nervously. 
           Steps to the window, pulls back an arrow. Aims. 

           IN HIS SIGHTS: Taylor staggers through the crowd. Drunk.  
           Tough to shoot. Suddenly he moves into the open - 

           But a SHAPE bounces into view, blocks the shot. Becket pulls 
           away from the sight, sees a TOPLESS GIRL bouncing on a 
           trampoline. He aims again - 

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK on the door. 

                                 FRAT BOY (O.S.)
                        Yo! Hurry up in there!

           IN HIS SIGHTS: Taylor stumbles into the open again. Becket 
           takes a deep breath and SHOOTS -   

           EXT. BACK YARD - THAT MOMENT

           Taylor bends over to plant a golf tee. The arrow ZINGS over 
           his back. He stands up, oblivious.

           INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT 

           IN HIS SIGHTS: Becket searches for the arrow. He sees it -- 
           stuck into a clipboard. Which is held by - 

           One of the GUARDS. The guy squints at the arrow. Peers up 
           toward the window -  
           Becket DUCKS away. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 FRAT BOY (O.S.)
                        I’m gonna kick down this door! 

           Becket rises, peeks through the window. See the Guard 
           marching toward the house, muttering into his walkie-talkie.  

           Becket spots something else: Taylor getting away, loping 
           toward a BOATHOUSE.

           INT. HALL - SECONDS LATER 

           Becket plows past the FRAT BOY and his GIRLFRIEND. Carries 
           the bow, bundled in the beach towel.  

           Rounds a corner -- and sees BOTH GUARDS marching up the 
           stairs toward him. Becket wheels around.    

           Sees a PARTIER pass by. Snatches the Princeton baseball hat 
           from his head, slips it on, shuffles down the stairs... 

           ...right past the Guards. The first doesn’t look twice. But 
           the second STOPS. Squints at Becket shuffling away... 

           EXT. BACK LAWN - SECONDS LATER 

           Becket pushes through the crowd. Glances over his shoulder -  

           The GUARD is on his heels. Shoving aside Ivy League dandies, 
           two at a time.   

           Becket BREAKS THROUGH the party, follows Taylor as he 
           staggers into the boathouse...  

           INT. BOATHOUSE - THAT MOMENT  

           Brett revs a PRIVATE HOVERCRAFT in the shallow water. 

                                 BRETT
                        Sharper Image Catalogue what 
                        whaaaaat. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Let’s do this.    

           Taylor climbs aboard. The hovercraft WHIRS to life, BLOWS 
           into the open water...

           ...just as Becket dashes into the building. Too late. But he 
           spots a JET-SKI bobbing in the water nearby -   
           The GUARD plows through the door, a few steps behind. Becket 
           LEAPS on the Jet-ski, FIRES the engine -    

           The Guard splashes into the shallow water, lunges for him 
           just as Becket hits the gas and ROCKETS onto the

           EXT. OPEN WATER - CONTINUOUS

           full throttle. Wind and salt in the air.   

           Becket follows the hovercraft. Loses sight of it around a 
           CONTAINER SHIP... 

           ...he weaves around the massive vessel... 

           ...and sees the hovercraft sputter to a halt a short distance 
           ahead. Becket slows. 

           Sees Brett puke into the ocean. Taylor yells at him, throws a 
           beer bottle. Their voices echoing across the water.    

           Becket unfurls the bow from the towel. Hands shaking. This is 
           it. This is his chance. There are no witnesses -    

           SPLASH. He just dropped the bow. Into the ocean. It sinks. 
           Becket stares in disbelief. 

                                 TAYLOR
                             (in the distance)
                        Hey! Hey bro! C’mere!

           MOMENTS LATER 

           Becket motors alongside the hovercraft. A panicked look on 
           his face. He has no plan. He awkwardly climbs 

           ABOARD THE VESSEL

           and sees Taylor on his back, mumbling nonsense. Brett face-
           down on the deck, out cold.    

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Retard put regular unleaded in my 
                        hoverboat...hoverboats take diesel, 
                        retard! Hey bro go to the house, 
                        call Baywatch.   

           Becket glances around for an idea. Something. Anything. He 
           spots an anchor.  

                                 BECKET
                        Just allow me to drop anchor, will 
                        you? So you don’t drift astray.
                                 TAYLOR
                        Whatever...just hurry up...

           Becket circles the chain around Taylor’s foot. DROPS anchor 
           into the ocean. The long chain WHIZZES over the gunwale...

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Pour me some...champaign, bro... 

           Becket pours a glass of champaign. Taylor sits up, rubs his 
           eyes. Looks Becket square in the face. Recognizes him.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Wait. You. Who are you?

                                 BECKET 
                        I’m Becket. 

           SNAP. Taylor is SUCKED overboard and SPLASH. Gone instantly.  

           Becket sits there. Holding champagne.  

           He toes to the gunwale, peeks over. Nothing. Just water. He 
           glances at Brett. Guy is dead to the world. 

           Becket climbs aboard the jet-ski. FIRES the engine. And it’s 
           only now he looks down at his HAND:   

           It’s trembling again. Becket breathes. Eases on the gas... 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Was that it? Was it that easy? 

           LATER 

           He ROCKETS across the water. Sun setting, the world peaceful.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Strange. But yes. And if the 
                        experience gave you a peculiar 
                        thrill... 

           INT. JAIL CELL - BACK TO PRESENT

                                 BECKET 
                             (into tape recorder)
                        ...then I suppose you and I have 
                        something in common.   

           Father Murphy leans forward, engrossed. He catches himself. 
           Tries to look reverent again.    
                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                             (into tape recorder)
                        Anyway. Can you believe I attended 
                        the funeral? Keep your enemies 
                        closer, as it goes... 

           EXT. ROTHCHILD FAMILY MAUSOLEUM - DAY 

           A traditional funeral. Pallbearers lurch forward, the casket 
           on their shoulders. And standing unnoticed, just a face in 
           the crowd:

           Becket. He spies the attendees. Mostly friends and classmates 
           of Taylor. And at the center -- an empty CHAIR, reserved for 
           someone important. Too important to attend, apparently.   

           Becket spots a Rothchild: UNCLE WARREN. A face on the family 
           tree. A leathery old salt. Stands alone looking defeated.  

           Becket feels a wave of empathy, despite himself. 

           AFTER THE CEREMONY 

           Becket toes to Warren.   

                                 BECKET 
                        I’m sorry for the loss of your son, 
                        Mr. Rothchild. 

           Warren gathers himself. Looks around. 

                                 WARREN
                        Thanks. 
                             (and)
                        Not sure I, uh. Know your name, 
                        son.   

                                 BECKET
                        Becket. I’m your nephew, I’m Mary’s 
                        only child.  

           Warren stunned.   

                                 WARREN
                        Bullshit.     

           INT. TAVERN - NIGHT 

           Becket sits with Warren. The old man is pissed on Scotch.      
                                 WARREN
                        They might’ve thrown you two out -- 
                        but they should’a done me the same 
                        favor, the dirty -- they hate me, 
                        y’know. Because I spend money on 
                        real investments. I put a few bucks 
                        into solar panels, they went 
                        ballistic.

                                 BECKET 
                        I’m sure Taylor appreciated your 
                        values.  

           Warren whips off his glasses, rubs his eyes. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Sir -  

                                 WARREN
                        Don’t be. You know who killed’m? 
                        Huh?
                             (a moment)
                        Me. 

                                 BECKET
                        I can assure you, that’s not the 
                        case.

                                 WARREN
                        I wasn’t there when he was a kid, I 
                        was a deadbeat. Full a’bullshit, 
                        what everybody said. Selfish, 
                        and...I offered him a job at my 
                        firm? Just to make up for lost 
                        time? Know what he told me? 

                                 BECKET
                        No, Sir - 

                                 WARREN
                        Nothing. Never called me back. Got 
                        a job selling sub-prime -- those 
                        guys are gonna put the country in 
                        the damn dirt, mark my -- and 
                        Taylor, he was a good kid. He was. 
                        And then he went off the handle, 
                        with the cars and prescription -- 
                        I’m surprised he didn’t have an 
                        accident sooner.  
                             (then)
                        It was me. I killed him.     

           Warren calms down. Looks at Becket. Smiles. 
                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. You look just like her. 

                                 BECKET
                        Like who, Sir? 

                                 WARREN
                        Your mother.
                             (then)
                        Anyway. Whaddya do, Becket. 

                                 BECKET
                        Oh. You could say I’m between jobs 
                        at the moment.  

           Warren looks at him. 

           INT. WARREN ROTHCHILD INVESTMENTS - NIGHT 

           Warren shuffles inside, flips on the lights -- revealing an 
           exquisite oak-lined lobby. Becket follows. 

                                 WARREN
                        Looked like a dustpan when I got 
                        here. Used to be Con Ed, back 
                        before Laguardia was in office...   

           Becket peruses the lines of leather-bound books, marble 
           counter tops. He’s in heaven. 

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Conscious capitalism, mainly. The 
                        bottom line ain’t everything, 
                        dammit. ‘Course I can’t say that 
                        too loud...   

           Becket eyes a leather chair. Touches the shiny surface.  

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Too polite, just like your mother. 
                        Take a seat for Chrissake.

           Becket sits.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Listen. We got an opening in the 
                        mail room. It ain’t much, but -- 
                        shit. I like you, Becket. You 
                        remind me of somebody I miss like 
                        hell. And I could sure use an 
                        honest face around here.   
           He holds out his hand. Becket is thunderstruck. Feeling a 
           mixture of things. He stands. Gives a firm handshake.  

                                 BECKET
                        Thank you, Sir -   

                                 WARREN
                        Don’t mention it. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And so it was... 

           INT. BUSTLING MAIL ROOM - DAY 

           Becket pushes a mail cart, dodging employees.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...that I put a man to death -- and 
                        received a corporate check. I was 
                        not the first.  

           INT. CUBICLE - DAY 

           Becket works the phones. Juggling three calls at once.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I began to learn the language. 
                        Collateral. Dividend. Deduction, 
                        and Kicker.   

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY 

           Warren and a handful of EXECUTIVES volley ideas at a long 
           table. Becket toes into the room, pushing a lunch cart.    

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Bailing. Bootstrapping. Closure and 
                        Clawback. 

           EXT. WALL STREET BAR - NIGHT 

           The Executives talk shit and drink liquor. Becket re-fills 
           their shot glasses, eavesdrops.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Lying. Cheating. Tailing and 
                        Trickery. 
           INT. ROW HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Becket steps through the door, a long package under his arm. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        My friends. I learned as much as I 
                        could. After all, I needed the 
                        knowledge...   

           He opens the package: A BRAND NEW ARCHERY BOW. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...I’d soon have an empire to run.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           A YOUTUBE VIDEO

           of a HIPSTER (late 20s) addressing the camera in a voice so 
           detached that we think, for a moment, he may be unconscious 
           and talking in his sleep:  

                                 NOAH
                        Konnichiwa. I’m Noah Rothchild. I’m 
                        a photographer, musician, and 
                        farmer.     

           The video cuts to a GIRL covered in chocolate and wearing a 
           Cherokee headdress. A camera FLASHES.     

                                 NOAH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’ve probably seen my 
                        photographs. If you haven’t, I 
                        guess you’re not that into culture, 
                        which is like, fine. Either way, I 
                        really need your help raising five-
                        hundred dollars. 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - SAME 

           Becket watches the video. Eats ramen noodles with chopsticks.

                        A sick world, my friends -- when 
                        the rich beg the poor for penny.    
           INT. PHOTOGRAPHY SHOW - WILLIAMSBURG, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

           CLOSE on a leather TRIPOD CASE. 

           PULL OUT to reveal the case is carried by Becket. In costume. 
           Hair combed smartly to the side.  

           Place is packed with mustached locals. Becket peers around, 
           spots Noah nursing a PBR and texting. 

           Becket meanders over, casually pulls out a vintage camera, 
           loads film. Noah pauses texting. 

                                 NOAH
                        Is that an old Leica Zero?   

           Becket looks around like he’s caught off guard. 

                                 BECKET
                        Oh. Yes.

                                 NOAH
                        An original? 

           Becket peers at him. And lights up.  

                                 BECKET
                        You’re Noah Rothchild.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah. 

                                 BECKET
                        I’m just -- apologies, I admire 
                        your work.   

           Noah turns red. Plays it cool.  

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah y’know I try not come around 
                        too much on Fridays, I don’t wanna 
                        make a big scene - 

                                 BECKET
                        Of course, of course - 

           EXT. SIDEWALK - WILLIAMSBURG - NIGHT 

           He makes friendly, hands out American Spirits to Noah and a 
           handful of HIPSTER PALS. They shuffle along together.      

                                 NOAH
                        So do you develop? 
                                 BECKET
                        Develop? 

                                 NOAH
                        Your photographs - 

                                 BECKET
                        Oh. No, I don’t have a darkroom.  

                                 NOAH
                        Nobody develops anymore, it’s shit. 
                        I mean no offense, if you don’t 
                        have a dark room I sorta get it, 
                        but...hang on.     

           Noah hands a HOMELESS PERSON a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. The guy’s 
           eyes widen - 

           FLASH! Noah takes a Polaroid of his stunned expression. Grabs 
           back the hundred, hands the guy the still-developing photo.   

                                 BECKET 
                        So -- do you have a darkroom? 

                                 NOAH
                             (after a moment)
                        Yeah, it’s shit. 

           INT. NOAH’S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER 

           Noah SLIDES open an industrial door, revealing:  

           A massive WAREHOUSE SPACE. Tastefully restored to shabby-chic 
           perfection. The East River rolling beyond the windows. 

           The Hipsters sink into the furniture, texting, not looking at 
           each other. Becket follows. Leans his case against the sofa.     

                                 HIPSTER GIRL 
                        I want pizza and I want to dance.   

                                 HIPSTER GUY 
                        I want you to crawl back into that 
                        phone booth where you lost your 
                        virginity and die.    

                                 HIPSTER GUY 2
                        Does that French place in Fort 
                        Green take EBT cards?  
                                 NOAH
                        Are you asking if you can order 
                        foie gras with my food stamps? 
                        Because the answer is still yes.   

           Hipster Guy unscrews Becket’s tripod case...

                                 HIPSTER GUY
                        Whaddya got in here, a big dildo?  

                                 BECKET
                             (pulling away the case)
                        Sorry -- that’s a delicate piece of 
                        machinery - 

                                 EVERYONE TOGETHER
                        OOOHHH / TOUCHY - 

                                 NOAH
                        Is that the original tripod? 

                                 BECKET
                        It is.

                        Dude lemme see.  

           Becket sits there. He puts down his PBR. 

                                 BECKET
                        Pleasure. Do you have roof access?

           EXT. ROOF - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT  

           Noah and Becket emerge from a door. Becket carrying the case. 
           Only a few floors up, but the view is staggering. Manhattan 
           sparkling on the water.  

           And across the roof: a SHACK. A stand-alone structure.  

                                 NOAH
                             (motions to it)
                        That’s my darkroom, that’s where 
                        the magic happens.
                             (re: New York)
                        Look at this shit dump. Why do 
                        assholes keep moving here? I’m 
                        gonna piss on this place. 

           He scuffles toward the edge of the building. Becket hangs 
           back, unscrews the tripod case...  
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Place is worse than Austin six 
                        years ago. Berlin is the new spot, 
                        man, the scene is real over 
                        there...   

           He pees off the edge of the building, oblivious, as Becket 
           slides the ARCHERY BOW from the tripod case... 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        ...chicks are a little hairy though 
                        I heard. I dunno.   

           Becket steadies an arrow, aims at Noah’s back -     

           FOOTSTEPS. Coming up the stairs. Becket eyes the cracked 
           door. Sees the shadow of someone approaching. 

           He quickly aims again and SHOOTS -   

           Someone pushes open the door and THWACK! The arrow sticks 
           into it. Intercepted.   

           Becket instantly swings down the bow, slides it into the case 
           -- just as a GIRL steps onto the roof. Her figure in shadows. 

                                 GIRL
                             (re: arrow)
                        The hell was that sound?   

           Her voice low. Calm. Becket watches from the dark. 

                                 NOAH
                        I thought you weren’t gonna be home 
                        until late - 

                                 GIRL
                        Good to see you too, babe. 

           She kisses him.  

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing up here?

                                 NOAH
                        Beckham was gonna set up his, uh -   
                             (motions to Becket)
                        - this guy right here, I met him at 
                        the show tonight.   

           She looks. Steps into the light - 

           Stunning. In a dressed-down sort of way. Her big, almond-
           shaped eyes glowing beneath her bangs. City glimmering.   
                                 RUTH
                        I’m Ruth. 

                                 BECKET
                             (after a moment)
                        Becket. 

                                 RUTH
                             (to Noah)
                        His name is Becket, not Beckham! 
                        I’m so hungry I could eat at 
                        Arby’s, let’s get dinner.

           She prances downstairs. Noah and Becket follow... 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Oh friends. It was at this juncture 
                        that things grew complex. 

           He SHUTS the door behind them -- and it’s now we see that the 
           arrow plunged directly into a big GRAFFITI HEART. 

           INT. NOAH’S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER 

           Becket, Noah, and Ruth eat takeout. Becket trying not to 
           stare.  

                                 RUTH
                             (to Becket)
                        You work in finance? You’re like 
                        the most polite person ever to work 
                        in finance. 

                                 BECKET
                        I’m only a beginner. And it’s not 
                        all thievery and dirty tricks, 
                        money can change the world when it 
                        falls into the right hands -  

                                 RUTH
                        Wait -- sorry -- why do you talk 
                        like that?  

           Becket looks around. Confused. Noah texting, oblivious.  

                                 BECKET
                        I’m sorry?

                                 RUTH
                        You sound like Orson Wells, nobody 
                        ever brought that up? How did this - 
                             (laughing)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT'D)
                        - wait are you from past? Are you 
                        like Quantum Leap?  

           Becket RED.  

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Oh God I’m sorry, I’m a jerk, I’m 
                        the one you should laugh at -   

                                 BECKET
                        You’re the one at whom I should 
                        laugh. 

                                 RUTH
                        OH! Touche my friend, touche!    

                                 BECKET
                        So what is it, uh. That you do. 
                        Besides accuse random strangers of 
                        illicit time travel.  

                                 RUTH
                        I’m an English teacher.   

                                 BECKET
                        Tell me you’re joking - 

                                 RUTH
                             (cracking up)
                        No, man. Nope. 

           She laughs with food in her mouth. 

                                 BECKET
                        And what books do you teach? 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s my first year, but I will 
                        teach Dickens, Conrad - 

                                 BECKET
                        Tell me -- A Tale of Two Cities, or 
                        Great Expectations?  

                                 RUTH
                             (mouth full)
                        David Copperfield.  

                                 BECKET
                        So I assume you’re aware that the 
                        title of the book is not David 
                        Copperfield, it’s actually - 
                                 RUTH
                        The Personal History, Adventures,

                                 BECKET
                        - of David Copperfield the Younger 
                        of Blunderstone Rookery -

           They stop eating. Look at each other. Noah pauses texting. 
           Silence. 

                                 NOAH
                        For the record, I don’t know which 
                        one of you is gayer.     

           He gets up, kisses Ruth on the forehead, marches away... 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m gotta do some work in the dark 
                        room, babe.  

                                 RUTH
                        Don’t run away! Oh no you’re 
                        running away again, stay here - 

                                 NOAH (O.S.)
                        Blah blah blah, later on, Becker. 

           Noah marches upstairs. It’s quiet.  

                                 RUTH
                        He goes up there every night at 
                        midnight. Locks himself in his... 
                        little shack.

                                 BECKET
                        Oh.  

           INT. NOAH’S LOFT APARTMENT - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Ruth SLIDES open the door. Becket steps outside. 

                                 RUTH
                        Well it was nice, uh. Hearing you 
                        put sentences together - 

                                 BECKET
                        I’m humbled by your appreciation. 
           Silence.  

                                 RUTH
                        Do you -- do you wanna come back 
                        for dinner on Thursday -  

                                 BECKET
                        Oh I’d love to. 

                                 RUTH
                        Okay. 

                                 BECKET
                        Okay. 

           More silence. 

                                 RUTH
                        Bye! 

                                 BECKET
                        Bye! 

           She SLIDES the door shut - 

           EXT. WILLIAMSBURG, BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT 

           Becket walks. The city dancing to a secret tune. Streetlights 
           blinking in time. Traffic honking on key.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        It had been so many years, since 
                        I’d felt that feeling. That old 
                        thump in the chest, and burn in the 
                        blood.  

           EXT. TRAIN - LATER

           Becket rides. Smiling mindlessly. Crack heads slumber on 
           either side -- but this time their snores are like violins.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And I knew not how / But I’d find a 
                        way / To make beautiful Ruth / A 
                        single woman a’gain.   

           INT. WARREN ROTHCHILD INVESTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY 

           BUSTLING. Becket trails Warren through the halls. 
                                 WARREN
                        Bullshit housing market. Got the 
                        whole place tilted.  

                                 BECKET
                        I know, Sir - 

                                 WARREN
                        These clowns wanna raise interest 
                        rates. But if you do that - 

                                 BECKET
                        Housing prices increase - 

                                 WARREN
                        Oh and here we go.

           Warren points to GEORGE W. BUSH on TV.  

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Two wars we can’t afford. If 
                        somebody would just make a 
                        projected foreclosure rate, maybe -   

                                 BECKET
                        Two-point-two. For next year.  
                             (then)
                        That’s a national average. Seven- 
                        point-three in Nevada. 

           Warren stops.   

                                 WARREN
                        You put that together? 

                                 BECKET
                        Yes, Sir. 

           Warren raises his eyebrows. Keeps marching. Becket follows.   

                                 WARREN
                        Goddamn time bomb. 

           A moment. And Becket’s EYES WIDEN... 

           INT. PARKING LOT - DAY 

           A TARP. Suddenly it gets WHIPPED away, revealing DYNAMITE. 
           Harvey (the guy from the sporting goods store) says:

                                 HARVEY

                        Ammonium nitrate, much more stable 
                        than the old stuff. Blows away 
                        clean, don’t leave a scrap.  

           He’s talking to BECKET. Who wears a hard-hat. Coated in soot.  

                                 HARVEY (CONT’D)
                        So what kind of, uh...mining are 
                        you doing exactly? 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Becket arranges three sticks of dynamite on the kitchen 
           counter. Measures a long WICK.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        On the surface, an absurd plan. But 
                        hours earlier I had made the 
                        titillating discovery...  

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - HOURS EARLIER 

           He reads a chemistry book. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...that the active ammonium 
                        compound in dynamite is also an 
                        active ingredient in photochemical 
                        dark room bath. In fact, all it 
                        would take for an enterprising 
                        young photographer to blow himself 
                        unto the heavens...  

           EXT. EAST RIVER - DAY 

           SMOKESTACKS billow smoke into the air. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...is a generous waft of sulfur. 
                        Say, from the TransCanada Power 
                        Plant in Queens.  

           EXT. NOAH’S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           As Becket knocks on the door, we BOOM DOWN and -- magically -- 
           the bottom of his pant leg glows translucent for a moment, 
           revealing the DYNAMITE lashed to his calf.    
                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        What it all means, my friends -- is 
                        that such a blast would appear to 
                        be an accident. After all...  

           Ruth slides open the door. Noah behind her, looking sour.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...you can’t deny chemistry. 

           INT. NOAH’S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER 

           A gaggle of hipsters and pseudo-intellectuals sit around the 
           dinner table, laughing into their wine glasses. Becket and 
           Ruth trying not to eye each other. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        San Francisco is overrated.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s an amazing place for kids. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Ew, who cares about kids? 

                                 RUTH
                        I do. I grew up in Berkeley, and it 
                        was -- we had a yard, and a dog -

                                 BEARDED GUY 
                        So you want kids?  

           But before she can answer, Noah BRISTLES.  

                                 BEARDED GUY (CONT’D)
                        Whooaaaa! Touchy subject... 

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah I do. Some day. 

                                 BEARDED GUY 
                             (re: Noah)
                        But not this guy. 

                                 NOAH
                        I don’t “hate” kids. It’s 
                        just...wait I totally hate kids. 

           Everyone LAUGHS. 
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t mind like, Japanese kids. 
                        Like the ones who work hard and 
                        don’t complain. But - 

                                 RUTH
                        He’s just posturing for effect -  

                                 NOAH
                        I totally had this Aunt. She was 
                        sorta famous in our family, because 
                        she was a whore and got pregnant in 
                        high-school. And her life sucked 
                        after that, and I think she got 
                        AIDS or something. And now her kid 
                        is running around, probably living 
                        off welfare and shooting heroin 
                        into his foot - 

           BIG LAUGHTER. Becket watches. Dumbstruck.  

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        - all because she was a retard and 
                        had a kid. Y’know what I mean? It’s 
                        like -- wow, you deserve to die of 
                        AIDS you dumb hooker. 

           The laughter PEEKS, dies down. Ruth shakes her head.   

                                 RUTH
                        What about you, Becket. Do you want 
                        kids? 

           He puts down his fork. 

                                 BECKET
                        Would you mind if I step away for a 
                        moment? 

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 

           He eases to the bathroom door. Opens and closes it, making a 
           SOUND. 

           Peeks down the hall, to the dinner party. Sees everyone 
           chatting. None the wiser. 

           EXT. ROOF - SECONDS LATER 

           He creeps onto the roof. Rolls up his pant leg, revealing the 
           dynamite and wick taped to his calf -    
           He sees MOVEMENT on the roof across the way. He FREEZES. 

           A moment. 

           And a flock of PIGEONS bursts into the air, flies away - 

           INT. DARK ROOM - SECONDS LATER 

           Becket slips inside, flips the LIGHT. Everything bathed red. 

           Photos hang from a clothesline. Each looks like an American 
           Apparel advert. Half-naked girls in bathtubs. 

           Becket pours fresh chemicals into the bath pans. 

           Plants the dynamite beneath the table. Circles the WICK 
           around the concrete floor with precision. It’s long.    

           Becket LIGHTS IT. Clicks a stopwatch, times the flame as it 
           travels down the wick...

           Checks the current hour: 11:45 pm.  

           INT. NOAH’S LOFT APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

           Everyone’s LAUGHING about something. It dies down. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Wait -- where’s, uh...the hell is 
                        his name? 

                                 HIPSTER GIRL 
                        He went to the bathroom like, 
                        awhile ago...  

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll check. 

           She rises, but:   

                                 NOAH
                        Lemme do it.  

           INT. HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER 

           Noah eases down the hall, whistling. He arrives at the 
           bathroom door. Knocks. 

                                 NOAH
                        You jerkin’ it in there dude? 
           No answer.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Hey Bagel, make a sound if you’re 
                        alive. 

           Nothing. Noah Reaches for the knob, opens the door - 

           Empty. 

           EXT. ROOF - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

           Noah emerges from the stairwell. Pokes around the rooftop. 

           He eyes the darkroom. 

           INT. DARK ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Becket is wrapping up when he hears something. FOOTSTEPS. He 
           peeks through the cracked door - 

           Sees Noah making his way over. 

           EXT. ROOF - THAT MOMENT 

           Noah shuffles toward the dark room. Takes a drag of his 
           cigarette. Grabs the door handle -  

           Becket bursts through -- and FREEZES. Wind blowing. 

                                 BECKET
                        Oh. You’ve caught me. 

           A beat. 

                                 NOAH
                        Caught you doing what. 

           Becket clears his throat. And pulls out a PHOTO. A front-lit 
           picture of a girl sitting on a toilet, eating a hamburger. 

                                 BECKET
                        Was hoping you might be so kind as 
                        to, uh. Well you know.

           Noah exhales. Pulls a pen from his breast pocket and signs 
           the photograph...
           INT. NOAH’S LOFT APARTMENT - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone readies to go. 

           Becket reaches for his blazer on the coat rack. And for some 
           reason, he thinks better. Leaves it. Nobody notices.

           He hugs Ruth. Awkward. They downplay their attraction.   

                                 RUTH
                        Great seeing you again -  

                                 BECKET
                        You as well, good luck with 
                        Copperfield - 

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER 

           Becket drops the photo in a garbage can. Checks his pocket 
           watch: 11:59. He stops, turns around. Waits.    

           And -- RUTH appears amongst the pedestrians, holding his 
           blazer.       

                                 RUTH
                        If I didn’t know any better I’d say 
                        you’re trying to get me alone - 

           Becket pulls her in close -- AND KISSES HER. 

           She goes limp like a rag doll. And after a moment, kisses 
           back. The world going quiet. 

           The kiss ends.  

                                 BECKET
                        I was thinking you and I could take 
                        a long walk and leave this rubbish 
                        behind, how about it. 

                                 RUTH
                        Wow...  
                             (then)
                        I gotta...think. About some things.  

           Becket examines her face.       

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Wealth may be taken by force...

           A church bell STRIKES MIDNIGHT. Deep, resonant. 
                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...but love is earned. 

           INT. JAIL CELL - PRESENT 

                                 BECKET 
                             (into tape recorder)
                        So I resolved to be a gentlemen, as 
                        my good mother raised me to be, and 
                        give her time to -   

           Father Murphy is leaning forward again like he’s constipated.  

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        - okay, look. Is everything 
                        alright? 

                                 FATHER MURPHY
                        I’m fine, but -   

                                 BECKET
                        If you need to use the facility 
                        there’s no shame in it. 

                                 FATHER MURPHY
                        Did it ignite?  

                                 BECKET
                        I’m assuming you’re referring to 
                        the dynamite and not our love 
                        affair, then - 

                                 FATHER MURPHY
                        Sorry, yes.  

           Becket clears his throat. Looks a bit irritated.  

                                 BECKET
                             (into tape recorder)
                        Now for those of us more taken by 
                        death and destruction than true 
                        love, it was a minute or two later 
                        when -  

           EXT. STREET - WILLIAMSBURG - BACK TO SCENE 

           KABOOM! An explosion. Everyone on the street ducks 
           instinctively and glances toward the sound -  

           Everyone except Becket, who stops at a flower vendor. 
                                 BECKET
                        Hi there, do you have sympathy 
                        lilies?    

           EXT. ROTHCHILD FAMILY MAUSOLEUM - DAY 

           Funeral. Rainy. Becket stands unnoticed. Eyeing the same 
           empty CHAIR from before, rain collecting on the seat.  

           He spots Ruth through the crowd. She’s not devastated, 
           exactly. But mournful. Confused.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I deemed she would love again. It 
                        would only take time.    

           LATER - SAME

           Ruth shuffles to her beat-up Honda Civic. Sees WHITE LILIES 
           resting on her windshield. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And respect.

           ACROSS THE CEMETERY - SAME 

           Becket plods along -- when a BLACK LIMO pulls up. Warren 
           pokes out his head. 

                                 WARREN
                        Two in a row. I just don’t know 
                        what the hell.
                             (then)
                        Climb in, I got news.  

           INT. SMALL OFFICE - WARREN ROTHCHILD INVESTMENTS - DAY 

           POP! Warren opens a bottle of champagne. A small crowd of 
           jealous employees watch as:  

                                 WARREN 
                        Ladies, gentlemen, assholes -- meet 
                        Becket. Youngest junior accounts 
                        executive we’ve ever had. 

           Everyone CLAPS. Becket bows his head -- modest.   

                                 BECKET
                        Thank you, Sir -   
                                 WARREN
                        Kid. I wish there were more 
                        bastards like you. Most people are 
                        just full’a bullshit. Anyway, back 
                        to work, he’s got a client already, 
                        been waitin’ fifteen minutes.  

           Everyone files out. Becket left alone. Unsure what to do with 
           himself. He sits, gazes through the rainy window at the 
           skyscrapers. Monoliths of power. His face reflected back.    

           Suddenly ANOTHER FACE appears in the reflection:

                                 JULIA
                        Tell me something. 

           Becket goes stiff. He swivels around, sees her wearing a 
           cocktail dress. Somehow holding a glass of champagne already.   

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        How does one go from Wal-Mart to 
                        Wall Street in a year? Is there an 
                        internship for the underprivileged 
                        I’m unaware of?

           A moment. 

                                 BECKET
                        Tell me something. How does one 
                        decide to wear that dress so early 
                        in the week? Is there an Indian 
                        casino nearby I’m unaware of?

                                 JULIA
                        It’s five-thirty, am I fisherman?  

                                 BECKET
                        Wish I could ask you to stay, but I 
                        have a client. 

                                 JULIA
                        I am your client. I need a loan. 

           Becket leans back. 

                                 BECKET
                        Oh, no.  

                                 JULIA
                        Oh, yes. My husband had 
                        a...misadventure, of sorts, maybe 
                        you heard about it.  
                                 BECKET
                        I’m dying to. 

                                 JULIA
                        Time shares. 

           She rolls her eyes. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. It appears I arrived on a 
                        good day for you.   

                                 BECKET
                        Well.
                             (then)
                        I need to see his portfolio, and 
                        run some preliminary numbers...

           She’s getting up. Sitting on the edge of his desk. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        ...do a...background check... 

                                 JULIA
                        Oh God, that sounds so official, 
                        doesn’t it.  

           Her golden hair falling over her collarbones. She KNOCKS his 
           wooden desktop. 

                                 BECKET
                        What did you have in mind? 

                                 JULIA
                        Something under the table.  

           Becket opens his mouth. Nothing comes out. 

           Julia waits...        

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Still such a gentleman.     

           She RISES, moves to the door, but: 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Just one thing, though. Sort of 
                        eating away at me. Have you heard 
                        about the Rothchilds?  

           Becket sits there. 

                                 BECKET
                        What do you mean. 
                                 JULIA
                        Taylor, Noah. I wonder who’s next? 
                        If I were you, I might be nervous.

           She smiles that icy smile. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell my husband he should 
                        expect to hear from you. Until 
                        then...
                             (beat)
                        ...I’m sure you’ll make a killing.  

           And she slinks away and joins LYLE in the hall. His head hung 
           low like a scorned child.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        My friends. Was it a ruse? Or did 
                        she have me by the tail?   

           INT. WARREN ROTHCHILD INVESTMENTS - MAIL ROOM - LATER

           Becket weaves through the swarms of employees, searching for 
           something. He carries a freshly pressed SUIT on a hanger.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Either way, let’s face it. My style 
                        of murder thus far had very little 
                        style at all. I had been sloppy.    

           He finds an INTERN pushing a mail cart. An intern who looks a 
           good deal like Becket. Similar features, posture. 

                                 BECKET
                        Excuse me -- how tall are you? 

           EXT. STREET - LOWER MANHATTAN - MORNING 

           The same Intern wears the SUIT. He stops at a HOT DOG CART on 
           the Southwest corner of Broadway and Canal.   

                                 INTERN
                        Can I get a...Polish 
                        sausage...green peppers...   

           BOOM UP to reveal: A SECURITY CAMERA on a nearby wall, 
           capturing the transaction from behind. 

           And, gradually, we hear the sound of WILD APPLAUSE as we - 

                                                                CUT TO:
           A DIMLY LIT STAGE. 

           A voice from the dark says:

                                 MAN’S VOICE 
                        It hurts. 

                                 AUDIENCE (O.S.)
                        HOW MUCH DOES IT HURT?

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        I said it HURTS. 

                                 AUDIENCE (O.S.)
                        HOW MUCH DOES IT HURT?! 

           Suddenly a MAN slides on his knees into the spotlight like 
           Pete Townsend. He wears a headset microphone.  

                                 STEVEN ROTHCHILD 
                        Jesus loves you so much it hurts 
                        SOOOOO FREEEAAAKING BAAAAAAAAD!  

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STEVEN ROTHCHILD MEGA-CHURCH - THAT MOMENT 

           A rabid audience goes ape shit. Easily two thousand people.  
           Steven rises, roves the stage. Blond hair cascading over his 
           shoulders. A cross between Billy Graham and David Lee Roth.    

                                 STEVEN 
                        A stake through this hand, a stake 
                        through that hand -- nine inches of 
                        iron and oh it hurts, doesn’t it.  

                                 AUDIENCE
                        HOW MUCH DOES IT HURT?! 

           Steven smiles. Changes gears, almost whispers:

                                 STEVEN
                        Look at me, up here. I can -- look 
                        out now, I can go here, there... 

           He prances around the stage.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        ...I got free will. I’m Steven 
                        Rothchild, here I go, POW, ZING...  
                             (then)
                        But free -- what is that? It’s a 
                        test, isn’t it. 
                                 AUDIENCE
                        YES! 

                                 STEVEN
                        You gotta make the right DECISIONS, 
                        don’t you.   

                                 AUDIENCE
                        YES! 

           He strikes a MATCH. Holds it high. Lets it burn. A few 
           moments, and the audience goes quiet. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Tykes, who’s ever burnt themselves 
                        by accident, touched the stove by 
                        accident, lemme see some little 
                        hands in the air...  

           Little kids raise their hands. Their eyes wide.  

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Free will. You can make the right 
                        call. But -- you can make the wrong 
                        call, too, hey what happens then?  

           The audience doesn’t have a canned response for that one. 
           They murmur as the flame flickers closer to his fingers. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Gimme an answer now, what happens? 

           Disorganized shouting. The flame reaches him. BURNS HIM. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let me burn! What happens? 

                                 AUDIENCE
                        YOU GO TO HELL / YOU GET PUNISHED / 
                        YOU SUFFER -

                                 STEVEN
                        WHAT HAPPENS?!

                                 AUDIENCE
                        YOU GO TO HELL - 

                                 STEVEN
                        I. SAID. WHAT. HAPPENS. 

                                 AUDIENCE
                        HELL! 

           Steven THROWS down the match. STOMPS it out.  
                                 STEVEN
                        It hurts to go to Hell and that’s 
                        what it’ll feel like, if you buck 
                        the opportunities God gives you, 
                        it’ll feel like burning. 
                             (then)
                        Forever. 

           The audience shell-shocked. A few kids cry.   

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Scary stuff. I know. But we need 
                        not be afraid. No no no, we’re the 
                        lucky ones.  
                             (then)
                        We’ve got him.  

           Steven points to a massive CRUCIFIX on the back wall, looming 
           behind the audience. Everyone turns their heads...  

           ...everyone except BECKET, who sits in the middle of the 
           crowd. Facing dead ahead.

           INT. HALLWAY - STEVEN ROTHCHILD MEGA-CHURCH - LATER 

           Becket sits patiently. Suddenly a heavy door opens and: 

                                 JUNIOR MINISTER 
                        The Minister will have you, now.

           INT. STEVEN ROTHCHILD’S PRIVATE CHAMBER - SECONDS LATER 

           Becket toes down a dark hall. Sees a big office looming 
           ahead. A massive desk. A neon cross hung high.   

                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        Harry, I want those Nigerians 
                        reading Javascript by Thursday. 

           Steven paces around, nursing a protein shake in a blender.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                             (into headset)
                        Am I exploiting them? Harry they 
                        were eating kangaroos two weeks 
                        ago, gimme a break. I gotta go.    

           He whips off his headset and pounds out a few PUSHUPS. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        WOOOO! I tell you I get SO, RILED, 
                        UP on Sunday mornings...  
           He catches his breath. Shakes Becket’s hand. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Steven Rothchild. 

                                 BECKET
                        Becket - 

                                 STEVEN
                        Take a seat, take a seat. 

           They sit. Steven leans back, puts up one foot on his desk.    

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        So. Sock it to me.   

                                 BECKET
                        Sorry -- just quickly -- what’s 
                        that right there?  

           He points to a PHOTO on the back wall. Steven swivels around. 
           And Becket whips out a VILE and squirts POISON in his shake.   

                                 STEVEN
                             (re: photo)
                        Bible giveaway trip to Somalia. 
                        Didn’t go so great. Turns out they 
                        needed a hot meal more than the 
                        Good Book. ‘Course we couldn’t just 
                        Google “Somalia” back in nineteen-
                        ninety-eight, so who knew.     

           He swivels back around, unsheathes an IRON CROSS. Sharp.  

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        But check this out. Gift from the 
                        Queen of Botswana. We did the same 
                        mission over there, and guess what.    

           Steven rises, sits on the edge of his desk. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        They gave me an award. Funny. You 
                        never know how stuff’s gonna pan 
                        out, huh.     

           He looks down. Sees Becket’s HAND trembling. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Becket. I know we just met. But can 
                        I ask you something? 

                                 BECKET
                        I don’t see why not.    
                                 STEVEN
                        What kind of poison are you using? 

           A moment. 

           And SLAM! Steven IMPALES Becket’s hand with the cross. Becket 
           stunned at first, then he SCREAMS -     

           Steven RIPS out the cross, KICKS Becket to the floor. STEPS 
           on his hand. Becket GASPS. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        You assassins all looked the same 
                        in the beginning - 

                                 BECKET
                        Sir allow me to explain - 

                                 STEVEN
                        But now it’s like affirmative 
                        action or something. What cartel do 
                        you work for? The Rodrigo Brothers? 
                        How’d they get a gringo? 

                                 BECKET
                        I don’t know anything about - 

           He LEANS on the hand. Becket HOWLS. Steven presses an 
           intercom on his desk.   

                                 STEVEN
                             (into intercom)
                        Peter. Paul. We got us a Judas.  

           INT. BASEMENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Becket THROWN on the floor. 

           Steven and two BEEFY YOUTH MINISTERS follow. One of them 
           cranks music on the stereo -- CREED.

                                 CREED
                        When dreaming, I guuuuuided to 
                        anooother world -    

           Becket tries to crawl away, but the Youth Ministers GRAB him, 
           STRAP him to a chair.

           They leave and SLAM the door -- revealing a painting of JESUS 
           on the back, his eyes staring solemnly -       
                                 STEVEN
                             (opening a cabinet)
                        I saw you out there this morning, 
                        not turning your eyes unto the 
                        lord, and I thought... 

           He grabs something: a JUG OF GASOLINE. 

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        ...free will is such a trip, isn’t 
                        it? 

                                 BECKET
                        Sir -- we’re related -- wait - 

           SPLASH! Steven douses Becket in gasoline. It gets everywhere.     

                                 STEVEN
                        Here’s whassup -- you can choose 
                        the honorable path, and go to 
                        heaven, or...

           He lights a MATCH. 

                                 BECKET
                        OH GOD please Sir, just -   

                                 STEVEN
                        Wait wait wait. 
                             (then)
                        I love this part.   

           Creed PEEKS. Steven closes his eyes and gets into it:  

                                 STEVEN / CREED
                        Can you take, meeee higherrrr, DA 
                        DA DA DA DA DA! 

                                 BECKET
                        I CHOSE WRONGLY! I REPENT! MERCY!

           Steven keeps singing, fist-pumping to the music. Suddenly 
           Becket spots something: 

           A pool of gasoline collected on his sleeve. And in a moment 
           of desperation he LEANS forward, SLURPS the gas, SPITS - 

           Steven opens his eyes just in time to see a spray of gasoline 
           fly through the air and pass through the match  - 

           - and ENGULF HIM IN FLAMES.

           Steven SQUEALS like a dying animal. HITS the floor, ROLLS. 
           But the floor is covered in gas, too - 
           Becket pushes back as FLAMES lick toward him across the 
           concrete. The chair catches fire. Becket hobbles to a wall, 
           SMASHES the chair against the cement blocks, SMASHES again -  

           The Youth Ministers burst through the door, but jump back 
           when they see the room roaring with fire and Becket flailing 
           around with a burning chair on his back -     

           He SMASHES the chair. BREAKS free. SHATTERS a high window 
           with a flaming chair leg, CLIMBS through - 

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER 

           Pouring rain. Becket RUNS like mad. Gripping his hand. 
           Clothes tattered and burnt. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        There I was. Risen from the fire 
                        like a Phoenix. It was then, my 
                        friends, that I felt a divine 
                        presence watching over me... 

           INT. MEGA-CHURCH - BASEMENT ROOM - THAT MOMENT 

           CLOSE on the painting of Jesus. His solemn eyes watching 
           Steven incinerate.

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...as if I had been put upon this 
                        great earth by some higher power, 
                        to do away with this rotten lot, 
                        this family of slime and filth and 
                        the top one-percent that shat them 
                        into existence.    

           INT. JAIL CELL - PRESENT 

                                 BECKET
                             (into tape recorder)
                        I had chosen the honorable path. So 
                        it was.   

           He pauses for a moment. Looks down at his HAND. 

           And now we see: a SCAR. Long and raised.      

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Summer was coming. And wouldn’t you 
                        know...  
           EXT. ROTHCHILD FAMILY MAUSOLEUM - DAY 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...the sun would come out.    

           Funeral. Raining. Right next to Warren -- Becket, his hand in 
           a bandage. Still keeping a low profile. He looks like an 
           employee, along for the ride. Suddenly he spots:  

           RUTH. His heart jumps as they make eye contact. And right 
           then, the rain trickles to a stop.  

           LATER - SAME 

           They stroll together. Sun peeking from behind clouds.  

                                 BECKET
                        Didn’t expect to see you here, I’d 
                        have worn my better loafers. 

                                 RUTH 
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 BECKET
                        My boss’s brother. Steven. And you? 

                                 RUTH
                        He was Noah’s favorite uncle. 

           Quiet. 

                                 BECKET
                        You’ve been stalking me, that’s 
                        quite alright - 

                                 RUTH
                        I -- yup, big time -- oh no, what 
                        happened to your hand?

                                 BECKET
                        You could call it an act of God. 
                             (then)
                        Bit of a story -- look, can I take 
                        you to dinner? What are your 
                        feelings about lobster?  

                                 RUTH
                        Wanna just cook something?

                                 BECKET
                        I would but my apartment is a bit 
                        lacking in basic aesthetic charm.      
                                 RUTH
                        Oh I don’t care, Jesus, I live in 
                        Flatbush.       

                                 BECKET
                        How’s eight, then.     

           She smiles. Looks around. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll be knocking. 

           INT. ROW HOUSE - EVENING

           Becket bustles through the door, arms filled with groceries. 
           He plops them on the counter. Humming to himself. 

           Puts on a record. Looks up, sees the Painting. Flips it, 
           revealing the family tree...   

           He grabs a marker, crosses out STEVEN. And now we see that 
           Taylor, Noah, and Steven have each been crossed out - 

                                 JULIA
                        Well that’s not suspicious or 
                        anything -   

                                 BECKET
                        GOD -  

           He JUMPS. Julia sits reclined on the couch, sipping wine.

                                 JULIA
                        So. We had an agreement -- and you 
                        flaked out.

           Becket gathers himself.  

                                 BECKET
                        One, we never had an agreement. You 
                        simply showed up begging for alms -- 
                        two, how did you get a key to my 
                        apartment?

                                 JULIA
                        I’m a beautiful woman, I get 
                        whatever I want. Look... 

           She puts down her wine, rises. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m having a real. Tough. Time, 
                        Becket.   
           She gets close. Softly:   

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        To be honest, we’re flat broke. 
                        And to be more honest, I don’t feel 
                        much desire for my husband these 
                        days. Y’know he used to have such a 
                        swagger in his step... 

           Their faces inches apart.   

                                 BECKET
                        Oh, no.

                                 JULIA
                        Yes, tell me, I’ve always felt 
                        there was something unconsummated 
                        between us, do you ever feel like 
                        that?  

           Becket looks down. Sees the curvature of her breasts. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I know you killed them.  

                                 BECKET
                        I did no such thing -   

                                 JULIA
                        I have proof, give us the money -   

                                 BECKET
                        Sure you do, show me -  

                                 JULIA
                        That would sour things between us, 
                        wouldn’t it.  

                                 BECKET
                        Hypothetically, yes - 

                                 JULIA
                        Well I don’t like it sour, Becket, 
                        I like it sweet. 

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK on the front door. Ruth.  

           Julia looks, sees the groceries on the counter. The record 
           playing. Her expression changes.    

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                             (must be date night)
                        Oh... 
           And Becket GRABS her. SHUTTLES her to a window. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        What -- now hold on - 

           Becket SLIDES open the window, corrals her onto the fire 
           escape. The girl stunned. Becket can’t believe he’s resisting 
           her either. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. 

                                 BECKET
                        Julia.
                             (then)
                        Truly sorry.      

           And he SHUTS the window - 

           EXT. ROW HOUSE - SECONDS LATER 

           Becket bursts from the front door, flustered. Ruth stands 
           there, holding a bottle of wine and a baguette -  

                                 BECKET
                        Apologies. Bit of a culinary 
                        disaster happening - 

                                 RUTH
                        Don’t -- hey don’t worry about it. 

                                 BECKET
                        Do you like Chinese? 

           EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - SECONDS LATER 

           Julia struggles to descend the fire escape in her heels when 
           she spots Becket and Ruth speeding away on his moped. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I don’t know what drives men to 
                        greater acts of barbarism, money or 
                        love. One thing was certain, 
                        however...

           Julia’s eyes narrow.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        ...I had made a new enemy. And it 
                        would only be a matter of time.  

           INT. SHITTY CHINESE RESTAURANT - NEWARK - LATER 

           They LAUGH about something. So easy together.  
                                 RUTH
                        These students, oh my God.  

                                 BECKET
                        Tell me about them. 

                                 RUTH
                        Entitled. They all think they 
                        deserve something for just showing 
                        up, it’s nuts.   

           Becket slows his chewing. Pokes his food.   

                                 BECKET
                        Well. We all feel we’re worth 
                        something, I suppose.  

                                 RUTH
                        I love’m though. I don’t even know 
                        why, it must be my fatal fl -- 
                        alright, whaddyou got in there? 

           She points to his hand in his pocket.  

                                 BECKET
                        Oh. 

           Becket pulls out Mary’s lock of hair. He’s been thumbing it 
           mindlessly. He looks uncomfortable. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        A keepsake. My mother.
                             (embarrassed)
                        Bit creepy, I’m well aware. 

           A moment. And Ruth pulls a locket from around her neck and 
           opens it: An old photo of a DAPPER MAN. Hair slicked aside. 

                                 RUTH
                        There’s my old dad. Rest his soul. 

           Becket hesitates. Examines the photo, smiles.  

                                 BECKET
                        A gentlemen. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER - NIGHT 

           Becket and Ruth stroll together beneath the street lamps. 
           Engrossed in conversation.
           INT. PASTRY SHOP - LATER 

           They eat cake. Becket using a knife and fork. 

           INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - LATER - NIGHT 

           They search for something together. Ruth finds: A TINY WOODEN 
           JEWELRY BOX. Shows it to Becket. 

           EXT. WATERFRONT - LATER - NIGHT 

           She opens the box for Becket -- and he places Mary’s lock of 
           hair inside. Closes it. Now it has a special home.  

           And they sit together, the Passaic shimmering, fog horns 
           echoing in the heat.     

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I had love, and a promising career. 
                        Surely I would quit fussing about 
                        with the systematic killing of 
                        Rothchilds, yes?

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - WALL STREET - MORNING 

           He parks his moped. Suddenly a shiny new ALFA ROMEO pulls in 
           beside him. Becket stares. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Well. 

           INT. ALFA ROMEO DEALERSHIP - MANHATTAN - DAY 

           A SALESMAN leads him to a sleek, new coupe. 

                                 BECKET
                        Do you have leasing options?

           EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY - LATER  

           He ROARS through traffic in his new coupe.

                        - and now economic forecasters are

                        become a full-on crisis. Just what 
                        we need, right? And oh -- have you

                        a year. All accidents. How you like 
                        that? 

           Becket smiles, SMASHES the accelerator. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Yes, I wanted the fortune. I needed 
                        the fortune. Which reminds me --

                        And the Rothchild.

           INT. ROW HOUSE - NIGHT

           Becket steps through the door. Water leaking into pots.

                        No, I would continue. Besides... 

           He FLIPS the painting, revealing the family tree.

           INT. BOILER ROOM

           Becket wheels a portable GENERATOR across the concrete. Plugs 
           it into a circuit board on the wall...    

           EXT. SIDEWALK - CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY  

           CASSANDRA ROTHCHILD marches along, wearing a fox fur coat and 
           an ascot. Smoking a cigarette. 

                                 CASSANDRA
                             (into phone)

           INT. HAIR SALON - LATER 

           She bustles inside. Sees the pretty, dark-skinned BLACK GIRL 
           behind the counter. Cassandra blows smoke in her face.

           A SALON ASSISTANT lowers a drying hood over her head, clicks 
           the metal contraption into place -   

           Wait, the Assistant is Becket. He secures a leather strap 
           beneath her chin.

           Becket RIPS open a box of synthetic fiber. Kevlar.

           MCARTHUR ROTHCHILD lies in the combat position like a Marine 
           sniper. Bandana around his head. Dragging a disposable razor 
           across his dry cheek. 

           Suddenly he spots a BEAR lumbering in the distance. He 
           squints in disbelief. Stiffens up, AIMS - 

           EXT. WOODS - LATER 

           McArthur approaches the dead bear. Kicks it. Drags the razor 
           across his face. Puts up a camera, sets a timer, poses...  

           And behind him, the “bear” rustles alive. Rises. McArthur 
           senses something, turns around -   

           And sees the bear stand up on two legs and pull out an 
           ANTIQUE PISTOL. McArthur presses the razor so hard against 
           his cheek it BREAKS.   

                                 MCARTHUR

                                 BECKET
                             (into phone)
                        Cancel my four-o’clock, would you? 
                        I’ve got something to - 
                             (smiling)
                        No, you’re killing me!

           INT. EMPTY TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT - MIDTOWN - DAY 

           A REALTOR leads Becket and Ruth through this beautiful, 
           vacant space.  

                                 RUTH
                        Is that -- oh my God, a hot tub... 

                                 REALTOR
                        You ever lived somewhere with a 
                        doorman? 

                                 BECKET
                        I’ve barely lived somewhere with a 
                        door. 

                                 REALTOR
                        Changes your life, not even jokin’ 
                        around. And this, here, hang on... 

           He WHIPS open the curtains, revealing MANHATTAN standing tall 
           and proud.  

                                 REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        Boom.

           LATER

           POP! Becket opens champagne. Pours a glass, hands it to Ruth. 
           Pours one for himself -- and spills it.  

                                 BECKET
                        Oh, look at me - 

                                 RUTH
                             (drinking)
                        Jesus -- that’s too sweet.    

                                 BECKET
                        Don’t care for champagne? 
                                 RUTH
                        Oh I’ll get into it. 

           EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT 

           Becket slides open the door. Steps out, gazes at the view. 
           Gathers himself. Ruth follows - 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh Christ, no way - 

                                 BECKET
                        It’s lovely, trust me. 

           He takes her hand. Eases her onto the balcony. Wind blowing. 
           Car horns echoing far below. The city glittering all around. 

                                 RUTH
                        Insane. It’s all just -- insane. 

           She turns - 

           There’s Becket on one knee holding a RING. 

           She freezes. And for once, Becket has no words. Just: 

                                 BECKET
                        Would you?

           Ruth takes the ring. Trembling. Tries it on.   

                                 RUTH
                        Okay. I mean yes, yes -  

           They KISS, EMBRACE. A long moment. Overwhelmed. 

                                 BECKET
                        So do you like the view, then. 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s absurd -   

                                 BECKET
                        Fairly certain we can see New 
                        Jersey if we lean out a bit - 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey.  
                             (then)
                        I loved you poor. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT'D)
                        I’m happy for you and you’ve worked 
                        so hard and this is totally -- I 
                        don’t even know -- but it’s all 
                        just stuff. And I love you high or 
                        low, up or down. 

           They look at each other. Traffic singing. The future ringing 
           in their ears. 

                                 BECKET
                        Hungry? 

                                 RUTH
                        Starving. 

                                 BECKET
                        Lobster? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A LID LIFTED FROM A PLATE, REVEALING LOBSTER. But it’s not in 
           a fancy restaurant, it’s in a 

           INT. JAIL CELL - THAT MOMENT  

           where Becket is receiving his last meal. He tucks a napkin 
           into his collar. Arranges the cutlery just so. 

           And sits there. No one to share with. No one except a priest. 

                                 BECKET
                        Would you like some? 

                                 FATHER MURPHY
                        I don’t care much for seafood. 

           Becket squints at him. Eats.  

                                 BECKET
                             (chewing)
                        Tell me, do you know much Chaucer? 
                        Geoffrey Chaucer? You being a 
                        learned man of the cloth? 

                                 FATHER MURPHY
                        I know some, yes.  

                                 BECKET
                        Seems there’s a verse, something 
                        like For you with the strongest, 
                        uh...
                                 FATHER MURPHY
                        For you with the strongest grip on

           INT. BECKET’S APARTMENT - MORNING 

           He rushes around, adjusting his shirt cuffs. Ruth emerges 
           from the bathroom, brushing her teeth. 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey -- I want you to come to my 
                        work party next Friday. Meet my 
                        people. We’re renting out a back 
                        room at that tapas place on Lex and 
                        fortieth, gonna be fun.  

                                 BECKET
                        Next -- yes alright - 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey. Hey. 

           She kisses his cheek, toothbrush still in mouth. 

           INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY - BACK TO STORY 

           Becket marches past the DOORMAN. Tips his hat. 

                                 DOORMAN
                        That’s a badass suit, now boy - 

                                 BECKET
                        New suit, new day.  

           INT. ALFA ROMEO - DRIVING - LATER 

           Becket ROARS through traffic. Shifting gears. 

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - WALL STREET - LATER 

           He SKIDS to a halt. Steps out, leather shoes shining. 

           EXT. WALL STREET - LATER 

           He marches along. And without even noticing, he passes a 
           small but gathering crowd of PROTESTORS. Bull horns. Signs.   

           SUBTITLE: September 15, 2008. 
           INT. WARREN ROTHCHILD INVESTMENTS - LOBBY - SAME 

           Becket marches across the marble floor -- and is intercepted 
           by a MAN IN A DARK SUIT. And a WOMAN dressed the same. 

                                 WOMAN 
                        Becket Rothchild? 

           A moment. 

                                 BECKET
                        Yes? 

                                 WOMAN 
                        Megan Pinfield, FBI. This is my 
                        partner Brad Matthews. Can we have 
                        a word with you in private? 

           Becket looks at them.  

                                 BECKET
                        Oh.
                             (then)
                        Yes -- sorry, I was about to fetch 
                        some tea, would you like some?

           INT. BECKET’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 

           They all sit, holding tea cups.   

                                 PINFIELD
                        ...and right after Cassandra, there 
                        was McArthur, found near his deer 
                        stand. Although his body was fairly 
                        well decomposed by the time -  

                                 BECKET
                        Yes I’m well aware. What’s this 
                        about?

                                 PINFIELD
                        Is it true you’re a Rothchild? The 
                        youngest? 

                                 BECKET
                        Far as I know, yes. 

                                 PINFIELD
                        And you’re an heir to the estate -  
                                 BECKET
                        Oh no. No, not to my knowledge. My 
                        mother was ousted from the family, 
                        sort of a long story. I was raised 
                        in New Jersey.

                        Newark. 

           Matthews squints in disbelief. Pinfield shuffles a few 
           papers, hands a FILE to Becket...

                                 PINFIELD
                        Well congratulations, you’re an 
                        heir.   

           Becket stares at the file. And slowly, his eyebrows raise. He 
           feigns surprise like a professional.   

                                 PINFIELD (CONT’D)
                        Two more family members die, you’re 
                        one of the richest men alive. 

           Quiet. 

                                 BECKET
                        I’m a suspect. 

           No answer.   

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        What -- okay. Okay, what can I do. 

                                 PINFIELD
                        Can you answer a question for us - 

                                 BECKET
                        Please. Anything.

           INT. WARREN ROTHCHILD INVESTMENTS - BOARDROOM - DAY 

           A big meeting. Tense. Becket sits amongst the brass, trying 
           to pay attention. But his cool is clearly rattled. 

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        Lehman Brothers is going today,

                        We dump whatever we can cut loose 
                        before the markets catch wind - 

                                 WARREN
                        Fuck you, I’m not doin’ it. I spent 
                        thirty-five years earning the trust 
                        of these shareholders, I’m not 
                        throwin’m to the sharks in one 
                        afternoon.   

                                 EXECUTIVE 2
                        Why are we debating? Everyone on 
                        the board’s here, let’s take a 
                        vote. Raise your hand if we sell.  

           One by one, hands RAISE. Warren watches. Light going from his 
           eyes. And Suddenly, from the street down below: CHANTING. 

           Everyone pauses. And peeks through the windows -- at the 
           PROTESTORS in the street. 

                                 PROTESTORS
                        BULL-SHIT! BULL-SHIT! BULL-SHIT!
           INT. BECKET’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Becket bustles around when Warren lumbers into the office, 
           sinks into a chair. Fisting a Scotch. Staring into nothing.   

                                 BECKET
                             (shuffling papers)
                        Well we can panic like animals, or 
                        we can re-group. I still have the 
                        accounts with Vienna, we could - 

                                 WARREN
                        Becket. I gotta let you go. 

           Becket pauses.

                        You can stay through the end of the 
                        week.

           Becket without words. Gut-punched. The CHANTING still 
           emanating from outside. And Warren chokes up. A grown man in 
           suspenders, crying. 

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Awe fuck. Let’s get drunk. 

           EXT. WALL STREET - MOMENTS LATER 

           They step outside -- protest BOOMING. They push through...

                                 PROTESTOR 
                        Yeah go take a break! You deserve 
                        it assholes!  

           Warren taking it hard. Suddenly he weaves, looses his 
           bearings a little. Drops his briefcase. 

                                 WARREN
                        Goddamn...hang on... 

                                 BECKET
                        Sir are you alright -

           Warren grabs his chest and FALLS to one knee. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        Sir! Hold on, hold on - 

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER 

           Becket sits. Waits. Alone. 
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           He toes inside, sees Warren strapped to machines. His skin 
           grey, bloodless. Breathing labored. 

           Becket eases into a chair. Eyes quickly wet.   

                                 WARREN
                        Not gonna...mince words...
                             (then)
                        ...you wanna chase that rabbit down 
                        the hole, that money rabbit, hey 
                        alright go ahead...but here I am, 
                        sixty-eight years old, so many 
                        people I’ve known in my life... 
                        and you’re the only one here.
                             (and)
                        Run. Get outta...grab that person 
                        you love...and... 
                             (and)
                        ...or shit, go ahead. Be like me. 
                        Huh? 

           Warren forces a smile. Tubes running from his nose. Becket 
           can barely look. He takes Warren’s hand. 

           EXT. ROTHCHILD FAMILY MAUSOLEUM - DAY 

           Funeral. Just Becket and a handful of EXECUTIVES poking their 
           phones. 

           Becket watches the coffin lowered into the dirt. He fights 
           off a burning emotion. Something deep, repressed. But he 
           swallows it. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Winter was coming. And my friends -- 
                        how suddenly the spoils of my 
                        efforts were upon me. Could you 
                        believe?
                             (then)
                        There was but one Rothchild left.

           INT. ROTHCHILD MANSION - TROPHY ROOM - 1983 

           A scene from the beginning. The one where Mary is given an 
           ultimatum by the Patriarch:

                                 WHITELAW
                        ...brick by brick, stone by stone, 
                        for the world to see. I’ve done 
                        that for you, now, Mary... 
           ANGLE ON Whitelaw. His face in shadows, just barely. Fire 
           light dancing on his dim features. 

           EXT. TICKET COUNTER - DAY 

           A MAN buys tickets for something. It’s Becket, wearing a 
           mustache and mesh baseball cap.     

                                 BECKET
                        One for the two-o’clock, please. 

           EXT. ROTHCHILD MANOR GROUNDS - LATER 

           A WALKING TOUR strolls past. Becket brings up the rear. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        It pained me to see my rightful 
                        home as a lowly riff raff.  

           EXT. ROTHCHILD MANOR GROUNDS - JAPANESE GARDEN - LATER

           The GUIDE drones on about flowers. But Becket is busy eyeing 
           the massive stone WALL bordering the place. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Yet I needed to know -- could the 
                        property be breached? 

           EXT. MANSION - LATER 

           They approach a set of big, oak DOORS. Becket examines them. 

                                 GUIDE 
                        ...one of my favorite questions: 
                        Does anyone still live here? Yes -- 
                        Whitelaw Rothchild does, in fact, 
                        still call the manor home, although 
                        he rarely leaves the North Wing -- 
                        which lies beyond these doors and, 
                        sadly, beyond the limits of this 
                        tour. Thanks so much -  

           EXT. MANOR GROUNDS - LATER  

           Becket lumbers atop a hill. Gazes at the Mansion in the hazy 
           distance. A hulking fortress of stone, oak.     
                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Whitelaw. Impenetrable. 
                             (then)
                        How did I do it.  

           INT. BECKET’S OFFICE - DAY 

           He writes a letter.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Friends, the truth is so despicably 
                        pedestrian I hesitate to tell.    

           INT. ROTHCHILD MANSION - NIGHT 

           BEHIND WHITELAW as he sits at his desk, reading a book. His 
           mangled hand turning pages.  

           Suddenly the old BUTLER approaches in the distance. Heels 
           clicking on the marble hall. He arrives, holds up a LETTER. 

                                 WHITELAW
                        From whom. 

           INT. BECKET’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY 

           BEHIND BECKET as he packs up items from atop his desk. Scar  
           visible on the back of his hand.

           Suddenly the INTERN approaches in the distance. Pushing the 
           mail cart down the hall. He arrives, holds up a LETTER. 

                                 BECKET
                        From whom. 

           SECONDS LATER 

           Becket RIPS open the letter. Reads. And his eyes widen. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I simply wrote the old man a 
                        letter, asking if he’d like to meet 
                        his grandson. And lo and behold -- 
                        he wrote back, and cordially 
                        invited me to a - 
           INT. HALLWAY - LATER 

                                 BECKET
                             (on phone)
                        - dinner party at the manor 
                        tonight. In two hours. He 
                        apparently has a spot unfilled. 

           Becket paces down the hall. Ruffled. 

           INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM - QUEENS - THAT MOMENT 

           Ruth grades papers. 

                                 RUTH
                             (into phone)
                        Jesus. Do you actually wanna meet 
                        the guy?

                                 BECKET
                        I suppose part of me does. 

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Wait -- my work party is tonight, 
                        remember? At the tapas place on 
                        Lex?

           BECKET

                                 BECKET
                        I -- yes right, could I arrive 
                        late? Perhaps after ten?  

           Becket marches toward his office... 

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        No later than ten, seriously. 

           He swings into his office -- and HALTS. Because someone is 
           sitting behind his desk.

                                 RUTH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s really important to me. 

                                 BECKET
                        Ruth. Apologies. I have someone 
                        here, can I call you back? 

           RUTH 

           A moment. 
                                 RUTH
                        Yeah of course. I love you - 

                                 BECKET (O.S.)
                        I love you too. 

           BECKET

           He hangs up. Peers at Julia sitting there. Her long legs 
           crossed. She wears a big pair of sunglasses. Smokes.  

           She plops a MANILA ENVELOPE on his desk. 

                                 JULIA
                        Open it. 

           Becket eyes her. And opens it. Slides out a thin stack of 
           glossy PHOTOGRAPHS -   

           OF HIM. From afar. Him entering Noah’s darkroom with 
           dynamite. Him running from Steve’s church with burns. Him 
           loading an antique pistol in the woods -  

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Where can I ash? 

           Becket breathes through his nose. Steadies himself.  

                                 BECKET
                        You can’t smoke in my office. 
                             (then)
                        You can’t smoke anywhere in 
                        Manhattan, it’s quite known.  

           He SHUTS the door -   

                                 JULIA
                        Taylor drowned. He went to 
                        Princeton on a swimming scholarship 
                        -- and he drowned. Oh I became more 
                        than a bit suspicious right then. 

           Becket LOCKS the door, SHUTS the window, UNPLUGS the phone -   

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        So I had a little helper follow 
                        you. Seems you almost caught him in 
                        Brooklyn, remember? On the rooftop? 
                        You saw something, but thought it 
                        was just a flock of pigeons, yes - 

           He POUNDS the desk -- she JUMPS -   
                                 BECKET
                        If I was a man of less moral fiber 
                        I might tell you where to shove 
                        these photographs. 

                                 JULIA
                        If you were a man of less moral 
                        fiber, God help us all.  

                                 BECKET
                        Who knows.   

                                 JULIA
                        Why would I tell you that? I’m 
                        blackmailing you, Jesus Christ.

                                 BECKET
                        What, then. 

           She clears her throat. Flips through a little notebook.  

                                 JULIA
                        Oh yes. Three million dollars, by 
                        today -  

                                 BECKET
                        Impossible.  

                                 JULIA
                        You still have a company checkbook, 
                        yes? You still have access to the 
                        accounts, yes? Liquidate the bla 
                        bla bla and do whatever it is you 
                        have to do - 

                                 BECKET
                        I can’t do it - 

                                 JULIA
                        - and deliver the checks to my 
                        husband. He’s across town in his 
                        office right now, waiting for you. 

           She clicks her watch. Sets a timer. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Thirty minutes. Any longer than 
                        that, and she’ll get a package 
                        immediately. One just like this. 

           Julia taps the manila envelope. Rises, slinks to the door... 

                                 BECKET
                        Who will get a package? 
                                 JULIA
                        Your little girlfriend, who do you 
                        think.  

           Becket looks down. Sees his hand trembling. 

                                 JUILA
                        My courier’s on the way. Public 
                        High School Forty-Nine in Bayside, 
                        Queens, yes? I imagine discovering 
                        that your groom-to-be dabbles in 
                        casual homicide might really put a 
                        damper on the weekend.  

           She opens the door to leave -- but stops. Her curvy figure 
           silhouetted in the light.     

                                 JULIA
                        And for what it’s worth, I was 
                        hoping we might consummate a 
                        different arrangement. Something a 
                        bit more fun. 
                             (then)
                        But you blew it, Becket. 

           And she SHUTS the door - 

           INT. HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER 

           Becket MARCHES at full tilt, ducks into the Intern Office - 

                                 BECKET
                        Brian. Call Fritzer in Vienna, 
                        tell’m we can sell P and G, he can 
                        name his price.       

                                 INTERN 
                        Wait -- can I do that?   

                                 BECKET
                        NOW.

           EXT. WALL STREET - THAT MOMENT 

           The Alfa Romeo ROARS from the parking garage, skids into 
           traffic. Horns honking.   

           It zooms right past an unmarked Crown Vic. And in the driver 
           seat: AGENT MATTHEWS. He pulls away from the curb, follows...  
                                 MATTHEWS
                             (into radio)
                        Heading north on Wall. 

           INT. ALFA ROMEO - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Becket careens through the Flat Iron District. Around 
           traffic. Gripping the wheel. He veers into a 

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS 

           Where he SKIDS to a stop, tosses the keys to the VALET - 

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - SECONDS LATER 

           He marches past the front desk... 

                                 SECURITY
                        Sir. Excuse me, Sir! 

           ...and into an open elevator, the doors closing -

           INT. UPPER FLOOR - SECONDS LATER 

           DING! The doors open. Becket BARRELS down the hall. Checks 
           his watch. 5:59. Unsure exactly where to go... 

           INT. LYLE’S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT 

           A massive place. Sparsely decorated. Modern art stretching 
           across the walls, worth fortunes. 

           Lyle slouches behind his desk, drinking Bourbon. Shouldering 
           a phone. Eyes bloodshot. He watches the clock -- 6:00.  

                                 LYLE
                             (into phone)
                        Well. He’s not here, honey - 

           Becket BURSTS into the office -   

                                 BECKET 
                        Is that her? Hand it over.   

           He SNATCHES the phone -  
                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        I’m here. And I’ve got your checks, 
                        you sociopathic, conniving wench.  

           INT. SALON - THAT MOMENT 

           Julia sits back, enjoying a pedicure. 

                                 JULIA 
                             (into phone)
                        Good Lord Becket. This could have 
                        been anyone.  

                                 BECKET (O.S.)
                        Call off the delivery.

                                 JULIA
                        Oh -- just write the checks first, 
                        will you? I want to be positive we - 

           BECKET

           He HANGS UP. Pulls out checks, paperwork. Splays them across 
           the desk. Grabs a pen without asking, writes. 

           Suddenly -- he hears sniffling. He looks up, sees Lyle 
           crying. 

           Becket notices a sharp LETTER OPENER within reaching 
           distance. He discreetly slides it away, keeps writing. 

                                 BECKET
                        You’re about to be a millionaire, 
                        Lyle. Put on a happy face.    

                                 LYLE
                        Don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about...she’s...

           Becket ignores him. Writes. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        ...she bankrupted us. With her time 
                        shares...and now...she’s gonna take 
                        it all and leave anyway - 

                                 BECKET
                        Breathe deep, now -  
                                 LYLE
                        She hates me...y’know...and... 
                             (then)
                        She loves you. 

           Becket peers up. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                             (disgusted)
                        You. 

           A moment. Becket unsure what to say. And he keeps writing. 
           Lyle takes a big breath.  

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Really coming up in the world, huh. 
                        Gonna get all that free money.  

                                 BECKET
                        I’ll send you a fruit cake.  

           Quiet. 

                                 LYLE
                        Little bastard.  

           Becket ignores him. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Just a little beggar bastard from 
                        Newark. 

           Becket SLAPS him. Lyle recoils, stunned. Never been hit.  

                                 BECKET
                        Apologies. Now take these checks, 
                        deposit them after midnight - 

           Lyle JUMPS UP, grabs the LETTER OPENER. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        Put that down, I have a dinner 
                        party to attend -  

                                 LYLE
                        C’mere you fucking peasant. 

           He JABS -- Becket JUMPS back -- Lyle JABS again - 

           Becket grabs his arm, wrestles away the weapon, THROWS Lyle 
           to the floor - 

           And the guy BURSTS INTO TEARS. On his knees. Becket tosses 
           the letter opener on the rug, opens the door to leave -   
                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m sorry, I just -      

                                 BECKET
                        Good. Now be sorry alone. 

           And he SLAMS the door -    

           INT. ALFA ROMEO - DRIVING - LATER

           Becket rips down the highway. Fresh raindrops smacking the 
           windshield. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And just that quickly -- I’d 
                        committed a clumsy theft. I was 
                        only consoled by the notion that 
                        I’d be a billionaire within the 
                        week -- provided I kill Whitelaw -- 
                        and perhaps I could pay off the 
                        divested parties before they 
                        demanded my punishment. 

           In his rear-view: the CROWN VIC. 

           Becket swivels around, squints at the car. Drives on. And as 
           the sky grows dark with clouds, he passes a sign: 

           WELCOME TO CONNECTICUT. 

           INT. ALFA ROMEO - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Storm pounding the roof. 

           Becket pulls to the mansion front gate -- and it RISES. He 
           motors up the drive. Headlights in the rain.

           EXT. ROUNDABOUT - SECONDS LATER 

           He climbs from the car, holds a briefcase over his head.  
           Peers to the north wing entrance. Sees two torches burning on 
           either side of the oak doors -- and between them: a PERSON. 

                                 BECKET
                        Hello! 

           No answer. Becket jogs through the rain, up the steps -- to 
           the old BUTLER who stands between the torches. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        Am I in the correct place?
           Without word, the Butler OPENS the doors -- revealing a deep 
           HALL. Marble floors. Gas lamps flickering. Becket steps 

           INT. INSIDE THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           and the doors SHUT behind him. All things quiet.  

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        In my haste, I had utterly 
                        forgotten to devise a plan of any 
                        sort.     

           Down the hall: WHITELAW approaches. Gliding through pools of 
           light like an apparition. And in a moment, we see clearly: 

           He’s Becket. An ancient, silver Becket. And in a voice like 
           oil bubbling deep from the earth: 

                                 WHITELAW
                        On account of the storm, it seems 
                        my friends couldn’t be with us 
                        tonight. But I just couldn’t turn 
                        you down. 

           They peer at each other. Both stunned by the resemblance. 
           Even the same injured hand. 

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Whitelaw. 

                                 BECKET
                        Becket. 

           And:

                                 WHITELAW
                        How do you feel about lobster.

           A SILVER LID IS LIFTED, REVEALING LOBSTER - 

           INT. DINING ROOM - THAT MOMENT 

           They eat at either end of a long, oak table. The old Butler 
           standing in a corner, heavy and still as a grandfather clock. 

           Becket peers around for an idea. Something. Anything. A 
           knife, a big vase -    

                                 WHITELAW
                             (eating)
                        Quiet, yes. 
                                 BECKET
                        I’d say peaceful, Sir.   

                                 WHITELAW
                        Peaceful. 
                             (then)
                        Would you humor an old man? May I 
                        tell you a story?

                                 BECKET
                        Oh certainly.  

           Whitelaw chews his lobster. Smiles a little. 

                                 WHITELAW
                        Nineteen forty-nine. I worked 
                        aboard a dredger boat in the bowels 
                        of Louisiana. Dragging the river, 
                        right down to her bones, yes. One 
                        day the water turned black. I knew 
                        what it was. I called on my uncle -- 
                        he had money, and I requested a 
                        loan. To purchase the rights, yes. 
                        To drill. He said he’d consider it. 
                        Two days later I went back to the 
                        river -- know what I discovered?

                                 BECKET
                        No, Sir.  

                                 WHITELAW
                        My dear uncle, surveying water with 
                        an oil crew. He’d gone and bought 
                        the rights for himself, okay.    
                             (chewing)
                        That evening I found him in a cat 
                        house in Vermilion with his pants 
                        around his ankles -- I pressed a 
                        blade right here...
                             (points to his neck)
                        ...told him I’d carve my initials 
                        into his jugular if he didn’t sign 
                        those rights to me. And he did. 
                        Right then and there.   

           He sips wine. Takes a moment. Becket growing uneasy. 

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        It was easy, that one. He didn’t 
                        fight back. But some did.  

           He raises his crippled hand.   
                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Man from the Federal Board of 
                        Petroleum. It was hard, yes. 
                        Filthy. But rising up in the world 
                        is a filthy job. Few have the gut 
                        for it.    

           Becket can’t help but smile a little. Whitelaw sees it - 

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Suppose you think me a selfish 
                        brute, yes.

                                 BECKET
                        Well no, Sir - 

                                 WHITELAW
                        Rich and out of touch. But hear 
                        this. The lobster you’re eating was 
                        fished from the ocean from a 
                        trawling vessel, which is an 
                        expensive piece of work. The local 
                        fisherman likely couldn’t afford it 
                        -- he took out a loan, yes. From a 
                        bank. Which is a place that 
                        accumulates money. Which is nothing 
                        but a pile of cold, flimsy paper, 
                        whose fragile value rests entirely 
                        upon the prosperity of men like 
                        myself, men whose quarterly profits 
                        determine the net worth of nations, 
                        men who ensure there’s money to be 
                        lent at all. So call me greedy. But 
                        remember, we need the rich. They’re 
                        the ones who’ve done the dirty work 
                        -- so you don’t have to. 
                             (then)
                        Are you finished?

                                 BECKET
                        Finished? 

                                 WHITELAW
                        With your dinner - 

                                 BECKET
                        Oh. Yes, it was delicious, thank 
                        you.     

           Whitelaw balls up his napkin. Throws it on his plate.

                                 WHITELAW
                        Come with me. I’ll give you a 
                        chance to see something. 
           INT. TROPHY ROOM - LATER 

           He leads Becket into this familiar place. Animal heads on the 
           wall. Fireplace burning eternally. Becket sees a CLOCK. 8:30. 

           Whitelaw grabs a hunting cap, slips it on.

                                 WHITELAW
                        How do I look. 

                                 BECKET
                        Quite authentic, I’d say -   

                                 WHITELAW
                        Ah good.   

           He lumbers to a wall covered in antique weapons. Bows, 
           arrows. Without word, he unhooks an old SHOTGUN -

           Becket glances to the doorway. Only one way out -- and the 
           Butler is quickly CLOSING the doors behind them -  

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                             (re: shotgun)
                        Perazzi double. A fowling piece, 
                        yes, my grandfather’s... 

           He CRACKS open the breach, removes old cartridges. 

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Oak stock. No cracks, no weak 
                        points...  

           He opens a drawer. Pulls out a fresh cartridge. Slides it 
           into the barrel, SHUTS the breach. Stands in front of a 
           roaring fire with a loaded shotgun. 

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        The sights are straight as arrows, 
                        would you like to see?  

                                 BECKET
                        I -- yes, alright.  

           Whitelaw HANDS OVER the shotgun. Gently. Never takes his eyes 
           off Becket. Curious about something. 

                                 WHITELAW
                        Go on. Draw a bead on something, 
                        whatever strikes your fancy. 

           Becket shifts around. Raises the shotgun, aims at the wall -   
                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Try this, here. 

           Whitelaw slips the hunting cap from his head. Places it over 
           his heart. 

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Right here. 

           Becket hesitates. Takes a breath. And AIMS at Whitelaw’s 
           beating heart.

           He squints into the sights. Zeroes in on the old man’s EYES. 
           Ancient. Wrinkled. But just like his. Exactly like his.   

           Becket keeps aiming. Finger tapping the trigger. Fire 
           ROARING. Rain THUNDERING. Clock TICKING. 

           And his HAND trembles. And he lowers the gun -   

                                 BECKET
                        Oh. I have to get back. 

                                 WHITELAW
                        Back where. 

                                 BECKET
                        Home. 

                                 WHITELAW
                        You’re nearly there. 

           No answer. And Whitelaw steps forward, gently removes the 
           shotgun from his hands. Never loses eye contact.    

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Well.
                             (and)
                        Better go quickly, then. 

           A moment. 

           And Becket backs away. To the door. Watching Whitelaw recede. 
           An old man gripping a shotgun in front of a roaring fire - 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Becket marches down the hall. Getting the fuck out of there. 
           He glances over his shoulder, sees nothing. No Whitelaw. 

           He rounds a corner -- and another -- but wait. Where is he? 
           Place is a labyrinth. He doubles back. 
           Breaks into a jog. Heels echoing on the marble. Breathing 
           heavy. Better go quickly? 

           He spots a door. PUSHES into a 

           INT. DARK BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           and LOCKS it behind him. Keeps the lights off. There’s a 
           window -- he tries to PUSH it open - 

           EXT. MANSION - SAME 

           Becket struggles with the window. Just a spec in the massive 
           stone facade of the mansion. Wind and rain whipping down.  

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME  

           Suddenly -- FOOTSTEPS approach from down the hall. Becket 
           goes still. Watches the light beneath the door...  

           ...and a SHADOW passes... 

           A few moments. And the footsteps recede. Gone. Becket toes to 
           the door. UNBOLTS the lock, silently. Pushes it open -  

           KABOOM! Buckshot SPRAYS into his shoulder. Becket rockets 
           back, through glass, into a shower - 

           Whitelaw steps into the bathroom, over broken glass. Becket 
           squirms backward on bloody palms as Whitelaw COCKS the gun -

           Becket grabs a shard of glass and PLUNGES it into his thigh. 
           Whitelaw HOWLS. And Becket SLIPS past him, STAGGERS down the 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           and now it’s fucking on. He staggers at full bore. Blood 
           pumping from his shoulder with each breath. Eyes WIDE.  

           INT. BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT 

           Whitelaw YANKS the shard from his leg. Blood SPATTERING 
           across his clothes, face.  

                                 WHITELAW
                        GO ON AND RUN, NOW! 
           INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

           Becket staggers - 

                                 WHITELAW (O.S.)
                        DOORS ARE LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE, 
                        HE MADE GOOD AND SURE OF IT! 

           Becket stumbles to a glass door, wrestles the handle - 

           JESUS the Butler is right there, just beyond the glass, face 
           wet with rain -  

           Becket backs away, turns a corner -  

           KABOOM! Whitelaw fires wildly. Misses. Becket RUNS. Whitelaw 
           CHASING. He opens the breach, reloads. 

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        Little BASTARD! Filthy little 
                        ABORTION! I’ll FLUSH you out! Like 
                        your WHORE MOTHER should have! 

           Becket hyperventilating. He is going to die. There is no way 
           out -  

                                 WHITELAW (CONT’D)
                        NO WAY OUT, YOU KNOW! GO ON AND 
                        TIRE YOURSELF! COME TO MY HOUSE TO 
                        KILL ME, YOU BEST HAVE DONE IT!

           Becket BURSTS through a doorway and into the -  

           INT. TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           NO! Right back where he started. He SHUTS the doors - 

           KABOOM! The doors VIBRATE from the impact of buckshot. Becket 
           stumbles back as Whitelaw BURSTS into the room -  

           Becket OVERTURNS a table just as KABOOM! Buckshot peppers the 
           table top -  

           Whitelaw reloads. Things suddenly quiet. The air dense with 
           smoke, powder.  

           Becket glances around, sees: an old BOW on the wall. And 
           ARROWS. He grabs the bow, pulls back an arrow just as 
           Whitelaw SHUTS the breach -  

           Becket SHOOTS him. In the chest. Whitelaw jolts back. Gathers 
           his balance, looks down. 
           Clears his throat -- and BREAKS OFF the arrow like William 
           Wallis -      

           Becket SNATCHES another arrow, PULLS IT BACK just as Whitelaw 
           raises the shotgun and now it’s a DUEL - 

           CLOSE ON WHITELAW as his face goes limp. 

           PULL BACK to reveal an arrow lodged straight through his 
           neck. 

           Whitelaw drops the shotgun. Gurgles. His airway filling. 
           Thick jugular blood SPRAYING into the air. 

           He sinks to his knees in front of the fireplace. Animal heads 
           watching from all sides. Fire light dancing on their waxy 
           eyes, teeth snarling.  

           Becket lowers the bow. Still shaking. And amidst the 
           adrenalin, he realizes something: 

           He’s gone and done it. 

           BEETHOVEN’S 7th SYMPHONY, 2nd MOVEMENT hums to life as -    

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Oh friends. Believe this. My final 
                        murder was not a murder at all, but 
                        a legitimate act of self-defense. 

           BEETHOVEN CONTINUES as -  

           INT. MANSION - LATER 

           POLICE tape off the trophy room. A few COPS talk to Becket as 
           an EMT bandages his shoulder.   

                                 COP
                        And you have no idea why he 
                        might’ve wanted to kill you? 

                                 BECKET
                        Gentlemen. I don’t.  
                             (then) 
                        Look -- this sounds ludicrous, but 
                        I promised my fiance I’d join her 
                        tonight, and I’m already late. I’m 
                        perfectly willing to make a 
                        recorded statement tomorrow if 
                        you’d like, but - 
                                 EMT
                        What -- Sir you need to go directly 
                        to the emergency room. 

                                 BECKET
                        I will -- right afterward. But 
                        please, it’s important. 

           The cops look at each other. They can’t hold him. BEETHOVEN 
           CONTINUES as -  

           INT. TAPAS RESTAURANT - LEX AND FORTIETH - NIGHT 

           He hustles from the rain -- into the crowded restaurant. Arm 
           and shoulder bandaged under his coat. 

           He shoots into a back room -- where a TOAST is underway. 
           Glasses in the air. He spots RUTH, makes his way over...  

                                 RUTH
                             (whispering)
                        Jesus I was worried -

           She notices his bandages.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        What -- OH MY GOD BECKET - 

                                 BECKET
                        Ruth listen for a moment - 

                                 RUTH
                        What happened? What - 

                                 BECKET
                        I’m fine. I’m okay. 

           They look at each other. Beethoven growing LOUDER. HEAVIER. 

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        I have some peculiar news. 

           BEETHOVEN BLASTS INTO HIGH GEAR AS WE 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MANSION - GREAT HALL - DAY 

           Becket stands atop a staircase in full regalia. Shoulder and 
           arm in a sling. Cameras FLASHING. A party APPLAUDING below.
           He holds out his hand -- and someone takes it: RUTH. She’s 
           overwhelmed. Becket looks into her eyes, comforts her. 

           And they ease down the steps. Into the festivities. A slow-
           motion cascade of glittery jewels and champagne.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Is this the part of story where I 
                        admit that wealth is not all it’s 
                        cracked up to be? Where I highlight 
                        the irony that after all this time, 
                        I cared only about love? 

           He greets his guests. A myriad of big names, beautiful faces. 
           He charms without effort. Born to do it. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        No. This is the part where I tell 
                        you the truth: that being rich is 
                        even better than you imagine.  

           BEETHOVEN THUNDERS as we

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. / EXT. SERIES

           The mansion / the beach house / the high rise on Madison / 
           the high rise on Lexington / the town home in Paris / the 
           huts over blue water / the yacht / the safety deposit boxes - 

           INT. MANSION - GREAT ROOM - BACK TO SCENE 

           Becket makes his way through the crowd, to Ruth. And 
           discreetly, he puts his hand on her belly. 

           There’s a little lump there. A secret between them. They peer 
           at each other. Beethoven ROARING.  

           EXT. BACK LAWN - THAT NIGHT 

           Among the guests, Becket and Ruth watch: 

           FIREWORKS EXPLODE across the water. Colors popping and 
           streaming through the air. We almost expect to see Mary and a 
           transient bass player making eye contact for the first time. 

           Fireworks POP and FIZZLE - 
           INT. JAIL CELL - PRESENT 

           Becket gazes off. Still hearing the fireworks. Just faintly. 
           He pushes aside his lobster, the cell quiet for a moment.   

                                 BECKET
                        I mentioned earlier this is a 
                        tragedy. It still is, mind you. 
                             (then)
                        Hold steady, now.  

           INT. MANSION - BACK TO SCENE - LATE NIGHT 

           The party has calmed a bit. Champagne flutes littered about. 

           Becket makes his way down a line of late GUESTS, shaking 
           their hands like the president. Each says their name:    

                                 OLD WOMAN 
                        Evelyn Walton, the Waltons. 

                                 OLD MAN 
                        Harold Koch, the Koches. 

                                 LENNY KRAVITZ 
                        Lenny Kravitz, Lenny Kravitz.    

           Becket approaches a WOMAN wearing a dark suit. Looks familiar 
           from somewhere. He shakes her hand, smiles politely...  

                                 PINFIELD
                        Megan Pinfield, FBI.

           Becket goes cold. Sees Agent Matthews behind her, stone-
           faced.  

                                 BECKET
                        Right. Right -- have you tried the 
                        ham? It’s delightful.

           INT. PRIVATE CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER 

           He leads them inside. 

                                 BECKET
                        Look, I don’t mean to be uncouth, 
                        but this is heroically poor timing -    

           Matthews HANDCUFFS him.  
                                 PINFIELD
                        You’re under arrest for murder. You 
                        have the right to remain silent - 

                                 BECKET
                        Murder? Of whom? 

                                 PINFIELD
                        Lyle Archdale. 

           Becket without words.

           INT. LYLE’S OFFICE - DAYS EARLIER 

           A bloody LETTER OPENER rests on the rug. 

           PULL OUT to reveal Lyle, sprawled on his side, wrists SLIT. A 
           forensics team snapping photographs.   

           EXT. MANSION - BACK TO SCENE 

           Becket is lead away in handcuffs. On the verge of a panic 
           attack. Bewildered guests watching. Ruth follows...     

                                 RUTH
                        What do we do? What do we do? 

           He gets SHOVED in a cop car. Looks up at her with a new 
           expression. Unguarded. Desperate. 

                                 BECKET
                        I love - 

           The door SLAMS in his face - 

           INT. COP CAR - THAT MOMENT

           The car pulls away. Becket cranes his neck, peers through the 
           back windshield. Watches Ruth recede. Her eyes heavy, red.  

           He looks like he wants to say something deep. Something 
           revealing. But:

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Can you believe. After all this, 
                        I’d go down for a killing I didn’t 
                        even commit. 
           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY 

           A REPORTER in heavy makeup: 

                                 NEWS REPORTER 
                        He’s the soul heir -- to one of the 
                        largest private fortunes in the 
                        world. And today, Becket Rothchild 
                        stands trial for murdering 
                        childhood friend Lyle Archdale.  

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER 

           Becket sits, looking comatose. The prosecution explains:

                                 ATTORNEY 
                        - as we can see from these security 
                        tapes, Mister Rothchild BURST into 
                        the office at approximately six-
                        o’clock PM, and emerged just three 
                        minutes later, which is consistent 
                        with the estimated time of Lyle 
                        Archdale’s death -     

           LATER 

           The Attorney displays the letter opener in a plastic bag. He 
           interrogates a FORENSICS EXPERT: 

                                 ATTORNEY (CONT’D)
                        - and did you find the defendant’s 
                        fingerprints on the murder weapon?  

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT 
                        I did, yes. 

                                 ATTORNEY
                        And how certain are you that the 
                        fingerprints are his - 

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT
                        One-hundred percent certain.  

           LATER 

           The Attorney questions someone: JULIA. Becket watches. 
           Boiling in his seat. 

                                 ATTORNEY
                        You were the first to find your 
                        husband’s body, is this correct? 
                                 JULIA
                        Yes. I found him.    

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Horrible.
                             (then)
                        Tell us, were you...in love with 
                        Mister Rothchild at the time?

           Quiet. 

                                 JULIA
                        I was.  

                                 ATTORNEY
                        And he with you?

                                 JULIA
                        Becket Rothchild has been in love 
                        with me his whole life. I just...
                             (she breaks down)
                        ...I don’t know. I never thought 
                        he’d do this. 

           She CRIES. Turns on the water works.  

           Becket peers up at RUTH in the gallery. Her kind face. She 
           wants to understand, to forgive. 

           But she looks away. Even she thinks he’s guilty. 

           LATER 

           The JUDGE hands down a sentence: 

                                 JUDGE 
                        Becket Rothchild. I hereby sentence 
                        you to death, in a manner 
                        prescribed by the laws of the 
                        state. May you know and understand 
                        that justice has been served, and 
                        may God rest your soul. 

           The gavel comes down -- SLAM!

           INT. PRISON - NIGHT

           Becket is relieved of his personal items. Wallet. Watch. 

           A GUARD pulls the jewelry box from his coat. Cracks it open, 
           sees Mary’s lock of hair inside.   
                                 GUARD
                        The hell is that.  

                                 BECKET
                        It’s personal. Please.  

           But the Guard marches away...  

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        Wait. SIR! PLEASE -    

                                 GUARD
                        Shut up! 

           The Guard lumbers into a bathroom and FLUSHES Mary’s lock of 
           hair down the toilet. Swirling around. Gone.   

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        I wish I could find the right words 
                        to describe this juncture in my 
                        story.

           INT. JELL CELL - LATER 

           Becket is SHUT behind bars. Alone. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        But my friends -- there are no 
                        right words, and no wrong words. 

           After a moment, he sits. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        There is only time. 

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And silence. 

           Quiet. Black. Just the sound of your own breathing. And - 

           INT. JAIL CELL - TWO YEARS LATER 

           Becket sits on the floor. New lines on his face. Hair longer. 
           This is the man we know -- the one from the present. 

           A BIG GUARD lumbers to the bars, RATTLES his night stick. 

                                 BIG GUARD
                        Yo. Get up, you got a visitor.  
           INT. PRISON - VISITATION WINDOW - LATER 

           Becket eases into a chair and sees, just beyond the glass 
           partition -   

           Julia. Hair tussled. Blouse buttoned low. He unhooks the 
           phone, puts it to his ear. Says nothing. 

                                 JULIA
                        Look at you. Bit tougher than last 
                        time, I bet you’re quite the catch 
                        around here. 

           He has no answer. Simply points to a digital CLOCK on the 
           wall, ticking away their time. 2:57, 2:56, 2:55... 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh.
                             (and)
                        How are you, Becket.  

           No answer. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow’s the big day, I 
                        understand. 

           Still no answer. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I was remembering -- you know that 
                        game we played? As kids? I’d have a 
                        secret and you’d try to guess?

           He nods. Just slightly.  

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Well go on, guess. 

           Becket lowers the phone -- fuck this -  

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Do it for me, c’mon -  

                                 BECKET
                        You have something to say, say it.    

                                 JULIA
                        Give you a hint. It involves -- 
                        handwriting. 

           Becket stares.  
                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Guess! 

                                 BECKET
                        You want me to guess? 

                                 JULIA
                        Yes, let’s hear it - 

                                 BECKET
                        You’re foul. You’re a lump of coal 
                        with makeup. I’d rather die in here 
                        than be with you. That’s my guess. 
                        It’s hardly a secret and it doesn’t 
                        involve handwriting.    

           Quiet. Julia blank. Did she hear him? 

                                 JULIA
                        Okay, here’s another hint. Lyle -- 
                        when I found him like that, I found 
                        something else, too. 

           A moment. And suddenly -- Becket feels a RUSH of blood to the 
           head -     

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        And beautifully written, I should 
                        add.   

           He looks down, sees his HAND trembling. Glances to the clock. 
           1:30, 01:29, 1:28 -    

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Why orange, by the way? Doesn’t 
                        match your complexion -   

                                 BECKET
                        Julia be quiet and listen to me.   

                                 JULIA
                        I should be leaving, really - 

                                 BECKET
                        If Lyle left a note -- if that’s 
                        what you’re saying -- in the name 
                        of all things holy, release it.    

                                 JULIA
                        Oh now you want to talk - 

                                 BECKET
                        Tell them you found it under the 
                        rug or I don’t know - 
                                 JULIA
                        Don’t tell me what’s what - 

                                 BECKET
                        - and if there’s something you want 
                        in exchange, tell me now. I’m sure 
                        there is. So tell me.  

           Quiet. 

                                 JULIA
                        Oh Becket. What could you possibly 
                        have to offer.    

           She smiles. And HANGS UP THE PHONE -  

                                 BECKET
                        Wait, just -- STOP. HOLD ON! STOP! 

           The Big Guard GRABS him, pulls his hands behind his back -- 
           as beyond the glass, Julia saunters toward the exit -     

                                 BIG GUARD
                        That’s it, you’re done -  

                                 BECKET
                        STOP! PLEASE, GODDAMMIT!

           Becket STRUGGLES -- and Julia pauses. Watches. Amused.   

                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                             (to the Guard)
                        I have thirty seconds left, let me 
                        finish the conversation - 

                                 BIG GUARD
                        Twenty-five, siddown.  

           Becket RIPS away from him, sits, grabs the phone -   

           JULIA’S SIDE - SAME 

           She watches Becket through the glass. Yelling. His voice 
           muffled. And she exhales dramatically, sits back down - 

           BECKET’S SIDE - SAME 

                                 BECKET
                        Tell me what you want. Make haste. 

           She gazes into the air. Like a little girl deciding what she 
           wants for Christmas. 
                                 BECKET (CONT’D)
                        Good Christ get on with it -  

                                 JULIA
                        Just give me a moment, now - 

                                 BECKET
                        I’m going to die in less than 
                        twelve hours. They’re going to 
                        inject me with a cocktail of deadly 
                        barbiturates until my nerves cease 
                        to fire and my heart sputters to a 
                        halt. You have the key to my life. 
                        And you want me to live, don’t you.   

           She eyes him. Her expression soft, genuine -- just barely. 
           0:06, 0:05, 0:04 -   

                                 JULIA
                        Give me everything.
                             (and)
                        Sign the estate over to me - 

           CLICK -- the line goes dead.    

                                 BIG GUARD
                        Time’s up, get up.  

           He GRABS Becket, PULLS him back. Julia behind the glass, 
           smiling in cool confidence -  

           INT. PRISON CELL - LATER 

           PLOP -- a stack of legal papers hits a desk. The Big Guard 
           pulls out a pen, hands it to - 

           Becket. Who eyes the papers. Looks deflated, like he’s 
           putting an old dog to sleep. He tightens his mouth.  

           And signs them. The air dense. 

                                 BIG GUARD
                        You need anything else. 

           Quiet. 

                                 BECKET
                        Just one thing, actually. Do you 
                        have a tape recorder?
           LATER - SAME 

           Becket hunches over the tape recorder. A dish of lobster 
           pushed aside, picked clean. Father Murphy listening 
           patiently. And we realize -  

           This is it. This is the present.  

           Sunlight cuts across the floor. Long shadows. The new day 
           upon him. 

                                 BECKET
                             (into tape recorder)
                        That was some hours ago, my 
                        friends.
                             (then)
                        And now it appears Julia has played 
                        one final, cruel joke.   

           He swallows. Hovers his finger over the STOP button on the 
           tape recorder. Face tight. Holding back so much. 

           FOOTSTEPS approach from down the hall. Father Murphy rises, 
           puts his hands on Becket’s shoulder. 

           And -- the Big Guard appears at the bars. Brow hard. He looks 
           at Becket. Becket peers back. 

                                 BIG GUARD
                        Rothchild. 

                                 ROTHCHILD
                        Yes. 

                                 BIG GUARD
                        You’re not gonna fucking believe 
                        this. 

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY  

           CLOSE ON A SUICIDE NOTE. It’s held by -  

           A POLICE CHIEF. Standing at a podium. Surrounded by cops and 
           court officials.  

           Cameras FLASHING. Reporters SHOUTING. All jockeying for 
           position.

                        The case of Becket Rothchild has 
                        had no shortage of rumors and 
                        conspiracy theories.

                        Some claim he was involved in the

                        Others claim he murdered just one 
                        person -- Lyle Archdale. Either 
                        way, what no one saw coming was -

                                 PIERS MORGAN
                        - the revelation that Becket 
                        Rothchild -- as found today in a 
                        New York state court of appeals -- 
                        is completely, and utterly, 
                        innocent.   

           The program plays on a TELEVISION in the 

           INT. PRISON - THAT MOMENT 

           where Becket is given back his personal items. 

           A GUARD slides the jewelry box across the counter. Becket 
           cracks it open, sees the empty interior. A quiet moment. 

           And he slides it back onto the counter. 

                                 BECKET
                        This isn’t mine. 

           INT. PRISON HALLWAY - LATER 

           He’s led down a dark corridor. To a steel door, which RATTLES 
           to life and EASES open like a bank vault. Becket steps 

           EXT. OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           and a crowd goes HAYWIRE beyond the fences. Reporters YELLING 
           his name. Protestors WAVING signs. 
           Becket shuffles through the pouring sunlight. Reaches a 
           parking lot and sees: 

           RUTH beside her beat-up Honda Civic. And holding her hand -- 
           a BOY. No more than two years old. Hair ruffled. Eyes big.  

           Becket stares. Heart pounding.  

           He turns the other way, sees: 

           JULIA. Leaning against a black limousine, smoking a 
           cigarette. 

           Becket breathes deep. And makes his way toward Ruth -- and 
           his young son.  

           Getting closer. Ruth breaking into smiles. Sunlight glinting 
           off her hair. Becket closes in, like from a magnetic pull. 

           But suddenly -- he slows. Squints into the distance. Lost 
           somewhere. Ruth watches, confused. Wind blowing. 

           And:

                                 BECKET
                        Okay. 

           And he strides toward JULIA. The moment he does it, Julia 
           flicks her cigarette and climbs into the limo -  

           The old BUTLER emerges from the driver seat, opens a door as 
           Becket arrives. They look at each other a moment. No words.    

           And Becket climbs 

           INT. INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

           and the Butler SLAMS the door -  

           Becket shifts around in his leather seat. Finds a comfortable 
           position as the limo eases into gear, silent and smooth.   

           Sees Julia reclined across the way, her long legs crossed. A 
           funny smile on her face. Secretly satisfied. 

           Becket looks down, sees his HAND trembling. A hot surge 
           hitting his system. Right behind the eyes. 

           A single tear squeezes out. Rolls down his face. Julia sees 
           it, expressionless behind her sunglasses. She says nothing, 
           just gazes out the window, at the landscape shooting by...
           Becket breathes deep. Presses a button on the console -- and 
           a bottle of CHAMPAGNE rises from the wet bar... 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        You may remember, some time ago -- 
                        I told you this was a tragedy. 

           He POPS the champagne. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        And it is.  

           INT. RUTH’S HONDA CIVIC - PARKED - THAT MOMENT 

           Ruth BAWLS. Her son watches. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        But it’s not about me. 

           INT. CHURCH - CONFESSION BOOTH - THAT MOMENT 

           Father Murphy listens to a confession. But he’s lost in 
           thought about something else. Gazing off into darkness. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        It’s about you. 

           INT. LIMOUSINE - DRIVING - THAT MOMENT 

           Becket sips champagne from a big glass. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        With your values and morality. Your 
                        deep-rooted expectations. You 
                        thought fate would hand me what I 
                        deserve, yes? Or that I’d at least 
                        choose love over money.

           Becket unearths a CASSETTE TAPE from his coat pocket. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Oh my friends.    

           He DROPS the cassette into the champagne glass. Watches the 
           bubbles corrode the acetate. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        You’ll be poor forever. 
           EXT. ROTHCHILD ESTATE - FRONT GATE - DAY 

           The limo pulls into the estate. It glides up the driveway, 
           toward the MANSION. Which seems further away than usual. Like 
           a mirage. Unreachable. 

           We stay behind, the limo growing tiny in the distance. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        Yes. It’s you. 

           The GATE lowers in our face. Keeping us out forever. 

                                 BECKET (V.O.)
                        You’re the tragedy.

                                 THE END
