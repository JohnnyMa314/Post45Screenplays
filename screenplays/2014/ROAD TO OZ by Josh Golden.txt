                                 FRANK (V.O.)

           EXT. ROSELAWN GARDENS - DAY

           LYMAN FRANK BAUM, 12, moves his hands from his face. Opening 
           his eyes. Covered in dirt, as if he’s been living in the 
           garden. Wearing a bedsheet for a cape, his father’s high hat 
           atop his head.

                                 FRANK
                        Ready or not, here I come.

           A country of marvelous beauty. Bright patches of green grass 
           going on for acres, trees bearing luscious fruits. A small 
           creek of sparkling water runs between the banks.

           He marches through the infinite fields of yellow roses, 
           calling out. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I seek company with the noble Kings 
                        of Roselawn. Present thyself, or 
                        suffer at the hands of Baum The 
                        Magnificent, the most powerful 
                        sorcerer in all the land. 

           This -- this is home. And there’s no place like it.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I said SHOW YOURSELF.

           FOOTSTEPS SCAMPER through the garden, Frank spinning around. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Aha. There you are.

           He takes off, chasing after the mystery feet. 

           Leaping over the narrow creek.

           RUNNING. Twigs cracking, pushing past the leafs, sunlight 
           bouncing off his hat. 

           He’s close. Gaining on the footsteps until he reaches--

           A SCARECROW.

           Nailed to a post, straw sticking out from every which way. 
           The cutout eyes in its burlap face staring down at the 
           frightened young boy.
           Frank trips over himself, falling backwards. Terrified.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Benji! Henry!

           The scarecrow’s gaze intensifies -- did it just smile?

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re there, Benji. The 
                        game’s over. Come on out.

           BENJI BAUM, 17, and HENRY BAUM, 9, come running out from the 
           cover of the trees.

                                 HENRY
                        Why’d we stop?

           The boys stand at their brother’s side, looking up at the 
           scarecrow.

                                 BENJI
                        I knew somethin must’ve spooked 
                        him. It’s just a scarecrow, Frank. 
                        Don’t be such a yellow-belly.

           Frank’s white as a ghost.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Frank?

           Frank struggles to breathe. Deep, deep breaths. 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Henry, go fetch ma. 

           Henry can’t take his eyes off Frank.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Henry go!

           BIRDS SCATTER FROM THE TREES as Benji’s scream carries 
           through the fields. 

                                 DOC PIPT  (V.O.)
                        And breathe in...

           INT. DOC PIPT’S OFFICE - DAY

           The lanky, wild-haired DOCTOR PIPT has his stethoscope 
           pressed against Frank’s bare chest. 

                                 DOC PIPT 
                        Very good. Now exhale.
           Frank lets it out, COUGHING up a fit.

                                 DOC PIPT (CONT’D)
                        Easy.

           The doc hands Frank a glass of water.

           BENJAMIN BAUM, 40s, observes with a worried eye. Massaging 
           his perfectly-groomed moustache.  

                                 DOC PIPT (CONT’D)
                        Do me a favor, son? Hop on down and 
                        go make yourself decent outside.

           Frank hops down from the inspection table, grabs his shirt 
           and leaves the room.

                                 BENJAMIN BAUM
                        Well, doc?

           JUST OUTSIDE THE OFFICE -- Frank peers through the cracked 
           open door. Sneaky little devil.

                                 DOC PIPT
                        It’s a good thing you brought him 
                        in when you did, Mr. Baum. That 
                        boy’s heart, well it’s a fragile 
                        little thing.

                                 BENJAMIN BAUM
                        He’s always been a sensitive one.

                                 DOC PIPT
                        You know that’s not what I’m sayin.

           Outside the door, Frank turns away from their conversation. 
           Distracted by something OUT THE WINDOW. 

           EXT. STREETS OF DOWNTOWN SYRACUSE - DAY

           Putting on his shirt, Frank steps out onto the unpaved 
           street. Drawn to a large crowd forming down the block in 
           Clinton Square. There’s excitement in the air.

           Frank runs across the crowded street, darting right in front 
           of a BUGGY.
           INT. DOC PIPT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Benjamin takes off his dirt-covered high hat, getting real 
           close and quiet to the doc.

                                 BENJAMIN BAUM
                        We’ve done everything you asked. 
                        We’ve got him homeschooled, he 
                        rarely goes out to play with his 
                        brothers and sisters. Spends most 
                        of his time just starin out the 
                        window. You told us it was 
                        manageable. 

                                 DOC PIPT
                        I know. I know. And it is. So long 
                        as he manages his excitement. Fear, 
                        anger. It’s in Frank’s best 
                        interest to avoid any kind of 
                        situation that’s gonna get him all 
                        worked up. 

           EXT. STREETS OF DOWNTOWN SYRACUSE - CLINTON SQUARE - DAY

           HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE gathered around, Frank not nearly tall 
           enough to see what’s happening. He weaves through the crowd, 
           even crawling between some legs. 

           Until he reaches the front and sees it for himself.

           A GIGANTIC HOT AIR BALLOON sits in the center of the square. 
           So big it dwarfs even the city’s tallest buildings. Quite the 
           sight. The name written across it:

           “THE NEW WORLD”

           PROFESSOR C.C. COE, the mad-eyed showman, excites the crowd. 
           He’s certainly got their full attention.

                                 C.C. COE
                        Ladies and gentlemen, boys and 
                        girls. Gather round and feast your 
                        eyes on a piece of history. What’s 
                        sure to be one for the record 
                        books. 120 feet long, a capacity of 
                        95,000 cubic feet. The New World, 
                        as I call her - this marvelous 
                        beauty that sits before you - shall 
                        travel farther than any balloon in 
                        these here United States. 

           Coe licks his finger and raises it into the air, closing his 
           eyes. The WINDS pick up. 
                                 C.C. COE (CONT’D)
                        You feel that?

           He climbs on into the basket, firing up the balloon. 

           Frank can’t take his eyes off the balloon as it slowly rises 
           up off the ground.

                                 C.C. COE (CONT’D)
                        Great citizens of Syracuse. On this 
                        gorgeous September day, I shall 
                        travel eastward. Far above the 
                        clouds and over the rainbow, into a 
                        land few men have ventured. 

           As the winds grow stronger and the balloon lifts higher, a 
           few volunteers from the crowd cast off the ropes, setting it 
           free.

           Just as the skies begin to grey, clouds rolling in.

                                 C.C. COE (CONT’D)
                             (shouting down)
                        A bid you adieu!

           Up, up, and up it goes. Far above Clinton Square. The 
           monstrous balloon swaying one way, then another. 

           The wind begins to switch, a powerful gust. The onlookers 
           holding onto their hats, power lines shaking.  

           THUNDER BOOMING, FLASHES OF LIGHT in the sky.

           The balloon probably two miles high until a current sweeps it 
           away. The beginnings of a cyclone forming in the clouds.

           CHEERS and APPLAUSE consume the square, the onlookers all 
           waving, many running down the street, following the balloon.

           Frank too begins to follow it until he’s grabbed by the arm, 
           finding his frustrated father standing over him.

           The skies suddenly clear like before. The wind tamed.

                                 BENJAMIN BAUM
                        That’ll be enough thrill for today, 
                        son. More than enough.

           As Frank’s dragged away, he looks up at the sky. The balloon 
           nowhere to be seen.
           EXT. STREETS OF DOWNTOWN SYRACUSE - DAY

           Everyone going back to their business. Frank and his father 
           heading to their buggy.

                                 BENJAMIN BAUM
                        I’m only looking out for you, 
                        Frank. I know it’s not easy. I know 
                        you’re just a boy. But the sooner 
                        you quit runnin around seeking out 
                        the next big adventure, the safer 
                        you’ll be.

           As his father lectures, Frank straggles behind.

           Something catches his eye. Benjamin’s oblivious.

                                 BENJAMIN BAUM (CONT’D)
                        You’ve just gotta find something to 
                        keep you sedentary.  

           Frank’s drawn to a shop window. Pressing his face against the 
           glass, it’s clear what’s got his attention.

           A TYPEWRITER. Just sitting there, waiting to be used.

                                 BENJAMIN BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Frank?

           He joins his son in front of the window, Frank’s interest not 
           going unnoticed. 

           INT. THE ROSELAWN HOUSE - EVENING

           In his sleeping clothes, Frank sits in candlelight. The 
           typewriter at his fingertips. 

           His brothers asleep in their beds. Trying to be quiet about 
           it, Frank types away. One letter a time. 

           Today, I saw a great, big balloon...

           Nope. Frank RIPS the page from the typewriter, starting over. 
           Thinking about it this time. 

           The majestic balloon was carried up over the city... 

           Frank smiles, that’s more like it. He keeps on typing, no 
           stopping him now.

           Circling Frank, around the back of the machine as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. GRAND OPERA HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - EVENING

           Coming back around the other side of the typewriter, we find 
           Frank - now in his 30s - still busy at work. Typing away in 
           the cramped, dusty corner. A moustache much like his 
           father’s, slick hair. Looking rather dapper in his tux.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (O.S.)
                        Frank.

           MR. BRISTLE, 40s, the bothersome stagehand, stands over Frank 
           as he continues to type. He doesn’t like being ignored.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        The actors need those pages, Frank. 
                        Curtain opens in ten. What do you 
                        expect me to tell the--

           Frank rips the page from the typewriter, handing it off.

                                 FRANK
                        Only minor edits. Mainly some of 
                        the verses to "A Rollicking Irish 
                        Boy.” Just a few versus. Well all 
                        of the verses, actually. And I 
                        think he should dance, no? Everyone 
                        loves a good dance.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        You changed Dennis’s number? Oh he 
                        won’t be too happy about that, sir. 
                        Not one bit.

           Frank pull his GOLD POCKET WATCH from his pocket, checking 
           the time.

                                 FRANK
                        Seven minutes, Mr. Bristle.

           INT. GRAND OPERA HOUSE - AUDIENCE - EVENING

           The seats fill up. It’s a full house tonight. Mainly a bunch 
           of STUFFY OLD FOLKS, very few smiles.

           Frank stands in the wings, pacing. Constantly checking his 
           watch.

           The ORCHESTRA cues up, time to begin. The audience quieting.

           The red velvet curtain opens -- revealing the backdrop of a 
           stormy sea, a partially-built wooden ship on stage.
           The beautiful, white-robed PROPHETESS takes center stage. The 
           focus on her.

                                 THE PROPHETESS
                        The picture lives, breathing ruin 
                        where once was magnificence and 
                        kingly splendor. And this fair-
                        haired stranger comes not to paint 
                        Arran in her palmy days, but in 
                        desolation. Aye! And more than 
                        this. He comes to woo our last 
                        treasure whose soul is centered in 
                        all the sweetness and honor of a 
                        kingly race. Would I could save 
                        her. But I cannot. The Hand of Fate 
                        is here, and we must bow to her 
                        will.

           Frank still watches from the wings, gauging the audience’s 
           reaction.

           He checks his watch yet again. Bored. 

           EXT. GRAND OPERA HOUSE - EVENING

           The sign outside the theater reads: MAID OF ARRAN. OPENING 
           NIGHT.

           Franks sits on the steps outside the theater, folding his 
           arms in the cold of the night.

           He stares off down the block, a GROUP OF KIDS skipping along 
           the brick road. 

           Something else grabs his attention, a BUBBLE floating by. 
           Just feet away from the tip of his nose.

           He looks over to find a shy little redhead, BETSY, holding a 
           BUBBLE PIPE.

           Frank WHISTLES, waving for the girl to come over.

                                 FRANK
                        Good evening, young miss.

           He tips his hat.

                                 BETSY
                        Evening, Mr. Baum.

                                 FRANK
                        Little late for a little lady like 
                        yourself.
                                 BETSY
                        My ma and pa are inside. They say 
                        the theater’s no place for a child.

           This seems to offend Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        That so?

           Betsy nods. Frank motioning to see her little bubble 
           contraption, just a skinny pice of wood with a spout.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        A fine piece of craftsmanship. Very 
                        fine. You know what it’s for, don’t 
                        you?

                                 BETSY
                        Of course. It blows bubbles.

                                 FRANK
                        Why you are a smart one aren’t you. 
                        But they’re not just any bubbles. 
                        They’re magic bubbles.

           Betsy’s eyes widen, intrigued.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Magic bubbles let you see things in 
                        a different color. Things as they 
                        should be. Here...

           Frank blows into the end of the pipe, a great big BUBBLE 
           coming out the other end. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Now let us see.

           Betsy at his side, Frank looks THROUGH THE BUBBLE -- the 
           nearby horse parked along the curb is suddenly bright pink.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Just as I thought. That horse 
                        there, she’s really pink. Someone 
                        must’ve painted her brown.

           The little girl giggles.

           Now SHE looks through the next bubble -- looking up at the 
           old opera house, the building suddenly a grand castle.

           Frank perks up at the sound of MASSIVE APPLAUSE from inside.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I suppose that’s our cue. Shall we?

           Frank stands, dusting himself off. He puts his arm out for 
           Betsy, the two of them marching up the steps side-by-side.

           INT. GRAND OPERA HOUSE - LOBBY - EVENING

           The lobby filled with GUESTS. People from the audience, city 
           folk of some importance. Lots of mingling, classy drinking.

           A VIOLINIST from the orchestra sets the mood.

           Frank stands at the top of the stairs, a whole line of guests 
           waiting to shake his hand. Mr. Bristle at his side.

           The elderly MRS. JOYCE is next in line.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Frank you remember Mrs. Joyce, her 
                        husband’s with the Syracuse Bank? 
                        They invested a great deal of money 
                        into this show.

                                 FRANK
                        Of course. Thank you for coming, 
                        Mrs. Joyce. I do hope you enjoyed 
                        the play.

           Frank puts on the smiles, kissing the back of Mrs. Joyce’s 
           hand.

                                 MRS. JOYCE
                        It was quite good, wasn’t it? Very 
                        sophisticated entertainment.

                                 FRANK
                        Sophisticated? Well that’s 
                        something then.

           DOWN THE STAIRS

           Frank’s practically hiding from the crowd. Fanning himself 
           with his hat, hand on his chest.

           He goes over to the table to pour himself a drink. Scotch. 

           Just as he raises the glass to his lips, he spots Betsy 
           amongst the adults, playing around. She blows into her pipe, 
           a BUBBLE floating up into the air.
           Frank looks through the bubble -- at what looks like a 
           stunning PRINCESS across the room. Cheeks sprinkled with 
           glitter, flowing pink gown. A silver crown atop her head.

           When the bubble POPS, this woman turns out to be MAUD GAGE, 
           30. Curls in her hair, quite the smile. She may not be a 
           princess, but she certainly has the grace of one.

           She catches Frank staring at her, the bumbling writer 
           immediately looking away, admiring the artwork on the wall 
           behind him. Trying to be real serious about it.

                                 MAUD (O.S.)
                        You’re not exactly doing a 
                        fantastic job of hiding.

           Frank turns around, clearing his throat.

                                 FRANK
                        Sorry?

                                 MAUD
                        Well normally when I catch a man 
                        staring me down from head to toe, 
                        he at least has the decency to come 
                        say hello. 

                                 FRANK
                        Well I wasn’t -- what I mean is, I 
                        was simply just--

           There’s no fooling her. Frank gives in and puts out his hand.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hello. Miss...

                                 MAUD
                        Gage. Maud Gage.

                                 FRANK
                        Did you enjoy the show, Miss Gage?

           Maud takes the scotch from Frank, taking a sip.

                                 MAUD
                        If I’m being entirely truthful?

           She leans in to whisper.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        I thought it was a bore. 

                                 FRANK
                        A bore?
           Frank bites his tongue.

                                 MAUD
                        Well don’t get me wrong, I found 
                        the writing to be just fine. I’m 
                        sure Mr. Baum is a talented man. 
                        But where was the character? The 
                        beauty? The whole thing just seemed 
                        very much...unimaginative.

                                 FRANK
                        Unimaginative? Hmm. Interesting 
                        choice of words, Miss Gage. And if 
                        I’m being entirely truthful, I 
                        can’t say I disagree.

           Mr. Bristle approaches in a huff.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        There you are, sir. Thank you for, 
                        once again, abandoning me.

                                 FRANK
                        Pleasure as always.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        I see you’ve met Matilda’s girl. 
                        She’s quite the charmer ain’t she?

           Maud shakes his hand.

                                 MAUD
                        Mr. Bristle you make me blush.

           Bristle gives Frank a friendly pat on the back.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Well I’ll check in with ya later, 
                        Frank. Be sure to take it easy on 
                        the sauce. 

           As he walks away, we see the color leave Maud’s face. She 
           slowly begins to realize...

                                 MAUD
                        Frank? 

           Frank sports a proud grin, winking at Maud before walking 
           off.
                                 FRANK
                        Pardon me. I suppose I should 
                        retire to somewhere where I can be 
                        alone with my ugly, unimaginative 
                        thoughts. 

           Maud stands befuddled.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I do imagine we’ll be meeting 
                        again, Miss Gage.

           EXT. STREETS OF FAYETTEVILLE, NEW YORK - EVENING

           A BUGGY trots along the neighborhood street, its passengers 
           Frank and Maud. Sitting arm-in-arm.

                                 MAUD
                        Frank you’re sweating.

           Frank dabs his forehead with his handkerchief.

                                 FRANK
                        Please. Sweating implies fear and 
                        anxiousness. I’m perspiring. It’s a 
                        perfectly natural biological 
                        occurrence.

           The buggy stops outside of MATILDA GAGE’S HOUSE.

                                 MAUD
                        You have no reason to be nervous.

           Frank stepping out first, holding out his hand to help Maud 
           down.

                                 FRANK
                        Your mother’s a Suffragette, Maud. 
                        I have every reason to be nervous. 
                        She’s built to hate men like-- 
                        well, men in general. That doesn’t 
                        exactly put the odds in my favor.

           Maud gives Frank a calming kiss.

                                 MAUD
                        Act like yourself, and I’m sure 
                        she’ll love you as much as I do.

           Maud heads up to the very quaint, humble house.
                                 FRANK
                        Well that would hardly be 
                        appropriate.

           INT. MATILDA GAGE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Maud hugs her mother, MATILDA GAGE, 62. Her greying hair 
           pulled back just a little too tight. Eyebrows seem to be 
           locked in the unhappy position.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        So good to see you, dear.

           Maud takes Frank’s hand.

                                 MAUD
                        Ma, this is Frank. Frank, this is 
                        my mother. Matilda Gage. 

           Frank takes off his hat, bowing as he daintily shakes 
           Matilda’s hand.

                                 FRANK
                        It is the highest of pleasures, 
                        Miss Gage. 

           Like magic, he pulls a thin bouquet of yellow roses from 
           inside his coat, handing them to Matilda.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        For you. Beautiful flowers for a 
                        beautiful woman. 

           Matilda inspects the roses, still no smile. Some of them are 
           bent.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Come. Supper’s getting cold.

           She stomps off, leaving the two lovebirds in silence.

           INT. MATILDA GAGE’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - EVENING

           Frank, Maud, and Matilda sit around the table. A delicious 
           steaming hot pot roast, potatoes, steamed vegetables.

                                 FRANK
                        So, Miss Gage, how is the movement 
                        progressing as of late? I’ve been 
                        hearing promising things about this 
                        Susan B. Anthony character. 
           He scoops himself some veggies.

                                 MAUD
                        Mother, Frank was actually raised 
                        mostly by women. His older sisters 
                        took care of him while his dad was 
                        away. He’s quite the feminist 
                        himself.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Susan B. Anthony is a fraud. She’s 
                        just like the rest of those 
                        conservatives, arguing not that we 
                        deserve suffrage as a natural 
                        right, but simply because women’s 
                        “feminine morality” would influence 
                        legislation. That’s not feminism, 
                        it’s politics. Madness. 

           Matilda fuming, Frank glances across at Maud. Signalling for 
           help.

                                 MAUD
                        Did I tell you Frank’s writing 
                        something new?

           Frank droops his head. Not what he wanted.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Another play? Are you still doing 
                        any acting, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        No ma’am. Didn’t take me too long 
                        to discover I was much better 
                        suited for a career off the stage. 

           Maud pushes him to proceed. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m actually thinking about writing 
                        a book. More just a thought than 
                        anything else at the moment.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        A novel? Not much money in that I’d 
                        assume.

                                 MAUD
                        Mother.

           Matilda SNAPS at her daughter.
                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        You hush. If this man has the 
                        intention of marrying my daughter, 
                        I have every right to suggest he 
                        seek more logical, guaranteed 
                        employment.

                                 MAUD
                        Well, about that...

           Matilda raises a suspicious brow.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        Frank and I discussed heading to 
                        Aberdeen, when he’s finished 
                        touring with his play of course. 
                        Emily said she has plenty of room 
                        for us, and there’s work there.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        South Dakota? Do you really plan to 
                        abandon me as your sister did? I 
                        know I raised you better. 

                                 FRANK
                        Aberdeen’s quickly becoming the 
                        Chicago of the south. They say the 
                        streets are paved with gold.

           Matilda laughs at this.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Paved with gold, you say? Well then 
                        it’s a wonder people don’t dig up 
                        the roads and peddle the bricks.

                                 MAUD
                        It’s a metaphor, mother.

           Matilda wipes her mouth and calmly sets the napkin down on 
           the table. She stands, taking her plate into the kitchen.

                                 FRANK
                        See this? Now I’m sweating. 

           He wipes his forehead clean.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Probably wise we didn’t tell her 
                        you’re pregnant.

           We hear a plate SHATTER in the kitchen. Yeah, she heard.
           EXT. MATILDA GAGE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Maud already inside the buggy, waving goodbye to her mother.

           Frank approaches Matilda with caution as she stands in her 
           doorway.

                                 FRANK
                        Miss Gage, I’d just like to--

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        You might have everyone else 
                        fooled, Mr. Baum. But I, sir, am no 
                        fool. Behind the charm and the 
                        rather colorful vocabulary I know 
                        exactly what you are. A coward. And 
                        a coward is no match for my Maud. I 
                        want you to remember that. 

           With that, Frank still politely tips his hat, heading back to 
           the buggy. The walk of a defeated man.

           EXT. STREETS OF ABERDEEN - DAY

           Aberdeen, South Dakota. 1889.

           The roads may not be paved with gold, but they are at least 
           paved. It’s a real, bustling city. Loud. Hope and optimism 
           flooding the streets.

           Frank and Maud in their BUGGY, pushing through traffic. 

           Maud holds a baby boy, ROBERT, in her arms. And FRANK JOSLYN 
           BAUM (or JUNIOR), 9, pops out from the backseat. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Is this it, pa? Are we here?

           Frank looks ahead at the city before him.

                                 FRANK
                        This is it, junior. Aberdeen. We’ve 
                        made it. We’re home.

           Street lamps, a drugstore, church, tavern, railroad station. 
           ABERDEEN CITIZENS going about their business.

           Frank pays special attention to an empty, rundown storefront.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I don’t see what’s so special about 
                        this place.
                                 FRANK
                        You don’t? Really? Hm. Look closer.

           FROM FRANK’S POV -- streets in a celebratory ruckus. Everyone 
           waving excitedly at the Baums, glad they’ve arrived. A FIRE 
           JUGGLER on the corner, the horses all a different color. The 
           road made of yellow bricks. 

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           The Baum’s buggy pulls up outside the old wooden fence.

           The paint peeling off the grey farmhouse. Surrounded by the 
           vast grey prairie. Grey skies. Lots of grey. Even the tall 
           grass looks more grey than green.

           A pig pen, stable for the horses. The tornado cellar close 
           by.

           EMILY GAGE opens the front door, watching Baum’s skip towards 
           the farmhouse. She’s 40, but looks 50. Thin and gaunt, the 
           red gone from her cheeks. A woman worn and tired.

           Maud smiles at the sight of her sister.

                                 MAUD
                        Em.

           Running to give her a great big hug.

                                 EMILY
                        My dear baby sister. You haven’t 
                        the slightest idea how glad I am 
                        that you’re here. All of you. 

                                 FRANK
                        Good to see you again, Emily. This 
                        place -- why it’s a palace like no 
                        other. Thank you for allowing us to 
                        invade it.

           Junior laughs at his father. 

                                 EMILY
                        Invading? Please. My palace is your 
                        palace. Although I’m not sure if we 
                        have room for this GIANT over here.

           Emily lifts up Junior and spins him around in the air. 
           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           The Baum family looks around the dusty farmhouse, getting 
           their bearings. Settling in.

           The kitchen basically an extension of the main room. A 
           cookstove, cupboard for the dishes. Pretty standard.

           Frank looks OUT THE WINDOW into the yard. A SWING hanging 
           from the tallest tree. 

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - FRANK AND MAUD’S ROOM - DAY

           Frank plops his plaid suitcase onto the rickety bed. Opening 
           it up to reveal his TYPEWRITER. The same one from when he was 
           a kid. Still in good condition. He runs his fingers across 
           the keys, then shuts the case.

           He takes a seat on the bed. The room as bland as they come.

           Frank massages his chest a bit, until he hears a MUFFLED 
           SNEEZE. Coming from inside the closet.

                                 FRANK
                        Bless you?

           Curious, he quietly steps towards the closet. Cautiously 
           opening the door--

           Revealing a pair of little legs, hidden behind the hanging 
           clothes. 

           He pushes away the clothes to find DOROTHY GAGE, 7. Her face 
           pale and quiet. Cute little pigtails with bows to match her 
           sky blue blouse. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Why hello there.

           No response from Dorothy. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Pleasure to make your acquaintance, 
                        young miss.

           He puts out his hand, but it just sits there.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hmm. Strange. What is so incredibly 
                        fascinating inside of that closet 
                        that you won’t come out? Is it 
                        treasure? Are you hoarding it all 
                        for yourself?
           The girl shakes her head.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Or perhaps it’s something out here 
                        that you’re hiding from. There must 
                        be evil afoot, yes? The very same 
                        evil that rendered you unable to 
                        speak.

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        I see you’ve met Dorothy.

           Emily throws a couple blankets onto the bed, approaching her 
           little girl.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy my love, why don’t you go 
                        and help your cousin unpack. He’s 
                        in your room. 

           A kiss from her mother, Dorothy skips out of the room.

                                 FRANK
                        I do hope I didn’t frighten her.

                                 EMILY
                        No. No you didn’t do a thing. She’s 
                        barely said a word since -- well 
                        since her daddy passed on. Poor 
                        girl. 

           Frank stares off out the door.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I feel like she’s off in 
                        her own little world. Y’all being 
                        here might do her some good. 

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DINING AREA - EVENING

           The family all around the table enjoying a modest meal of 
           ham. Likely one of those pigs from out back.

                                 EMILY
                        So how’s ma doing?

           She passes the veggies to her sister.

                                 MAUD
                        She’s--
                                 FRANK
                        As delightful as ever. I think that 
                        woman’s finally starting to warm to 
                        me. Really I do.

           Maud and Emily can’t help but laugh.

                                 MAUD
                        Last I heard, she was going off to 
                        New York for another one of her 
                        idealistic marches. 

           As Maud and Emily talk, we see Frank rearranging the food on 
           his plate.

           He folds his ham over, like a mouth. Giving it eyes with 
           carrots, a snout with a broccoli stem. Turning his plate 
           towards the kids. 

                                 FRANK
                        Children, I don’t mean to alarm 
                        you. But I fear this pig - Sir 
                        Oinks a lot - has returned from 
                        beyond the grave to seek 
                        retribution for this delicious meal 
                        we’re enjoying.

           Frank makes PIG NOISES, puppeteering the ham.

           Both children go into a giggle fit, Junior stabbing the pig’s 
           carrot eye and chewing it up.

                                 EMILY
                        And what about you, Frank? What do 
                        you intend to do for work here in 
                        Aberdeen?

                                 MAUD
                        Didn’t I tell you, Em? Frank’s 
                        going to be writing a book. Heaven 
                        know’s he’s got the mind for it. 
                        And Aberdeen’s the perfect place to 
                        draw inspiration--

                                 FRANK
                        I actually, well I saw an open 
                        storefront back in town. Been 
                        thinking about maybe opening up a 
                        shop of my own. I’ve got a few 
                        ideas. 

           Maud appears disappointed by this, staring down at her plate.
           EXT. STREETS OF ABERDEEN - DAY

           Frank stands in the middle of the street.

           He’s staring up at the old, empty rundown storefront we saw 
           before. Sandwiched between the ABERDEEN TAVERN and the 
           drugstore. The place definitely a fixer-upper.

           Spacing out until a buggy nearly runs him over.

           INT. EMPTY STOREFRONT - DAY

           Frank walks through the abandoned space. Thick layers of dust 
           covering every surface, broken furniture, shards of glass on 
           the floor. He looks around, closing his eyes. 

           FROM FRANK’S POV -- the place now filled with magic. CHILDREN 
           running rampant. Jars and jars of colorful candies for sale, 
           rare antiquities and knickknacks, toys, the room covered in 
           royal silks. Majestic.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. This will do just fine.

           INT. ABERDEEN TAVERN - DAY

           Frank stands at the bar, signaling the elderly BARTENDER.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What’ll it be, sir?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, um -- how’s about a milk?

           The bartender gives Frank the look of “are you serious?” 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Whiskey then.

           The tavern’s as grimy as they come. The walls cracked and 
           crumbling. Filled with Burly BAR FOLK who look like they 
           could start a brawl at any second. It wreaks of testosterone. 

           Now holding his drink, Frank nearly passes out at the mere 
           smell of it.

           Something gets his attention. A POSTER on the wall. He 
           approaches it, reading...

           ANNUAL BROWN COUNTY FAIR! ONE WEEK ONLY!
           But it’s not the words that stand out. It’s the artwork. 
           There’s a colorful life to it, a richness. Character. 
           Drawings of a lion, monkeys, elephants.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        What do ya think?

           Frank finds a drunken, plump man standing beside him. His 
           greasy hair parted down the middle. This man is WILLIAM 
           WALLACE (W.W.) DENSLOW, 40.

                                 FRANK
                        Pardon?

                                 WILLIAM
                        The poster. How does it make you 
                        feel?

                                 FRANK
                        Well truth be told, it makes me 
                        feel like attending the Brown 
                        County Fair. Though I’ve always 
                        been partial to fairs myself.

           Frank puts out his hand.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Frank Baum.

           The drunken William nearly toppling over as he returns the 
           gesture.

                                 WILLIAM
                        William Denslow. And the poster’s 
                        garbage, by the way. Nothing more 
                        than a children’s doodle.

           Frank spots the signature “W.W. DENSLOW” at the bottom of the 
           poster.

                                 FRANK
                        Nothing more, Mr. Denslow? I have 
                        children, sir. And no disrespect to 
                        them but they couldn’t dream of 
                        producing such lively drawings. 
                        They jump out at you, don’t they? 
                        I’d like to meet that lion. I’d 
                        like to ride on the back of that 
                        elephant.  

           William’s touched.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m working on setting up an 
                        establishment here in Aberdeen. The 
                        likes of which this town has never 
                        seen. I could surely use some 
                        advertisement like this one here. 

           William throws his arm around Frank, raising his glass.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, next round’s on me!

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Frank’s made somewhat of a makeshift office in the corner of 
           the main room just beside the window. A small wooden desk, a 
           few filing cabinets.

           He’s writing a list, things for the store. Focused, until 
           Junior comes running into the room.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Pa?

                                 FRANK
                        Old pa’s working, Junior. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Aunt Em said I could take one of 
                        the horses out for a ride. But she 
                        said you had to come with me.

                                 FRANK
                        Did she now? Well you tell your 
                        Aunt Em I’m working on something 
                        very important.

           Junior’s head falls, disappointed as he walks away.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Junior stops.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what. I’ll take you out 
                        before sundown. Alright? That’s a 
                        Baum guarantee. 

           The boy’s demeanor switches, excitedly running off. 

           Frank leans back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. Tired. He 
           looks out the window. 
           Dorothy’s in the yard by her lonesome, sitting on the swing. 

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - YARD - DAY

           On the swing, Dorothy gently rocks back and forth. Staring up 
           at the clouds.

           Frank heads her way.

                                 FRANK
                        Good day, lady Dorothy.

           No response as usual.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        And what are we looking at on this 
                        beautiful afternoon?

           Frank stands beside her, staring up at the clouds. One in the 
           shape of a DONKEY.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Ah, yes. Of course. The wise 
                        Donkey. I’ve had the displeasure of 
                        encountering him on more than a few 
                        occasions. Do you know what makes 
                        him so wise?

           Dorothy shakes her head.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Well rumor has it that one day he 
                        got so hungry that he started 
                        raiding libraries, eating all the 
                        books in sight. He consumed so many 
                        books that he suddenly knew all of 
                        their contents. Quite the know-it-
                        all if you ask me.

           Frank steps behind the swing.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        May I?

           She nods, Frank beginning to push her.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I see the mysterious evildoer is 
                        still holding your voice captive. 
                        We’ll see what we can’t do about 
                        that. 

           Dorothy’s swings higher and higher with each push.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps it’s hidden up there 
                        somewhere. Maybe if I swing you 
                        high enough, up past the clouds, 
                        you could go and retrieve it. How 
                        does that sound? 

           Dorothy laughs as she swings VERY high now. It looks as if 
           she’s actually touching the clouds, eclipsing the sun with 
           each swing.

           FROM FRANK’S POV -- A HOT AIR BALLOON floats in the sky, 
           through the clouds. It’s Professor C.C. Coe’s. Focusing on 
           the name written across it:

           “THE NEW WORLD”

           INT. ABERDEEN TAVERN - EVENING

           Frank and William sit at a table, working. The table 
           cluttered with papers, books, empty glasses.

           William’s busy sketching. He holds up his drawing to show 
           Frank.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How’s this?

           Just rough sketch, the words “BAUM’S BAZAAR” written across 
           it.

                                 FRANK
                        Getting there. We want to convey a 
                        level of rarity and uniqueness 
                        these folks have never seen. 
                        Bohemian glass, Chinese lanterns, 
                        gourmet chocolates and exotic 
                        candies. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Do folks really want that sort of 
                        stuff?

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE (O.S.)
                        Well would you look at these here 
                        ladies.

           A growling beast of a man stands over the table. RAK THE 
           TERRIBLE, 40s. A typical, spittin, dirty American cowboy. 

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE (CONT’D)
                        Hope y’all are enjoyin your tea 
                        time.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Leave us be, Rak.

           Rak snatches away William’s poster sketch.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        Aw what’s this? Denslow’s making 
                        himself a pretty little picture?

           Rak rips the poster into two, the pieces falling to the 
           floor.

           Frank stands.

                                 FRANK
                        Now excuse me, sir. I don’t think-- 

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        I don’t think I was talkin to you, 
                        fancy boy. Heck I don’t think I’ve 
                        ever even seen you round here 
                        before.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s because I’m a ghost, as it 
                        were. The ghost of the man you 
                        killed with your wretched breath 
                        and pitiful hygiene, come back to 
                        haunt you.

           Rak LUNGES across the table and grabs Frank by the collar of 
           his shirt.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        Hygiene?! You tryin to confuse me 
                        with all those fancy words, fancy 
                        boy? How’s about you put some fight 
                        behind those words and we take this 
                        outside?

           Frank doesn’t respond, he’s sweating up a storm.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. That’s what I thought. You’re 
                        nothin but a fast-talkin yellow-
                        belly. 

           Rak releases his grip. He SPITS on the floor before stomping 
           off.

                                 FRANK
                        Who was that pleasant fella? 

           Frank rubs his chest, his heart pounding fast.
                                 WILLIAM
                        That there is Rak the Terrible. 

                                 FRANK
                        Terrible? You don’t say.

                                 WILLIAM
                        People say when Rak’s in a fight, 
                        he gets so angry he turns into a 
                        dragon the size of a hundred men. 
                        Glowing red eyes, breathing a fiery 
                        smoke.

           FROM FRANK’S POV -- Rak’s over across the tavern laughing it 
           up with his DRUNKEN GANG. Rak turns back to Frank, his eyes a 
           piercing red. Wide pointed wings on his back, smoke rising 
           from his nostrils.

           INT. BAUM’S BAZAAR - DAY

           The place is coming along very nicely, almost ready for 
           opening day. William, Maud, Emily, Junior, and Dorothy 
           perusing the store. Some of the NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS, Junior’s 
           friends, come and go.

           The walls freshly painted, the shelves all stocked up. Glass 
           figurines, toys, candies, strange costumes. There’s a real 
           life to it.

                                 MAUD
                        Well it sure is something, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Something marvelous? Stupendous? 
                        Extraordinary?

                                 MAUD
                        It’s...something.

           Frank pulls a glass CHINA DOLL from behind the counter.

                                 FRANK
                        See this? I Had these glass dolls 
                        flown in from France. They’re all 
                        the rage there, and I have no doubt 
                        that every single child of Aberdeen 
                        will want one sitting on their 
                        bedside table. 

           Frank hands the china doll off to Maud, walking away.
                                 MAUD
                             (to the doll)
                        I suppose you are a cute little 
                        thing. Fragile, but cute.

           Frank catches Dorothy in the costume section, eyeing a pair 
           of SILVER SLIPPERS. Sparkling from every angle.

                                 FRANK
                        Aha. You have fine taste, lady 
                        Dorothy. Fine taste indeed.

           He approaches her, picking up the slippers.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I see you’ve stumbled upon the 
                        crown jewel of Baum’s Bazaar. Would 
                        you like to try them on?

           Dorothy nods.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Dorothy emerges from behind the changing curtain with the 
           shimmering slippers on her feet.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        My oh my. Would you look at that. 
                        Perfection. It’s as if those 
                        slippers were meant to be on those 
                        little feet of yours. Why I 
                        wouldn’t be surprised if they had 
                        the name Dorothy Gage written 
                        across the bottom. 

           Dorothy lifts up her foot to look at the bottom, nothing 
           there.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Written in invisible ink I’d 
                        presume. 

           Dorothy stands in front of the mirror, checking herself out. 
           Modeling her feet. She likes what she sees. She waves for her 
           mother and Maud to take a look.

                                 MAUD
                        Well don’t you look just like a 
                        little princess, Dorothy.
                                 EMILY
                        They’re very pretty, Frank. But I’m 
                        afraid there’s just not enough room 
                        in our closet for another pair of 
                        shoes.

                                 FRANK
                        Another pair of shoes? Another pair 
                        of shoes?! Emily Gage, you 
                        disappoint me. Do you not recognize 
                        these?  

           Emily looks to Maud. She hasn’t the slightest clue. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Why, these are the enchanted silver 
                        slippers of an all powerful 
                        sorceress. 

           This revelation draws in Junior and some of the other kids, 
           all gathered around.

                                 JUNIOR
                        A sorceress, pa?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s right.
                             (whispers to Dorothy)
                        Perhaps the same sorceress that 
                        stole that voice of yours?

           Frank steps up onto a little wooden stool, talking down to 
           his captive audience.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Now how they got here I haven’t the 
                        slightest idea. But I can guarantee 
                        you that the sorceress will go to 
                        great lengths to get them back.

           Maud watches with a smile.

                                 MAUD
                        What do they do? 

                                 FRANK
                        Well I’m glad you asked, Maud. You 
                        see, these slippers possess a 
                        magical power. The power to take 
                        their wearer and - in the blink of 
                        an eye - transport them to anywhere 
                        they wish.
           The kids all whisper amongst themselves, Frank kneeling down 
           to address Dorothy.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, in order for the slippers 
                        to work I need you to do something 
                        for me. I need you to close your 
                        eyes, click your heels together, 
                        and think of where you’d like to 
                        go. Anywhere in the world. 
                        Someplace you’ve always dreamed of 
                        visiting. Can you do that?

           Dorothy nods, closing her eyes. Everyone else quiet in 
           anticipation.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)

           Dorothy clicks her heels once.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)

           Twice.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)

           Three times. 

           Frank SNAPS his fingers. Dorothy opening her eyes to find 
           herself in--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. THE NEW WORLD - DAY

           FROM DOROTHY’S POV -- Dorothy looks around. Taking in her 
           surroundings. A land of marvelous beauty.

           Sprawling jungles from left to right, banks of gorgeous 
           flowers. The SINGING of some rare, exotic birds fluttering in 
           the distance.

           She looks up, a rainbow across the clear blue sky. Closing 
           her eyes again, and--

           INT. BAUM’S BAZAAR - DAY

           We’re back. Dorothy opening her eyes to find herself again 
           surrounded by her family and neighborhood kids.
                                 FRANK
                        Well how about that. They worked. I 
                        can tell.

           Some CHUBBY KID obnoxiously shouts out.

                                 CHUBBY KID
                        But she didn’t go nowhere. She was 
                        here the whole time.

                                 FRANK
                        Well to you and I it might appear 
                        that way. But to Dorothy, well I 
                        imagine she was in a place of 
                        extraordinary wonder. 

           Dorothy smiles.

                                 EMILY
                        As lovely as those slippers are, 
                        Frank, we really can’t afford them.

                                 FRANK
                        Money is no factor, my dear. It’s 
                        out of my hands. There they are, 
                        and there they’ll stay.

           Frank gives a knowing wink to his niece, the rest of the kids 
           still reeling with excitement.

           EXT. ABERDEEN SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY

           A group of STUDENTS come running out from the small, free-
           standing schoolhouse. Freedom.

           Junior heads down the dirt road.

                                 ROY (O.S.)
                        Frank.

           Junior turns around to find ROY - the tallest, dirtiest boy 
           in class - and a couple of his simple-minded FRIENDS. Right 
           on his tail.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Oh. Hi, Roy.

                                 ROY
                        That’s it? Just hi? You oughta 
                        treat me with a little more 
                        respect, Baum.

           Junior just keeps on walking.
                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        How’s your daddy’s little store 
                        doin?

           Again, no response from Junior. Roy and the others running to 
           catch up.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        HEY I’M TALKIN TO YOU BOY.

           Roy SHOVES Junior, his books falling to the ground.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        My old man says the store’s gonna 
                        come a cropper in under a month. 
                        You know what else? My old man says 
                        your daddy ain’t nothin but a 
                        deadbeat, flannel mouth yellow-
                        belly.

           This stops Junior in his tracks. He turns around to face Roy, 
           the two of them practically touching noses.

           But Junior simply picks up his books and walks off.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Like father like son I suppose.

           That’s it. Junior throws his books to the ground and CHARGES 
           at Roy.

           Before he can even take a swing Roy pushes him to the ground. 
           On top of Junior, WHALING on him. One punch after another. 
           The other boys cheering him on.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Maud stands at the sink, washing dishes.

           She looks up out the window, Frank sitting on the swing out 
           in the yard.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - YARD - DAY

           Frank gently rocks back and forth on the swing, staring up at 
           the sky. Maud walking towards him.

                                 MAUD
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 FRANK
                        The shop.
           Maud squeezes in next to him on the swing, practically 
           sitting on his lap.

                                 MAUD
                        What are you really thinking about?

           She knows him well.

                                 FRANK
                        That little girl’s been through a 
                        lot. Too much. I just wish there 
                        was something we could do.

                                 MAUD
                        You’re doing more than you know, 
                        Frank.

           Maud rests her head on Frank’s shoulder.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        That story about the slippers. I’ve 
                        never heard anything like it. If 
                        you’re able to bring that much joy 
                        to one child, imagine what you’d 
                        bring to the world.

           He knows what she’s up to.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re clever, but not more clever 
                        than I. Things are different than 
                        they were nine years ago. My only 
                        concern is to make certain this 
                        family is taken care of. For now 
                        and for always.

           Hand-in-hand, the two now stare up at the sky together.

           INT. BAUM’S BAZAAR - DAY

           The place is packed. ABERDEEN PATRONS flood the store. 
           Families of all shapes and sizes. All very interested in the 
           merchandise, inspecting it curiously. The glass dolls, 
           lanterns, flamboyant costumes.

           Frank and William stand behind the counter, watching the 
           rush.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (whispering)
                        How come nobody ain’t buyin nothin, 
                        Frank? They’re all just lookin.
                                 FRANK
                        Give ‘em time. It’s likely all 
                        these newfangled products are just 
                        a lot for folks to comprehend. 
                        It’ll all be flyin off the shelves 
                        in no time.

           Frank spots Maud entering the store, then quickly tries to 
           make himself look busy.

                                 MAUD
                        Good heavens. Just look at this 
                        crowd. How many sales have you made 
                        so far? Dozens I’m guessing.

           Frank’s tries to cover up his excessive perspiration.

                                 FRANK
                        How -- how many? Well, you know how 
                        it is, dear. Been somewhat 
                        difficult to keep track. I’d have 
                        to count up the money. Though I’d 
                        wager we’ve had about--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Zero ain’t a difficult number to 
                        calculate. We’ve had zero sales.  

           Frank gives William the look of death...just moments before 
           he realizes what he’s done.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Did I say zero? What I meant to say 
                        was zero to the power of ten. 
                        Which...I’m nows slowly realizing 
                        would also, in fact, be zero.
                             (off a WOMAN scanning the 
                              shelves)
                        What’s that? You’d like some help, 
                        ma’am? No trouble at all.

           He smoothly removes himself from the conversation.

                                 FRANK
                        We’ll be just fine, Maud. Trust me.

                                 MAUD
                        I always do.

           Maud heads for the door, turning back to Frank.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and Frank. Happy Birthday.
           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DINING AREA - EVENING

           BURNING CANDLES ON A BIRTHDAY CAKE the only light in the 
           room. The family sitting around the table, singing to Frank.

                                 MAUD/EMILY/JUNIOR
                        Happy Birthday to you, Happy 
                        Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, 
                        dear Frank. Happy Birthday to you.

           The family claps. Frank hovering over the cake for a moment 
           before blowing out the candles.

                                 JUNIOR
                        What’d you wish for, pa?

           Curiously, junior’s got a hat on.

                                 FRANK
                        Well if I tell ya then it’s never 
                        gonna come true.

           Emily hands a newspaper-wrapped gift to Frank.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Em...

                                 EMILY
                        Well it’s not from me. It’s from 
                        Dorothy. 

           He looks across the table to Dorothy.

                                 FRANK
                        I see. Let’s see what we have here.

           Frank unwraps the gift. Pulling back the paper, to reveal-- 

           A LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.

           He opens it up, skimming the pages. Every one of them blank.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hmm. Not exactly a page turner is 
                        it, Dorothy?

           Dorothy gets up from her chair and walks around the table. 
           Standing beside Frank, she runs her finger across an empty 
           page of the book.

                                 MAUD
                        Don’t you see, Frank? She wants you 
                        to fill them in. It appears she’s 
                        out-clevered both of us.
           Getting a little choked up, Frank shuts the book, setting it 
           down on the table.

                                 FRANK
                        Well then. Who’s next?

           Junior hands an envelope off to his mother.

                                 MAUD
                        These are from Junior and I.

           Frank opens up the envelope, pulling out a stack of FIVE 
           TICKETS: 

           COME ONE, COME ALL. THE BROWN COUNTY FAIR. ADMIT ONE. 

           EXT. BROWN COUNTY FAIR - DAY

           A sight to behold. Rows and rows of game booths line the 
           field, big top tents, stagecoaches, ANIMALS in cages.

           KIDS AND FAMILIES running around, enjoying the gorgeous day. 

           The Baum’s walk as a family. Junior and Dorothy enjoying 
           cotton candy, Maud pushing Robert in the stroller.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Pa, why do you think it is they 
                        keep the monkeys all caged up like 
                        that? They’ve got no room to move.

           They stop at the MONKEY CAGES. The loud, wild primates with 
           little room to swing around.

                                 FRANK
                        Why do they keep the monkeys in a 
                        cage? Well that’s simple.

           Junior and Dorothy both wait for an answer.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        So they don’t fly away.

           The kids laugh at this.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What’s so funny?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Monkeys can’t fly.
                                 FRANK
                        No? You seem awfully sure about 
                        that. Have you ever seen a monkey 
                        outside of a cage?

           Junior and Dorothy look at one another, both shaking their 
           heads.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Then I rest my case. 

           The others walk off, Frank straggling behind a bit. He looks 
           back to the cage. 

           FROM FRANK’S POV -- the monkeys DO have wings. They’re 
           vicious, mouths watering. Clawing to break free of the cage. 
           Creatures not to be meddled with.

           PONY RIDES

           One of those rigs where the ponies walk around in a circle. 
           Maud walks alongside little Robert as he rides one of them. 
           Emily doing the same with Dorothy.

           Frank helps Junior up onto a pony.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Up you go, boy.

           But his foot gets all tangled up in the saddle, causing him 
           to FALL TO THE GROUND. Flat on his back, hat fallen off.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Junior!

           Frank rushes to his side, helping him to his feet. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I think that pony’s got it out for 
                        you. 

           As Frank picks Junior’s hat up from the mud, he notices 
           something on his son’s face. 

           A great big black and blue shiner over his right eye.

           Realizing, Junior snatches the hat from his father and puts 
           it back on his head, slightly covering up the bruise.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Let’s you and I take a little walk.

           He puts his arm around his son, the two of them walking off.
           BY THE LION CAGES

           Father and son stroll through the fair grounds, Junior with 
           his head down.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        So...care to share where you got 
                        that nifty little battle scar?

           Silence from Junior.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        There’s no shame in it. Heck when I 
                        was young and your grandparents 
                        shipped me off to the academy, I 
                        had my whole soul and spirit beaten 
                        outta me at least twice a day.

                                 JUNIOR
                        It don’t matter none. I’m just 
                        fine.

           Junior avoids eye contact. Some attitude there.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh? Fine. Alright. No matter if you 
                        keep comin home lookin like that. 
                        I’m sure your mother would love to 
                        have a walking, talking blueberry 
                        for a son.

           Junior stops.

                                 JUNIOR
                        There’s this boy at school. Roy. 
                        Gives me a hard time every now and 
                        then. That’s all. 

           Frank gets on his knee, eye-to-eye with Junior.

                                 FRANK
                        He did this to you?

           Junior nods.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You know how I feel about fightin.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Pa, he called you a deadbeat, 
                        flannel-mouthed yellow-belly.
           Frank’s taken by surprise. A little hurt.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh.

           He stands, walking over to the lion cage.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I should’ve tried harder.

           Frank just stares at the beautiful, golden LION. The animal 
           laying down in its cage, locking eyes with Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        You see this lion?

           Junior stands at Frank’s side.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Look at him. Those eyes. Those 
                        teeth. Strong enough to rip the 
                        limbs right out of their sockets 
                        without thinking twice about it. 
                        King of the forest indeed. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        So?

           Frank bends down, meeting Junior’s eye line.

                                 FRANK
                        So behind those teeth, behind those 
                        eyes, the crown -- is a coward. 
                        There’s not a living thing on this 
                        Earth that isn’t afraid when it 
                        faces danger. All you need, son, is 
                        confidence. If you’ve got that, 
                        well then it don’t matter a dime 
                        what anyone else says. 

           He tussles Juniors hair.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Now go on. Those pony’s won’t ride 
                        themselves.

           Junior runs off.

           Dusting himself off, Frank stands, turning to the lion cage 
           once more. 

           Leaning in close, too close, addressing the beast.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Sorry for putting you on the spot 
                        like that. Thanks for the help, 
                        though. Your majesty.

           Oddly enough, the lion WINKS at Frank. 

           EXT. BROWN COUNTY FAIR - EVENING

           An array of beautiful FIREWORKS light up the night sky. 
           Explosions of color -- reds, blues, purples. Just over the 
           fair grounds.

           The fair crowd watches in awe from the grass.

           Frank with his arm around Maud, Robert in her lap.

                                 FRANK
                        So, William’s got a friend that 
                        sells china for Pitkin and Brooks. 
                        Lord knows we could use the extra 
                        income.  

                                 MAUD
                        Traveling sales? What about the 
                        shop?

           Frank’s not sure how to respond to this.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        I suppose that means you’d be away 
                        a lot. 

           Frank gives Maud a reassuring kiss on the forehead. Though 
           she’s not convinced.

           MUSIC PLAYS from the nearby stage. Drums and fast-paced 
           violins. A crowd gathered around.

           Frank pulls Maud up to her feet.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        Frank what are you up to?

                                 FRANK
                        Shhh. Trust me.

           He drags her off towards the excitement, then up onto the 
           stage. 
           They’re the only ones up there. He bows to Maud, very 
           gallant, before taking her hand. The two of the dancing to 
           the music. Happy as can be.

           As the music slows, the couple bows to the audience, people 
           CLAPPING.

           Looking out onto the fair from the wooden platform, Frank 
           signals for the music to cease, addressing the crowd.

           Maud takes a step back, embarrassed. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, boys and 
                        girls, animals of every kind. Other 
                        unspecified creatures of the Brown 
                        County Fair -- let us celebrate.

           The family - Dorothy, Junior, Emily - watches in amusement.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        For this, good people of Aberdeen, 
                        is the first annual royal ball of 
                        one princess Dorothy Gage. And what 
                        type of ball would it be without a 
                        ceremonial dance?

           He points to the Dorothy.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Princess Dorothy, would you do me 
                        the honor of joining me up here? 

           Dorothy’s nervous, all eyes on her.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Please, feel inclined to allow the 
                        rest of your royal court to 
                        accompany you.

           Emily takes Dorothy by the hand, heading up towards the 
           stage. Junior following.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (to the band)
                        Make it a catchy one, fellas.

           Dorothy and the others now joining him up on stage. Frank 
           taking the girl’s hand. Emily with Junior, Maud with Robert.

           The music BEGINS. A rather jolly melody, the family dancing 
           all across the stage. In their own little world.
           The crowd gains interest, many of them joining the family up 
           on the stage, some just dancing on the grass. A ball indeed. 

           THE FAIR TRANSFORMS -- right before our very eyes. The big 
           tents and cages melt away. The music growing louder, the 
           crowd bigger, as we find ourselves inside a-- 

           INT. CASTLE BALLROOM - EVENING

           Dorothy really IS a princess. A gorgeous blue gown, tiara, 
           her silver slippers shining. Frank dapper in his tux and top 
           hat. The ceiling miles high with a glittering chandelier. 

           The creatures of the fair fill the room, watching everyone 
           dance in perfect unison. The LION, FLYING MONKEYS. 

           The smile on Dorothy’s face can’t be matched. Like she’s 
           floating on air. Until out of nowhere, her face turns pale, 
           losing her footing.

           Dorothy FALLS TO THE GROUND. Passed out. 

           Frank and the rest of the family rushing to her side...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BROWN COUNTY FAIR - EVENING

           Back on the stage, the fair crowd stands over the unconscious 
           Dorothy. 

                                 FRANK
                        Everyone please step back.

           They do.

                                 EMILY
                        Dorothy?

           Frank leans over, putting his ear to her chest.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Is she breathing? Dorothy?!

           Emily hugs her daughter, tears in her eyes.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Dorothy lays in bed, all tucked in. Eyes closed, a washcloth 
           on her forehead. Emily sits beside her, holding her hand.
           DOCTOR SMITH, round and greying, packs up his supplies. 

                                 DOCTOR SMITH
                        It’s difficult in these situations 
                        to make an entirely conclusive 
                        diagnosis, Miss Gage. Girl this 
                        young, sometimes these things come 
                        and go.

           Emily seems hopeful.

                                 DOCTOR SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes they don’t. But it’s 
                        probably best not to worry her. For 
                        the time being, we’ll treat this 
                        like any moderate chest cold.     

                                 EMILY
                        Thank you, doctor. 

           The doctor grabs his medical kit and heads for the door, 
           stopping to rest his hand on Emily’s shoulder.

                                 DOCTOR SMITH
                        Make sure she gets her rest.

           He leaves.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DINING AREA - EVENING

           Frank and Maud sit at the table, consoling a tired Emily. 
           Each with a cup of tea. 

                                 MAUD
                        She’s a warrior, Em. Giver her a 
                        week, two...she’ll get through 
                        this. Junior had the same thing a 
                        couple years back. Isn’t that 
                        right, Frank?

           Frank’s silent. He takes off his hat, scratching his head. He 
           then gets up and walks off. 

           A door SLAMMING down the hall. 

                                 EMILY
                        I can’t do this on my own. Who’s 
                        gonna tend to the farm?

                                 MAUD
                        You’re not on your own. 
                                 EMILY
                        That’s sweet of you, Maud. But 
                        you’ve got your two boys to deal 
                        with.

                                 MAUD
                        Three, actually.

           The two sisters share a much needed laugh.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        So what exactly are you suggesting?

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           A KNOCK at the front door.

           Emily and Maud opening it to reveal their mother, Matilda, as 
           grey and uptight as ever. Luggage in tow. 

                                 EMILY
                        Hey, ma.

           Both girls give their mother a hug.

                                 MAUD
                        How was New York?

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Where is she? 

           She doesn’t waste any time.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - DAY

           Matilda feels Dorothy’s forehead. The girl’s eyes are open 
           now, some of the color returned to her face.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        How are you feeling, dear?

           As usual, no response from Dorothy. Matilda sets a small 
           suitcase down onto the bedside table, opening it up. All 
           sorts of VIALS, medicines and remedies. 

                                 EMILY
                        What are those?

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Only every newfangled treatment I 
                        could bring back with me from the 
                        big city.
           She leans down to Dorothy.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        Can you tell me what’s ailing you, 
                        pretty one?

           Still nothing.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t speak?

           Maud and Emily aren’t sure how to respond.

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Well she can’t speak.

           Frank lurks in the doorway.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Her voice was stolen by a wicked 
                        sorceress, you see. We’ve been 
                        trying desperately to get it back, 
                        but, alas. No such luck thus far. 

                                 MAUD
                        Frank...

           Dorothy shows a glimmer of a smile.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Hello, Frank. I see you haven’t 
                        changed one bit.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh I’d imagine that’s not entirely 
                        true. My moustache is fuller. 

           The girls can’t help but giggle.

           EXT. ABERDEEN SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY

           The other kids gone, Junior skips out from the schoolhouse, 
           down the dirt path.

                                 ROY (O.S.)
                        Frank.

           Roy was waiting for him.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Heard that little cousin of yours 
                        is sick.
           Junior continues to walk, ignoring him.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        That’s too bad. Didn’t think FREAK 
                        was contagious.

           Frank approaches from down the road. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Say somethin, Baum!

           Roy SHOVES Junior from behind.

                                 FRANK
                        Gentlemen.

           Both boys are surprised to see Frank, Roy especially so.

                                 ROY
                        Oh. Good afternoon, Mr. Baum.

                                 FRANK
                        Glad to see you boys getting along 
                        so splendidly. Tell me, how was 
                        school? I sure hope you stimulated 
                        those brains of yours. You only get 
                        one of them. 

           Not even making eye contact with his father, Junior walks 
           away.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Let’s go, pa.

           He heads off down the road. Now just the two of them, Frank 
           bends down to address Roy eye-to-eye.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s Roy, yes?

           Roy nods.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You seem like a clever boy, Roy. A 
                        real solid head on your shoulders, 
                        tall, well-mannered. I’d just feel 
                        awful if something were to happen 
                        to you.  

                                 ROY
                        Happen? What do you--
                                 FRANK
                        OH not by my hands, no. No I’d 
                        never suggest such a horrid notion. 
                        I’m a pacifist. But this woman I 
                        know, well -- she’s a witch.  

                                 ROY
                        A witch?

                                 FRANK
                        A witch. Normally I wouldn’t waste 
                        my time with such a warning, but 
                        the sad fact is, she preys on 
                        little boys such as yourself. 
                        Little boys who make a habit of 
                        teasing other little boys. You know 
                        what that means don’t you? Prey? 

           Frank holds out his finger pokes Roy on the chest.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Means she’ll use her razor sharp 
                        fingernails to cut you open inch by 
                        inch. Like she’s unzipping your 
                        skin. Probably using your blood for 
                        some powerful spell. Though if 
                        you’re lucky, she’ll just use her 
                        magic to turn you into a rat or 
                        some other pesky rodent. 

           Roy’s face turns ghost white. Frank patting him on the head 
           as he stands up, proud. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Just a thought to ponder, son. 

           He hurries to catch up to Junior.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Frank sits at his desk in his cluttered little corner. The 
           book Dorothy gave him collecting dust. 

           He stares out the window, the swing sitting empty. He spots 
           Matilda outside, hanging the laundry out to dry.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - DAY

           Frank knocks quietly before entering.

                                 FRANK
                        Dorothy?
           She’s awake, happy to see him. Frank taking a seat on the 
           bed.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        How are we doing today?

           She shrugs.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Then I’m glad I came when I did. 
                        Because I think you’ll be feeling 
                        much better when I tell you what 
                        I’ve just recently discovered.

           Dorothy sits up, interested.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Please forgive me, but I was 
                        mistaken. The woman who stole your 
                        voice, well it turns out she wasn’t 
                        a sorceress at all.
                             (completely serious)
                        She was a witch.

           Dorothy’s jaw drops. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        The most wicked witch in all the 
                        land. And she’s here, right now. In 
                        this house.  

           He takes Dorothy’s hand.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Let me show you.

           Lifting Dorothy out of bed, the two of them walk over to the 
           door. Quietly.

           They peer through the open door, Matilda busy sweeping the 
           floor.

           FRANK AND DOROTHY’S POV -- The utterly grotesque Wicked Witch 
           snoops and sniffs around the farmhouse. Face covered in 
           erupting warts and thread-like white hair. That famous 
           pointed black hat, eye-patch covering her left eye. Broom in 
           hand.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Well, what do you suggest we do, 
                        princess?
           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Dorothy and the Baum boys all stand lined up in a row. Like 
           soldiers ready for battle. An upside down stove pot on 
           Junior’s head, a ladle in little Robert’s hand.

           Frank paces before them. We can practically hear the DRUMS OF 
           WAR.

                                 FRANK
                        Alright, troops. Listen up and 
                        listen good. Princess Dorothy here 
                        has put me in charge of this most 
                        dangerous operation. A full scale 
                        assault on one of the most 
                        horrifying creatures that ever 
                        walked this green Earth. 
                             (pauses for effect)
                        The Wicked Witch.

           Collective GASPS amongst the boys.

                                 ROBERT
                        A witch?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s right. 

           Frank bends down and stares Robert dead in the eye.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        And if that thought terrifies you, 
                        Sir Robert, I suggest you go home 
                        now. 

           Robert salutes Frank. He’s totally onboard.

                                 JUNIOR
                        But how do we defeat the witch?

                                 FRANK
                        Aha. A fine question indeed.

           Frank motions over to TWO BUCKETS OF WATER sitting on the 
           grass just feet away.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        The only way to defeat the Wicked 
                        Witch, is to liquidate her. Melt 
                        her clean and good. The trick is 
                        getting close enough to do so. 
                        Dorothy, Robert, I’ve set aside a 
                        water cannon for each of you.
                                 JUNIOR
                        And what’ll I use?

           SIDE OF THE HOUSE

           Junior unravels the GARDEN HOSE. The most powerful weapon of 
           all. He tests it out, water shooting out from the end. 

           Frank, Dorothy, and Robert march towards him in a line.

                                 FRANK
                        Soldiers, before we head into 
                        battle, I’d just like to say it’s 
                        been an honor fighting alongside 
                        each of you.

           Junior joins them in line.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Now then -- onward, MARCH.

           EXT. THE WITCH’S CASTLE - EVENING

           THUNDER and LIGHTNING fill the swirling black sky.

           The Wicked Witch entering her towering, sinister fortress 
           built from grimy black stone. 

           Frank and the kids watch from a distance, disguised as CASTLE 
           GUARDS. 

           Frank points forward, giving them the signal. The group 
           hurrying towards the castle.

           INT. THE WITCH’S CASTLE - EVENING

           The group enters the castle with caution, the drawbridge 
           closing shut behind them. There’s an eeriness here.

                                 ROBERT
                        I have to pee, pa.

                                 FRANK
                             (whispering)
                        Shhhhhh.

           He places his finger over Robert’s mouth.

           A door CREAKS OPEN from up the spiral staircase.

           Dorothy points up towards a passing SHADOW on the wall 
           upstairs, ugly and hunched-over.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Let’s move.

           Frank leads them running up the staircase to--

           THE TALLEST TOWER

           The pitch black night sky visible from the tower’s windows.

           The Wicked Witch limps across the room, coming to a dead end. 
           End of the line.

           Frank and the kids enter, their guards up.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You’re surrounded, witch. There’s 
                        nowhere to fly off to. 

           The witch HISSES at them. Tongue sticking out from between 
           the crevices of her rotting teeth. Quite the eyesore.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Ready, soldiers?

           Junior gives him a thumbs up.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Ready.

           Frank gives the witch a conniving grin. 

                                 FRANK
                        NOW.

           And all at once, Dorothy and Robert unleash their buckets, 
           Junior his hose, each of them FIRING A BLAST OF WATER at the 
           witch. 

           Nailing her dead on. The witch letting out a deafening 
           MOANING as smoke emits from her pores. Her skin practically 
           sliding off of her bones. MELTING.

                                 WICKED WITCH
                        What have you done?!

           Almost a puddle...
                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - YARD - DAY

           Matilda stands by the clothesline. Completely drenched, 
           dripping wet. As are the drying clothes. 

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        What have you done?! What is the 
                        meaning of this?

           Dorothy, Junior, and Robert stand giggling in front of her.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll ask this only once. WHO IS 
                        RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MADNESS?

           Dorothy and Robert quickly hide their buckets behind their 
           backs. Junior dropping the hose.

           Frank then walks out from behind a hanging bedsheet, looking 
           guilty. He points at the kids. 

                                 FRANK
                        It was all their idea.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DINING AREA - DAY

           Frank sits at the table. Matilda standing over him, pacing. 
           He’s definitely in for it.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Please, Frank. PLEASE help me to 
                        understand what was going on in 
                        that head of yours.

                                 FRANK
                        Well I just thought--

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        I’ve held my tongue over the years, 
                        humored your -- your “ways.” All 
                        because that girl of mine - beyond 
                        my comprehension - loves you. You 
                        are, after all, the father of my 
                        grandsons.

           We see Dorothy peering out her bedroom door, eavesdropping. 
           Matilda’s barking carries through house.
                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        BUT, to involve Dorothy in one of 
                        your childish adventures--

                                 FRANK
                        She is a child, after all.

           Matilda sits across from Frank, calming her voice.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        That girl is not well. She should 
                        be in bed. Resting. My job here is 
                        to make sure that’s the case. It’s 
                        important we remain focused on 
                        reality in times like these, Frank. 
                        There is no place for fantasy.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - DAY

           Dorothy doesn’t like what she hears. Head held low as she 
           goes to climb into bed, tucking herself in.

           INT. BAUM’S BAZAAR - EVENING

           The pouring rain beats down on the windows of the shop.

           The shelves are full, but the store is empty. Not a soul in 
           sight.

           Except for Frank, who sits on the floor, resting against the 
           counter. He’s playing with one of those fragile china dolls.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        Thought I might find you here.

           Frank simply stares at the bulgy legs in his field of view, 
           before William takes a seat beside him.

                                 FRANK
                        My family -- we came here with the 
                        promise of riches. Of opportunity. 
                        I fear I may have led them astray.

           William laughs at this. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Come on. You foolin me? 

           Frank’s unflinching expression suggests he’s not.
                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        The boom’s long over. Sure. That’s 
                        a fact. Ain’t no fault of your own 
                        though. You did right by your 
                        family, like any man should. 

           The leg of the china doll BREAKS OFF. Frank throwing the toy 
           to the ground.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        I had a drink with my buddy last 
                        night...Pitkin and Brooks is just 
                        callin our names. It’s good, honest 
                        work. I know this may be bold of 
                        me, Frank, but -- well what else 
                        are you gonna do?

                                 FRANK
                             (under his breath)
                        Yeah. What else...

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Frank’s suitcase sits by the door. Ready to go. Frank picks 
           it up, about to head out.

                                 MAUD (O.S.)
                        Wait.

           Maud hurries over carrying Frank’s top hat.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        Can’t forget this.

           Frank puts it on, giving his wife a grateful kiss.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        So you’ve got everything else then? 
                        Just, be careful, Frank. Promise 
                        me? And mind that heart of yours, 
                        don’t go getting riled up over 
                        nothin.

                                 FRANK
                        I fully intend to pick a fight with 
                        every brute that dare cross my 
                        path.
                             (off her unamusement)
                        It’s only a few days. I’ll be fine. 

           Matilda comes rushing out of Dorothy’s room.
                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Has anyone seen Dorothy?!

           As Matilda and Maud scatter to search, Frank heads to the 
           back window. Looking out to find Dorothy standing beneath the 
           tree.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - YARD - DAY

           Dorothy stands at the highest point of the yard, in the shade 
           of the tree. Eyes closed. Wearing the silver slippers, she 
           CLICKS HER HEELS together.

           1...2...3. Nothing happens.

           She tries again. Her face scrunched, she WANTS it. 1...2...3.

           Nothing.

           Frank watches from a distance, walking her way.

           Overcome with frustration, Dorothy takes the slippers off her 
           feet and BANGS them against the bark of the tree. 

                                 FRANK
                        Dorothy?

           His walk turns into a run, worried.

           Dorothy takes one shoe and CHUCKS IT across the yard. About 
           to throw the second one, until Frank grabs her arm.

           Dorothy lets the slipper drop to the grass, falling to her 
           knees. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What is it, little princess? What’s 
                        wrong?

                                 DOROTHY
                        They’re not working!

           Not only does she speak, she SHOUTS. Frank taken aback. 
           Speechless, ironically. The young girl breaking down before 
           his very eyes. Tearing up.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                             (through the sobs)
                        They’re not working.

           Frank holds her close.
           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - DAY

           Emily puts a tired Dorothy back into bed, giving her a kiss 
           on the forehead.

                                 EMILY
                        Glad to have you back, my love.

           Frank taps on the open door.

                                 FRANK
                        Would you ladies mind if I had a 
                        minute with her majesty?

           Matilda’s not having any of it, not moving a muscle.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Please?

           Emily grabs her mother by the hand, practically dragging her 
           out of the room.

                                 EMILY
                        Let’s go, mother.

           Emily stopping at Frank on her way out.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Take all the time you need.

           Matilda and Emily gone, Frank half-shuts door behind them. He 
           takes a seat on the bed, pulling Dorothy’s now-muddy slippers 
           from his coat.

                                 FRANK
                        A little dirty, but I’m sure your 
                        ma will have them sparkling again 
                        in no time. 

           He puts them under the bed.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Where were you trying to go?

           She’s silent again.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Between you and me. You have my 
                        word. 

           Dorothy sits up, still a little teary-eyed.

                                 DOROTHY
                        To see him.
           Frank’s a little lost.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I wanted the slippers to take me to 
                        see my papa.

                                 FRANK
                        Ah. I see.

                                 DOROTHY
                        But they didn’t work. Why didn’t 
                        they work, uncle Frank?

           Franks searches for the words.

                                 FRANK
                        Can I tell you a story?

           Dorothy gives him the green light.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        There once lived a man with a 
                        broken heart. Now, I don’t mean 
                        broken in the way you might be 
                        thinking. He wasn’t scorned, nor 
                        was he unloved. But no matter what 
                        he did, his heart just 
                        wouldn’t...couldn’t work properly.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Couldn’t he just ask for a new one?

           Frank laughs.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m afraid that’s not how it works. 
                        What I’m trying to say is -- there 
                        are some things in this world that, 
                        no matter how hard we try or how 
                        much magic we use, we just cannot 
                        fix.

           Through the crack in the doorway, we see Matilda standing 
           just outside, listening in.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’m sorry if I got you in trouble 
                        with grandma the other day. 

                                 FRANK
                        Me? In trouble? Nonsense. Your 
                        uncle Frank isn’t afraid of any 
                        Wicked Witch. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        All that matters is that you 
                        finally got that voice of yours 
                        back. 

           Frank tucks Dorothy in nice and comfortable, before getting 
           up to leave.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Uncle Frank...

           He stops.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        The place I go to sometimes when I 
                        close my eyes and click my heels 
                        together...it’s the most wonderful 
                        place I’ve ever seen. You should 
                        write about it in your book. 

           Frank smiles, putting on his hat.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re a very special girl, Dorothy 
                        Gage. Don’t ever let anyone tell 
                        you different. 

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           The sun setting over the prairie, William sits just outside 
           in his buggy, waiting.

           Frank gives his final goodbye hugs to the family. One for 
           Emily, a kiss for Maud. Lifting Junior and Robert up into his 
           arms and spinning them around.  

           EXT. UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD - EVENING

           The TRAIN chugs along the tracks beneath the open night sky. 
           Clouds of thick black smoke spouting out from the engine. 

           South Dakota’s long gone, the train roaring past the 
           mountains of Nebraska. 

           EXT. KANSAS CITY STATION - DAWN

           The train slows down as it approaches the station. PASSENGERS 
           waiting eagerly on the platform.

           The station sign reading: KANSAS WELCOMES YOU!
           The train stopped, unloading. Frank and William step off, 
           luggage in hand. Taking in the sights. 

           EXT. STREETS OF KANSAS CITY - DAY

           Frank and William stroll along the bustling paved streets. 
           Definitely a busier, more congested city than Aberdeen. 

           They stop outside of the small KANSAS CITY IRONMONGERS shop. 
           The doorbell RINGING as they enter.

           INT. KANSAS CITY IRONMONGERS - DAY

           Shelves of kitchenware line the quaint store. Aluminum and 
           metal plates, pots, pans, utensils. 

           The weary, middle-aged SHOPKEEPER puts on his glasses as he 
           inspects Frank and William’s open suitcases filled with 
           fancy, top-of-the-line china.  

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Where’d you say this china was 
                        from?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Imported all the way from Venice 
                        this stuff. Don’t get more high end 
                        than that. Your customers will feel 
                        like they’re dining in the lap of 
                        luxury.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Luxury, eh?

           The shopkeeper takes off his glasses, addressing the men eye-
           to-eye.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Look...you seem like a couple of 
                        nice fellas, so I’m gonna be 
                        entirely honest. We just don’t have 
                        the means to stock such a “high 
                        end” product. My customers can’t 
                        eat on a plate worth more than what 
                        they earn in a month. I’m sorry.  

           Defeated, William closes the suitcase and picks it up from 
           the table.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Thank you for your time, sir.
           Frank doesn’t give up, grabbing the shopkeeper by the arm.

                                 FRANK
                        Wait. I’ve got a family to care 
                        for. Please, just reconsider...

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Nothin to reconsider. We’re a 
                        modest, simple folk here. Y’all 
                        best try your luck somewhere like 
                        Chicago. 

           Taking the hint, Frank tips his hat at the shopkeeper as him 
           and William head for the door.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Better get a move on, there’s a 
                        storm comin. 

           The daylight’s disappeared, the skies gray and gloomy. 
           THUNDER BOOMING as Frank and William make a run for it.

           INT. KANSAS CITY STATION - DAY

           A waterfall of rain blankets the view from the station 
           window. Brief bursts of LIGHTNING make it clearer for a 
           moment.

           The station’s packed full. People stuck, nowhere to go. 
           Dripping wet. 

           Frank stands at the window, staring outside -- as the storm 
           lights up the sky, he watches a FUNNEL CLOUD swirling off 
           above the Kansas plains. A TWISTER touching down.

           Frank has to squint a bit, looking closer. Spotting Professor 
           Coe’s hot air balloon emerging from the funnel, the storm 
           tossing it around like a rubber ball.

           INT. UNION PACIFIC RAILCAR - EVENING

           Cigar smoke fills the cabin. Red velvet seats and a 
           chandelier RATTLING with the bumps and shakes of the train. 
           There’s an element of class here masked by scotch and middle-
           aged testosterone.  

           Frank sits in his own little world, thinking. The blank book 
           from Dorothy sits open in his lap.
                                 WILLIAM
                        You workin on somethin new?

           William sits just across from him, sketching.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s nothing. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah. I suppose this is nothin, 
                        too.

           William turns his sketch paper around, revealing a very 
           cartoonish drawing of Frank. His body short, moustache and 
           top hat extremely exaggerated. 

                                 FRANK
                        Is that supposed to be me? 

           Frank takes a closer look.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Amazing. You truly have a gift, 
                        William. It’d be a shame to waste 
                        it.

           William laughs at this.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Something funny?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well no, it’s just -- it’s somewhat 
                        ironic, isn’t it? You tellin me how 
                        I shouldn’t be lettin my talents go 
                        to waste.

           Frank leans in close, raising a curious brow.

                                 FRANK
                        If I didn’t know better I’d say 
                        you’ve been talking with my wife.

                                 WILLIAM
                        She’s a smart woman. You’d be wise 
                        to heed her advice every now and 
                        again.

           A GROUP OF SALESMEN sitting across the aisle begin laughing 
           obnoxiously. They’re loud, interrupting Frank and William’s 
           conversation. They’ve probably had one too many.
                                 FRANK
                        Gentlemen. It appears as though 
                        someone had a successful day. 
                        That’s more than I can say for the 
                        two of us.

           The ringleader of the group - OSCAR DIGGS, late 50s - leans 
           over to greet frank. His forehead full of wrinkles, beard as 
           white as snow.

                                 OSCAR DIGGS
                        You bet your keister we did. 

                                 FRANK
                        Then my hat is off to you, sir. 

           A inebriated Oscar climbs over his friends, stumbling into 
           the aisle and joining Frank and William in their seats. 
           Somewhat intrusive.

           He shakes hands with Frank.

                                 OSCAR DIGGS
                        Name’s Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig 
                        Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel 
                        Ambroise Diggs. But you can simply 
                        call me Oscar.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well that’s a relief.

           Oscar chuckles at William, giving him a friendly slug on the 
           arm. Too friendly.

                                 OSCAR DIGGS
                        A jester, this one. Well done. A 
                        good sense of humor is a skill all 
                        men should strive for. It’s 
                        healing. 

           He downs the rest of his drink.

                                 OSCAR DIGGS (CONT’D)
                        First day on the job?

                                 WILLIAM
                        What gave it away?

                                 OSCAR DIGGS
                        Your attitude. The complete lack of 
                        that twinkle in your eye. I’ve been 
                        at this for -- well, I’m fifty-
                        eight, so...
                             (counts in his head)
                                 (MORE)
                                 OSCAR DIGGS (CONT'D)
                        The better part of twenty years. 
                        Ridin this train up and down the 
                        line every week since it was first 
                        built. I’ve sold everything in the 
                        alphabet, twice over. Don’t matter 
                        what it is, Oscar Diggs can sell 
                        it. Guaranteed.

           He glances at their suitcase.

                                 OSCAR DIGGS (CONT’D)
                        Pitkin and Brooks, eh? What are you 
                        boys peddlin?

                                 FRANK
                        China.

                                 WILLIAM
                        High-end, imported china.

           Oscar grins, putting his arm around Frank.

                                 OSCAR DIGGS
                        Hah. Child’s play. Why anyone could 
                        use a decent set of china.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well apparently not.

                                 OSCAR DIGGS
                        They just don’t know they want it 
                        yet. You’ve just gotta put on a 
                        show. Create that desire. It’s not 
                        about selling the product, 
                        gentlemen. It’s about selling 
                        yourself. Believing in yourself. 
                        You do that, and they’ll start to 
                        believe it too.

           As crazy as Oscar may sound, his words seem to get to Frank. 
           Really making him think. 

           Frank opens up his book, jotting down some notes.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - DAY

           Dorothy’s COUGHING echoes through the bedroom. She sits up in 
           bed, hands over her mouth. This one looks like it hurts.

           Maud sits beside her, pouring a few sips of water into her 
           mouth.
                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Are you sure you two will be 
                        alright? I feel just terrible 
                        leaving at a time like this.

           Emily hands Matilda her bag.

                                 EMILY
                        We’ll be fine, mother. Go. I can 
                        take care of my own girl. 

           Matilda gives her daughter a hug.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Just be sure she takes her 
                        medicine. It’s only a day-long 
                        march. I’ll be back before you even 
                        know I’m gone.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Matilda heads for the door, bag and umbrella in hand, putting 
           on her coat. Maud comes running after her.

                                 MAUD
                        Mother...

           They come to the front door, Maud speaking quietly.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        She’s getting worse, isn’t she?

           Maud hesitates to answer.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        We’re not children anymore. You 
                        don’t think Emily can see it?

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Just see to it that the girl gets 
                        her rest. Should be a whole lot 
                        easier now seeing as that husband 
                        of yours is out of the house.

           Maud’s NOT happy with her.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look at me that way. He’s 
                        unusual, dear. You and I both know 
                        that’s an opinion I’ve never 
                        exactly strayed from. 
                                 MAUD
                        Mother...if I’ve learned anything 
                        in the time I’ve spent with Frank, 
                        it’s that the only people worthy of 
                        consideration in this world are the 
                        “unusual” ones. The common folks, 
                        like you, are like the leafs of a 
                        tree. They live and die unnoticed. 
                        I believe in that man with every 
                        fiber of my being. And so does 
                        Dorothy.  

           Matilda’s taken aback, like she doesn’t recognize the woman 
           in front of her.

           EXT. CITY OF CHICAGO - DAY

           A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE CITY--

           Buildings so tall they touch the clouds. 

           The congested bridge over the Chicago River.

           The above-ground rail system.

           The FERRIS WHEEL on the pier.

           TRAIN PLATFORM

           Frank and William step off the train at UNION STATION. 
           They’re in absolute awe of the city before them.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        As I live and breathe. Have you 
                        ever seen anything so beautiful?

           FROM FRANK’S POV -- The city shines and sparkles a bright 
           shimmering green. A city made from hope. A city of made from 
           Emeralds.

                                 FRANK
                        No. No I can’t say that I have.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’re definitely not in Aberdeen no 
                        more. 

           As they walk on, they pass a sign that reads: 

                 CHICAGO WORLD’S FAIR. CELEBRATE THE FUTURE!
           INT. SMALL CHICAGO HOME - PARLOR - DAY

           Frank and William sit uncomfortably in the parlor of a quaint 
           Chicago home. Their china suitcase snug between the two of 
           them. 

           An unkempt, middle-aged DISTRAUGHT MOTHER sits across from 
           them. Staring blankly.

                                 DISTRAUGHT MOTHER
                        China?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well not just any china. High-end, 
                        imported china.

           The woman laughs them off. They must be joking.

           A BABY CRIES down the hall.

                                 DISTRAUGHT MOTHER
                        Excuse me for a moment.

           Still laughing, the woman walks off down the hall.

           William immediately turns to Frank, in a panic.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I say we abandon ship. I don’t 
                        think this woman has the slightest 
                        interest in buying any china at 
                        all.

                                 FRANK
                        What gave it away?

           Frank stands, straightening up.

           The mother comes hurrying back into the room, her BABY in her 
           arms. 

                                 DISTRAUGHT MOTHER
                        I’m sorry about that. He’s been 
                        giving me a real hard time as of 
                        late. 

           She rocks him back and forth.

                                 FRANK
                        How old is the little guy?
                                 DISTRAUGHT MOTHER
                        About two months now. Look, I know 
                        you fellas got a job to do, but I 
                        don’t think--

                                 FRANK
                        No. No we should apologizing. I’m 
                        not sure we made our intentions 
                        clear.

           The woman becomes curious. Frank motions for her to have a 
           seat, while he continues to pace the parlor.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I have children myself. Two boys. I 
                        love ‘em to death, make no mistake. 
                        But they run me ragged. Especially 
                        when they were miniature-sized like 
                        your little one. My wife and I 
                        would be lucky to get a mere hour 
                        of sleep between the two of us.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (whispering)
                        Uhh, Frank...

           Frank shoos him off, continuing to do his thing.

                                 FRANK
                        One year my mother-in-law had 
                        gotten us this fancy little tea 
                        set. The woman’s a witch to be 
                        sure, but I’ve always been grateful 
                        for that gift. Once a week my wife 
                        and I would pull it out of the 
                        cupboard and, just for an hour, 
                        pretend we were somewhere else. 
                        Just for an hour, we’d drink tea 
                        with an element of class, letting 
                        the headaches of the day slip away.  

           Frank goes over to the couch, opening up the suitcase of 
           china. He pulls out a single plate, displaying it for the 
           woman to see.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Now I know you love that child with 
                        all your heart. But just for an 
                        evening, maybe you could enjoy a 
                        meal and pretend you’re in Paris. 
                        Or throw a fancy soiree for the 
                        friends you haven’t seen in months?  
           The woman’s eyes are locked on the china...then she looks up 
           at Frank, a smile on her face.

           EXT. CHICAGO WORLD’S FAIR - PIER - DAY

           ON THE PIER overlooking Lake Michigan. The place flooded with 
           TOURISTS. The ferris wheel at the center of the chaos.

           Frank and William stroll through the crowd, a bounce in their 
           step. They observe the many EXHIBIT BOOTHS that line the 
           pier, each displaying technologies that might appear alien at 
           first glance.

                                 FRANK
                        Well we pulled it off, William. A 
                        many cheers to us.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        No you pulled it off. Why’d you 
                        never tell me that story about the 
                        tea set? It’s quite charming.

                                 FRANK
                        The -- ah, yes. Truth be told my 
                        mother-in-law never got us a gift 
                        in her life. 

           William stops in his tracks. Even MORE impressed than he was.

           INT. CHICAGO WORLD’S FAIR - MAIN EXHIBIT TENT - DAY

           This is where the real action’s at. The best of the best. 
           Frank stands in awe of it all. Him and William parting ways.

           Frank wanders, as giddy as the kids that roam the tent with 
           their parents. Until something peculiar catches his eye.

           He stops to inspect a TIN WOODSMAN standing on display. A man 
           made entirely from tin, not very convincing. Almost what we’d 
           consider a robot. An axe placed in its hands.

                                 FRANK
                        How do you do?

           Frank stares into the tin man’s empty eyes, shaking its hand.

                                 MAD-EYED INVENTOR (O.S.)
                        You’re a man with good taste. I can 
                        tell.
           Frank is startled to find an elderly MAD-EYED INVENTOR 
           standing over his shoulder. The man’s gut not well hidden in 
           his overalls. 

                                 FRANK
                        Pardon?

           The inventor walks circles around Frank.

                                 MAD-EYED INVENTOR
                        Don’t think I don’t see you eyeing 
                        my man. You’re intrigued. And why 
                        wouldn’t you be? It’s not every day 
                        you see a man made of tin. 

                                 FRANK
                        No, I suppose not. What does it do?

                                 MAD-EYED INVENTOR
                        Why it’s a tin woodsman. See that 
                        axe in his hand? Mankind wasn’t 
                        destined to stand in the forest 
                        choppin down trees til the cows 
                        come home. No sir. In the future, 
                        we’ll have an entire fleet of these 
                        fellas. One on every farm across 
                        these United States.

           Frank puts his ear to the tin man’s chest, KNOCKING on it. 
           Nothing but an empty rumble echoes back.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s hollow.

                                 MAD-EYED INVENTOR
                        Of course he’s hollow. He’s got one 
                        purpose and one purpose only. Not 
                        much use for a heart. Hah.

           The strange man laughs at the thought of it.

                                 FRANK
                        Hmm. Tin like this, it’ll rust from 
                        water in a matter of minutes. 
                        What’ll happen when it rains, I 
                        wonder? 

           Frank tips his hat before walking off.

           Leaving the inventor dumbfounded, scratching his head. 

           Frank continues to wander. He notices a particularly large 
           crowd gathering around one of the exhibits, piquing his 
           interest.
           A very fancily dressed SHOWMAN stands on his pedestal, 
           preaching to the crowd. 

                                 SHOWMAN
                        Gather round, folks. Nice and 
                        gentle. No need for pushing, 
                        everyone will get a turn.

           Behind him sits a device surrounded by lights and mirrors. A 
           lens in one end, light coming from the other -- projecting 
           onto the side of the tent. A very early version of what might 
           be considered a PROJECTOR. 

                                 SHOWMAN (CONT’D)
                        Now it’s simple, really. Just take 
                        anything - like so - place it in 
                        front of the lens...and presto!

           The man places his hand in front of the lens, its shadow 
           projected -- ten times the size.

                                 SHOWMAN (CONT’D)
                        The grandest of illusions.

                                 FRANK
                             (under his breath)
                        Incredible.

           The showman pinpoints Frank in the front of the group.

                                 SHOWMAN
                        You sir. Please step right up.

           He doesn’t have to ask Frank twice. Frank walks forward, 
           standing in position in front of the lens.

                                 SHOWMAN (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful.

           Frank puts his hands on his hips, playing to the crowd. His 
           giant silhouette projected behind him. His stature and top 
           hat making him appear more intimidating than he ever could’ve 
           imagined.

           FRANK’S POV -- his projected shadow rules over the room, 
           towering above the rest. There’s an air of powerful 
           greatness. Fiery TORCHES IGNITE from either side of the 
           shadow, the crowd quivering in fear.

           The crowd APPLAUDS. Frank bowing, naturally.
                                 MR. BRISTLE (O.S.)
                        Frank? 

           Frank looks down to find his old friend, Mr. Bristle, 
           watching from below.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        Frank Baum? Is that really you?

           He steps down to greet him.

                                 FRANK
                        Mr. Bristle.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Well if it isn’t the genius 
                        himself. I never thought I’d be 
                        seeing you again. 

           The two shake hands.

                                 FRANK
                        Genius? Have you looked around? 
                        This place is -- well it’s 
                        extraordinary. These men are 
                        geniuses.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Modest til the end. 

           INT. UNION STATION PUB - EVENING

           Frank, William, and Mr. Bristle all share a ceremonial 
           cheers. A CLINKING of their glasses. Holding a conversation 
           amidst the chaos of the station, people waiting for their 
           trains.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        So tell me, what’s new in the life 
                        of one of L. Frank Baum?

                                 WILLIAM
                        He’s writing a book.

           Frank shoots William a nasty look. Not what he was going to 
           say.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Is that true, Frank?

           Frank holds up the suitcase filled with china.
                                 FRANK
                        In the sales game, as of late. And 
                        yourself? Still wrangling the 
                        backstage minds of live theater?

           Mr. Bristle laughs.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Nah. Not since you and I parted 
                        ways. You remember that night, 
                        don’t you? I’d wager all of 
                        Syracuse does.

           William’s a little left out, trying to follow.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What happened?

                                 FRANK
                        Nothing. It was--

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Nothing?!
                             (to William)
                        So we’re touring with Maid of 
                        Arran. A very successful run. Then 
                        comes our last show, back home in 
                        Syracuse, and the theater goes up 
                        in flames. Burns to the ground.
                             (to Frank)
                        I told you a hundred times not to 
                        use real matches in that scene.

           Frank clearly wants OUT of this conversation.

                                 FRANK
                        I needed it to look authentic.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well I’d imagine that fire made it 
                        look a bit more authentic than you 
                        were going for. 

           Frank and Mr. Bristle stare at William, then glance back at 
           each other -- before bursting out in laughter.

           It takes them a few moments to calm back down.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        I am still in the business of art, 
                        though. Been working for Way and 
                        Williams. They’re a small 
                        publishing firm here in Chicago.
           Frank’s ears perk up a bit.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        You’re one of the most talented 
                        writers I know, Frank. If you’re 
                        working on something...

                                 FRANK
                        There’s a lot going on back home. 
                        Money’s a little tight. We’ve been 
                        living with my sister-in-law and 
                        her little girl, Dorothy. She’s 
                        fallen ill.

           He really knows how to bring down the mood. The others not 
           sure how to respond.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Get her a dog.

           Frank raises a brow.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        My little ones, well when their 
                        grandfather passed--

                                 FRANK
                        You’ve got a family?

           Mr. Bristle pulls out an old photo from his pocket, showing 
           it to Frank.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Three little ones. Who would’ve 
                        thought, right? When the their 
                        grandfather passed, our youngest 
                        took it the hardest. Wouldn’t go 
                        outside or nothin for weeks. So I 
                        picked him up a cute little puppy. 
                        Cheered the boy right up.

           We can see the wheels turning in Frank’s head.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Junior kneels on the couch, pulling back the curtains as he 
           stares OUT THE WINDOW -- Frank stepping out from William’s 
           buggy, heading towards the house. A small crate in tow.

                                 JUNIOR
                        He’s home! Dad’s home!

           Maud comes running into the room.
                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        And I think he brought us presents.

           Maud joins Junior, spotting Frank with the crate.

                                 MAUD
                        Oh Frank. What did you do?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Maud opens the front door -- Frank standing on the other side 
           with a great big smile on his face. Maud not nearly as happy. 
           Her eyes focused on the crate.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        You know she’s not going to like 
                        this one bit. 

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - DAY

           Dorothy sits up in bed, drawing on her little pad of paper. 
           She COUGHS a bit, Matilda giving her some water.

           The door CREAKS open...nobody there.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Hello?

           Out of nowhere, A LITTLE DOG jumps up onto the bed. A dark 
           Cairn Terrier. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        A puppy!

           The adorable little furball instantly drawn to Dorothy.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you come from, boy?

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        What in the -- don’t touch that 
                        thing, Dorothy. You don’t know 
                        where it’s been.

           Dorothy pets the dog as it circles her lap. Until Matilda 
           intervenes, shooing the dog off the bed.

           Dorothy spots Frank standing in the doorway.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Uncle Frank! Is this your dog?
                                 FRANK
                        Actually, I thought it might be our 
                        dog. This little fella approached 
                        me on the street and told me he was 
                        a doctor. I thought, “well what do 
                        you know, we’ve got a sick little 
                        girl at home could use a good 
                        doctor.” Can you believe that luck? 
                        His fees are steep, sure, but he’s 
                        the best of the best.

           The dog hops back up onto Dorothy’s lap, the girl simply 
           overjoyed.

           Matilda stares at Frank with that haunting look.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Frank. A word?

           Frank follows her out of the room.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Just outside the bedroom, Matilda closing the door behind 
           them.

           The rest of the family gathers around too, expecting a fight.

                                 FRANK
                        Before you unleash those ghastly 
                        claws and begin the full-scale 
                        assault, informing me full well of 
                        what I’ve once again “done wrong,” 
                        you should know I had the girl’s 
                        best interests at heart. She she 
                        can’t go outside, can’t play--

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        You’re right.

           Frank’s stunned. At a complete loss for words.

           Maud and Emily are equally perplexed. 

                                 FRANK
                        Could you -- please say again what 
                        you just said a moment ago?
                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        I said I agree with you completely. 
                        I would’ve liked to have been 
                        consulted on the matter, sure, but 
                        you’re right. That girl needs 
                        something real to lift her spirits.

           Frank takes this as somewhat of a backhanded compliment.

           Grateful, Emily wraps her arms around her mother.

                                 EMILY
                        Thank you.

           Matilda SNEEZES. Her eyes watering a bit.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Now, let’s see what we can’t do 
                        about getting that mangy little 
                        creature some water.

           As she walks off, Matilda SNEEZES again.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        Lovely.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - DAY

           Frank enters the room, quietly. Watching Dorothy hold the dog 
           in her arms.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Is grandma taking him away?

           Frank takes a seat beside her on the bed.

                                 FRANK
                        No. No I’m happy to say the furry 
                        little doctor is here to stay.

           Dorothy’s relieved. She squeezes the dog, kissing the top of 
           its head.

                                 DOROTHY
                             (to the dog)
                        You hear that, Toto? I can keep 
                        you! You get to stay here with us.

                                 FRANK
                        Toto?
                                 DOROTHY
                        That’s what I named him. Because of 
                        the way he was smelling my toes 
                        before.

           She lets go of the dog, and he does just that. Skipping over 
           to Dorothy’s legs and sniffing her toes.

           Frank smiles. He stands, walking over to the night stand. 
           Something catching his eye.

           He picks up Dorothy’s drawing pad.

                                 FRANK
                        What’s this?

           It’s a rough sketch of a forest filled with apple trees. The 
           trees with long gangly arms.

                                 DOROTHY
                        The place I go to when I close my 
                        eyes and click my heels together. 
                        The trees are all alive there. Like 
                        the monkeys you were telling me 
                        about, and the lion. 

           Frank looks at the drawing closer -- each tree wearing a 
           little frowning face.

                                 FRANK
                        Are they now? And might I ask why 
                        they look so angry?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Well because people keep picking 
                        their apples. You wouldn’t like it 
                        if people picked things off of you, 
                        would you?

           Frank can’t help but laugh.

                                 FRANK
                        No, I suppose I wouldn’t.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Maybe next time I go back there I 
                        could bring Toto with me with me. I 
                        know he’d just love it.

           He hands the drawing pad back to Dorothy.

                                 FRANK
                        Wouldn’t that be something. 
           INT. ABERDEEN TAVERN - EVENING

           A row of empty glasses in front of them, Frank and William 
           share a table in the nearly-dead watering hole. Frank writing 
           in his book, William busy - focused - drawing something.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Is this about right?

           He holds up his paper -- a more refined sketch of Dorothy’s 
           talking, angry trees. Pretty darn impressive.

                                 FRANK
                        Not quite. Their faces should 
                        appear more foul. Repulsive, even. 
                        Think how you’d like it if people 
                        went around picking things off of 
                        you?

           Letting out a SIGH, William goes back to work.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What do you call this place, 
                        anyhow? You’ve been goin on about 
                        all these characters in this “new 
                        world,” but you ain’t got a name 
                        for it?

                                 FRANK
                        Just -- “The New World.” Yes, 
                        that’ll do fine for now.

           William’s not impressed by the name. 

           Just then, the tavern doors swing open. Very “old west 
           saloon.” The CLANKING of spur boots on the wood entering the 
           bar, property of none other than Rak the Terrible.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        Hey Baum.

           Frank and William look up from their work.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE (CONT’D)
                        I been lookin for you. 

           The few COWARDLY PATRONS left in the room instantly jump out 
           of their seats and flee the tavern.

                                 FRANK
                        Ah. I see. Might I suggest a good 
                        pair of spectacles?
           Not the least bit amused, Rak pulls a REVOLVER from his belt. 
           FIRING--  

           And SHATTERING the bottle of whiskey the bartender held in 
           his hand. The old man probably needing a clean pair of 
           trousers.

           Rak stomps towards Frank’s table. William nearly falling out 
           of his seat as he quickly retreats.

           The gruff Rak, the face of a mad dog, corners Frank up 
           against the bar. Nowhere to run.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        What’d you say to my boy?

           Frank drips with sweat, we can practically hear his heart 
           POUNDING.

                                 FRANK
                        Sorry?

           Rak SNARLS, spitting on the floor.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        My boy. Roy. What’d you say to him 
                        that got him all scared and 
                        twitchy? Kid hasn’t slept in a 
                        week. Has some crazy notions about 
                        witches or somethin of the like.

                                 FRANK
                        Roy? OH. Roy -- is your son. Of 
                        course. That makes sense. Well you 
                        see, he was sort of having trouble 
                        with Junior, and well I only--

           Rak’s face gets uncomfortably close to Frank’s. Frank 
           cringing at the smell of his breath.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        You got an issue with my boy, you 
                        got an issue with ME. What kinda 
                        fella threatens a helpless kid? 
                        That make you feel man enough, 
                        Baum?

           Rak releases his hold on Frank, stomping back towards the 
           door.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE (CONT’D)
                        Sunday. Right here. High noon. 
                                 FRANK
                        What happens on Sunday?

           Rak grins, revealing his mouth of hideous teeth.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        We find out if you’re a MAN, or a 
                        COWARD.

           Rak pushes through the saloon doors and exits, leaving a 
           terrified Frank in his wake. His hand on his heart.

           Without even looking, Frank takes a half-full glass of scotch 
           that sits on the bar and downs it in one quick motion.

           William emerging from hiding.

                                 FRANK
                        Tell me, William. Why is it that 
                        these barbaric standoffs must 
                        always take place at high noon?

                                 WILLIAM
                        So they can work up an appetite, I 
                        suppose. So they can get 
                        lunch...after they kill you.

           Not the most comforting thing to say.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DINING AREA - EVENING

           Maud consoles a worried Frank at the dining table, holding 
           his hand. William and Emily there too.

                                 MAUD
                        You know we can leave town, Frank. 
                        Take the boys and never look back.

                                 FRANK
                        If I run -- then I truly am a 
                        coward.

                                 EMILY
                        But you’d be alive. You don’t even 
                        own a gun, do you?

                                 MAUD
                        And what about your heart? Did you 
                        think about that?

           Frank stands up, leaving the table. He’s heard enough. Maud 
           goes after him, grabbing him by the arm.
                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        In all seriousness, Frank. Just 
                        think about this. What is it you 
                        intend to do? Become an expert 
                        gunman in just a few days? You? 
                        Please. Something like that would 
                        require an act of magic.

           A sparkle in Frank’s eye. A light bulb’s gone off.

                                 FRANK
                        What did you just say?

           Frank can’t help but smile. He laughs, so giddy it begins to 
           creep out the others. He lifts Maud up into the air and spins 
           her about, kissing her on the cheek again and again.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Come along, William. There’s much 
                        work to be done.

           Grabbing his hat, Frank skips out the front door. William 
           hesitantly following behind.

           INT. BARN - EVENING

           Frank holds a lantern as he KICKS OPEN the door to the dark, 
           cluttered barn. The only thing giving light to the room. The 
           wooden beams infested with cobwebs, god knows what else is 
           living here.

           Frank and William look around. The place piled with junk. 
           Farming equipment, old household items. Knickknacks and goods 
           leftover from the bazaar.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        What are we doin here, Frank? This 
                        place gives me the willies.

           Frank holds his lantern over a pile of old SCRAP METAL.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re gonna put on a show, William. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m not so sure Mr. Rak’s a fan of 
                        the theatre. 

           Frank walks around, now shining the light on what looks like 
           a crate of old FIREWORKS.
           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Junior marches through the front door, Frank right there 
           waiting for him.

                                 FRANK
                        Well?

           Junior smiles, looking back at the door.

           An entire line of NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS enter the house. A whole 
           fleet of them, just under a dozen young boys and girls. That 
           one annoying chubby kid among them.

                                 JUNIOR
                        This was all I could get on such 
                        short notice. 

           His dad’s impressed.

                                 FRANK
                        Well would you look at that. You 
                        lead, they follow. 

           Frank steps up onto a chair, towering over the rest of the 
           room. All the kids chatting amongst themselves, gathering 
           around.

           Frank raises his hands into the air, the kids going quiet on 
           cue. He has their full attention.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Young citizens of Aberdeen -- I owe 
                        you a great deal of thanks for 
                        being here today. Your cooperation 
                        is quite humbling.  

           Young Robert’s hand shoots up.

                                 ROBERT
                        Are you gonna tell us another 
                        story, papa? Like the one about the 
                        silver slippers?

                                 FRANK
                        No, sir Robert. I’m afraid this 
                        time I need your help to tell the 
                        story. All of you.

           The kids in the room become filled with excitement.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, do any of you know much 
                        about dragons?
                                 CHUBBY KID
                        Oh! They’ve got really sharp teeth. 
                        And they breathe fire, don’t they? 

           Maud, Emily, and William watch from the back of the room, 
           quite amused. Matilda -- less so.

                                 FRANK
                        That they do. Very good. You see, 
                        as fate would have it, I have to 
                        face a dragon tomorrow. And the 
                        only way I’m going to be able to do 
                        that and come out alive, is if we 
                        all work together.

           We see the door to Dorothy’s room slightly cracked open, the 
           young sickly girl peeking out into the living room.

           A Tall FRECKLE-FACED GIRL steps to the front of the crowd.

                                 FRECKLE-FACED GIRL
                        But we’re not like you, Mr. Baum. 
                        We don’t have magic slippers, we’ve 
                        never melted witches or slayed 
                        dragons before. 

           Frank hops down form the chair, bending down to look that 
           freckle-faced girl dead in the eye.

                                 FRANK
                        So tell me...would you like to?

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - YARD - DAY

           The DRUMS OF WAR sound once more. The neighborhood kids are 
           lined up in a row on the lawn, Frank standing before them. 

           A bunch of that junk from the barn scattered across the yard.

                                 FRANK
                        Each of you will be assigned to a 
                        designated post. Junior here will 
                        give you your placements.  

           Junior stands beside Frank, clipboard in hand.

           BAUM’S ARMY TRAINING SEQUENCE:

           Junior leads the kids in a run across the plains. They’re 
           focused, determined.

           A few of the kids tie rope around a couple pieces of scrap 
           metal.
           Maud helps some of the kids teach Toto some new tricks. 

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Make no mistake about it. This will 
                        be no easy feat. You will all be 
                        tested. 

           They call the dog from the opposite end of the field. 

           Some of the kids circled around, Frank carefully demonstrates 
           how to operate the fireworks.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        HOWEVER, if you stay smart, stay 
                        brave, and true of heart -- we’ll 
                        come out on the other side better 
                        men because of it.

           Kids playing with more pieces of sheet metal, banging on them 
           with large wooden mallets. 

           A group messes around with some of Frank’s old bazaar 
           costumes.

           Finishing their run through the field, the freckle-faced girl 
           stops to pick a handful of flowers.

           Frank stares up at the sky -- Professor Coe’s balloon still 
           floating just above the clouds.

           From the farmhouse window, Matilda looks out onto the yard 
           with a wary eye.

           END OF SEQUENCE.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Looking outside at the nonsense in the yard, Matilda can’t 
           help but grumble.

           Standing just beside Frank’s workspace, she stares down at 
           the disorganized desk. 

           Quickly scanning the area to make sure she’s alone, Matilda 
           picks up Frank’s book -- the title “THE NEW WORLD” now 
           written on the cover. 
           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Frank sits on the edge of the bed, talking with Dorothy. The 
           little dog sitting in her lap.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’m sorry I can’t be there. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh but you will be. 

           Frank pulls the silver slippers out from under the bed.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You may not be able to leave this 
                        bed but -- just use these, and you 
                        can be there if you’d like.   

           Dorothy takes the slippers, smiling.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        There’s something I wanted to show 
                        you.

           Frank pulls a folded up piece of paper from his coat pocket. 
           He hands it off to Dorothy, the girl opening it up.

           It’s an illustration of an adorable little girl with pigtails 
           and a blue dress. A scrappy little black dog beside her.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Is this...me? And Toto?

           Frank nods.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Look, Toto. Isn’t it lovely?

           She shows the drawing to Toto. Frank getting up for the door. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        How’s the book coming, Uncle Frank?

           He’s hesitant to answer.

                                 FRANK
                        Nearly finished now. Though I still 
                        haven’t quite figured out what’s 
                        waiting there at the end of the 
                        road. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Well whatever it is, I’m sure it’ll 
                        be wonderful.
           INT. ABERDEEN TAVERN - DAY

           William nervously paces the creaky tavern floor, constantly 
           checking his pocket watch. Not their busiest hour.

           Frank rushes inside, out of breath.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’re late.

           William straightens out Frank’s tie.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s theatre for you. Always 
                        preparing until the very last 
                        second.

           Frank spins around -- looking more suave than usual. His top 
           hat shinier, his coattails longer. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        How do I look?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Like a dead man walkin.

           Nobody asked grumpy old bartender.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE (O.S.)
                        BAUM. Baum you in there?!

           Frank turns towards the door, Rak standing just outside. 

                                 FRANK
                        Well then. Showtime.

           He stands upright, swallowing his fear and marching out the 
           door.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - MATILDA’S ROOM - DAY

           Matilda sits on her bed, all neat and tidy. Twiddling her 
           thumbs for a moment, uncomfortable.

           She pulls a book from under her pillow -- Frank’s book. Even 
           though she’s clearly alone, Matilda looks around. Cautious. 
           Opening the book to the first page...
           JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR

           A BRIGHT, GLOWING GOLDEN LIGHT seeps through the crack 
           beneath the door. 

           A single BUTTERFLY - complete with all the colors of the 
           rainbow - comes flying out from under the door, fluttering 
           through the house.

           EXT. STREETS OF ABERDEEN - DAY

           We follow Frank’s sleek black shoes as they take their place 
           at the center of the dusty city street.

           And just across the way stand Rak’s worn and torn spur boots. 
           Totally opposite fashion statements. 

           It’s dead silent -- save for the sound of Rak hacking up a 
           wad of spit. There might as well be tumbleweeds blowing 
           through the street. ABERDEEN CITIZENS, Frank’s family, watch 
           from along the storefronts. 

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        Gotta say, Baum. I didn’t think 
                        you’d have the stones to show. 

           Frank too attempts to spit...only much less successfully. Rak 
           can’t help but laugh.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re gonna wish I hadn’t, Rak. 
                        You don’t have the slightest idea 
                        what you’re in for. If only you 
                        knew what I’m capable of. 

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        HAH. I know full well what you’re 
                        capable of. Runnin. Bein a sissy. 
                        And after today -- dyin. 

           Frank looks over to Maud on the sidelines. She gives him a 
           smile for good luck.

           Frank takes off his holster belt and throws it to the ground, 
           turning back to Rak with conviction. 

                                 FRANK
                        You’re wrong. I’m capable of things 
                        beyond your wildest dreams. Things 
                        you couldn’t possibly fathom.

           He takes a step forward -- Rak flinching, putting his hand on 
           his weapon. 
                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        You stay put now. Pick up your 
                        weapon and let’s finish this like 
                        men.  

           Frank smiles with a sudden burst of confidence.

                                 FRANK
                        I have no need for such primitive 
                        tools. 

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        Primitive?

           Frank walks circles around an increasingly-confused Rak.

                                 FRANK
                        My powers far exceed those of 
                        mortal men. They’ve no doubt proven 
                        useful in the past for slaying 
                        dragons such as yourself.

                                 RAK THE TERRIBLE
                        Best watch who you’re callin a 
                        dragon.

           FROM FRANK’S POV -- still in the middle of Aberdeen street, 
           only now the creature that stands before Frank is that 
           fierce, red-eyed DRAGON we saw before. The hideous winged 
           beast towering over the Aberdeen skyline. Thick black smoke 
           rising from its nostrils. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh I know precisely who I’m calling 
                        a dragon. A dragon who breathes 
                        fire and levels cities to make up 
                        for the fact deep down inside, he’s 
                        just a scared little boy. 

           The dragon lets out a deafening ROAR, the streets TREMBLING 
           with every step the beast takes. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        And unfortunately for you, a dragon 
                        is no match for the magics of a 
                        wizard.

           The dragon - sounding eerily similar to Rak - lets out a 
           bellowing laugh.
                                 THE DRAGON
                        HAH. A wizard? There is no such 
                        thing.  

           Frank takes his position. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh but it’s true. I am a wizard. A 
                        great - and POWERFUL - wizard.

           Rolling up his sleeves, frank motions to the chubby kid 
           standing on the sidelines watching.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Here, let me show you.

           The pudgy boy looks scared out of his mind, backing up.

                                 CHUBBY KID
                        No, no -- please don’t do it!

           The boy flees and hides inside the tavern -- just before a 
           quick FLASH OF LIGHT appears from the other side of the 
           doors.

           A moment later, a little dog - Toto - comes running out from 
           the tavern, wearing a shirt. The chubby kid’s shirt.

                                 THE DRAGON
                        What happened to the child?

           Toto jumps up into Frank’s arms. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh not to worry. The only concern 
                        he’ll have from now on is the size 
                        of his fleas. 

           Frank puts the dog down, Toto running back to Maud.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Now I ask you once again. Do you 
                        really wish to challenge a great 
                        and powerful wizard such as myself?

           The dragon opens his mouth full of razor sharp teeth, letting 
           a STREAM OF FIERY BREATH out into the sky. The onlookers 
           ducking, cowering in fear. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Very well.

           Frank raises his arms up into the air, closing his eyes.
           The sky begins to darken. Pitch black clouds rolling in, 
           swirling above Frank.

           The skies come alive. THUNDER BOOMING.

           BAUM’S BAZAAR

           The storefront now bare and empty and -- a group of kids, led 
           by the freckle-faced girl, BANG ON A DOZEN PIECES OF SHEET 
           METAL all lined up in a row, funneling the sound into some 
           type of megaphone device. Our thunderous sound.

           EXT. STREETS OF ABERDEEN - DAY

           The dragon looks up at the stormy sky, fear in his eyes. The 
           sound of the thunder growing louder.

                                 FRANK
                             (growing angry)
                        YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DEFY 
                        THE GREAT AND POWERFUL WIZARD OF 
                        ABERDEEN?

           And with one fell swoop, Frank STOMPS HIS FOOT down onto the 
           ground, throwing hands forward--

           THE DOORS OF EVERY SHOP ON THE STREET FLY OPEN IN UNISON, THE 
           WINDOWS SHATTERING AS THE SKY ROARS--

           ABERDEEN DRUGSTORE

           Little Robert stands near a GREASY-HAIRED BOY at the window. 
           The kid spacing out.

                                 ROBERT
                             (whispering)
                        Psst. You missed your cue.

           Snapping out of it, the greasy-haired boy SHATTERS the window 
           with the end of an umbrella.

           EXT. STREETS OF ABERDEEN - DAY

           Brushing himself off with a sense of pride, Frank steps 
           closer to the dragon.

                                 FRANK
                        Now then, dragon. I order you to 
                        leave this place. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Go far away and never return, 
                        before I’m forced to unleash the 
                        most terrible of magics.

           The beast looks to his sides, the onlookers staring him down. 
           The dragon slowly backing away...

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I SAID GO!

           As Frank raises his hands once more -- EXPLOSIONS FIERY COLOR 
           ERUPT IN THE SKY, BOOMING as they scatter.

           The dragon nearly trips over itself, expanding its wings and 
           soaring up into the sky.

                                                          SMASH BACK TO 
                                                               REALITY:

           They sky as clear as day. Rak falls backwards into the dirt, 
           losing his hat. Struggling to stand, he doesn’t even bother 
           picking it up. Too terrified. He gets to his feet, running 
           off down the street with high-pitched SHRIEK. 

           BEHIND THE TAVERN

           Junior and a few of the other kids continue to set off the 
           last of the fireworks. Laughing up a storm.

           EXT. STREETS OF ABERDEEN - DAY

           With Rak now out of sight, the crowd on the street CHEERS and 
           APPLAUDS. They’re in an uproar, one heck of a show.

           Frank removes his hat and bows...until something’s off. 

           Not sure quite what. Frank suddenly hunching over, grabbing 
           his chest. As we begin to hear the RAPID BEATING OF HIS 
           HEART. 

           Maud stops clapping, sensing something’s wrong.

                                 MAUD
                        Frank?

           Frank falls to his knees -- then COLLAPSES to the ground.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        Frank!

           Maud rushes to his side as fast as she can, Emily following 
           behind. 
           The rest of the crowd slowly gathering around...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - FRANK AND MAUD’S ROOM - EVENING

           Frank lays in bed, sweaty. His eyes slowly opening, finding 
           Doctor Smith standing over him.

                                 DOCTOR SMITH
                        Evening, Frank. Glad to have you 
                        back with us.

           Maud sits at the edge of the bed, holding Frank’s hand. Tears 
           in her eyes.

                                 MAUD
                        You gave us quite the scare.

           Frank attempts to sit up.

                                 DOCTOR SMITH
                        Easy. 

           Maud repositions the pillow, allowing Frank to sit 
           comfortably. 

                                 FRANK
                        Rak?

                                 MAUD
                        You did it. You slayed the dragon.

           The doctor begins to pack up his medical kit.

                                 DOCTOR SMITH
                        But not without a price. Frank, 
                        we’ve been over this, time and time 
                        again. You shouldn’t be subjecting 
                        yourself to such--

                                 FRANK
                        Excitement. I’m aware, doc. Thanks.

                                 DOCTOR SMITH
                        This was a close one. The closest. 
                        Next time you might not be so 
                        lucky.

           Doctor Smith picks up his bag and heads for the door.
                                 DOCTOR SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You stay put, Frank. No more 
                        traveling. No more gunfights. Find 
                        a relaxing hobby for the love of 
                        God. I’ll be back in a week.

           The doc exits, leaving Frank and Maud alone on the bed.

                                 FRANK
                        The doc give you a hard time?

                                 MAUD
                        I believe the phrase he used to 
                        describe your condition was, “a 
                        walking barrel of dynamite ready to 
                        explode at any moment.”

           Frank smiles, Maud giving him a kiss on the forehead.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        What you did out there today, 
                        Frank...you have a gift. The 
                        wizard, well I think he’s one of 
                        the most wonderful characters 
                        you’ve ever created.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s just a man.

                                 MAUD
                        Maybe. But he’s a good man. A man 
                        who’s spent his life doing 
                        everything in his power to care for 
                        the ones he loves. To provide for 
                        them, even when it meant 
                        sacrificing his magic, his 
                        ambitions. 

           This hits Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Or maybe he was just afraid he’d 
                        fail.

           There’s a KNOCK at the door, Junior and Robert entering.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Dad?

           Frank and Maud are happy to see them.

                                 FRANK
                        Come here, soldiers. We have a 
                        victory to celebrate!
           The boys run to the bed, Robert diving headfirst into Frank’s 
           arms.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAWN

           The weather vane atop the barn turns slightly in the morning 
           breeze.

           The clouds breaking up as the sun rises over the plains. The 
           faint sound of a ROOSTER’S CALL from across the yard, time to 
           wake up.

                                 DOROTHY (V.O.)
                        Oh Uncle Frank...

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - FRANK AND MAUD’S ROOM - DAWN

           Frank’s eyes open, waking up to the sight of a slobbering, 
           BARKING Toto standing on his stomach. He’s not sure what to 
           make of it.

                                 FRANK
                        So the dog speaks.

                                 DOROTHY (O.S.)
                        It’s me, Uncle Frank.

           Frank turns to find a laughing Dorothy standing beside the 
           bed, holding a tray with a bowl of steaming hot soup.

                                 FRANK
                        So it is.

           Dorothy rests the tray on the bed.

                                 DOROTHY
                        My ma made you soup. I hope you 
                        like it. It’s cabbage.

                                 FRANK
                        Tell me, little princess. Does your 
                        grandmother know you’re out of bed? 

           Dorothy nods.

                                 DOROTHY
                        She says I’m getting better. She 
                        says maybe - just maybe - I’ll even 
                        get to go to school next week. 
                        Isn’t that great news?
                                 FRANK
                        The greatest news I’ve ever heard.

           Frank tastes a spoonful of soup. Soothingly delicious.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        It’s as if we’ve swapped roles, 
                        isn’t it? I used to be the one 
                        visiting you in bed. 

           Dorothy sits beside him, holding Toto in her arms.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Just think, with all the time you 
                        have to rest now, you’ll finally be 
                        able to finish your book. Toto and 
                        I can’t wait to read it.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh you’ll be the first. That’s a 
                        promise.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Using a cane to get around, Frank hobbles across the room to 
           his cluttered working space.

           He stares down at his desk, piles of disorganized papers 
           everywhere. Not an inch of clear surface visible. Curious, he 
           rifles through the mess, searching.

           He looks harder, faster. Throwing stacks of paper to the 
           floor, his book nowhere to be found.

           He turns to his two columns of filing cabinets. Opening the 
           first drawer - A-N - skimming through it. Nothing.

           Closing the first drawer, he opens the second. Furiously 
           searching through this one. Nothing again.

           After he SLAMS the drawer shut, something catches his eye. 
           The name plate on the front of this second drawer--

           O-Z.

           He runs his fingers over the letters, floating off to some 
           other world.

                                 ROBERT
                        Papa?

           Little Robert runs into the room, snapping him out of it.
                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        I’m supposed to tell you that we, 
                        umm. Shoot. I mean what I’m 
                        supposed to say is -- please come 
                        outside, we’ve got something to 
                        show you. Please.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - FIELDS - DAY

           Robert leads his father through the infinite columns of wheat 
           stalks, the hot midday sun beaming down on them. 

                                 FRANK
                        What’re you up to, Robbie? Your 
                        brother put you up to this?

                                 ROBERT
                        Shhh. It’s a surprise.

           Pressing forward, Frank drips with sweat, pushing away the 
           stalks in front of him.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        We’re here.

           Robert comes to a halt, stepping aside so Frank can see 
           what’s standing before him. He has to squint to see it in the 
           sun, the “surprise.”

           A SCARECROW. Nailed to a post, straw sticking out from its 
           overalls, every which way. Cutout eyes in its burlap face. 

           Junior, Dorothy, and little Toto step out from behind.

                                 JUNIOR
                        So? Do you like it?

           Frank steps towards the scarecrow, his gaze not letting up. 
           Like those burlap eyes are digging deep into his soul. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Uncle Frank?

           Frank smiles up at the scarecrow, before turning around to 
           face the kids.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s a fine piece of craftsmanship. 
                        BUT, we can do better.
           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - FIELDS - DUSK

           The sun sets beyond the plains, a shade of orange peeking 
           through the clouds.

           Frank puts the finishing touches on the scarecrow, shoving 
           some additional straw into its neck.

                                 FRANK
                        And finally...

           He takes one last look at it. The scarecrow now with a big 
           wide smile on its face, a farmer’s hat atop its head.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Voila. A bona fide scarecrow.

           The three kids APPLAUD with glee. They’re all sitting in the 
           grass, snacking on golden brown ginger snaps.

           Toto looks up at the smiling dummy, BARKING.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Did I ever tell you boys about the 
                        house I grew up in?

           Frank joins the kids sitting down.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Well we had a scarecrow. Just like 
                        this one. Scared me half to death. 
                        Though I suppose that just means he 
                        was doing his job.

           Frank smiles at his own cleverness.

                                 JUNIOR
                        No reason to be afraid of a 
                        scarecrow, dad. They don’t have any 
                        brains.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Do you think we should give him 
                        some?

           Junior and Robert laugh at Dorothy’s comment -- until they 
           hear something nearby in the field. 

           FOOTSTEPS.

           A towering, hunched shadow appears on the ground...just 
           before Matilda emerges from the wheat stalks.
                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        There you are.

           The kids all breathe a sigh of relief.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        You children have been out here all 
                        day. Go on then, inside with ya. 
                        Supper’s on the stove.

           The three kids stand, walking towards the house with their 
           heads held low. Defeated.

           Matilda circles the scarecrow, looking it up and down.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        So this is what you’ve been up to, 
                        hm? Working on this -- interesting 
                        looking gentleman?

           Frank stands and dusts himself off, ready for a fight.

                                 FRANK
                        Look, Matilda--

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Looks an awful lot like the 
                        scarecrow in your book. Wouldn’t 
                        you say, Frank?

           Frank’s frozen in his tracks. Cat’s got his tongue. 

           Matilda pulls a book - Frank’s book - from her coat, handing 
           it over to Frank.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        Now before you go judging me, 
                        accusing me of thievery or any of 
                        that rubbish, you must understand 
                        that I’d do just about anything in 
                        the world to protect my family. And 
                        you can’t blame a woman for wanting 
                        a glimpse at the one thing on which 
                        the future of this family might be 
                        determined. That being said...
                             (hard to say)
                        It’s enchanting, Frank. The best 
                        you’ve ever written.

           Frank takes the book from Matilda, still a little shaken up. 
           Either uncomfortable or just in disbelief.
                                 FRANK
                        You read the entire thing then?

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        You need a more suitable name for 
                        this land you’ve created. “The New 
                        World?” Honestly, Frank. That 
                        simply won’t do.

                                 FRANK
                        Well I’m -- I’ve been working on 
                        it.

           Matilda steps closer, making certain he hears what she has to 
           say.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        I was wrong. I’ve seen it in the 
                        way you’ve emboldened that girl. 
                        There is a place for fantasy in 
                        this world, Frank. People need to 
                        dream.

           She turns to leave, walking away...but stops suddenly, 
           looking back at Frank.

                                 MATILDA GAGE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, there was one more thing. In 
                        the story, your Wicked Witch as 
                        she’s called...

                                 FRANK
                        Yes?

           Frank knows what’s coming, swallowing his fear.

                                 MATILDA GAGE
                        Quite a lovely character, isn’t 
                        she?

           She walks away for good this time, leaving Frank aghast in 
           the field. Fanning himself off with the scarecrow’s hat.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           A KNOCK at the front door. 

           Maud rushes to answer, opening it up to find William.

                                 MAUD
                        William? What a lovely surprise.

           William takes off hat, the gentleman he is.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Good day, Mrs. Baum. Is Frank 
                        ready? 

                                 MAUD
                        Ready? Ready for what?

           Frank rushes into the room, all dressed up and ready to go. 
           He grabs his suitcase, his hat from the rack.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You didn’t tell her? Well now I 
                        just feel awkward.

           Frank sets down his case, turning to Maud. Resting his hands 
           on her shoulders.

                                 FRANK
                        Maud, dear...

                                 MAUD
                        No. Frank, I can’t -- I won’t let 
                        you. The doctor clearly said--

                                 FRANK
                        I won’t be gone long. And if things 
                        go our way, when I return we’ll 
                        have reason to celebrate. I give 
                        you my word...I’ll be back before 
                        Junior’s 40th birthday.

           Maud doesn’t find that the least bit funny, her face 
           unflinching.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        This is something I have to do. For 
                        us. For me. 

           Picking up his bag, he gives Maud a kiss before following 
           William out the door. 

                                 MAUD
                             (under her breath)
                        I know.

           EXT. UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD - DAY

           The TRAIN chugs along the tracks beneath the bright blue sky, 
           leaving its trail of black smoke behind. It’s like there’s an 
           urgency to it this time.

           The glowing Chicago skyline visible in the distance.
           EXT. WAY AND WILLIAMS PUBLISHING FIRM - DAY

           The corporate office smack dab in the middle of the busy city 
           street, the heart of downtown. 

           INT. WAY AND WILLIAMS PUBLISHING FIRM - DAY

           The slow TICKING of a clock on the wall. Each turn of the 
           hand more obnoxious than the last.

           Art and accolades from some of the firm’s published works 
           hang framed on the walls. Desiree’s Baby and A Night In 
           Acadie among others.

           Frank and William sit opposite a large desk. Frank’s leg 
           bouncing up and down, anxious.

           He’s constantly checking his pocket watch.

                                 FRANK
                        What do you suppose it means, that 
                        they’re taking so much time? Do you 
                        suppose it means they love it? Or 
                        do you suppose it means they’re 
                        going to pass? No, they won’t pass. 
                        What do you suppose it means?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t suppose it means anything.

           Focused on the twitching leg, William rests his hand on 
           Frank’s arm, calming him.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have a thing in the world 
                        to worry about. It’s incredible, 
                        sir. And I’m honored to be a part 
                        of it.

           This relaxes Frank a bit.

                                 FRANK
                        Your “kids drawings” as you call 
                        them, are going to inspire millions 
                        of children around the world. 
                        Cherished for the ages. Believe me, 
                        the honor is mine. 

           The door opens, both men standing as Mr. Bristle enters the 
           room. He’s carrying a giant stack of paper. Frank’s 
           manuscript. 
                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        Please, sit.

           They do. Mr. Bristle taking a seat at the opposite them, 
           PLOPPING the manuscript down onto the desk. 

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        We have a history, Frank. You and I 
                        go back a long ways, isn’t that 
                        right?

           Frank nods.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        So when you told me you had been 
                        working on something, a book, I 
                        naturally assumed it was a dramatic 
                        piece. Something to the tune of 
                        Maid of Arran. Folks adored that 
                        play, did they not?  

                                 FRANK
                        With all due respect, Mr. 
                        Bristle...Maid of Arran wasn’t me. 
                        Truth be told I had never been more 
                        happy in my life than when that 
                        theater burned to the ground. 

           William does his best to conceal his smile. 

           Mr. Bristle leans forward on the desk, hands folded.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        I can’t publish this, Frank.

           A punch to the gut for Frank, the wind knocked out of him.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        Speaking as a businessman, there’s 
                        just no demand for an American 
                        fairytale. Children have their 
                        nursery rhymes, their Grimm 
                        stories. But if I published this? A 
                        story about a talking scarecrow and 
                        a man made out of tin...little 
                        people and flying monkeys? Well I’d 
                        be chased outta here, tarred and 
                        feathered.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you for your time.

           Frank can’t even make eye contact with him. He reaches for 
           his manuscript, quick to leave
                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        BUT, speaking as your friend -- I 
                        think it’s bloody brilliant.

           Frank and William are both caught off guard, some life back 
           in their eyes.

                                 MR. BRISTLE (CONT’D)
                        I started on page one and woke up 
                        on page two-seventeen. What 
                        happened in between was a dream. 
                        I’ve never read anything like it, 
                        Frank. Truly. But I just can’t take 
                        financial risk. I’m sorry.

           Mr. Bristle stands, extending his hand. 

           Still feeling defeated, Frank gets up and shakes Bristle’s 
           hand.

                                 FRANK
                        I understand. Thank you, old 
                        friend.

           Him and William turn to leave, heading for the door.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What if we did?

           Frank pauses, turning back towards Mr. Bristle.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Took the financial risk, I mean. 
                        What if it was on our shoulders, 
                        not yours? 

           William’s a little lost.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        You mean self-publishing? That’s 
                        awfully bold, Frank.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (through his teeth)
                        Yes, Frank. Awfully. Bold.

           Excitement in his step, Frank approaches Mr. Bristle. He 
           means business.
                                 FRANK
                        Between what the two of us earned 
                        on the road this past month, I’d 
                        imagine William and I would have 
                        enough to cover the costs. As long 
                        as you’d handle the distribution, 
                        of course.

                                 MR. BRISTLE
                        I’ll have to talk to my partners, 
                        but -- I think we can make that 
                        work.

           As Frank and Mr. Bristle shake hands once again, William 
           hurries over, in a panic.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (a quiet yell)
                        FRANK?

           Frank doesn’t have to utter a word. He just gives William 
           that desperate, persuasive stare.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Ah, to hell with it. To Oz? 

           Frank throws his arm around William.

                                 FRANK
                        To Oz.

           EXT. STREETS OF ABERDEEN - EVENING

           The skies are a nasty shade of grey. FLASHES OF LIGHTNING in 
           the distance.

           The winds begin to pick up, dust blowing everywhere. The 
           people of Aberdeen clearing the streets in a rush, the men 
           holding down their hats.

           They run for cover in the local storefronts, shops closing 
           up.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - EVENING

           The roar of THUNDER begins as a buggy pulls up outside, Frank 
           stepping out and making a run for the door. The RAIN starting 
           to come down hard.
           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - EVENING

           Frank enters the house, dripping wet.

                                 FRANK
                        Hello?

           Maud enters the room, approaching Frank.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Aha. My queen.

           Frank pulls a somewhat bent, damp bouquet of yellow roses 
           from his coat, handing them off to Maud. He kneels before 
           her.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I struggle for words in the 
                        presence of your beauty. 

                                 MAUD
                        Frank...

           Frank leaps to his feet, grabbing Maud by her hands. He 
           twirls her about, dancing with her across the room. Making 
           his own jolly music, HUMMING loudly. He’s floating on air, 
           until--

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        FRANK.

           It stops. She has his attention.

                                 MAUD (CONT’D)
                        It’s Dorothy.

           That’s all she has to say. He knows, and his world comes 
           crashing down.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Frank quietly follows Maud into the room, taking off his hat.

           The others are already there. Junior and Robert sitting with 
           Matilda in the corner of the room, Emily standing beside the 
           bed.

           Dorothy perks up a bit at the sight of her uncle. She’s paler 
           than ever, wet with sweat. Bags under her eyes. Yet, she 
           still has that glow about her.
                                 DOROTHY
                        Uncle Frank, you’re back.

                                 FRANK
                        Indeed I am, little princess. 

           He takes a seat on the bed, forcing little Toto out of his 
           spot.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t really think I’d let you 
                        go without saying goodbye.

           Dorothy goes into a COUGHING FIT. Emily quickly wiping her 
           daughter’s chin with a damp cloth. Faint specks of blood.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Go where?

           Frank lifts up the bottom end of the bedsheets, Dorothy still 
           wearing her silver slippers.

                                 FRANK
                        Why on your journey to Oz, of 
                        course. Where else?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Oz? Well will you all be there, 
                        too?

                                 FRANK
                        Oh I imagine we will. Everything 
                        that’s happened until now - finding 
                        those slippers, retrieving your 
                        voice from that wicked old witch, 
                        meeting Toto - it’s all led you 
                        here.

           Frank pulls something from his coat. A hardcover book, neatly 
           wrapped in newspaper. He hands it off to Dorothy. 

           She tears through the paper like it’s Christmas morning. Her 
           eyes lighting up...

                                 THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ                                                                                               
                                      BY L. FRANK BAUM

           The text printed in emerald green, an illustration of the 
           lion on the front.

           She opens to the first page. Only the words “FOR DOROTHY” 
           fill the space.
                                 DOROTHY
                        For...me?

           Frank nods with a smile. Maud taking her husband’s hand.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Could you read it, Uncle Frank? 
                        You’re a much better storyteller 
                        than I am.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh. Well, I’m not quite sure--

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        Dad. 

           Frank turns to his boys. They need this.

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Please?

           Frank looks to Emily for approval.

                                 EMILY
                        You’ve done so much for us already, 
                        Frank. I hate to ask, but, I think 
                        we could all use a story right 
                        about now.

           Dorothy holds the book out for Frank. He takes it, turning 
           the page.

                                 FRANK
                             (from the book)
                        Dorothy lived in the midst of the 
                        great Kansas prairies, with Uncle 
                        Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt 
                        Em, who was the farmer’s wife...

                                 DOROTHY
                        Em? That’ short for Emily, ma.

           The room lightens up a bit, laughing. Emily can’t help but 
           shed a tear as she smiles, arms around her girl.

                                 FRANK
                        It was Toto that made Dorothy 
                        laugh, and saved her from growing 
                        as gray as her other surroundings. 
                        Toto was not gray; he was a little 
                        black dog, with long silky hair and 
                        small black eyes that twinkled 
                        merrily on either side of his 
                        funny, wee nose. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Toto played all day long, and 
                        Dorothy played with him, and loved 
                        him dearly.

           Toto BARKS at the mere mention of his name. The room laughing 
           again.

           A FEW PAGES LATER

           Everyone’s completely into the story. Matilda and the boys 
           leaning forward, on the edge of their seats. Emily and 
           Dorothy enjoying every second of it.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see 
                        where the long grass bowed in waves 
                        before the coming storm. There now 
                        came a sharp whistling in the air 
                        from the south, and as they turned 
                        their eyes that way they saw 
                        ripples in the grass coming from 
                        that direction also. Suddenly Uncle 
                        Henry stood up. "There's a cyclone 
                        coming, Em."

           THUNDER BOOMS from outside, starling the room. The timing 
           almost eerie.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - FIELDS - EVENING

           The HOWLING of the winds. The fields being torn apart, almost 
           entirely dark except for the brief FLASHES of lightning.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - YARD - EVENING

           Dorothy’s little swing sits alone on the hill, being blown 
           back and forth by the raging winds and rains. The clouds 
           above the farmhouse begin to swirl. A FUNNEL forming over the 
           city of Aberdeen.

           The CELLAR DOOR pounded by the hail.

           EXT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - EVENING

           The funnel cloud forms into a full-on TWISTER. Touching down 
           just outside the farm.

           It’s sheer chaos. Almost impossible to see. Debris flying 
           everywhere, wooden fence-posts spinning about. Even some farm 
           animals - a pig, a chicken or two - pass us by.
           The farmhouse then becomes UPROOTED. Broken off from the 
           ground, being swept up into the heart of the monstrous 
           twister.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Then a strange thing happened. The 
                        house whirled around two or three 
                        times and rose slowly through the 
                        air. Dorothy felt as if she were 
                        going up in a balloon.

           The farmhouse lifted higher and higher up into the air.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - EVENING

           The room spins around and around, the bed rocking back and 
           forth. 

           Toto sliding across the floor. 

                                 FRANK
                        It was very dark, and the wind 
                        howled horribly around her, but 
                        Dorothy found she was riding quite 
                        easily. After the first few whirls 
                        around, and one other time when the 
                        house tipped badly, she felt as if 
                        she were being rocked gently, like 
                        a baby in a cradle.

           Matilda holds onto her chair for dear life, though the others 
           seem less worried. Still as into the story as ever.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy sat quite still, and waited 
                        to see what would happen...

           Junior and Robert rush over to the window, mouths agape. 
           They’re up in the clouds, pulling back the curtains to see 
           the dust and debris of the spinning cyclone. 

           An entire tree blows by. 

           Then a cow, MOOING as it passes. 

           William sitting at his desk, drawing. 

           The Wicked Witch on her broomstick, letting out a SCREECHING 
           LAUGH as she passes.
           THE EVENING SKY

           The farmhouse miles above ground, being thrown back and 
           forth. Until the cyclone dissipates. The winds slowing, and 
           the house begins to fall. 

           Falling straight towards us and landing with -- THUD.

           INT. AUNT EMILY’S FARMHOUSE - DOROTHY’S ROOM - EVENING

           It’s silent, a calmness sweeping the room.

           Dorothy’s a bit shaken up, getting her bearings. Everyone in 
           the room probably a little nauseous. 

           Frank shuts the book.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, Dorothy...I believe we’re 
                        here. 

           Dorothy looks towards the door, then up at her mom. Emily 
           giving her a nod of approval.

           The young girl throws off her sheets, climbing out of bed and 
           slowly walking towards the door.

           Her hand on the doorknob, she looks back at her Uncle Frank.

           Dorothy opens the door to find herself in--

           EXT. THE LAND OF OZ - DAY

           Dorothy squints as she exits the house. Everything so bright 
           and vivid. Overwhelming colors. 

           Wearing her silver slippers, she steps out into the center of 
           Munchkin Land -- onto the YELLOW BRICK ROAD. Toto at her 
           side.

           Flowers made from glass, seven feet tall. A pond with 
           gigantic lily pads, a quaint bridge above it. Butterflies 
           fluttering around.

           THE MUNCHKINS begin to emerge from their little cottages. 
           Giggling and whispering amongst themselves, the adorable 
           little people coming out to greet her.

           Two of them oddly resemble Junior and Robert, along with some 
           of the other children we’ve met. They bow before her.
           Still in awe, Dorothy walks across the bridge. 

           GLINDA THE GOOD WITCH waiting for her on the other end. 
           Cheeks sprinkled with glitter, flowing pink gown. She 
           resembles Maud.

           The smiling SCARECROW watches as he’s nailed up on his post, 
           waving to Dorothy. CROWS picking at his straw.

           THE TIN MAN chops his tree, stopping at the sight of Dorothy 
           approaching. He salutes her, and she salutes back.

           The LION emerges from the forest, also bowing to Dorothy. She 
           responds with a pat on the head.

           The Wicked Witch creeps behind a tree, lurking in the 
           shadows.

           The entire cast of characters follow behind as Dorothy 
           continues down the yellow brick road. A man waiting for her 
           at the top of the hill.

           THE WIZARD OF OZ - Frank - in his dapper tux and top hat, 
           extending his hand for Dorothy.

           She takes it, reaching the top. Quite a view from up here, 
           looking out over the land of Oz and the miles of yellow road. 
           Leading all the way to the sparkling EMERALD CITY.

           As the Wizard and Dorothy continue on, we move up past the 
           trees, into the skies above Oz.

           Our familiar “New World” hot air balloon passing by as we--

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” quickly became one of the most 
           popular and beloved children’s stories of all time, and sold 
           out all of its initial 35,000 copies released. The book would 
           go on to sell millions and millions of copies throughout the 
           world.

           The adventures of Dorothy continue to live on in the hearts 
           and minds of children everywhere.
