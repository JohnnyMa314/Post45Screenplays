                                     BEEF

                                      Jeff Lock
           EXT. US HIGHWAY 44 - NIGHT

           Rain falls on a desolate Midwestern highway. A lone sedan 
           speeds by with a thumping bass.

           INSIDE THE SEDAN

           JOHN, mid-20’s, drives with one hand casually on the steering 
           wheel. He has a shaved head and a NECK TATTOO OF A GRENADE. 
           His thin but muscular build read as ex-military. He carries a 
           thousand yard stare under glazed eyes as he raps along to the 
           blaring hip-hop with sporadic intensity. 

                                 JOHN
                        “The takeover. The breaks over 
                        nigga. God Emcee. Me. Jay Hova.”

           He begins fumbling in his cup holder, grazing an open beer 
           and a pill bottle, to find a wooden dug out. He flicks out a 
           one hitter and packs some marijuana, occasionally glancing at 
           the road. 

           Hands jittery, he lights up the one-ie and takes a hit. Just 
           as he steadies the steering wheel and enjoys the high... 

           TWO DEER. Frozen in his headlights.

           He SLAMS on the brakes and swerves. His reaction isn’t quick 
           enough as he PLOWS into both animals. He does a one-eighty 
           sending him off the road and SMASHING into a tree. 

           FROM THE HIGHWAY

           The sedan sits eerily quiet. The rear of the car wrapped 
           around the tree. The rain continues to fall. His headlights 
           illuminate the road in the direction where the deer were hit.

           John is slumped over in his seat. A long beat.

           He erupts in a hacking COUGH.

                                 JOHN
                        Shit...ahhh...

           BACK INSIDE 

           He slowly begins to stir, patting himself down to make sure 
           all is intact. He lifts up his wife beater to find...

           A HANDGUN

           Sloppily tucked in his waist. He takes a deep breath. He 
           removes the gun and sets it on the empty passenger seat. He 
           gains resolve and pries himself out of the car.
           NEXT TO THE HIGHWAY

           John stumbles around a bit. Surveying the damage... 

                                 JOHN
                        Dumb ass deer.

           He slowly limps onto the road. 

                                 JOHN
                        You better be dead you Bambi mother 
                        fuckers!

           He stumbles back toward where the deer were hit. He reaches 
           the edge of the pavement just as he spots the deer... 

           BROKEN INTO MULTIPLE PIECES. 

                                 JOHN
                        What the hell?

           He slowly bends down to pick up a piece of the deer’s leg. He 
           lifts it up, examining it. It dawns on him that the deer he 
           hit were fake, target practice deer made of Styrofoam. We 
           hear FOOTSTEPS ON THE GRAVEL, just as we see...

           TWO DARK FIGURES. Standing behind John.

           The headlights REVEAL the two men wearing dark clothing. 
           Their faces covered with creepy and surreal looking MASKS -- 
           designed to look like a DEER’S HEAD WITH ANTLERS. 

           A moment of realization flashes across John’s face. Instead 
           of turning, he drops to his knees and closes his eyes, 
           resigning to a fate he knew was overdue. 

           DEERMAN #1 lifts a CROWBAR and STRIKES him at the neck 
           instantly BREAKING IT. 

           John immediately goes limp, drops to the pavement. DEERMAN #2 
           stands by holding a shotgun, he nods to Deerman #1 who raises 
           the crowbar again and delivers another crushing blow to the 
           head. 

           The Deermen stare at John’s motionless body on the pavement. 

           A long beat.

                                 DEERMAN #2
                             (muffled)
                        Put him back in the car. 

           Deerman #1 grabs John’s legs and begins dragging his body 
           across the pavement. 
           As he does, we begin to here a low metallic whooshing sound. 
           Rhythmic. It begins growing louder... and LOUDER...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A PILE OF THINLY SLICED ROAST BEEF. 

           The pile grows as a slicer churns out the beef. We only hear 
           the sound of the slicer smoothly shredding the meat.  Over 
           and over again. Our trance is finally broken with...

                                 VOICE OVER
                        At Beefy’s, our customer service 
                        starts with beef. 

           PULL OUT TO REVEAL the edges of a television set. We are 
           watching a corporate video circa the 90’s, so lots of color 
           and diagonal transitions for no reason. 

           AN EMPLOYEE/ACTOR, smiles as she takes a tray of beef out of 
           an industrial oven.

                                 VOICE OVER
                        Slow cooked for over three hours, 
                        our roast beef packs juiciness and 
                        flavor in every single bite.

           INT. BEEFY’S - DAY

           WE FIND KIRSTEN, 16, a new Beefy’s employee. While she 
           watches this video on a shitty DVD/TV Combo, sounds of a busy 
           fast food restaurant roar to life. 

           She sits in an alcove of an office just off the prep area in 
           the kitchen.

                                 VOICE OVER (O.S.)
                        Next up... “The Slicer”

           Approaching her is JASON, 30. Young, clean cut, and 
           surprisingly handsome for this environment. He wears a Kohl’s 
           dress shirt and tie combo signifying fast food management. He 
           stops the DVD.

                                 JASON
                        Since you are under eighteen, you 
                        can’t use the slicer. So we can 
                        stop here.
                             (beat)
                        Plus this video is close to twenty 
                        years old, not much of it makes 
                        sense any more.
           Kirsten sits quietly.

                                 JASON
                        Any questions?

                                 KIRSTEN
                        You look kind of young to be a 
                        General Manager.

                                 JASON
                        Uh, yeah. I’m sort of interim 
                        General Manager. Tony, my boss, or 
                        was my boss. He had a stroke and 
                        passed away a week ago. I was an 
                        assistant manager but I’m taking 
                        his duties on for now, maybe 
                        longer.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        That sucks. I mean, it’s great that 
                        you are the manager and stuff. But 
                        your boss dying and all.

           Behind Jason, FLORENCE, a tenured elderly employee, plops 
           blobs of thawed roast beef onto a tray in the prep area.  

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, sure. He was with his family 
                        though... at Holiday World. Anyway, 
                        you’ll work the dinner rush. 
                        Amanda, will help you out with the 
                        registers...

           Kirsten watches Florence fling a roast that falls short of 
           the tray and smacks onto the tiled ground. Without a second 
           thought, Florence lifts the beef off the ground and puts it 
           back on the tray. 

                                 JASON
                        Next week, we’ll get you on drive-
                        thru...

                                 KIRSTEN
                             (interrupting)
                        She just dropped that on the 
                        ground. 

           Jason turns to see Florence attempting to clean bacteria from 
           uncooked meat by brushing it with her hand. Jason sighs.

                                 JASON
                        Florence. You can’t do that.

           Florence just looks at him.
                                 JASON
                        You just dropped that on the floor. 
                        We can’t use this now.

                                 FLORENCE
                        Oh, bologna. 

           Florence throws up her hands and walks off to get another 
           roast. Jason, frustrated, rips the chunk of beef off the tray 
           and tosses it in a trash can. He heads up front.

           AT THE REGISTERS

           We track Jason where he spots AMANDA, 27, also in managerial 
           garb, leaning over the counter. Jason momentarily enjoys the 
           view of her ass, until revealing... GREG, 30’s, Amanda’s 
           boyfriend. They kiss over the counter. 

                                 JASON
                        Amanda.

           Amanda stops. 

                                 AMANDA
                             (to Greg)
                        Bye. 

                                 GREG
                             (to Jason)
                        Sorry Jason, had to sneak one in. 
                        Congrats on the promotion by the 
                        way. And sorry to hear about Tony.

           Jason gives him a nod as Amanda approaches.

                                 AMANDA
                        Sorry, Greg’s going out of town 
                        tonight. 

                                 JASON
                        Where’s Chad and/or Griffin? 
                        Florence is in the back by herself 
                        and dropped an entire roast on the 
                        ground.

                                 AMANDA
                        Griffin called off, but Chad will 
                        be in later.
                             (whispering)
                        You should really get rid of her. 
                                 JASON
                             (quietly)
                        And be the guy who fires the old 
                        lady related to half of Muncie? 
                        She’s like a fucking community 
                        pillar.

                                 AMANDA
                             (laughing)
                        Cover the front and I’ll finish her 
                        prep. 

           She takes off her headset and hands it to Jason. He watches 
           her walk off, as he puts it on...

           BEEP.

           The notoriously piercing sound of a fast food drive-thru 
           speaker. A customer lies in wait. Jason presses the receiver 
           to answer.

                                 JASON
                             (into mic)
                        Welcome to Beefy’s, can I interest 
                        you in a Beefy Cheddar Combo today?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh, I’m interested in that Cheddar 
                        baby!

           Jason immediately recognizes the voice and cuts him off.

                                 JASON
                             (into mic)
                        Pull around Coop. 

           DRIVE-THRU WINDOW

           Jason flips open a take out bag, he looks around then removes 
           a WAD OF CASH from his pocket. He drops the money in the bag 
           as a smoggy P.O.S. car rolls up to the window blaring Eminem. 
           COOP, 29, a gangly white guy, rolls down the window and cuts 
           the music.

                                 COOP
                        Shit, I was going to order 
                        something. 

           Jason tosses the bag out of the window and into Coop’s lap.

                                 JASON
                             (firm)
                        I said I’d drop by later.
                                 COOP
                        Figured I’d save you a trip. 
                             (off the bag)
                        What’s this?

           Coop opens the bag spotting the cash, he smirks.

                                 COOP
                        Very sneaky. I thought you’d get us 
                        with the Pacer’s at home. You ask 
                        me, the NBA is rigged.

           Jason pulls out a FOLDED POSTCARD. As he unfolds it, a torn 
           piece of LOOSE-LEAF PAPER falls out. He shoves the postcard 
           back in his pocket, and clutches the scrap of paper. 

                                 COOP
                        Well, it’s been a pleasure doing 
                        business with you over the years.

           Jason hands the folded paper to Coop. 

                                 JASON
                        Here. I want to bet on the race.

                                 COOP
                        What race?

                                 JASON
                        The Indy 500.

           Coop busts out laughing, he unfolds the paper, his smile 
           fades.

                                 COOP
                        You’re serious?
                             (beat)
                        For this kind of cash? 

                                 JASON
                        I’m the General Manager now. I’ve 
                        got the money. 

           Coop looks ahead, uncomfortable.

                                 COOP
                        I don’t know man. I don’t think Dip 
                        will go for this. 
                             (beat)
                        I told you last week was the cut 
                        off. We’re suppose to leave town 
                        tomorrow.
                                 JASON
                        Just ask him. It’s a lot of action.

           BEEP. 

           Another customer is waiting. Coop studies the piece of paper.

                                 COOP
                        You do realize that if Danica 
                        Patrick wins, you’d be completely 
                        fucked?

                                 JASON
                        And how likely is it that a woman 
                        would win the Indy 500?

           Coop smiles and shakes his head. He turns his music back up.

                                 COOP
                        I’ll let you know.

           BEEP.

           Coop peels out of the drive-thru leaving a trail of smog. 
           Jason reaches back in his pocket and unfolds the postcard. 

           ON POSTCARD -- A FAKE SANTA CLAUS in a Hawaiian shirt, 
           smiling in front of a roller coaster and a sign for HOLIDAY 
           WORLD THEME PARK - SANTA CLAUS, INDIANA. 

           BACK ON JASON. Slightly disturbed but determined.

           BEEP.

           INT. DIP’S SISTER’S PLACE - NIGHT

           BEEP BEEP. BEEP BEEP. A timer sounds. 

           CLOSE ON a big industrial vat. A dark liquid bubbles for a 
           few seconds and then settles. 

           A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enters the frame laying a screen of 
           GREEN CAMOUFLAGE into the vat, similar to a silk screen. Once 
           the screen contacts the water, the CAMOUFLAGE begins floating 
           on the surface.

           A wooden shotgun stock is positioned above the liquid. The 
           hands slowly “dip” the stock into the camouflage, submersing 
           it completely. Once under for a few seconds, the wood is 
           smoothly lifted out, with the camouflage ‘painted’ onto the 
           stock permanently.

           This is “Camo Dipping”...real Redneck shit. 
           PULL BACK TO REVEAL, DIPPER, Late 30’s, a towering piece of 
           iron who is equal parts bookie, drug dealer, and camo dipping 
           enthusiast. He has a permanently worn look of severity etched 
           on his face. 

           He hangs the stock on a rack to dry. There’s a calming, 
           spiritual rhythm to his movements. The moment is broken by 
           Coop, who plows through the front door carrying the Beefy’s 
           bag. Dip peels off his gloves and begins wiping his hands on 
           a nearby towel. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Any problems?

                                 COOP
                        Naw, got it all collected. Saw Jim 
                        this morning, over in Rushville. 
                             (beat)
                        Said some kid was asking ‘bout you 
                        last week.

                                 DIPPER
                             (quick, dismissive)
                        Lots of people ask about me. 
                        Probably just looking to score. 

           Dip picks up a shotgun, already dipped, inspects the finish.

                                 COOP
                        Kid had a neck tattoo of a grenade, 
                        which is pretty tits if you ask me. 
                        He don’t sound familiar?

           Dipper eyeballs Coop. 

                                 DIPPER
                        I said I don’t know him.

           Coop knows better than to push the issue. 

                                 COOP
                        Yeah, Jim said he never seen him 
                        neither. 
                             (beat)
                        Collected from Jason, guy works at 
                        the Beefy’s here in Muncie. He 
                        wants to bet on the race tomorrow. 
                             (beat)
                        For ten grand.

           This stops Dipper. 
                                 COOP
                        I told him to fuck off. He knew we 
                        were leaving town tomorrow. Just 
                        like I told everybody else.

                                 DIPPER
                        What’s the bet?

           Coop pulls out the piece of paper Jason gave to him earlier.

                                 COOP
                        He wants to bet on the driver 
                        matchups. So, twenty-five hundred 
                        on Power over Patrick, another 
                        twenty-five hundred on Andretti 
                        over Patrick, and then another 
                        twenty-five hundred on Carpenter 
                        over Patrick.

                                 DIPPER
                        That’s only about eight grand 
                        depending on the lines.

                                 COOP
                        He also wants to put seven hundred 
                        on each on the three drivers he’s 
                        taking on the match-up bets, to win 
                        the race outright.

                                 DIPPER
                        He’s given up fourteen hundred 
                        right there.

                                 COOP
                        Yup, but he’s picking the favorite 
                        in every match-up and between those 
                        three drivers, he’s got a shot at 
                        picking the winner.

           Dipper contemplates. Coop laughs to himself.

                                 COOP
                        You got to hand it to him though, 
                        betting the farm against a woman 
                        driver? Pretty genius if you ask 
                        me. Ain’t no bitch going to win the 

           Dipper isn’t laughing.

                                 DIPPER
                        Any chance he could actually cover 
                        ten grand?
                                 COOP
                        He’s the general manager now. Other 
                        guy croaked. Figure he got a decent 
                        bump. But, we can’t take that bet, 
                        he could clean us out before we 
                        leave. If he wins...

                                 DIPPER
                             (interrupting)
                        Tell him we’ll take it.
                             (long beat)
                        It won’t matter if he wins. 

           Coop, realizing Dip doesn’t plan to pay, gives a sly smirk.

           INT. JASON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jason’s side table knocks against the wall as his cellphone 
           vibrates. A text from Coop lights up...

           TEXT: BET’S ON. Power OVER Patrick -225, Andretti OVER 
           Patrick -115... 

           REVEAL Jason breathing heavily as he plows away on top of 
           Amanda on the nearby bed. He finishes, takes a beat, and 
           falls off. Amanda leans over and delivers a long, sensual 
           kiss.

           They look at each other for a beat, and laugh. Impossible to 
           be serious with one another. Amanda slides out of the bed and 
           heads into an adjacent bathroom. Jason leans over to check 
           his phone, spotting the text from Coop. He smirks.

                                 JASON
                             (calls out)
                        You staying the night?

                                 AMANDA (O.S.)
                        Can’t. Greg could be back early 
                        tomorrow morning. 

                                 JASON
                        Hadn’t seen Greg around in awhile. 
                        He looks well.

           Amanda steps out of the bathroom. She begins getting dressed 
           as she pulls clothes from an overnight bag.

                                 AMANDA
                             (sarcastically)
                        Ha, ha, ha.
                                 JASON
                        You should really watch the PDA in 
                        the store though. 

           Amanda tosses a pile of clothes at Jason. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh yeah? What are you going to do, 
                        fire me?

                                 JASON
                        I could you know.

           Amanda jumps back onto Jason playfully pinning him down. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, somebody’s getting power hungry 
                        now that the King is dead. You’re 
                        the first in line to the throne.

           She begins kissing his neck. She realizes Jason isn’t 
           reciprocating. She pulls back, Jason looking distant.

                                 AMANDA
                        You okay?

                                 JASON
                        I don’t want to be the King. 

                                 AMANDA
                        What?

                                 JASON
                        Look at Tony. Worked for 35 years 
                        getting bossed around by customers, 
                        supervising teenagers, and eating 
                        Beefy’s twice a day. Jesus. Stroke 
                        at 52, died in Santa Claus, 
                        Indiana. That’s where I’m headed.
                             (beat)
                        I don’t want to die at Holiday 
                        World.

           Long beat.

                                 AMANDA
                        Splashin’ Safari.

                                 JASON
                        What?
                                 AMANDA
                        There’s Holiday World the theme 
                        park and Splashin’ Safari the water 
                        park. He had the stroke at the 
                        water park.

                                 JASON
                        Ugh. That’s even worse. He probably 
                        had his shirt off and everything. 

           Amanda starts to chuckle.

                                 JASON
                        What? This isn’t funny, this is my 
                        future we’re talking about.

                                 AMANDA
                        I doubt he went topless. 

           Jason laughs a little. 

                                 JASON
                        So, I’ll not only be the guy who 
                        has a stroke, but also that guy who 
                        wears a white t-shirt at the water 
                        park.

           They both are laughing. He takes a beat to look at Amanda.

                                 JASON
                        At least I’ve got you. This is 
                        about the only thing in my life I 
                        choose to do. 

           Amanda looks slightly uncomfortable, like she wants to say 
           something.

                                 JASON
                        What?

                                 AMANDA
                        Nothing.

           She leans over and kisses Jason sympathetically on the 
           forehead. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You don’t have to spend your life 
                        working at Beefy’s. No one has a 
                        gun to your head. 

           Jason lays back against the headrest. 
                                 JASON
                        I guess I’ve got no clue what I’d 
                        do if I didn’t work at Beefy’s.

           Amanda thinks about it.

                                 AMANDA
                        Just go to Florida. You’ll have to 
                        deal with the same crap there, but 
                        at least it’s sunny, and you can go 
                        to a real beach.

           Off Jason, considering the possibility.

           INT. BEEFY’S - DAY

           The restaurant is starting to fill up. Jason works the front 
           with a patented smile that one can only develop from years of 
           pretending to care about customers. He sets down a sandwich 
           and fries on a CUSTOMER’S tray.

                                 JASON
                        Enjoy that now.

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jason finds GRIFFIN, 20’s, a seasonal Beefy’s slacker, 
           cleaning dishes in a half-assed manner.

                                 JASON
                             (re: DVD/TV Combo)
                        That thing get regular channels?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        I wish.

           Jason looks at him.

                                 JASON
                        You don’t do much around here and 
                        I’m okay with that. It’s fast food, 
                        you don’t care, I get it. 

           Griffin just looks at Jason. Jason pulls out his iPhone.

                                 JASON
                        Figure out a way to get the audio 
                        to the 500 streaming on my phone. 

           Griffin dries his hands and grabs the phone.
                                 GRIFFIN
                        You put money on the race or 
                        something? 

                                 JASON
                        A little. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        What’s a little?

                                 JASON
                             (quick)
                        A hundred dollars. Can you figure 
                        it out?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Nice. Yeah I got it.

           EXT. BEEFY’S - LATER

           A LINE OF CARS snake around Beefy’s, impatiently creeping 
           their way to the Drive-Thru window. 

           LOUD SOUNDS OF INDYCARS ROAR IN THE DISTANCE...

                                 ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
                        ...with thirty laps left, the young 
                        Marco Andretti leads the 
                        Indianapolis 500. He’s followed by 
                        Ed Carpenter and Danica Patrick.

           INSIDE BEEFY’S

           Jason has his hand up to his ear leaning against the counter. 
           He pretends to compile figures on a ‘beef chart.’ An earbud 
           from his headphones is run up his shirt and through the 
           sleeve so he can discretely listen to THE AUDIO OF THE 
           RACE... 

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        Danica sure has shown what she’s 
                        made of today.

           TIGHT ON Jason. He winces at Danica’s name. He doodles on the 
           beef chart not writing anything in particular...

                                 AMANDA (O.S.)
                        Jason?

           Jason drops his hand from his head bringing us back to the 
           full sound of the restaurant. Amanda hovers.
                                 AMANDA
                        Can you do the beef charts after 
                        the rush? I’m getting slammed.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, sure.

           Jason drops the earbud and begins bagging an order.

           BATHROOM - LATER

           Jason bursts through the bathroom door. He frantically pulls 
           the headphones out of his shirt where he was hiding them. He 
           replugs them into his phone and puts on the headphones. 

                                 ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
                        With two laps left to go. The young 
                        Marco Andretti has maintained the 
                        lead.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        Eight more turns and the 
                        Indianapolis 500 is his. 

                                 JASON
                        Come on. Come on.

           Jason grips the sides of the sink as he listens intently.

                                 ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
                        It’ll be another high finish for 
                        Danica as well. She currently rides 
                        in second well behind the leader, 
                        Carpenter just after her.

                                 JASON
                             (intense)
                        C’mon Ed, get in there.

                                 ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
                        The white flag is out. Andretti now 
                        on his way to win his very first 
                        Indianapolis 500, one lap to go.

           Jason nodding his head, still determined.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        Listen to the crowd roar as Marco 
                        is through turn 2. Half a lap, half 
                        a lap and he is the Indy 500 
                        Champion...

           Jason looks up seeing himself in the mirror.
                                 JASON
                             (to himself)
                        Come on, come on.

                                 ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
                        Now here’s Andretti, finishing the 
                        backstretch. He’s into turn three, 
                        here’s four... no! 

                    ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                                                   ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
           Oh no!
                                              Oh my goodness!

                                 ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
                        Andretti is into the wall! He’s 
                        into the wall! Turn four. 

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        Oh my! He lost control, all alone.

                                 JASON
                        No. No. No.

                                 ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
                        Danica Patrick goes high to 
                        avoid... she’s gonna... she wins! 
                        She wins!

           Jason just stares into the mirror.

                                 ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
                        There’s the checkered flag! The 
                        first woman driver to win the 
                        Indianapolis 500.

           Jason still staring at himself, plucks the earbuds out of his 
           ears slowly. He takes a breath. Not sure what to do.

           Long beat.

           Jason turns on the faucet and hits two squirts of liquid soap 
           into his hands. He begins washing them like nothing has 
           happened. 

           He turns off the faucet and wipes his hands on a paper towel. 
           Shuts off the lights.

           EXT. BEEFY’S - NIGHT

           Jason leans against a brick wall behind Beefy’s. He takes a 
           long pull of a cigarette. The back door opens as Griffin 
           exits dragging two trash bags.
                                 GRIFFIN
                        How’d you do on the race? You get 
                        that hundo?

           Jason suppresses all emotion. 

                                 JASON
                             (flat)
                        Go away. 

           Griffin, puzzled, continues dragging the trash to the 
           dumpster.

           Jason’s cell phone rings. “COOP” lights up his caller ID. He 
           answers and listens.

                                 JASON
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah. I know. 
                             (listens)
                        Where?

           EXT. DIP’S SISTER’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Jason pulls up outside a typical cookie cutter two-level 
           suburban home. There is an oversized F-250 truck in the 
           driveway. Jason kills his engine and sits in the car for a 
           beat and takes a deep breath.

           Jason walks to the door, clutching a bag of Beefy’s, he 
           knocks. Coop opens up holding an assault rifle, camo stock, 
           and equipped with a bayonet. 

                                 COOP
                        Well, well, if it isn’t Mr. Danica 
                        Patrick.

                                 JASON
                             (re: assault rifle)
                        What the hell man, its me. 

                                 COOP
                        Can’t never be too careful. You 
                        better get inside, this baby’s not 
                        exactly street legal. 

                                 JASON
                        Is Dip here?

                                 COOP
                        Sure is.
           INSIDE

           Coop leads Jason into the dingy home. Sparsely decorated with 
           bullshit Target knickknacks and a few mounted deer heads. 
           Empty beer cans and cigarettes are spread about. 

           A large flat screen TV, with a paused PS3 game, sits in the 
           corner. There are multiple brand new leather furnishings. And 
           there’s one thing that stands out... the amount of items that 
           are decorated with CAMOUFLAGE.

           Coop walks in and sets down the assault rifle. He takes a 
           seat in a nearby chair.

                                 COOP
                             (yelling)
                        Dip! Jason’s here.

           Jason takes a seat across from Coop, uneasy. 

                                 JASON
                        Who lives here?

                                 COOP
                        It’s Dip’s sister’s place. We’ve 
                        been crashing here for a bit before 
                        we move to Wichita.

                                 DIPPER (O.S.)
                             (sharp)
                        Ain’t nobody’s business where we 
                        headed.

           Dipper enters the room which is now silent. He takes his time 
           to sit down on one of the leather couches. The leather 
           squeaks. 

                                 JASON
                             (nervous)
                        Hey, Dip.

           A long beat. Dipper is focused on the frozen image across the 
           TV screen. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Hey to you. 

           Dipper reaches over on a side table and grabs a pack of 
           cigarettes. He begins to pound the pack on his hand. Every 
           sound amplified in the quiet room.

                                 JASON
                             (re: Beefy’s bag)
                        I brought over some food. 
           Dip looks at the bag, plucks out a cigarette.

                                 DIPPER
                        You brought my cash?

                                 JASON
                        I’ll of course pay you all of the 
                        money. But, I just don’t have it 
                        all now.

           Beat.

                                 DIPPER
                        How much did you bring?

                                 JASON
                        About four hundred.

           Dipper doesn’t react. Just stares into Jason.

                                 DIPPER
                        Let’s see if I got this right. You 
                        come in here with a few roast beef 
                        sandwiches and ‘about’ four hundred 
                        dollars?
                             (laughs to himself)
                        Shit son, you must have one hell of 
                        a mouth, because the blow job 
                        you’re about to offer is going to 
                        run me some nine thousand dollars.

                                 JASON
                             (smiling a little)
                        I can get more tomorrow, but I 
                        figured you could run interest on 
                        the rest. ‘Juice’ you know? I can 
                        send it to where ever you guys are 
                        heading...

           BANG. Dip smashes his hand into the side table next to the 
           couch. This silences the room again. Dip continues to stare 
           intensely at Jason, never breaking away. He is about to 
           speak...

           THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. A blonde haired girl, LORELEI, 9, with a 
           perma-stain of red Kool-Aid around her mouth, comes storming 
           down the stairs. 

                                 LORELEI
                        Uncle Dip, Uncle Dip! Is my pink 
                        gun ready yet? Is it?

           The conversation is halted, Dip’s demeanor has softened in a 
           flash.
                                 DIPPER
                        Ah, aren’t you a sweet one. You’re 
                        after Uncle Dip’s heart getting 
                        into guns so early. I got it ready 
                        for you right here. 

           Dipper pulls out a PINK CAMOUFLAGED 4X10 SHOTGUN from under 
           the couch. The little girl squeals and jumps up and down.

                                 LORELEI
                        That’s so cool! Lemme see it.

           Jason can do nothing but observe this odd exchange. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Sure you can see it. But first can 
                        you run in the kitchen and grab me 
                        an apple?
                             (looking at his stomach)
                        Trying to eat healthier sweetie.

                                 LORELEI
                        Okay!

           The girl barrels off. Without speaking Dipper lifts a box of 
           shotgun shells up off the nearby table. 

                                 JASON
                             (rapid fire)
                        I can pay you in a month or two. I 
                        just need some time. If I pay with 
                        interest you stand to make more 
                        anyway...

           Dipper plucks FIVE SHOTGUN SHELLS from the box.

                                 JASON
                        Just give me some time. Please...

                                 DIPPER
                        I don’t care how you do it. But 
                        you’ll have that money by tomorrow 
                        night. We ain’t waiting around.

           As he speaks he slowly LOADS the shells into the clip of the 
           pink camouflaged shotgun. 

                                 JASON 
                        Wait. Wait. Dip. Coop. What the 
                        hell is going on here? I can get 
                        the money...

           The little girl comes flying back in holding an apple. 
                                 LORELEI
                        Here. Here. Now lemme see it.

           She gives the apple to Dip.

                                 DIPPER
                        Sure here you go.

           Dip HANDS the nine year old a LOADED SHOTGUN. 

           She struggles to move it around and careens the barrel past 
           Coop, who jumps out of its direction.

                                 COOP
                        Shit!

                                 JASON
                        Wait!

                                 DIPPER
                        Hey fellas, why don’t we all calm 
                        down and let Lori play with her new 
                        pink gun.

           Both men are frozen. 

                                 LORELEI
                        It’s heavy Uncle Dip. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Be careful. Now what have I told 
                        you? You have to treat every gun 
                        like it’s loaded at all times. 

                                 LORELEI
                        I know what I’m doing!

           Lorelei aims at random objects in the room.

                                 DIPPER
                        Hey Lori, you ever hear the story 
                        of William Tell?

                                 LORELEI
                        No.

           She now holds the gun slumped down. Jason shifts in his seat.  

                                 DIPPER
                        Ol’ William Tell had to prove how 
                        good of a shot he was. And do you 
                        know what he had to do?
                                 LORELEI
                        What?

                                 DIPPER
                        He had to shoot an apple off his 
                        own son’s head to save his life.

                                 LORELEI
                        Really?

                                 DIPPER
                        Really...now I don’t remember the 
                        point of the story, but do you 
                        think you could shoot an apple of 
                        someone’s head?

                                 LORELEI
                        Uhh..duhh..Of course I can!

           Dipper flips the apple and hits Jason square in the chest 
           forcing him to catch it.

                                 COOP
                        Hey Dip, how bout we...

                                 DIPPER
                        Put the apple on your head Jason.

                                 JASON
                        Dip, I...

                                 DIPPER
                             (deadly serious)
                        Do it now.

                                 LORELEI
                        Yeah, do it. Do it!

           Jason doesn’t move. From out of the little girl’s vantage 
           point, Dipper slides a Glock 9 millimeter from his waist and 
           sets it down on the side table. Dip takes this time to 
           finally light his cigarette. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Put the apple on your head Jason, 
                        you heard the little lady.

           Jason, defeated, slowly puts the apple on his head. 
                                 DIPPER
                             (directing Lorelei)
                        Now lift that barrel up and make 
                        sure you aim that bead right at the 
                        apple. Don’t hold the trigger ‘til 
                        you’re ready to shoot.

           Jason’s breathing deepens. The room is gravely intense as the 
           little girl lifts up the barrel, struggling to keep it from 
           bobbing up and down. 

                                 COOP
                             (whispering)
                        Jesus Dip.

           Lori slowly begins to steady the aim. The barrel still bobs 
           up then down, with the bead in the vicinity of Jason’s face.

                                 DIPPER
                        Hold it still Lore. Don’t pull the 
                        trigger until you have it square on 
                        the apple. Just like I taught you.

           Jason closes his eyes, wincing. Lorelei puts her finger on 
           the trigger... and...

                                 LORELEI
                        My arms hurt.

           Jason opens his eyes to see Lorelei having slumped the pink 
           shotgun to the floor. Dipper picks it up. Jason lets out a 
           gasp of relief. The situation momentarily diffused.

                                 DIPPER
                        Aw, sweetie. We’ll try again 
                        another time. Maybe our friend 
                        Jason can come by again. 

                                 LORELEI
                        I smell curly fries!

           Lorelei oblivious to all the excitement goes straight for the 
           bag of Beefy’s. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Sure you do. That there’s for you. 
                        Run along now. 

           Lorelei excited goes skipping back up the stairs with the 
           bag. Jason is an anxious mess. Dipper rises with the pink 
           shotgun. He walks over to Jason and one handed, places the 
           barrel of the shotgun against Jason’s forehead.
                                 DIPPER
                             (deadly)
                        If I’d take the chance that my 
                        eight year old niece might 
                        accidentally paint your brains on 
                        my living room wall... imagine what 
                        I’ll deliberately do if I don’t 
                        have the money by midnight 
                        tomorrow.

           Dipper lifts up the barrel. He carries the gun out of the 
           room leaving Jason and Coop.

                                 COOP
                        Guess he ain’t fucking around this 
                        time Jace.

           Jason looks at Coop incredulously. ‘No shit’

           INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

           Jason quickly paces through the aisles of the gas station, 
           grabbing random snacks, Doritos, beef jerky, and a bottle of 
           5 Hour Energy. He brings them up to the counter to a GAS 
           ATTENDANT. 

                                 JASON
                             (re: 5 Hour Energy)
                        This stuff work?

                                 GAS ATTENDANT
                        If you aren’t interested in 
                        sleeping for two days.

           Jason sees a tower of sunglasses next to the register.

                                 GAS ATTENDANT
                        Taking a little road trip?

                                 JASON
                        Something like that.

                                 GAS ATTENDANT
                        You wanna stay off the highway if 
                        you was planning to go north. 
                        Construction’s got the entrance 
                        blocked off over here.

           Jason grabs a pair of sunglasses, sets them on the counter.

                                 JASON
                        I’m heading south.
           OUTSIDE

           Jason marches to his car. He takes one last look back toward 
           the town. As he does he spots a LARGE BILLBOARD for MAT MART. 
           “Floor Mats, Doormats, Bath Mats. Don’t get rolled over by 
           the other guys.” There’s a picture of a family, smiling, 
           apparently having all their matting needs satisfied. 

           Jason stares at the billboard. He is locked in on one word 
           DOORMAT. 

           An idea.

           INT. STEAK N’ SHAKE - NIGHT

           A retro diner, half full with young people drunk or high, the 
           only place open 24/7 in this town. Jason sits with a glass of 
           water and a meal he’s barely touched. Coop enters and slumps 
           down in Jason’s booth.

                                 COOP
                        Couldn’t wait ‘til morning huh?

                                 JASON
                        I need your help. I got a plan, but 
                        we gotta...

                                 COOP
                        Whoa... we? I’m gonna stop you 
                        there. Listen, we go back. But 
                        outside of selling you skunk weed 
                        in high school and when you was in 
                        college, we ain’t exactly best 
                        buds. So, lets drop this royal ‘we’ 
                        shit right now.

                                 JASON
                        My plan involves you, but you 
                        benefit, and its also a sure thing. 

                                 COOP 
                        A sure thing? Like betting on the 
                        Indy 500? 

                                 JASON
                             (losing temper)
                        I fucking bet against a woman 
                        driver!

           THREE EMO kids look over at Jason. He regains his composure. 
                                 JASON
                        I bet against a woman driver that 
                        should have been a sure thing. But, 
                        this is nothing like that. This is 
                        no risk. It’s one night, I’ll be 
                        square with Dip and you get a piece 
                        on the side.

                                 COOP 
                        How big a piece we talking?

                                 JASON
                        A grand up front. I’ll throw you 
                        another grand a month later when I 
                        have time to put some money 
                        together.

                                 COOP
                        I’m listening.

                                 JASON
                        Beefy’s. There’s this “doormat” 
                        policy. If you are ever threatened 
                        in a robbery, you are suppose to, 
                        without question, hand over the 
                        money. Period. No funny business...

                                 COOP
                        You want me to rob Beefy’s? Your 
                        own store? Why am I going to risk 
                        robbing a store for ten grand to 
                        get two. That’s retarded.

           A WAITRESS, 40’s, worn and pudgy, comes by the table.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I get you anything sweetheart?

                                 COOP
                        You could get me a lot of things 
                        baby, but let’s start with a 
                        strawberry shake. 

           The waitress ignores him, turns to Jason. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        And you all set here?

                                 JASON
                        I’m good, thanks. 

           The waitress leaves, Coop watches her go. 
                                 JASON
                        You wouldn’t be robbing it in any 
                        real sense. I’ll be there by 
                        myself, handing you the entire 
                        day’s take in cash. Just like if I 
                        were paying you. You leave with the 
                        money, take whatever is extra off 
                        the top. Dip is paid, you’re paid. 
                        And I call the robbery in and tell 
                        ‘em I got held up by a black guy in 
                        a ski mask. 

           Coop considers the plan. It’s not bad. 

                                 COOP
                        Does Beefy’s even make eleven grand 
                        in a day?

                                 JASON
                        No. Not one day. But two, sure. I 
                        didn’t drop our deposit from Sunday 
                        so that’s four grand right there. I 
                        need a good day tomorrow but we had 
                        a coupon drop today, that’ll help. 
                        I’ll call in a few favors and get 
                        some catering orders. Eleven is 
                        doable. 

                                 COOP
                        What if you just make it to ten, 
                        and there’s no take for me.

                                 JASON
                        I’ll get it.

                                 COOP
                        You better. Because Dip’s not the 
                        only one done fucking around with 
                        your ass. 
                             (beat)
                        What time do I need to be there?

                                 JASON
                        Eleven thirty. I’ll make sure I’m 
                        by myself. Just park across the 
                        street, come in on foot. I hand you 
                        the cash and that’s it.

           Coop thinks on it. Not sure.

                                 COOP
                        Why are you doing this? You can’t 
                        sell your car? Call your folks? 
                        This seems like a lotta trouble. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COOP (cont'd)
                        You ain’t got another way to get 
                        ten grand?

                                 JASON
                        In one day? No. My parent’s estate 
                        isn’t exactly liquid, they are 
                        living paycheck to paycheck like 
                        most. My sister would have to ask 
                        her husband, who wouldn’t have it, 
                        and it’d be a ‘no’ even if he did. 
                        I could flip my car on Craigslist 
                        but only get five or six grand in 
                        cash, but then I’d have no fucking 
                        car and still be short half of it.
                             (beat)
                        This is simple and easy. 

           Coop mulls it over. The waitress returns with a large 
           strawberry shake. Whipped cream, cherry on top. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Let me know if that’s sweet enough 
                        for you.

                                 COOP
                        Oh, I’ll let you know. 

           She briskly exits leaving Coop with his shake. He pulls the 
           straw out and licks the whipped cream off, contemplating. 

                                 COOP
                        Alright. I’ll be there at eleven 
                        thirty. 
                             (beat)
                        And I think we both know you’re the 
                        one paying for this shake. 

           Coop slurps some whipped cream off the top of the shake like 
           a small child. 

           INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           CLOSE on an iPhone... “FUCKING BOSS”, with an unflattering 
           picture of Jason, fills the screen as it rings. 

           A large GRAVITY BONG gurgles. 

           Griffin takes a huge rip like only a college kid can do. He 
           coughs once, then is cool. He looks over to CHAD, 19, 
           Griffin’s counterpart, who sips a Natty light as he checks 
           his phone. 
                                 CHAD
                        Jason? What the fuck does he want?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Answer it fag. 

                                 CHAD
                        It’s like he somehow knows when we 
                        are getting fucked up, and calls 
                        us.

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (laughs)
                        Maybe we’re just always fucked up.

                                 CHAD
                        True.
                             (answering)
                        What’s up boss?

           INT. JASON’S CAR - SAME

                                 JASON
                        Good you’re still up. Wait, you’re 
                        not drinking are you? 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                                 CHAD
                        Oh no man, just uh, studying some 
                        shit for a test.

                                 JASON
                        You are working tomorrow right?

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah.. The test isn’t until, uhh.. 
                        Tuesday.

                                 JASON
                        Is Griffin there?

                                 CHAD
                        He’s right here, studying too... 
                        same test.

                                 JASON
                        I need a big favor, I need you guys 
                        in early tomorrow. 6 A.M. Which is 
                        like four hours from now can you do 
                        that? I need all hands on deck 
                        tomorrow.
           Chad mouths “Fuck”. Griffin looks on concerned.

                                 CHAD
                        I mean, that’s only like a three 
                        hour notice man, we weren’t suppose 
                        to be in until ten.

           Jason stares ahead. He doesn’t have much leverage with these 
           hourly waged burnouts. 

                                 JASON
                        You do this for me, I’ll leave you 
                        both clocked in until eight and you 
                        both can take off at two alright? I 
                        need you there Chad, you are the 
                        most responsible, or at least the 
                        most likely to attempt a form of 
                        responsibility. 

                                 CHAD
                        Let me ask Griffin. 

           Jason listens, hears Griffin say ‘Fuck that’ in the 
           background. The stoners converse a little longer.

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah, okay.

                                 JASON
                        Awesome, I owe you both. And I’ll 
                        buy you a six-pack when you are old 
                        enough.

           Chad takes a pull of his beer.

                                 CHAD
                        Whatever man.

           INT. BEEFY’S - PREDAWN

           Jason storms into Beefy’s. Focused, he pulls out some sheets 
           of paper and fires up an older model PC at his desk. As it 
           loads, he reaches over to the safe under his desk and opens 
           it. He pulls out Sunday’s deposit and sets it on his desk. 

           He pulls out a calculator and starts punching in some 
           numbers, calculating the day’s sales projections. He 
           scribbles some of the numbers on the paper. Looks it over. 

           He sits back in his chair for a second. ‘This is manageable’ 
           He closes his eyes to rest. 
           As quick as he shut his eyes, a door slams shut. Jason is 
           jarred awake, finding Florence, fully dressed and alert like 
           only an elderly person can be at this hour.

                                 FLORENCE
                        Good morning Jason.

                                 JASON
                        Florence. What time is it?

                                 FLORENCE
                        Five fifty.

                                 JASON
                        Shit.

                                 FLORENCE
                             (continuing her thought)
                        I know without looking at a clock 
                        because I just took my pills at 
                        five thirty sharp. My doctor says 
                        my blood thinners...

                                 JASON
                        Sounds great Florence. Here are the 
                        beef charts. Put the ovens up to 
                        four-fifty to start. We need eight 
                        roasts going. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Four-fifty? 

                                 JASON
                        We’re going to have some catering 
                        orders and a big lunch rush. We 
                        need to speed cook.

           Florence shakes her head.

                                 FLORENCE
                        Shortcuts are the quickest way to 
                        do the wrong thing.

           That rings a little too pointed for Jason at the moment. 

                                 JASON
                        I’ve got to run to the bank. Go 
                        ahead and get started. The boys 
                        should be here soon to give you a 
                        hand.

           Jason walks off leaving the deposit out. Florence wastes no 
           time in beginning the work. She enters the...
           WALK-IN FREEZER 

           Florence turns on the lights. Racks of frozen roast beef 
           stacked high to the ceiling encompass the entire freezer.

           INT. BRIAN GILL’S HOME - DAY

           BRIAN GILL, 40, sits at his kitchen table eating multi-grain 
           Cheerios. He is wearing an uncomfortably bright golf outfit. 
           Bright green polo shirt and plaid green pants. 

           His holstered cell phone vibrates. He pulls it from his belt. 
           It’s from a blocked number. 

           TEXT MESSAGE: 92 days...

           He looks disturbed. Deletes the text. Takes a hard bite of 
           his cereal. 

                                 KAREN GILL (O.S.)
                        That outfit is so cute. Don’t you 
                        love it?

           KAREN GILL, perfect housewife, enters carrying a small child 
           and sporting a baby bump. 

                                 SMALL CHILD
                        Daddy looks silly.

           Brian Gill plasters on a practiced smile.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        It’s great dear. 

           TWO TEENAGE BOYS come plowing through the kitchen hitting 
           each other, one carries a PS Vista. 

                                 ONE OF THE BOYS
                        Stop it you prick!

                                 THE OTHER ONE
                        Get bent.

                                 KAREN GILL
                        Hey! Knock it off.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (fatherly tone)
                        Braden, Brody, language!

           They barely pay attention to their progenitors and disappear 
           out of the kitchen. 
                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Sure you don’t want me to stay 
                        around today. You’ve got your hands 
                        full with the kids and the 
                        cookout...

                                 KAREN GILL
                        Nonsense. You never take a day for 
                        yourself. You promised, no work 
                        today and only fun.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        I know honey it’s just..

                                 KAREN GILL
                             (sharp)
                        That’s the end of it. 
                             (nice)
                        I packed something special for your 
                        little golf outing. It’s in your 
                        office. Go see...

           She kisses him on the forehead, he forces a smile.

           HOME OFFICE - LATER

           Brian Gill enters his home office. As soon as he does, all 
           his pretension is gone and the smirk disappears. He locks his 
           door and goes over to his desk where a soft cooler sits with 
           a note on top. He opens it.

           ‘How many wives tell their husbands to go and get drunk? 
           (Heart) Karen’

           He tosses the card in the trash and flips up the flap of the 
           cooler. Vodka and Bloody Mary mix sit on ice. He looks 
           annoyed as he goes behind his desk. 

           He opens a bottom drawer with a key. Inside that drawer 
           contains a safe. With his thumbprint, it opens. 

           He removes a GLOCK 23 HANDGUN with a silencer and places it 
           in  a duffle bag. Next, RUBBER BANDED STACKS OF CASH... then 
           a CELL PHONE. He pulls out a final object... a DEER MASK WITH 
           ANTLERS, exactly like the masks from the opening sequence. 

           After all these items are in the bag, he zips it up. Picks up 
           his phone and dials. Someone answer on the other end...

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (into phone)
                        Forty five minutes. Bear Chase Golf 
                        Course.
           INT. CHAD’S JEEP - DAY

           Chad and Griffin sit in a beat up Jeep parked next to 
           Beefy’s. Chad drops in Clear Eyes as Griffin chews half a 
           pack of gum. 

                                 CHAD
                             (re: Clear Eyes)
                        Here, you want some? 

           Griffin takes the Clear Eyes and hands the pack of gum to 
           Chad. He takes a few pieces and crams it in his mouth. They 
           sit there in the Beefy’s parking lot. Just two teenagers 
           chewing gum. Chad begins to laugh.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        What the fuck are you laughing at?

           This makes Chad laugh even harder. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Quit it fag. 

           Now Griffin can’t contain his laughter and joins in, as only 
           two half-drunk, half-high, half-tired kids can laugh at 
           nothing.

                                 CHAD
                        I’m still fucked up.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        I’m straight. Check my breath.

           Griffin leans into Chad’s face and breathes. 

                                 CHAD
                        You’re cool, how’s mine?

           Chad returns the gesture. Both their faces an inch apart. 

           INT. BEEFY’S - DAY

           Florence struggles to load the thawed roasts into an oven. It 
           takes all of her ninety pound frame to lift them. Chad and 
           Griffin enter, playing it as cool as they can. 

                                 CHAD
                        How are you doing today Flo?

                                 FLORENCE
                        I’ve felt better. I’ve been feeling 
                        colder with these new...
                                 GRIFFIN
                             (not listening)
                        Jason here?

                                 FLORENCE
                        No. He ran to the bank. Although I 
                        don’t know why he needs to do that. 
                        He left last night’s deposit. Seems 
                        like he’s going to have to make two 
                        trips...

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (ignoring Florence)
                        Dude, Jason’s not here. Let’s go up 
                        front.

           They walk past Florence, indifferent to helping an eighty 
           year old woman with the heavy lifting. Florence loads the 
           last tray of beef. She turns up the dials to 450. The 
           machines roar to life. 

           Florence’s facial expression suddenly begins to change. She 
           starts flexing her left arm a bit. She clutches it with her 
           right arm. Her breathing becomes labored as her right hand 
           moves to her chest. She collapses on the middle of the prep 
           floor.

           LOBBY

           Completely unaware of Florence’s collapse, Griffin and Chad 
           have out cleaning supplies and begin their opening duties. 
           Slowly and without purpose, Chad mops the floor. 

                                 CHAD
                        It’s really bullshit that we have 
                        to clean in the morning. They just 
                        cleaned this place after they 
                        closed last night. Then we come in, 
                        and clean it again. Why? They just 
                        fucking cleaned it.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Who cares?

                                 CHAD
                        Well you don’t take a shower at 
                        night, go to bed and lay perfectly 
                        still for eight hours, then feel 
                        the need to shower again the second 
                        you wake up. That would be 
                        retarded.
                                 GRIFFIN
                        Man, my head is killing me. I think 
                        those Natty’s are wearing off.

                                 CHAD
                        I could go for a beer. That always 
                        helps my hangover.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        A beer would be good.

                                 CHAD
                        But, a warm beer. Not a cold beer 
                        but a beer that’s been sitting out 
                        on the counter for a few hours. I 
                        have one warm beer and my hangover 
                        is gone.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Warm beer? That’s fucking gross.

           Griffin pulls out his dugout.

                                 CHAD
                        Dude, you gonna to do that right 
                        here?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Fuck it. This will cure my shit. 
                        Jason’s not here, who cares?

                                 CHAD
                        A warm beer and a nap. And I’d be 
                        straight.

           Griffin walks over to the entrance of the store. He unlocks 
           the door and leaves it cracked open. He lights up and 
           inhales.

                                 GRIFFIN 
                             (re: the weed)
                        Fuck that’s good. Why don’t you go 
                        take a nap in your car. Get a good 
                        fifteen minutes and then you cover 
                        me.

                                 CHAD
                        That’s a solid idea. I’ve got some 
                        Keystones in the back I think. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (mocking)
                        “Warm beer and a nap.”
           EXT. MUNCIE CREDIT UNION ATM - DAY

           Jason checks his account balance - $953.48. He withdraws the 
           max of $200. He is growing impatient with the process. He 
           hits the max $200 again. The money churns out. He does the 
           max again, this time an error message pops up...

           MESSAGE: Cannot currently process request.

                                 JASON
                        Ah, come on.

           He tries it again. Same message. He hits the machine.

                                 JASON
                        Shit.

           He tries it again... 

           MESSAGE: Account has been locked.

                                 JASON
                        Shit. Shit.

           Jason checks his watch. He looks up at the bank hours: Monday-
           Friday 7AM-7PM. He paces a bit, then decides to wait. 

           He slides down against the entrance of the door and rubs his 
           temples. He opens up his cell phone and dials. 

           It rings, rings... then voicemail.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        You’ve reached...

           He cuts it off as a PT Cruiser comes flying into the parking 
           lot. A COLLEGE SORORITY GIRL hops out, stumbles a bit. 
           Clearly hungover in block out sunglasses and yesterday’s 
           clothes. She walks straight up to Jason.

                                 JASON
                        They aren’t open yet.

                                 COLLEGE GIRL
                        Oh, shit. Duh! 
                             (smacks forehead)
                        It’s Memorial Day. Stupid banks and 
                        their lame holidays.

           Jason jumps up, a sign “Closed Memorial Day” was above his 
           head the whole time. 
                                 JASON
                        Shit!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEEFY’S - SAME

           Griffin continues cleaning the front of the lobby. As he 
           wipes down the counter his facial expression changes. He 
           rushes towards the...

           BATHROOM 

           OVER BLACK -- We here a stall door open and Griffin beginning 
           to puke. It goes on for a beat. Griffin finishes up there is 
           a rustling around for the light switch. 

           BRIGHT. Light on. 

           The TOILET LID... CLOSED. 

           VOMIT all over the top and sides of the toilet. There’s a 
           good reason to clean up.

           Griffin moans as he puts his weight against the side of the 
           stall and slides to the floor, defeated. Not ready to tackle 
           the mess, he rests his eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATER

           Jason pulls frantically into the parking lot of an adjacent 
           baseball field. A FEW COLLEGE BASEBALL PLAYERS head to the 
           diamond with COACH BROWN, 45, your run of the mill hard ass. 

                                 JASON
                        Coach Brown!

           Coach Brown turns around and sees a very frantic Jason coming 
           towards him.

                                 COACH BROWN
                        Jason? What’s a matter? You finally 
                        getting around to bringing the 
                        curly fries you left out of my 
                        order Friday?

           Jason tries to laugh and play along but he’s in a hurry.
                                 JASON
                        Sorry, I tried to call. I need a 
                        big favor. You think you could 
                        cater from Beefy’s today? 

                                 COACH BROWN
                        Those billboards over the 
                        interstate don’t bring enough in, 
                        you got to solicit beef sandwiches 
                        door to door?

                                 JASON
                        I don’t want to be a drama queen 
                        about it but, I need an end of 
                        quarter sales bump today. It could 
                        be the difference in keeping my job 
                        or losing it. I’m sorry, I wouldn’t 
                        ask if it wasn’t important.

           Coach Brown studies Jason. He can sense bullshit but, can see 
           Jason is legitimately in need of help. A beat.

                                 COACH BROWN
                        Ah, what the hell. Guess I might as 
                        well treat these guys since today 
                        is technically a “voluntary 
                        practice.” I’ll send one of my boys 
                        over to pick it up around one?

                                 JASON
                        Thank you so much. Yes, one’s 
                        great. It’ll run about the same as 
                        last time, if that’s alright?

                                 COACH BROWN
                        My pops would probably roll over in 
                        his grave he knew I shell out a 
                        grand on beef to feed these whining 
                        little brats.

           Coach Brown chuckles to himself and walks away. Jason pulls 
           out his cell phone and dials. As he walks back to his car, we 
           hear it ringing, ringing...

                                 TONY (V.O.)
                             (overtly corny)
                        You’ve reached Beefy’s. We must be 
                        busy busting away to bring you the 
                        best in beef. So leave a message 
                        after the beep...

           Jason pissed, hangs up. ‘Why is no one answering?’

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CHAD’S JEEP - DAY

           “Who Will Save Your Soul” by Jewel plays as Chad is passed 
           out cold in the fully reclined front seat of his Jeep. One 
           hand clutches a warm Keystone Light. 

           REVERSE THROUGH WINDOW

           Jason’s car comes flying back into the parking lot. 
           Screeching to a halt, Jason jumps out of his car and 
           immediately notices Chad asleep in his car. 

           Chad lies peacefully as Jewel is blaring. Jason rushes up to 
           the driver’s side window.

           WHAM. WHAM.

           Jason pounds the glass causing Chad to jump, spilling beer 
           all over his uniform.

                                 JASON
                             (muffled through window)
                        Get. Out.

           Chad looks like he’s about to piss himself.

                                 CHAD
                             (getting out)
                        Jason, man. I’m sorry. I..

           PARKING LOT

           Jason, frustrated, waits for Chad to get out but, something 
           catches his eye...

           SMOKE. Filling the lobby of Beefy’s. 

           He rushes up to the entrance, it’s locked. He fumbles with 
           his keys. Finding the right one, he rips open the door. 

           INSIDE BEEFY’S

           The smoke is darker towards the kitchen. Jason hops the 
           counter. He grabs a fire extinguisher and instinctively goes 
           to the ovens. As he rips them open, smoke pours out. 

           He douses the oven and in turn the precious beef. He empties 
           the fire extinguisher on the bottom oven as well.

           THE BEEF IS CHARRED. And now covered in flame retardant.

           Jason begins coughing. He kicks open the back door letting 
           the smoke out. He hacks up a few more coughs. As the smoke 
           clears out he finds...
           FLORENCE. Lying in the middle of the floor. Dead.

                                 JASON
                        Florence! Florence!

           Dropping to his knees, he checks her pulse. Nothing. 

                                 JASON
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

           He shakes her almost apathetically. His apathy turns to 
           anger.

                                 JASON
                             (yelling)
                        Chad! Griffin!

           Jason rises and storms to the front of the store.

           LOBBY 

           Smoke is still dwindling and there is no sign of the 
           burnouts. He rips open the door to the bathroom where he 
           spots Griffin passed out next to his own vomit. Jason SMACKS 
           Griffin right in the face.

                                 JASON 
                        Griffin, what the fuck?

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (coming to)
                        Shit. Ah. Shit. Sorry Jason. I’m 
                        sick.

           He grabs Griffin by the collar and pulls him out of the 
           bathroom as Chad comes in from the parking lot.

                                 CHAD
                        Whoa, what happened?

                                 JASON
                        You guys are worthless! I leave for 
                        thirty minutes and you burn all the 
                        beef and kill Florence.

                                 CHAD
                        Florence is dead?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        What?

           Jason finally loses his cool.
                                 JASON
                        Fuck! Fuck!

                                 CHAD
                        We should call 911.

           Trying to regain some composure.

                                 JASON
                        No! I’ll take care of it. You guys 
                        fucked up big time. But you know 
                        what? Forget it. I’ve got to call 
                        Nick at the Anderson store.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        For what?

                                 JASON
                        Beef... to serve at Beefy’s you 
                        moron. We don’t have enough time to 
                        start the roasts we need to last us 
                        through lunch. 

                                 CHAD
                        Forget the beef. I know we screwed 
                        up, but Florence is dead dude.

                                 JASON
                        You guys are going to Anderson. 
                        I’ll call 911 and take care of 
                        Florence. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        One of us could stay and...

                                 JASON
                        No! Two of you barely make one 
                        competent person. Both of you go. 

           Griffin and Chad stand there unsure.

                                 JASON 
                        Go!

           They start to move and he grabs them both by the collar and 
           pulls them back in.

                                 JASON
                             (intense, dark)
                        Listen to me very closely. The only 
                        reason you both aren’t fired right 
                        now is because I need a great day 
                        today. You hear me? This goes 
                        beyond some boss-employee shit. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASON (cont'd)
                        If you two fuck this up, I will 
                        literally come to your house and 
                        sodomize you with an aluminum 
                        baseball bat. Understood?

           Chad and Griffin nod and hurry out. Jason turns back to the 
           prep area and sees Florence’s feet protruding into view from 
           the kitchen area.

           PARKING LOT 

           As Chad and Griffin walk to the jeep, a long sober silence...

                                 CHAD
                        Dude, what’s sodomize mean?

           They both start to laugh.

           BACK INSIDE 

           Jason stands over Florence in total shock. His cellphone 
           rings. Jason glances at his caller ID. He takes a deep 
           breath. His tone becomes upbeat and professional.

                                 JASON
                             (into phone)
                        Doug! Thanks for calling me back. 
                        Sorry I called so early, but I’m 
                        sort of in a bind. 
                             (listens)
                        Sure, I was hoping you may be in 
                        need of a catering order on campus 
                        today?

           Jason glances at a clock. Then looks at Florence.

                                 JASON
                             (into phone)
                        I figured you probably weren’t, and 
                        I hate to have to beg you. But, and 
                        I don’t want to sound melodramatic, 
                        but it’s almost life or death over 
                        here. I’d owe you big time.

           Jason reaches down and grabs both of Florence’s arms while 
           cradling the phone in his neck. He begins dragging her...

                                 JASON
                             (into phone)
                        You will? Thank you. I really 
                        appreciate it. What time do you 
                        need to pick up?

           He drags Florence into the walk-in freezer.
           WALK-IN FREEZER 

           He lays Florence to the side.

                                 JASON
                             (into phone)
                        One? You got it. Thanks pal.

           Jason ends the call and puts the phone in his pocket. He 
           stares at Florence.

                                 JASON
                             (to Florence)
                        I’m sorry to do this. Just give me 
                        a few minutes Florence and we’ll 
                        get you situated. 

           He grabs a tray of frozen beef and closes the freezer door.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           JOE, 24, a muscular but trim young man, gazes on to a 
           manicured putt and chip lawn where we find Brian Gill working 
           his pitching wedge. Joe looks very similar to JOHN from the 
           opening, ex-military, long stare. Gill spots him.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Joe?

           Joe nods, approaches the putting green. Brian lines up a putt 
           and sinks it. He has a menacing gravity to his movements, 
           completely opposite of the submissive house dad from earlier. 
           He approaches Joe and shakes his hand firmly. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Brian Gill. Thanks for meeting me 
                        on a holiday.
                             (beat)
                        And thanks for... you know, your 
                        service. Or whatever it is I am 
                        supposed to say to a veteran on 
                        Memorial Day.

           Joe just kind of stands there. Brian Gill leans on his club. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (gets to it)
                        You’ve been working for us over at 
                        Wolf Run subdivision is that right?

                                 JOE
                        Cattle Cove.
                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (chuckles)
                        Cattle Cove. Right. Wolf Run, Bear 
                        Chase, Turkey Springs. People love 
                        the idea of nature. The idea. When 
                        what they really want is for us to 
                        plow the shit out of it and pop up 
                        a faux brick castle with a bunch of 
                        fake rocks in their lawn.
                             (Chuckles again)
                        Cattle Cove, it’s like we ran out 
                        of combinations of animal and 
                        geographic location. 

           Gill begins walking to his golf cart, Joe in tow. They pass 
           three bronze statues of a family of bears.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        You’ve been in trouble with the law 
                        recently?

                                 JOE
                        Bar fight. I didn’t start it 
                        though.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        No need to explain to me, Joe. 
                        You’ve had towel heads taking pot 
                        shots at you, little kids throwing 
                        rocks, friends blown to shit. You 
                        come back here and you wonder what 
                        everyone is smiling about. Like 
                        their country isn’t in a fucking 
                        war. 

           Gill walks to his golf cart and tosses his clubs in the bag.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Drive me up to the first tee, will 
                        you?

           Joe gets in the driver’s seat. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        You’re getting in trouble because 
                        of the disconnect. The people 
                        around you have a void left from 
                        the constant state of comfort 
                        they’ve built for themselves. 
                        Houses, children, sports... they’ve 
                        neutered themselves of real pain. 
                        Soft and unrecognizable to those 
                        who have felt what it’s really like 
                        to be uncomfortable. 
           They pass a group of High School kids laughing as they 
           shotgun beers in the parking lot.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Now you know we’ve got our hands in 
                        developing, construction, 
                        landscaping. But we also help 
                        people fill their voids. 

                                 JOE
                        Drugs?

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Sure. Drugs, gambling, escorts. We 
                        dabble in all of the illicit 
                        solutions to the human condition.

           Joe winds up to the first tee and they stop as a FATHER and 
           SON tee off in front of them. Gill grabs the black duffel bag 
           he filled up earlier and puts it on Joe’s lap.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        That’s where you come in. In this 
                        kind of work you sometimes need a 
                        heavy hand.
                             (re: the bag)
                        There’s a large retainer in there. 
                        That’s cash, up front. You’ll 
                        continue to work on the landscaping 
                        teams in order to keep your taxes 
                        legitimate. You’ll also find a 
                        mask. You’ll wear that partly to 
                        conceal your identity, but more 
                        importantly to scare the shit out 
                        of people. 

           Gill pulls out a slip of paper and hands it to Joe. Joe 
           studies it.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Here’s a guy’s name and number up 
                        in Yorktown. You’ll meet with him 
                        later today and he’ll fill in all 
                        the blanks. 
                             (beat)
                        Do you understand what I’m asking 
                        from you Joe?

                                 JOE
                        Yes sir.

           The twosome finish their drives and head to their cart.
                                 FATHER
                             (to Gill, Joe)
                        Morning.

           Gill puts his hand up, a signal of suburban acknowledgement. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (to the father)
                        Good luck out there.

           They drive off. Joe stares ahead realizing he will never 
           connect to this world. Gill flips on his Oakley shades.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (to Joe)
                        I’m offering to fill your void Joe.
                             (beat)
                        If that’s agreeable to you, take 
                        that bag and I’ll be in touch.

           Easy choice, Joe hops out of the cart with the duffle bag and 
           heads back toward the parking lot. 

           Gill sits for a moment staring out onto the vast fairway. 
           Taking it in, or maybe just trying to feel something.  He 
           opens up the soft cooler. Considers it. Pours a large portion 
           of vodka into a red solo cup, takes a slug. Heading to the 
           back of his cart, he grabs a club, and heads to the tee box.

           INT. BEEFY’S - DAY

           Jason is on a cordless phone as he continues to single-
           handedly get the store ready to open. He is opening 
           refrigerator doors, slicing tomatoes, shredding lettuce. All 
           while he talks on the phone.

                                 JASON 
                             (into phone)
                        Nick, hey I’m sending two employees 
                        over for six roasts if you can 
                        spare it.

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                             (smarmy)
                        Who is this?

                                 JASON
                        Dammit, Nick. It’s Jason.
           INT. OTHER BEEFY’S - SAME 

           NICK, Late 40’s, the quintessential fast food manager. Like 
           the biblical Samson, he derives his power from hair, not the 
           hairs on his head, but from his finely trimmed mustache.

                                 NICK
                        Jason, look I’m sorry to hear about 
                        Tony. Wish I could have made it to 
                        the service but that was my poker 
                        night, I was hosting. But, hey it 
                        looks like it’s going to be me and 
                        you sparring for the next few years 
                        in the region.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                                 JASON
                        Sparring? I’m not sparring. Look, 
                        I’m in a real bind over here. We 
                        need some beef or we can’t make it 
                        through lunch. 

                                 NICK
                        I’m flattered you thought to call. 
                        I hate to say it though, I don’t 
                        have any roasts to spare. We’ve got 
                        our usual catering order going out 
                        to the Ball Jar factory, plus we 
                        need to be ready for the baseball 
                        game tonight over at the high 
                        school. Go Tigers! 

                                 JASON
                             (losing patience)
                        Dammit Nick that’s eight hours from 
                        now! This isn’t a joke. I’ve 
                        already sent my guys, we need 
                        whatever you can spare. 

                                 NICK
                        I wish I could help Jace. I really 
                        do. But, I’ve got to look out for 
                        my store. Regional would agree.

           Jason is fuming. But, continues to mask it the best he can.

                                 JASON
                        Nick. Please. I’m asking for a big 
                        favor here and I’m at your mercy...
                                 NICK
                        Listen, I got to run, things are 
                        getting crazy around here already. 
                        Bye now.

           Nick hangs up.

                                 JASON
                        Nick, wait...

           No answer. Jason is now standing in front of his office desk. 
           Staring back at him is a smiling picture of ‘General 
           Operations Manager - Tony Miller’

           Jason pauses at the poorly lit, cheaply framed photo. A long 
           beat. Tony still smiling posthumously.

           Jason lets loose, and begins repeatedly slamming the cordless 
           phone into the side of the desk.

           INT. CHAD’S JEEP - DAY

           Griffin and Chad drive en route to the other Beefy’s. They 
           both hold a Keystone Light in one hand. Chad takes a sip of 
           his as he drives. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (to no one)
                        Rooooad. Sooooda.

           Chad and Griffin’s phones both buzz simultaneously. Chad 
           reads the text out loud while driving.

                                 CHAD
                             (sotto voice)
                        “Hey guys, its Jason. Let me know 
                        when you have the beef. Thanks! 
                        XOXO.”

                                 GRIFFIN
                        He didn’t say that.

           Chad sips his beer.

                                 CHAD
                        Yes he did. Right here “Let me know 
                        when you have the beef.”

                                 GRIFFIN
                        No shit he said that. He didn’t say 
                        “XOXO”
                                 CHAD
                        Well of course not.

           They drive in silence.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        I think Jason’s into some serious 
                        shit.

                                 CHAD
                        What do you mean?

           Chad taps his nose.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        No.

           Chad taps his arm. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        No, idiot. Gambling. I think he 
                        lost a bunch on that race. That’s 
                        why he’s acting all shitty this 
                        morning.

                                 CHAD
                        Really?

           Chad takes a big pull of beer as he continues to drive, deep 
           in thought.

                                 CHAD
                        Gambling is stupid.

           EXT. WHITE RIVER - DAY

           Dip and Coop sit idly in lawn chairs overlooking a muddy 
           river. They watch Lorelei and a BLACK HAIRED GIRL fish. A few 
           other small families do the same as they are spread out down 
           the river’s edge. 

           Dip cracks a beer, takes a long sip. After a beat of silence 
           Coop breaks the ice... 

                                 COOP
                        You think Jesus drank beer whenever 
                        he fished?

           Dip looks at Coop bemused.

                                 DIPPER
                        Jesus was a carpenter you moron. 
           Coop thinks really hard.

                                 COOP
                        Fisher of men, that’s right. 

           Dipper ignores him.

                                 DIPPER
                        You think Jason is capable of 
                        getting that money?

                                 COOP
                             (too confident)
                        He’s going to get it alright.

                                 DIPPER
                        What makes you so sure?

                                 COOP
                        I mean. I think he’s definitely 
                        capable... Like you said.

                                 DIPPER
                        You must have some reason for the 
                        confidence.

                                 COOP
                        Shit. 
                             (beat)
                        He asked me to help him out.

                                 DIPPER
                        Help him out?

                                 COOP
                        He’s going to have me show up at 
                        his store, you know Beefy’s. And 
                        when I show up he’s going to give 
                        me the money. But, the money is 
                        coming from Beefy’s. He’s just 
                        going to say a black guy jumped 
                        him, and that’ll be that. Something 
                        called the ‘doormat policy’ where 
                        he’s just suppose to hand over the 
                        money, no fuss.

           Coop waits for a reaction. Dipper stares at him. A long beat.

                                 DIPPER
                        That’s not bad.

           Coop is surprised Dip is okay with the plan.
                                 COOP 
                        About splitting, you sure we gotta 
                        do that right away? I mean this 
                        score from Jason is a pretty sweet 
                        deal, maybe that holds us over for 
                        a few more...

                                 DIPPER
                             (interrupting)
                        This area is dry. My cousin is 
                        going to set us up in Wichita. 
                        We’ve been over this. We aren’t 
                        fucking up our deal there. 

                                 COOP
                        I was just figuring...

           Dip eyes Coop, who stops. Lets it hang there.

           Lorelei comes running up from the bank, her fishing pole is 
           tangled. 

                                 LORELEI
                        Uncle Dip. My pole is all stuck. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Let me help you with that.

           He begins untangling the line. Lorelei stares at Coop who is 
           visibly uncomfortable around children.

                                 COOP
                             (to Lorelei)
                        You fishing or catching?

           Lorelei doesn’t answer. Dip finishes untangling the line and 
           hands it back.

                                 DIPPER
                        There you go sweetie.

           Lorelei takes off back to the river. Coop hesitates to say 
           anything but then...

                                 COOP
                        How long your sis going to be at 
                        the casino?

                                 DIPPER
                             (growing impatient)
                        However long it takes to clean 
                        fifty thousand dollars. 
                                 COOP
                        It’s just, it’s been almost two 
                        months we’ve been staying at her 
                        place. She paying the mortgage? 
                        There’s bills on the table she 
                        probably needs to take care of. And 
                        your niece Lorelei...

           Dip quickly jumps out of his chair and throws Coop back down 
           by his neck. He pins him to the ground by grappling at his 
           throat.

                                 DIPPER
                             (gritting teeth)
                        I say jump and you jump. I cut you 
                        in for jumping not to think about 
                        jumping. You got it? 

           He finally gets a firm hold on Coop’s neck. Coop stares back 
           defiantly.

                                 COOP
                             (struggling)
                        I’m not your bitch.

           Dip holds him tight against the ground for a split second 
           longer, then releases. Coop gathers himself and flips his 
           chair up. 

           Dip grabs another beer out of the cooler and tosses it to 
           Coop.

                                 DIPPER
                        This fucking move is stressing the 
                        shit out of me. With Lorelei 
                        around, I just got a lot on my 
                        plate.

           Coop pops open his beer. They begin to settle back in their 
           lawn chairs. Dip struggles to look at Coop in his eye but 
           once he does it’s sincere. 

                                 DIPPER
                        I honestly don’t know what I’d do 
                        without you Coop. 
                             (beat)
                        I mean that. When we get setup in 
                        Wichita, we’re going to be partners 
                        outright. Its half and half from 
                        here on out.

                                 COOP
                             (massaging his throat)
                        Yeah alright.
           A girl screams nearby. Dipper immediately jumps up with 
           concern. He quickly eases at the sight of Lorelei holding up 
           a flopping bluegill at the end of her fishing pole. 

           He pauses, looks down on Coop...

                                 DIPPER
                        You go check on Jason and make sure 
                        everything is copacetic. Don’t want 
                        him getting any fancy ideas about 
                        skipping town. 

           Dipper walks off towards the bank. Coop takes a sip of his 
           beer as he watches Dip.

                                 DIPPER (O.S)
                             (to Lorelei)
                        Ah, settle down. That’s just a 
                        little fella.

           INT. BEEFY’S - DAY

           The hiss from the ovens crescendos as Jason opens the doors. 
           There are racks and racks of cooked beef. Jason pulls the 
           trays out and sets them on a counter. He checks one with a 
           thermometer. ‘Good enough’ 

                                 ARNOLD (O.S.)
                        Hello? Are y’all open?

                                 JASON
                        One second. 

           Jason bare hands a roast burning himself, but holds on as he 
           carries it to the slicer. He tosses it on and locks it in. 
           He’s done it a thousand times. He comes around to the...

           LOBBY 

           ARNOLD, an old timer and regular customer is at the 
           registers. Unassuming, he’s your grandpa. He holds the days 
           paper in a perfect fold. He pulls a napkin from his pocket 
           and wipes the counter exactly three times.  

                                 JASON
                        Oh, hi Arnold. How we doing today?

                                 ARNOLD
                        Above the dirt. Can’t complain. How 
                        about you?
           Jason slides a tray in front of Arnold. The old timer removes 
           two sugar packets from his other pocket. Laying them down 
           just so, their usual routine...

                                 JASON
                             (rambling)
                        Same ol’, same ol’. Lost a massive 
                        amount of money on the Indy 500 
                        yesterday because I bet against a 
                        female driver. Now I’m planning on 
                        embezzling the day’s take from 
                        Beefy’s just so my bookie doesn’t 
                        kill me.
                             (beat)
                        You know the usual. 

                                 ARNOLD
                             (playing along)
                        You don’t say? I’d think betting 
                        against a female driver would have 
                        been a lock.

                                 JASON
                        You win some, you lose some.

           Jason can’t believe he just unloaded like that. There’s a 
           long beat. Then, Arnold lets out a hearty laugh.

                                 ARNOLD
                        You know, you got a twisted sense 
                        of humor on you. I like it. Reminds 
                        me of myself.

                                 JASON
                             (relieved)
                        Ha, yeah I get a little carried 
                        away sometimes. 

           Awkward beat.

                                 JASON
                        So, what can I do for you today? 
                        I’m guessing a senior coffee, small 
                        roast beef, add lettuce, and...

                          ARNOLD
                                                          JASON
           No tomato.
                                              No tomato.

                                 JASON
                        The usual, absolutely.

           BEEP. 

           The piercing sound of the drive-thru window returns. 
                                 JASON
                        You go ahead and have a seat Arnold 
                        and I’ll bring that out to you.

           Arnold gives him a smile. Regards Jason’s dishevelment.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Thanks Jason. You’ve always made my 
                        mornings bright. That’s valuable.

           BEEP.

                                 JASON
                        Thanks, that’ll be right out.

           Jason rushes over to the drive-thru speaker.

           INT. THE OTHER BEEFY’S - DAY

           Chad and Griffin enter the other Beefy store. It is an 
           identical layout to the their own store with the addition of 
           a few fake plants.

           There are some CUSTOMERS in line ordering from a cashier, 
           DEANNA, 19. She is attractive in the right light, blonde with 
           roots showing. She takes an order as she catches Chad’s eye 
           and winks. 

           Appearing from the back is SCOTT, early 30’s. He worships the 
           holy trinity: Dale Senior, Dale Junior, and the number 3 car. 
           He is outfitted with the appropriate Beefy’s uniform with the 
           exception of a black Number 3 hat. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Look who it is? Ole Chadwick is 
                        back.

                                 CHAD
                        Hey Scott, we’re here to see Nick.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, ‘How do ya do?’ Boy you must 
                        lose your manners the farther you 
                        are from the big city.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        At least we learn hygiene grease 
                        monkey. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Whoa, who’s your girlfriend Chad? 
                                 CHAD
                        Where’s Nick?

           OFFICE AREA 

           Chad and Griffin follow Scott to the back of the Beefy’s 
           store, again identical setup as Jason’s office. We track them 
           past multiple plaques for “Manager of the Year - Northeast 
           Indiana” all with head shots of “Nick Conkler - General 
           Operations Manager”. Finally finding the real Nick Conkler 
           sitting with his back to the guys. 

                                 NICK
                        Well, if it isn’t Harold and Kumar. 
                        Let me guess, White Castle is 
                        closed?

                                 CHAD
                        Just here for some beef and we’ll 
                        be on our way.

           Nick really milks spinning his chair around slowly. Once 
           facing Chad he studies him in a way he believes 
           ‘intimidating’ should look. 

                                 NICK
                        All business are we? That’s not the 
                        Chad I remember, the Chad I 
                        remember used to be anything but 
                        business. Usually out taking a few 
                        tokes by the garbage cans just to 
                        manage a whole four hours of work. 

           Nick does a horrible miming of smoking a joint.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Listen perv-stache. We aren’t here 
                        to lay our cocks on the table and 
                        have a dick measuring contest. 
                        Jason sent us here for the beef. 
                        You’ve got it. We’ll take it, and 
                        we’ll be on our way. 

                                 NICK
                        Oh, I’m afraid you’re mistaken. See 
                        I told Jace already that I don’t 
                        have beef to give. So, you’ll have 
                        to take it up with him on why he 
                        sent you on a wild goose chase, 
                        Cheech. 

           Nick turns his back on them and begins to walk up front. Chad 
           quickly takes note of the ovens in the background.
                                 GRIFFIN
                             (getting angry)
                        We aren’t leaving without...

                                 CHAD
                        Let’s go dude. He’s not giving it 
                        to us. Let’s just go back and tell 
                        Jason.

                                 NICK
                        There you go Chad. Finally, 
                        thinking straight for once.

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (to Chad)
                        Dude, he’ll give us the...

                                 CHAD
                             (serious)
                        Let’s go. 

           Chad begins to lead Griffin out of the back of the store.

                                 NICK
                        See you later “bros.” Better get 
                        back soon, it’s 4:20 somewhere, 
                        right guys?

           Nick and his employees chuckle to themselves. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (as he’s walking away)
                        You’re right Tom Selleck, and it’s 
                        probably Halloween somewhere too. 
                        So keep passing out candy to little 
                        children you fucking pedophile. 

           Chad yanks Griffin out of the store.

           PARKING LOT 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        What the fuck dude? Why are you 
                        backing down from that prick? Jason 
                        is going to be shitty if we don’t 
                        come back with beef.

                                 CHAD
                        Chill dude. I saw the ovens.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        So?
                                 CHAD
                        So, they have about six roasts 
                        coming out in ten minutes. Once 
                        they pull them out, a good four 
                        will sit out in the back for a few 
                        minutes before they move them to 
                        the backline. Scott always pulls 
                        the roasts and then steps out for a 
                        smoke before putting them up.

           They reach the car. 

                                 CHAD
                        When he steps out, I’ll slip in 
                        behind him and lock him out. By the 
                        time I grab a few roasts I’ll bust 
                        through the back door and be to the 
                        car before he knows what’s going 
                        on.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        You don’t think somebody else in 
                        the back will see you. 

                                 CHAD
                        It’s Beefy’s. You think people will 
                        get into a physical confrontation 
                        over this shithole?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        I wouldn’t. Nick probably would 
                        though.

                                 CHAD
                        If Nick’s back there I’ll just 
                        punch him in the fucking face. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Damn dude that’s cold. Why’d he 
                        fire you again? Toking?

                                 CHAD
                        No. You saw that chick up front? 
                        That’s Deanna, his niece. He caught 
                        me fingerin’ her out back in the 
                        dry shed. Went ballistic.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Nice.
           INT. BEEFY’S - DAY

           Jason is a one man machine. He takes orders with a headset on 
           for Drive-Thru customers. Makes sandwiches in the back. The 
           slicer constantly running, beef piling high.

           He pulls out some frozen french fries and tosses them into 
           the fryer. Then he’s up to take an order from a CUSTOMER in 
           the front. Normally a job for at least four people he is 
           doing all by himself. And he is good. 

           Amanda comes in from the back of the store. She spots the 
           slicer, unmanned, now overflowing with beef. She shuts it 
           off. Jason runs by her to make a sandwich.

                                 JASON
                             (quickly)
                        Hey.

                                 AMANDA
                        What’s going on?

           Jason finishes the sandwich and tosses it down the shoot. 

                                 JASON
                        The beef got burned this morning. I 
                        have just enough to hold us over 
                        until lunch. I sent the burnouts to 
                        Anderson to pick up a few roasts 
                        from Nick. 

           Amanda jumps in to start helping Jason. She puts on a headset 
           and answers a drive-thru order.

                                 AMANDA
                             (in headset)
                        Hi, welcome to Beefy’s what can I 
                        get for you today?

           Jason, with blinders on, moves quickly. Amanda cuts him off 
           by placing her hand on his stomach and getting close, 
           intimate.

                                 AMANDA
                             (personal)
                        Everything okay?

           Jason is about to answer but spots Coop, lurking in the lobby 
           with a few other customers. Coop clocks the exchange, as 
           Jason breaks off and grabs a sandwich flinging it into Coop’s 
           chest. 
                                 JASON
                             (to Coop)
                        Go wait in the dining room.

           Coops bobbles the sandwich and drops it. Jason abruptly 
           turns, Amanda stopping him again.

                                 AMANDA
                        What’s he doing here? And why did 
                        all the beef get burnt?

           Jason stops in his tracks for a second and looks right at 
           Amanda. 

           A PIERCING SCREAM reverberates from the back of the store. 
           Amanda and Jason both react.

                                 JASON
                             (remembering)
                        Oh shit.

           KITCHEN

           Jason and Amanda get to the walk-in freezer where Kirsten, 
           arriving to work, stands covering her mouth at the sight of 
           the semi-thawed body of Florence. 

                                 JASON
                             (to Amanda)
                        Call 911. 

           Amanda rushes for a phone.

                                 JASON
                             (to Kirsten)
                        It’s okay, it’s okay.

           Jason puts his hand on her shoulders and backs her away from 
           the scene. 

                                 KIRSTEN
                        What happened to her?

                                 JASON
                        She must have had a heart attack.

           Kirsten stands in horror.

                                 JASON
                        Kirsten, why don’t you go up front, 
                        clean the bathrooms, just get your 
                        mind off this for awhile. Amanda 
                        and I will handle it okay?
           Kirsten slowly nods, disillusioned as she stumbles up front. 
           Amanda is on the phone with a dispatcher.

                                 AMANDA
                             (to Jason)
                        Did you check her pulse?

                                 JASON
                        Yes, she’s dead.

                                 AMANDA
                             (to dispatcher)
                        Yes, there’s no pulse. 
                             (listens)
                        Okay, okay. Thank you.
                             (to Jason)
                        They are on their way.

                                 JASON
                        This is why the beef burnt. I was 
                        at the bank. Chad and Griffin were 
                        apparently passed out from whatever 
                        it is they do. And Florence must 
                        have had a heart attack.

           Amanda can barely process all the information.

                                 AMANDA
                        What? Wait, you didn’t call an 
                        ambulance once you found her like 
                        this? Are you crazy?

                                 JASON
                        I forgot Amanda. I wanted to start 
                        the roasts. We have three catering 
                        orders today. I couldn’t take a 
                        chance of running out during lunch. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Florence could have had a chance to 
                        live! 

                                 JASON
                        She was dead Amanda. She is dead. 
                        There’s nothing I could do for her 
                        then and there isn’t anything we 
                        can do for her now.

           Jason begins to walk off.

                                 JASON
                        You handle this and I’ll deal with 
                        the customers. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASON (cont'd)
                        It’s unfortunate, but there’s no 
                        reason not to keep doing our jobs.

           Jason walks up front, Amanda stands frozen at the image of a 
           deceased Florence.

           INT. BEEFY’S - LATER

           Coop sloppily eats a roast beef sandwich in the dining area. 
           He sits directly across from Arnold, who tries to ignore Coop 
           by reading the paper. Liquid cheese drips from Coop’s chin as 
           he attempts to call Dipper on his iPhone. 

                                 COOP
                             (headset on)
                        Yo Siri. Call Dipper mobile.
                             (waits while it rings)
                        Dip, it’s me. Yeah, yeah I’m here.
                             (listens)
                        Yeah, Jason’s here. 

           Coop continues to listen as some liquid cheese gets on his 
           headset. After careful thought he proceeds to lick off the 
           cheese from the headset. Arnold shakes his head and puts up 
           his paper. 

                                 COOP
                             (into phone)
                        I got it. I’m going to finish 
                        eating, then I’m going to pack some 
                        shit up and meet you back. 
                             (listens)
                        Yes. Alright. Jesus. I’ll take care 
                        of it.

           Jason comes into the dining room and finds Coop. He notices 
           Arnold, along with another CUSTOMER in the vicinity.

                                 JASON
                             (to Arnold)
                        How’s that sandwich? You need a 
                        refill on that coffee?

                                 ARNOLD
                        I’d love a refill Jason, thanks. 
                             (eyeing Coop)
                        Everything is great.

                                 JASON
                        Let me get that for you.

           Jason takes his coffee cup. 
                                 JASON
                             (to Coop)
                        Hi, Coop could I have a word with 
                        you outside please?

                                 COOP
                        I want some coffee too.

           Jason tries to hold his smile the best he can.

                                 JASON
                        Sure thing.

           EXT. BEEFY’S - LATER

           Coop stands at the back of the store smoking a cigarette. 
           Jason comes out the back exit. 

                                 JASON
                        What the hell are you doing here? 
                        We don’t need anybody connecting 
                        dots.

                                 COOP
                        Chill, I was hungry and I got some 
                        of those coupons.

                                 JASON
                             (angry)
                        You’re about to get a grand tonight 
                        and you’re worried about some 
                        stupid fucking coupons?

           Coop is visibly put off by Jason’s tone.

                                 COOP
                        I’m just making sure everything is 
                        copaseptic. 
                             (beat)
                        Thinking maybe you should give me 
                        that one grand right now. You know, 
                        just a little insurance in case 
                        you’re planning on splitting.

                                 JASON
                        What? Of course I’m not.
                             (beat)
                        And no, you’ll get your money 
                        tonight. I can’t pull it now. All 
                        the paperwork needs to be square. 
                        Jesus Coop.
           Coop seethes at being put in his place. He spits on the 
           ground.

                                 COOP
                             (threatening)
                        Fine. You disappear, I’ll just ask 
                        that purty looking girl up front 
                        about you. I bet she’d have some 
                        answers... and maybe a few other 
                        things for me too.

           Coop smirks sheepishly.

                                 JASON
                        Leave her out this.

                                 COOP
                        Well that really depends all on 
                        you, don’t it?

           Sirens approach in the distance as Coop walks off. Jason 
           fumes as an ambulance comes ripping into the parking lot. He 
           puts up his hand signaling for them to stop in the back.

           ADJACENT PARKING LOT

           DARREN, 40’s, slightly overweight and a grizzled face, 
           watches the back of Beefy’s from inside his SUV. He clocks 
           Coop getting into his truck.

           He takes a large, finishing bite of his roast beef sandwich. 
           He kills what’s left of a Diet Coke from a Beefy’s cup and 
           fires up his ignition. 

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           Next to a sign for the 13th Tee we find Brian Gill, pissing 
           onto a tree at the edge of a tee box. His holstered cell 
           phone vibrates, again from a blocked number. Concerned, he 
           answers.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (into phone)
                        Gill.

           We do not hear the other end of the call but Gill’s face 
           drops as he listens.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        What?
                             (listens)
                        Beefy’s? The one in Muncie?
           He continues to listen and nods, becoming more and more 
           pissed off. Two golf carts pull up behind his cart carrying 
           FOUR MEN IN THEIR THIRTY’S. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (into phone)
                        I’ll take care of it.
                             (beat)
                        Yes, of course now.

                                 MAN #1 (O.S.)
                        Hey Hollywood! Get off the phone.

                                 MAN #2
                        You got three groups stacked behind 
                        you. Let’s pick it up!

           Gill hangs up and turns staring down the four men through his 
           Oakley’s. 

                                 MAN #1
                        You got a problem Hollywood? Tee 
                        the fuck up already. 

           Gill removes his shades and heads calmly to the back of his 
           cart, taking out a driver. He turns and makes a bee line, 
           relaxed, but directly at Man #1 who now hops out of his cart.

                                 MAN #2 
                        Don’t be stupid Craig. He’s not 
                        worth the trouble.

                                 MAN #1 
                        What’s your problem?

           Gill goes straight up to the man and stops just short of 
           chest bumping him. He stands without touching the man, but is 
           right up to his face. The rest of the posse hop out of their 
           carts.

                                 MAN #3
                        Settle down now, no need for this. 
                        Lets play some golf.

           Gill moves to cut off the rest of the group by swinging his 
           driver around wildly in the air. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Get the fuck back! This is between 
                        me and the Alpha! Me and the Alpha! 

           The other three men jump back quickly, isolating Gill with 
           Man #1. Gill tosses his driver to the ground and walks back 
           up to Man #1. He gets right back in his face.
                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (quietly)
                        Are you the Alpha?

           The man shoves Gill but, Gill quickly puts himself right back 
           in the previous position. His eyes searching the man’s face.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Are you the Alpha?

                                 MAN #1 
                        You’re a fucking nut.

                                 MAN #4 (O.S.)
                        Forget this guy.

           Man #1 tries not to look at Gill in his eyes. Gill stares 
           cold almost lifeless. Then, lightening quick Gill grabs the 
           guy into a hug, cradling his head like a baby, he leans right 
           into his ear. Man #1 struggles but Gill holds on firmly.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (whispering)
                        I can see you.

           Man #1 shoves Gill off roughly and jogs back to his golf 
           cart.

                                 MAN #1
                        Fuck him, lets play through.

           They all pile back in and drive past Gill.

                                 MAN #3 
                             (in passing)
                        Grow up asshole!

           A few of them flip him off as Gill continues to stare them 
           down. Once out of sight, Gill begins wildly bashing his 
           driver into the ground, eventually breaking it. After the 
           tantrum he rests his hands on his knees. 

           After a beat, he begins to spew Bloody Mary onto the course. 

           INT. CHAD’S JEEP - DAY

           Chad and Griffin sit in their car which they strategically 
           parked, hidden from the other Beefy’s store. Chad ROLLS DOWN 
           ALL THE WINDOWS MANUALLY. Griffin is distracted on his phone. 
                                 CHAD
                        You’re the wheel man. Keep the car 
                        running. I’ll be out with the beef 
                        and toss it in, then we’ll go.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        You sure you don’t want me to go in 
                        with you?

                                 CHAD
                        The logistics could get 
                        complicated. It’s stealthier with 
                        one person. I know the people and 
                        the layout. Just be ready to go.

           PARKING LOT 

           Chad steps out of the car and walks purposefully toward the 
           other Beefy’s. He hides himself behind the dry shed that is 
           detached from the store. Peaking around the corner, he spots 
           the back exit and waits.

           BACK IN THE JEEP

           As Griffin plays Angry Birds on his phone, A HOMELESS MAN 
           approaches the window. 

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Sir!

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (startled)
                        Shit. What the hell?

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Sir, can you help me out? Spare 
                        some gas money? I need some gas 
                        money.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        No, man. Sorry.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Some change sir. I see some right 
                        there.

           The man indicates the clearly visible change stash in the 
           middle console. 

                                 GRIFFIN 
                        That’s not mine dude. Sorry. 
           Griffin, struggling, begins manually rolling the windows up 
           as the Homeless Man just stands there. The Homeless Man taps 
           on the window. Griffin motions for him to leave.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Go!

           After a few beats the Homeless Man complies and walks away. 
           Griffin goes back to his game.

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (to himself)
                        Shit’s getting real out here.  

           BEHIND THE DRY SHED

           Chad still crouched down, monitors the back door. He checks 
           the time on his phone, puts it back in his pocket. 

           Beat.

           The door opens... Out steps DEANNA, Not SCOTT. 

           Chad hesitates for a moment. But decides it doesn’t matter, 
           he’s going in. Deanna turns her back to light a cigarette. 

           Chad slides through the back door, unnoticed. 

           INSIDE

           Alone in the back kitchen, he frantically looks around. Spots 
           the prep table to find... NO BEEF.

           He glances to the ovens, the beef is still cooking. 

           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

           A timer for the ovens goes off.

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        Scott, the ovens!

           Chad thinks quickly, spots two oven mitts. He slides them on. 

           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

           The timers continue to sound. 

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Yeah, yeah. I’m getting ‘em.

           Chad freaks. He opens the oven and rips out a tray of two 
           roasts. One of which tumbles to the ground. 
           In a mad rush. He rips out a second tray, with both of those 
           roasts crashing to the floor. Scott rounds the corner to find 
           Chad standing over the mess.

                                 SCOTT
                        What the hell? Nick!

           Chad quickly throws two of the roasts from the ground onto 
           the tray and lifts it up. They have a stand-off.

                                 SCOTT
                        Put those down.

                                 CHAD
                        This has nothing to do with you. 

           Chad has three roasts stacked high, burning his chest, 
           sprints to the back door and kicks it open. 

           CHAD’S JEEP

           Griffin still quietly playing Angry Birds. He reacts to a 
           solid move, fist pumps.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Yes!

           PARKING LOT

           Chad dashes toward the car, Scott on his trail. Chad chucks 
           the tray towards the back window...

           SMACK. 

           The tray and beef NAIL the window that should have been open. 
           Chad trips and goes head first SLAMMING into the back door, 
           one of the roast landing on his head. 

           Griffin leaps out of the driver’s seat, Scott charging. 
           Griffin LUNGES into Scott tackling him to the ground. They 
           begin to wrestle on the concrete. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You little bitch. You want some?

           They wrestle sloppily as Nick comes running outside.

                                 NICK
                        Hey! Hey! Stop!

           Scott overtakes Griffin and pins his arms to the ground.

                                 SCOTT
                        Huh, punk? Now what?
           SMACK!

           The hot tray that once held the beef SLAMS into the side of 
           Scott’s head. Chad stands over him holding the tray... it 
           would be bad ass, but he still has oven mitts on.

                                 CHAD
                        Get off him, now! 

           Griffin begins to sit up. Scott is knocked out cold on the 
           ground. Nick closes in, but Chad just goes ape shit...

                                 CHAD
                        Get back cocksucker!

           He wildly swings the tray around. Nick stops in his tracks.

                                 CHAD
                        I’ll eat your face off!

                                 NICK
                        Settle down now. Let’s think this 
                        through.

                                 CHAD
                             (to Griffin)
                        Get the beef! 

           Griffin scrambles to his feet and picks up one of the roasts. 
           He heads to the driver’s side door.

                                 CHAD
                        We’re taking this beef and I swear 
                        to God if you go cry about this to 
                        anyone, I’ll come back here and 
                        sodomize you with a fucking 
                        baseball bat!

           Nick is in shock. Chad, eyes wild, continues glaring at him. 
           Griffin struggles to open the car door.

                                 CHAD
                             (to Griffin)
                        Let’s go!

                                 GRIFFIN
                        It’s locked. I uhh... it’s on the 
                        other side.

           Griffin, head down, walks around to the passenger side. The 
           window still open, he awkwardly reaches to unlock the door. 
           Then he walks back around to pick up the rest of the beef.
                                 CHAD
                        Jesus. Hurry up.

           Chad keeps the tray aimed at Nick like a loaded gun.

                                 NICK
                        Jason isn’t going to be too happy 
                        about what happened here today.

                                 CHAD
                        Oh please, you think he gives a 
                        shit?

           Griffin finishes loading the beef.

                                 GRIFFIN
                             (to Chad)
                        We’re good.

                                 CHAD
                        Suck it Nick.

           Chad throws down the tray and jumps into the driver seat. 
           They peel out as Nick rushes over to Scott who has begun to 
           recover from the blow to his head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHAD’S JEEP - MOMENTS LATER

           Chad is visibly shaken from the showdown, still with the oven 
           mitts on, he clutches the steering wheel.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        That. Was. Awesome! Dude, where did 
                        that come from?

                                 CHAD
                        I think I’m going to puke.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        That was like the Rock just coming 
                        in and laying the smack down. I 
                        mean a tray to the dome? That’s 
                        some Wrestlemania shit. 

                                 CHAD
                        The beef. How much did we get?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Who cares. 
                                 CHAD
                        How much?

           Griffin takes a look in the back. Two roasts roll around on 
           the seats with flecks of asphalt embedded in the meat. 
           Another one is on the floor with a napkin stuck to it. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Three. They look pretty gamey. I 
                        mean they’ve rolled around the 
                        parking lot and this car. I don’t 
                        even want to know what’s been on 
                        those seat cushions.

                                 CHAD
                        They’ll be fine, whatever. We got 
                        them. Jason can stop bitching and 
                        we surprised the world.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Huh?

                                 CHAD
                        The world. No one in the world 
                        expected us to pull that off. And 
                        we did it.

           Griffin just stares at Chad, “wtf”?

                                 GRIFFIN
                        Outside of me, you and Jason, no 
                        one is going to know “in the 
                        world.” 

           Chad takes a beat, realizes he doesn’t know what he’s talking 
           about. He laughs.

                                 CHAD
                        Dude, I’m still kinda high and 
                        drunk right now.

           Griffin laughs. 

                                 GRIFFIN
                        That was badass back there. 

           They drive for a beat.

                                 GRIFFIN
                        You could probably take the oven 
                        mitts off now though.
           INT. BEEFY’S - DAY

           TWO PARAMEDICS wheel Florence out of the back of Beefy’s on a 
           stretcher. She is covered with a white sheet.

                                 JASON
                             (to the paramedics)
                        Thanks guys. Don’t want to freak 
                        out the customers.

           A POLICE OFFICER, stands next to Jason.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        So once you saw the deceased on the 
                        ground what did you do?

           Amanda approaches from the front and watches Jason’s poor 
           performance.

                                 JASON
                             (nervous)
                        Like I said sir. I immediately 
                        checked for a pulse. She had none. 
                        Smoke was pouring out of the ovens. 
                        So, I tried to, rectify the 
                        situation best I could in case that 
                        was... well. I mean...

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Calm down sir. This isn’t an 
                        interrogation. How long would you 
                        say you called 911 after you found 
                        no pulse?

                                 JASON
                        I would say...it was about...

                                 AMANDA
                             (interceding)
                        It was about ten minutes, sir. I 
                        called. Jason had me do it while he 
                        cleared out the smoke in the back. 
                        Florence was in charge of cooking 
                        the roasts which became burnt after 
                        she passed. Once she was found it 
                        was quite the situation and caused 
                        us to delay calling immediately. We 
                        apologize for that, it all seemed 
                        to happen very quickly.

           The police officer jots down some notes. His demeanor shows 
           he really doesn’t care.
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I’ll be in touch should we need any 
                        follow up information. From what 
                        the EMT’s said, there wasn’t much 
                        to be done. Don’t beat yourself up. 
                        We’ve got her personal information 
                        and will contact the family. 

           The officer begins to leave. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Say, y’all wouldn’t mind giving me 
                        a couple roast beef sandwiches for 
                        the road would ya?

                                 AMANDA
                        Sure officer...

                                 JASON
                             (interrupting)
                        You know, I’m going to have to 
                        recommend our original chicken 
                        sandwich. Have you tried one 
                        before?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        No, can’t say I’ve tried a chicken 
                        sandwich... at Beefy’s before. 

                                 JASON
                        Let me set you up. 

           Jason walks away, Amanda follows concerned. He tosses two 
           frozen chicken breasts into the fryer.

                                 AMANDA
                        What the hell is going on with you 
                        today?

                                 JASON
                        We can’t give him beef Amanda, 
                        we’ve got about thirty minutes 
                        before we are out. There’s three 
                        catering orders that will show up 
                        any minute, and we are fucked if 
                        the burnouts don’t get here.

           Jason checks his watch.

                                 AMANDA
                        If we run out, we run out Jason. 
                        Will you tell me what’s going on 
                        with you, why was Coop here? 
           He grabs a land line phone off the cradle and dials.

                                 AMANDA
                             (whispering)
                        Are you in trouble?

           She puts her hand on Jason’s arm. He pulls away as someone 
           answers.

                                 JASON
                             (into phone)
                        Hi, I was just calling to confirm 
                        the time of the Beefy’s catering 
                        order today.

           He listens, eyes on Amanda. Maybe he will tell her.

                                 JASON
                             (into phone)
                        3PM? Okay great. Thank you.

           He hangs up. Amanda waits.

                                 JASON
                        I’m...

                                 KIRSTEN (O.S.)
                             (interrupting)
                        Hey Jason?

           Kirsten stands behind them.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        There’s someone here from the 
                        baseball team to pick up their 
                        order.

                                 JASON
                        Let them know I’ll be up there in 
                        just a second. And Kirsten, start 
                        pushing chicken, mozzarella sticks, 
                        anything that isn’t roast beef. 
                        Tell the others. 

           A BACKLINE EMPLOYEE now interrupts Jason...

                                 BACKLINE EMPLOYEE
                        Hey boss.

           A metallic squeaking sound emanates loudly.

                                 BACKLINE EMPLOYEE
                        We are out of beef.
           Jason’s face drops. His whole plan is crumbling. He crosses 
           to the slicer, still slicing but grinding against nothing. He 
           shuts it off.

           Jason stands there speechless. His world spinning out of 
           control.

                                 AMANDA
                        Jason, tell me...

                                 KIRSTEN (O.S.)
                        Hey Jason, there’s another catering 
                        order, this one from the campus.

           Kirsten comes around the corner again.

                                 JASON
                             (dismissive)
                        Thanks Kirsten. 

                                 KIRSTEN
                        And Amanda, I think it’s your 
                        boyfriend out there, Gary? He’s 
                        asking for you.

                                 AMANDA 
                        Thanks Kirsten. 
                             (to Jason)
                        I’ll be right back. Just give me a 
                        minute okay?

           Jason, alone, lays against the wall and slides down to the 
           ground. He covers his face in his hands.

           The sounds of the restaurant become piercing. Conversations, 
           beeping fryers, dings from microwaves. It all begins to 
           overwhelm him, he closes his eyes.

           Long beat.

                                 CHAD (O.S.)
                        Somebody looking for some 
                        muthafuckin’ beef?

           Jason opens his eyes to find Chad and Griffin hovering, 
           heroically holding roasts on their shoulders like they are 
           returning from a Paleolithic hunt. 

                                 CHAD
                        Damn Jace, you look like shit.

           Jason hops up to his feet and grabs the beef, in a quick 
           motion flings it onto a slicer. 
                                 JASON
                             (to Backline Employee)
                        Let’s get this out, we have an 
                        order of seventy sandwiches out 
                        there.

           The backline employee fires up the slicer. 

                                 JASON
                             (to Griffin)
                        Start dropping buns. 
                             (to Chad)
                        How many roasts did you get?

                                 CHAD
                        Three.

                                 JASON
                             (to Backline Employee)
                        I need you to thin out every order. 
                        Leave one ounce of beef off each 
                        sandwich. 

                                 BACKLINE EMPLOYEE
                        An ounce a piece? People will 
                        notice that.

                                 JASON
                        I’ll deal with the people. If Jesus 
                        could feed five thousand people 
                        with five fish and a loaf of bread 
                        I’ll be goddamned if I can’t 
                        stretch three roasts.

           While the employees start following his orders, Jason grabs a 
           tray liner and starts scribbling on the back.  

                                 JASON
                        We have an hour until our next six 
                        roasts come out.

           Amanda comes back around to Jason, who finishes writing. He 
           abruptly hands the paper off to her.

                                 JASON
                        Start filling this order. Then I 
                        need you to cover me for dinner. 
                             (beat)
                        This order, I’ll need to deliver.

           Amanda studies the paper as Jason storms off. 
           INT. BALL JAR FACTORY - DAY

           Jason sits in the lobby of an industrial office space, 
           nondescript aside from the plethora of Ball Jars spread 
           around as decorations. He has multiple bags of Beefy’s at his 
           feet. With nervous energy, his knee bobs up and down. 

           A door opens, and a small portly woman, BECKY, an office 
           manager of some sort, greets him. She carries a small deposit 
           bag. 

                                 BECKY
                        Can I help you?

           Jason rises and extends his hand as Becky sizes him up.

                                 JASON
                        Hi. I’m Jason, I work at the 
                        Beefy’s over on Wheeling. 

                                 BECKY
                        Becky. Nice to meet you. I thought 
                        Nick would be dropping off the 
                        order like usual. 

                                 JASON
                        Nick ran into a terrible problem 
                        this morning, ovens were 
                        malfunctioning, the fire department 
                        had to be called in.

                                 BECKY
                        Oh lord. Is everyone alright? 

                                 JASON
                        Oh yeah, nothing like that. 
                        Everybody is okay. Just one of 
                        those days. Anyway, he called me to 
                        see if I could help him out today.

           She looks at him, a bit skeptical.

                                 JASON
                        I took the liberty of tossing in 
                        some extra curly fries and cheddar 
                        cups, just to apologize in advance 
                        for the confusion.

           Becky eyes the bags with delight. 

                                 BECKY
                        Why thank you.

           She quickly hands the deposit bag over to Jason. 
                                 BECKY
                        Do tell Nick I’ll look forward to 
                        seeing him next Monday. 

                                 JASON
                        Absolutely.

           Becky nods to her receptionist, who rises to retrieve the 
           bags. 

                                 BECKY
                        Thanks again.

           As Becky leaves, Jason zips open the deposit revealing a 
           stack of cash. His plan back on track.

           INT. COOP’S MOBILE HOME - DAY

           A low rent, railroad style mobile home. The place is a mess, 
           dirty dishes on every surface, peeling wallpaper, and empty 
           beer cans.

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        Hey dawg, I got a job for us.

           BEDROOM 

           A DUFFLE BAG is tossed onto an unmade bed. We find Coop on 
           his cellphone throwing clothes into the bag.

                                 COOP
                             (into phone)
                        You know the Beefy’s over on 
                        Wheeling? Well a little birdie told 
                        me that if we go in waving a gun, 
                        they’ll hand over their money no 
                        fuss. Called the ‘Doormat Rule’.

           As he listens, he paces around. He pulls open a drawer to 
           reveal TWO HANDGUNS. Like toys, he chucks them into the bag. 

                                 COOP
                        That’s it. I figure since I got the 
                        tip and they know me, you go in, 
                        and I’ll handle the wheel. We can 
                        split fifty-fifty which will be 
                        like 5K a piece.

           Coop paces out of the bedroom and into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           He heads to a drawer, opens it up.
                                 COOP
                        What do you wear? I ain’t no 
                        stylist but why don’t you try a ski 
                        mask and some comfortable sneaks 
                        for running or some shit.
                             (listens)
                        Yeah, I got a piece. Bring what you 
                        got though. 

           Coop puts the phone on his shoulder and listens as he walks 
           back into the...

           BEDROOM

           He grabs some underwear out of the drawer.

                                 COOP
                        A four ten? I guess that’s fine. I 
                        mean, it’s barely enough to kill a 
                        rabbit but it won’t matter. You’re 
                        just gonna stick it in somebody’s 
                        face.
                             (listens)
                        Naw, fuck Dip. He’s not in on this. 
                        This my deal. Dip’s going out of 
                        town for good. We do this thing and 
                        I’m a lay low at my buddy’s in St. 
                        Louis for a few weeks.

           Coop listens as he spots, next to a pipe, some flakes of a 
           green algae-like looking substance. This is salvia, a cheap 
           but strong hallucinogen.

                                 COOP
                        Yeah nigga, that’s right. Just meet 
                        me out there at 11:30, and we’ll be 
                        popping Cris’ by one.
                             (listens)
                        Alright, peace.

           Coop hangs up. He sits there nodding his head. Excited to be 
           the one calling the shots. He eyes the salvia, then checks a 
           clock -- there’s time for a celebratory trip. 

           He packs the bowl, lights up, and inhales deeply. As he 
           exhales, he immediately starts to tweak. Tourrette-like, he 
           shouts a few unintelligible bursts of speech. 

           A DISTORTED CRASH is heard in the living room. We are unsure 
           if it was real. 

           Coop rocks back and forth a bit, he stands up to check the 
           noise, walking into the...
           LIVING ROOM 

           COOP’S POV 

           TWO SIXTEEN POINT DEER. 

           Standing majestically in the middle of his shitty mobile 
           home. One of the deer wags its tail.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           REALITY 

           TWO MASKED DEERMEN, identical to the open. Stand with guns 
           pointed at Coop. 

           Coop begins to mumble and smirk. The Deermen look at each 
           other. Suddenly, Coop starts shrieking, really tripping 
           balls.

           Deerman #1 moves quickly and CRACKS Coop in the head with the 
           butt of a Shotgun. 

           Coop flops to the ground. There’s a fumbling at the front 
           door. Deerman #2 trains his gun at the door. After a long 
           beat, the door finally opens revealing...

           A THIRD DEERMAN. However, this one is wearing a bright green 
           golfing outfit and his mask is on crooked. It’s clearly BRIAN 
           GILL. 

           He kicks the door shut, frustrated. He’s holding a silenced 
           GLOCK 23. Coop is on the ground slowly rolling around and 
           twitching. Gill starts to rip off his deer mask. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (muffled)
                        Goddamn this thing.

           He successfully pulls it off. His face is bright red, sweaty, 
           with a distinct sunglass tan line on his face.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        What the fuck is going on here?

                                 DEERMAN #1
                             (muffled)
                        He’s tripping or some shit.

           Gill leans over to Coop.
                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Hey. Hey, mother fucker where is 
                        Dip?

           Coop is mumbling and slowly scratching the floor like a cat.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Where is Dip?

           As he leans a little closer, Coop LUNGES at him wildly. Gill 
           instinctively pulls away as...

           click.

           An incredibly soft sound, as Gill puts a silenced shot 
           straight through Coop’s eye. 

           Coop’s body falls to the floor with a thud. A pool of blood 
           slowly trails to the feet of the two Deermen. There is a long 
           silence.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (sarcastic)
                        Just fucking great.

           The other two remove their masks REVEALING DARREN, from the 
           Beefy’s parking lot, and JOE, the young man Gill met at the 
           golf course. 

           Gill drops the clip out of his Glock and tosses it to Darren.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        No fucking safety on this thing? I 
                        have no business with that gun. Get 
                        me a different one.

           Darren nods. Gill shakes his head to the ceiling. His cell 
           phone begins vibrating in his holster. Checking it...

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Cunt. Ass. Balls.

           He answers.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (pedestrian voice)
                        Hey honey!
                             (beat)
                        I know something came up at work 
                        and I had to...
                             (listens)
                        I hear you sweetie, and I did go 
                        golfing but...
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRIAN GILL (cont'd)
                             (yelling on the other end)
                        Okay, I’ll be back soon. I love...

           His wife has hung up.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (seething)
                        Fuck!

           Brian Gill rubs his temples. He slowly lowers his hands to 
           his knees, looking like he may spew again. He collects 
           himself.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Okay, this is what we are going to 
                        do. Clean this up, then you both go 
                        back and sit on the only lead we 
                        have left breathing. I have to go 
                        host a fucking Memorial Day cookout 
                        then I’ll meet up with you before 
                        midnight. We are closing this thing 
                        tonight.

           Joe and Darren both nod.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Oh, and please. Lets not kill this 
                        last guy before we find Dip.

           As Gill begins to leave...

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (to Joe)
                        Hell of a first day.

           INT. BEEFY’S - NIGHT

           Jason, exhausted, arrives back at Beefy’s. He walks through 
           the lobby, the crowd dwindled down. 

           He reaches over the counter and grabs a Beefy’s paper cup. He 
           walks to the drink station and fills up a coke. 

                                 AMANDA (O.S.)
                        Everything alright?

           Jason doesn’t even turn around to acknowledge Amanda and 
           heads into the...

           DINING ROOM 

           Jason takes a pull of his coke like it’s scotch. He collapses 
           into a booth and stares out the glass windows. 
           A moment of solitude, as he looks out on the expanse of the 
           suburban sprawl.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Rough day?

           PAUL, Late 30’s, evangelical pastor, very hip with a v-neck t-
           shirt and black frames is sitting across from Jason.

                                 JASON
                        Pastor Paul. How are you doing?

                                 PAUL
                        It seems like I’m having a better 
                        day than you.

           He smiles, he’s friendly, likeable.

                                 JASON
                        I’ve definitely seen better days. 
                        But, I think I’m starting to see 
                        the light at the end of the tunnel.

                                 PAUL
                        That’s great Jason. 
                             (philosophical)
                        Despair is best defeated with hope. 

                                 JASON
                        That from the bible?

                                 PAUL
                        No, I think I heard Oprah say it.

           Jason can’t help but smile. 

                                 PAUL
                        Haven’t seen you in church lately? 
                        Amanda not dragging you in anymore?

                                 JASON
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Yeah, uh no. Not really. 

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sure you’re excited about her 
                        engagement?

                                 JASON
                        Engagement?

                                 PAUL
                        Oh, you didn’t know? She and 
                        Gary...
                                 JASON
                        No I didn’t. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s great though. 

           Paul senses the discomfort. 

                                 PAUL
                        Anytime you want to talk about 
                        anything... or nothing, my door’s 
                        always open. 

                                 JASON  
                        Uh, yeah. I know. It’s just... 
                        thanks.

           Jason musters up his best fake smile. 

           INT. BEEFY’S - NIGHT

           A money counter rapidly flips bills. Jason sits slouched at 
           his desk looking like a strung out Tony Montana. The bills 
           finish flipping, he marks down the count and puts in another 
           stack. 

           He takes a large bite of a nearby roast beef sandwich, 
           inhaling it. More cash gets filed through. Amanda approaches 
           from behind...

                                 AMANDA
                        I finished the closing prep. You 
                        sure you don’t want me to close 
                        tonight?

                                 JASON
                        No that’s alright. Thanks though. 

           Amanda still hangs there.

                                 AMANDA
                        So, are you going to finally tell 
                        me what’s going on? With Coop, with 
                        your breakdowns today?

                                 JASON
                        Everything is fine now.

           Amanda feeling that’s all she is going to get starts walking 
           away.

                                 JASON
                        Congrats on the engagement by the 
                        way.
                                 AMANDA
                             (caught)
                        How’d you know?

                                 JASON
                        Pastor Paul came in.

                                 AMANDA
                        I was going to tell you, it’s 
                        just...

                                 JASON
                        It’s alright. 

           A pause. Neither knowing what to say.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m sorry Jason. I wanted to tell 
                        you a few nights ago. 

           Jason pulls out the postcard he had folded up from Holiday 
           World.

                                 JASON
                        Tony sent me this, must have been 
                        right before he had the stroke.
                             (reading it)
                        ‘Thanks for holding down the fort, 
                        I’m out here living the dream.’

           Amanda laughs a little.

                                 AMANDA
                        Wow.

                                 JASON
                        This job is going to eat away at me 
                        until it convinces me I’m lucky.
                             (beat)
                        That’s not going to be me. That 
                        can’t be me.

           Amanda walks over to Jason and kisses him on the forehead.

                                 AMANDA
                        Then don’t let it be.

           She lets that hang there for a moment, then walks over to a 
           desk and grabs her purse.

                                 AMANDA
                        Bye Jason, I’ll see you tomorrow.
           She leaves out of the back exit leaving Jason alone. He 
           stares at the cheesy postcard. Then chucks it in the trash.

           INT. DIP’S SISTER’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Dipper sits at his kitchen table. He has an open PC. He is 
           staring at an e-mail.

           “From: KrzyChkKelli86@aol.com

           Subject: Sorry

           u probably figured it out. but i ain’t coming back. i lost 
           most of the money. need the rest to live on. u can stay at 
           the house but i owe the bank. 

           take care of my beatiful lorelei...i know you will. sorry i 
           really tried...i know you won’t believe that but i did.”

           ON Dip, he’s been staring at this for awhile. No telling how 
           long he’s had it. He sips a beer. 

           Without a change of expression he violently chucks the PC 
           across the room.

           Lorelei hurries in.

                                 LORELEI
                        What was that Uncle Dip?

                                 DIPPER
                        Computer froze sugar. I unfroze it.

                                 LORELEI
                        Oh. Okay. 

                                 DIPPER
                        Hey Lorelei, you’re friends with 
                        the neighbor girl across the way 
                        right? What’s her name?

                                 LORELEI
                        Alisha.

                                 DIPPER
                        Yeah. That’s her. Why don’t you go 
                        spend the night at Alisha’s. I have 
                        to run out. Go run over there now 
                        and see if she’s home.

                                 LORELEI
                        Are you sure, all night?
           She squeals.

                                 LORELEI
                        Okay I’m going. 

           Lorelei sprints off.

                                 DIPPER
                             (calling after)
                        Make sure you take a toothbrush and 
                        a change of clothes!

                                 LORELEI (O.S.)
                        ‘Kay!

           Dipper takes another pull of his beer. He pulls out his cell 
           phone. Scrolls to “Coop”. Listens to the dial tone. 

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 DIPPER
                        Coop. It’s me.

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        What’s that?

                                 DIPPER
                        It’s me. Dip. Do you...

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                             (laughs)
                        I’m just playing, this is my voice 
                        mail. I ain’t here right now. 

                          DIPPER
                                                       COOP (V.O)
           Goddammit.
                                              Leave it.

           Dipper hangs up. He sets the phone on the table, stares 
           ahead.

           INT. COOP’S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

           Coop’s corpse, partially wrapped in tarp, sits in the 
           foreground as Joe, deer mask off, wipes up a pool of blood 
           from the floor. He pours bleach on the area. Darren, also 
           sans mask, is dumping anything of value into a duffle bag.

                                 DARREN
                        Gill is a little off his game 
                        today. Never seen him like that 
                        before.
           Joe doesn’t say anything, continues cleaning. 

                                 DARREN
                        Just figured I’d mention, he’s more 
                        polished than that. Not the type of 
                        guy you want to fuck with. 

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t assume nothing. I met him 
                        once before at one of the sites.

           They continue to work in silence, but Darren spots a tattoo 
           on Joe’s forearm. Large, scribbled from the hand of a child 
           “Kayden”. More than one letter backwards. 

                                 DARREN
                        You have a daughter?

           Joe looks up. Not sure if this is time for small talk.

                                 JOE
                        Only thing I’ve done right in this 
                        world, my angel.

                                 DARREN
                        That’s sweet. I got two boys 
                        myself. Never thought I could 
                        handle a girl, God must’ve agreed.

                                 JOE
                        Cunt for a mother though. But, I 
                        don’t let that stop me from taking 
                        care of her.

           Darren nods. Feels obligated to speak...

                                 DARREN
                        Listen. I’m saying this, because, I 
                        feel, in part, well, responsible. 
                        Gill puts the new guys like 
                        yourself under my wing. And, there 
                        ain’t much to it, just like the 
                        military, do what you’re told. But, 
                        one thing I need to say is, stay 
                        clean. You wanna drink a few, fine. 
                        Smoke a little pot, okay. I wish I 
                        could just say lay off the heavy 
                        shit. That’s what I told the last 
                        kid. But, now, it’s these pills. 
                        Tic Tac looking shit, seems 
                        harmless. But that’s the new heavy.

           Joe nods, no problem. Darren isn’t finished, like he’s baring 
           his soul.
                                 DARREN
                        I know I come from a different 
                        generation and shit. But, we left 
                        ourselves to feel the pain of our 
                        decisions. Never thought much about 
                        it, didn’t really have much choice 
                        ‘cept to drink ourselves to an 
                        early grave. But, looking back, it 
                        wasn’t so bad to feel that pain. 
                        Let’s you know you can feel. 

           That sits there for a long beat.

                                 JOE
                        What happened to the last kid?

                                 DARREN
                             (flat)
                        I had to put him down like a dog.

           EXT. BRIAN GILL’S HOME - NIGHT

           A BBQ in full swing. KIDS chase each other around the 
           backyard, WIVES sip Strawbarita’s and gossip. 

           Brian Gill sits in a lawn chair next to TWO SUBURBAN DADS.  
           Disinterested as they shoot the shit, he checks his watch.

           Gill spots an ANT crawling around his beer bottle on a nearby 
           side table. The ant attempts to scale the bottle. 

                                 SUBURBAN DAD #1
                        Can you believe a chick won the 
                        Indy 500? I mean what’s next, an 
                        Asian?

           The other man heartily laughs. Gill pays them no mind. He’s 
           entranced by the ant’s struggle to climb his beer bottle.

                                 SUBURBAN DAD #2
                        I don’t understand why there isn’t 
                        like, a WNBA for racing. A bunch of 
                        women driving around in circles.

                                 SUBURBAN DAD #1
                        Oh, they’ve got that. It’s called 
                        the Kohl’s parking lot on a 
                        Saturday.

           They both keep laughing. Gill doesn’t. The other two take 
           notice. Try to include him, after all it’s his party.
                                 SUBURBAN DAD #1
                        Say Brian, you seem to be doing 
                        pretty well for yourself. You still 
                        doing consulting for White Tail 
                        Developers?

                                 SUBURBAN DAD #2
                        You work with White Tail? Shit, I 
                        see their subdivisions everywhere. 
                        Like frickin’ Starbucks.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (disinterested)
                        Yeah, still there.

                                 SUBURBAN DAD #1
                        You know, my brother does that 
                        work. Says you guys can’t be 
                        outbid. What’s your secret over 
                        there?

           Gill looks at them like observing another species. He decides 
           to play.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        You see this ant here. I keep 
                        watching him climb this beer 
                        bottle.
                             (laughs to himself)
                        And no matter the obstacle: a pool 
                        of condensation, a 90 degree 
                        incline. No matter what, this ant 
                        is determined to get to the top of 
                        this bottle. 

           The two men are both keyed on the ant watching him climb 
           Gill’s beer bottle. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        He believes whatever is inside this 
                        bottle possesses what it is he’s 
                        been searching for his whole ant 
                        life.

           The ant reaches the bottleneck, he’s about to make it.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        What’s the secret?

           Gill lifts the beer bottle and the ant goes tumbling onto the 
           side table, in one swift move Gill uses the bottle to CRUSH 
           the ant to death. With a quick twist, he ends the suffering.
                                 BRIAN GILL
                        The secret is not to be the fucking 
                        ant.

           The two stare blankly. ‘Who is this guy?’

           INT. BEEFY’S - NIGHT

           Jason holds the stack of cash. The calculator reads 
           $11,127.28. Jason removes the one hundred and twenty seven 
           dollars from the stack and pockets the money for himself.

           He stuffs the cash into a deposit bag as we hear GLASS 
           SHATTER. Jason, concerned, goes to check it out...

           LOBBY

           Jason walks around front to find A MASKED MAN. The ultimate 
           irony, a real black guy wearing a ski mask here to rob him. 

                                 MASKED MAN
                             (low, masking his voice)
                        Put your fucking hands up! Put ‘em 
                        up!

           The Robber holds a small shotgun and wears obnoxious Day-Glo 
           Nike sneakers. This is Coop’s accomplice, not getting the 
           memo about Coop’s death. 

           He levels his shotgun at Jason, who looks like he’s about to 
           shit himself.

                                 JASON
                             (to himself)
                        You can’t be serious.

                                 MASKED MAN
                        Where’s the fucking money?

                                 JASON
                        Listen, I... I can’t get into the 
                        safe. 

                                 MASKED MAN
                        You want to die tonight? I know you 
                        got ten grand here. Where is it?

           The guy starts coughing from trying to mask his voice, the 
           shotgun wobbles but still aimed at Jason.

                                 JASON
                        Alright, don’t shoot. I got it, 
                        it’s in the back.
           The Masked Man keeps the gun on Jason as he crawls awkwardly 
           over the top of the counter. Jason keeps his hands up and now 
           the Man is next to him. He presses the barrel into Jason’s 
           back. 

                                 MASKED MAN
                        Keep moving. No funny business 
                        bitch. Make like a fucking doormat.

           Jason recognizes he’s been double crossed. He continues 
           moving slowly toward the safe in the office. They get to the 
           deposit bag which sits on Jason’s desk. Jason’s whole shot at 
           getting his life back is down to this.

           Jason pauses.

                                 JASON
                             (re: the bag)
                        There it is. 

           The Masked Man prods him with the barrel again, keeping it on 
           Jason’s back.

                                 MASKED MAN
                        Grab it. And give it here, slowly.

           Jason hesitates, he closes his eyes reaching deep down for 
           some sort of bravado. The Man presses the barrel in Jason’s 
           back again.

                                 JASON
                        Okay, okay.

           Jason picks up the bag... Then in one quick motion he spins 
           the barrel off his back and LEVELS the Masked Man in the face 
           with the money. 

           Stunning the Man more than hurting him... he tries to pull 
           the shotgun back on Jason one handed, but Jason knocks his 
           arm causing the gun to fall to the floor.

           Jason lunges forward and knocks both of them off their feet. 
           The Masked Man reaches for the gun but Jason starts wildly 
           punching him. All of the day’s aggression finally boiling 
           over.

           The Masked Man begins to choke Jason as he’s being punched. 
           It’s sloppy and Jason breaks free of the choke hold and falls 
           towards the gun.

           Jason grabs a hold of the gun as the Masked Man pounces back 
           on top of him. The Man grapples for the gun as Jason pushes 
           the barrel towards his face. The barrel waivers under both of 
           their chins as they push in a reverse tug of war. 
           The barrel gets under the Masked Man’s chin for a quick 
           second, just enough for...

           BANG. 

           Jason pulls the TRIGGER which explodes buck shot under the 
           Masked Man’s chin and pierces through the top of his head. 
           The Man is dead instantly.

           Jason drops the gun and lays his head on the ground. Lying on 
           the floor to catch his breath. He begins to slowly get up, 
           covered with the Man’s blood. 

           He gets to his feet and sees the Man, still with a ski mask 
           covering his face, lying in a growing pool of blood. Jason is 
           in shock. Tears form in his eyes. He aggressively pulls his 
           hair out of sorts.

           Slowly he walks over to his desk and begins searching for 
           something. He finds a pack of cigarettes. He starts tapping 
           the package. 

           He opens the back door needing some fresh air.

           OUTSIDE

           Jason exits the store and starts to pull out a cigarette. He 
           struggles to coordinate the lighting. His hands trembling 
           violently. He leans against the back of the building and 
           takes a deep drag. Coughs. 

           He tosses the cigarette to the ground, and ambles further 
           towards the parking lot. Not ready to go back inside.

           He walks past the dry shed and looks out into the parking lot 
           REVEALING...

           THE TWO MASKED DEERMEN.

           They are illuminated eerily by the lights over the empty 
           parking lot.

           ON JASON. He doesn’t move, a deer in headlights himself. The 
           Two Deerman lift their shotguns and begin to slowly approach. 
           Jason quickly turns and sprints for the door. Moving quickly, 
           he trips going HEAD FIRST into the door knocking himself out.  

           The Deerman look at each other. As they continue to approach 
           an engine ROARS in the distance. Headlights become fast 
           approaching towards Beefy’s otherwise empty parking lot. 

           The Deerman take off behind the side of the store, hidden 
           from view.
           Dip’s F-250 comes screeching to a halt in back of the store. 
           His headlights shine directly on Jason, who is barely 
           conscious on the ground.

           Dip steps out of his truck, unsure what to make of the 
           situation. Jason fades in and out as he sees Dip flip open 
           the tarp in the back of his truck. Jason blacks out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DIP’S SISTER’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Jason lies on the floor of Dip’s living room. We hear the 
           spraying from the camo dipping machine. 

           We find Dipper in front of the machine. A screen of 
           camouflage floats in the dark liquid. 

           Jason slowly comes to. He grips his forehead which is dried 
           with blood. Dip, apoplectic, begins violently shaking him...

                                 DIPPER
                        Where is the fucking money?

                                 JASON
                             (groggy)
                        What money?

                                 DIPPER
                        Where’s Coop? You two fucking me 
                        over?

           Dip grabs Jason by the neck and lifts him up with the 
           strength of a man possessed. He leads him towards the steel 
           camo dipping vat.

                                 JASON
                        Please. Don’t...

                                 DIPPER
                             (gripping Jason)
                        Where’s the fucking money?

                                 JASON
                             (groggy)
                        I..I don’t know, you, they took it. 
                        They...

           Dipper positions Jason’s head above the open vat. The screen 
           of camouflage has swirled from being hit...
                                 DIPPER
                        What? Who is they? What are you 
                        talking about?

                                 JASON
                        The..the deer. They had masks.

           Dipper stops wrestling with Jason for a beat.

                                 DIPPER
                        What deer? 

           Dipper searches Jason face showing some recognition to 
           Jason’s babbling.

                                 JASON
                             (now crying)
                        Please, these guys. With deer masks 
                        on...in the parking lot. They must 
                        have...

           Dipper’s hard face drops with fear. He lets a hold of Jason 
           who falls to the ground. Dip backs away and loses his balance 
           tripping into a coffee table.

           He scrambles back to his feet and runs straight to the door. 
           Dipper whips the door open to find...

           A MASKED DEERMAN. Before he can react a STUN GUN ejects 
           straight into his chest.

           The voltage runs through his body paralyzing him to the 
           ground. In walk the other Deerman and Gill who quickly closes 
           the front door. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Enough.

           The stun gun is shut off. Dipper is doubling over on the 
           floor.  

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (re: the Stun Gun)
                        I knew I had that thing somewhere. 
                        If he moves again, let him have it.

           The Deermen nod as Gill scans the surroundings. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Well, well, well. So here are the 
                        new digs. 
           Gill, much more refreshed than earlier, walks around the 
           room. Taking in the expensive furniture, big screen and 
           gaming system. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (off TV)
                        Is that a Plasma? LCD? You son of a 
                        bitch.

           Dipper is still slightly shaking on the ground as Gill mocks 
           him.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Ninety-two days since we loaned you 
                        a hundred thousand dollars. And 
                        what did you do with it? Huh?

           Gill puts a lightening fast fist into Dipper’s stomach.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        I should have known you would fuck 
                        me over you hillbilly piece of 
                        shit.
                             (beat)
                        But, it’s my fault with entrusting 
                        you with more capital and here we 
                        are.

           Gill notices the mysterious looking steel vat in the corner 
           by Jason. Jason grows nervous as Gill walks toward him.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (re: the vat)
                        And what’s this?

           He examines the floating camouflage screen not knowing what 
           to make of it.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        What the hell is?

           No one in the room answers. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Bring him here.

           The two Deermen grab Dipper and drag him over to the vat. He 
           reacts to the idea by trying to fight them off. Deerman #1 
           shoots electricity back to the attached stun gun. Dipper 
           convulses on his knees. Fighting for his life, he manages to 
           get up on one foot and take a swing at the Deerman. 
           Gill charges over and kicks Dipper firmly in the gut which 
           puts him down. Gill, strong for his size, lifts Dipper up 
           with the help of the other Deerman. 

           With all he has left, Dip tries to break free of Gill’s grip. 
           Gill holds tight by grasping the hair on back of Dip’s head. 
           He holds steady and stares straight into Dip’s eyes.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Be the ant.

           Dip too weak at this point to fight, stares unrelenting.

           In a quick motion, Gill dunks Dip’s face into the vat in an 
           attempt to drown him. The camo sheet begins to swirl around 
           and completely envelops Dip’s head. It also covers Gill’s arm 
           as he holds him under.

           Dip starts to violently fight to get back up for air. Gill’s 
           face is stoic, but the camouflage begins to dry to his skin. 
           He flings Dip out of the vat.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        What the fuck?

           Gill shakes his arm around.

                                 BRIAN GILL 
                        What is this shit?

           Gill quickly exits the room into the adjoining kitchen. 
           Dipper lays in the middle of the floor, hacking and 
           struggling for breath. His face is an unrecognizable camo 
           swirl, painted onto his skin. 

           The camouflage hardens inside his mouth and lungs causing him 
           to suffocate. He flops around on the ground like a fish out 
           of water. It is messy and slowly the camo becomes a mask that 
           snuffs the life out of him.

           His body convulses for a few more seconds then stops moving. 
           It’s a horrible sight. Jason cowers in the corner in shock. 

           A FAUCET IS TURNED ON. Running water echoes into the room.

                                 BRIAN GILL (O.S.)
                        This better come off. 

           The living room is now completely still. Two men standing in 
           deer masks holding weapons. Jason, tears in his eyes, blood 
           on his face, cowers in the corner. All staring at the 
           lifeless Dipper, laying in the middle of the floor, with a 
           face covered in camouflage.
           The faucet shuts off and Gill enters. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        You two clean this up. Sweep the 
                        house for anything of value. This 
                        redneck mismanaged over a hundred 
                        thousand dollars and we need to 
                        salvage what we can. One of you 
                        take care of the body here, one 
                        heads back to Beefy’s and cleans up 
                        there.

           The two men stand at attention.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        But, first one of you find some 
                        cleaner or something to get this 
                        shit off my arm.

           They nod and head upstairs leaving Gill alone with Jason. 
           Gill notices a ‘Delinquent’ bank note on a nearby table. He 
           examines it, puts it in his pocket. 

           Then Gill pulls the deposit bag, from Beefy’s, out of his 
           back pocket. He waves it at Jason.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        I believe this belongs to you.

           He tosses it in front of Jason who doesn’t move.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        You’re going to get out of here. 
                        Show up to work tomorrow just like 
                        normal, and forget any of this ever 
                        happened. 

           And with that Gill leaves. Jason is alone with Dipper’s body. 
           Jason hunched against the wall, truly broken.

           INT. BEEFY’S - MORNING

           Jason sits slumped at his desk, a band-aid over his forehead 
           from this run in with the back door. His eyes are puffy from 
           lack of sleep, he looks like shit.

           A red light blinks on the land-line phone next to his 
           computer. He presses play as employees mill about behind him. 

                                 VOICEMAIL (O.S.)
                        You have one, new, message. 
           The voice mail begins but Jason’s focus is on the spot where 
           he last saw the body of Coop’s accomplice, not ten feet away.

                                 REGIONAL MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Hey Jason, it’s Diana, from 
                        Regional. Look, I got an odd call 
                        from Nick at the Anderson store. He 
                        told me two of your employees 
                        assaulted an employee of his and 
                        that you stole one of his catering 
                        orders. Now, I just want to get 
                        both sides of the story, but this 
                        isn’t a great start if you want to 
                        take the reigns at your store. I’m 
                        going to head out there today to...

           Jason clicks off, he could care less.

                                 AMANDA (O.S.)
                        Hey, Arnold’s asking about you. 
                        He’s out in the lobby. 

           Amanda walks behind Jason who is staring at nothing. Then, a 
           weird half smile comes across his face. His first genuine 
           smile. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Whoa, what happened to your head?

                                 JASON
                             (distracted)
                        Huh? It’s nothing.

           Jason breaks into a full smile and a small laugh to himself.

                                 AMANDA
                        What are you smiling at?

                                 JASON
                        Diana’s coming out here today. I’m 
                        going to quit.

                                 AMANDA
                        What?

                                 JASON
                        You were right. I’m in charge of my 
                        own fate. I’m going to put in my 
                        two weeks, move to Florida, I don’t 
                        know, work at a hotel or 
                        something... anything.

                                 AMANDA
                        Are you serious?
                                 JASON
                        Why not? It’s going to be great.

           Jason, smiling, heads up front. Light on his feet.

                                 AMANDA
                        Wait. Jason... Jason come here for 
                        a minute.

           But Jason is gone...

           LOBBY 

           Jason looks around at all the employees, the customer’s, 
           taking it in. He no longer is carrying the weight of this 
           world, he breathes it in. 

           DINING ROOM

           Jason walks out to through the lobby and spots Arnold, 
           talking to A MAN,  who’s back is facing us. Arnold smiles at 
           Jason and waves him over. As Jason approaches he comes around 
           to...

           REVEAL THE MAN AS BRIAN GILL. 

           Jason freezes up. 

                                 ARNOLD
                        Jason. Have a seat. 

           Arnold motions for Jason to sit across from him. Gill puts on 
           a sinister smile that clashes with his tucked in polo shirt.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                             (smarmy)
                        There he is. 

           Jason sits down slowly, unsteady. 

                                 ARNOLD
                             (motioning at Gill)
                        I believe you two have already met.

           Jason nods, he has no words. Arnold now has an air of 
           severity we haven’t seen before. He lifts a sugar from the 
           group of his perfectly aligned packets. He pours the first 
           into his coffee. 

                                 ARNOLD
                        To know something, to really know 
                        it, is something I value. Like when 
                        I walk in here, I know exactly what 
                        I’m going to get. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARNOLD (cont'd)
                        A friendly chat, a roast beef 
                        sandwich, a coffee, and this seat. 
                        You are essential to that equation.

           Arnold gives a slight nod to Gill.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        You’re forgiven your debt to 
                        Dipper. However, someone has to be 
                        accountable for the debt Dipper 
                        owed, one hundred thousand dollars. 
                             (beat)
                        That person is you.

           Jason’s face is draining of color.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Lucky for you Jason. I know you. 
                        You are here at Beefy’s for the 
                        long haul. And for that, we have a 
                        solution that I know will work for 
                        all parties involved.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        The way we do business requires a 
                        certain practice known as money 
                        laundering. Once a week, I’m going 
                        to hand you two thousand dollars of 
                        illicit funds. You’ll swap that 
                        money, with Beefy’s money. You’ll 
                        give me the clean legitimate two 
                        thousand and we’ll repeat the 
                        process every week. That way we 
                        clean one hundred thousand dollars 
                        a year. We typically pay our 
                        cleaners a five percent fee. So 
                        that comes out to 5K you earn each 
                        year to erase your debt. Does that 
                        make sense?

           Jason slowly nods. Putting it all together.

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Bottom line, we are going to own 
                        you for the next twenty years.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Now don’t panic Jason. You’ll be 
                        living your life just as you were. 
                        As long as you are here at Beefy’s. 
                        You’ll be safe. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Are we being clear Jason?
                                 JASON
                             (almost in audible)
                        Yes.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Great, thanks Jason. I knew you’d 
                        be a good sport about all this.

           Gill and Arnold are all smiles. Jason gets up and begins 
           walking away slowly, we follow him to... 

           BACKLINE AREA 

           Jason, in shock, now walks heavy and disoriented, on the 
           verge of a panic attack. 

           BACK TO LOBBY

           Gill and Arnold continue their conversation... 

                                 ARNOLD
                             (scathing)
                        Bringing your mess all the way to 
                        the foot of my doorstep. 

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        You don’t have to involve this kid, 
                        there’s the house.

                                 ARNOLD
                        What about the house?

                                 BRIAN GILL
                        Dip’s sister owned it. She 
                        purchased it after the housing 
                        bubble for a song. She’s been 
                        delinquent now for three months and 
                        the home was about to be taken over 
                        by a regional bank to which we have 
                        some ties.

           BACK ON JASON

           Lost, walking without purpose. One sound takes over in his 
           head, the rhythmic sound of the slicer, churning, humming 
           under the sound of Gill’s voice. 

                                 BRIAN GILL (O.S.)
                        I’ll start the paperwork today, and 
                        we could have that property under 
                        one of our loan out company’s in a 
                        few months. Once flipped we’ll net 
                        in the six figures. More than 
                        enough to cover Dip’s debt.
           BACK ON ARNOLD

           He contemplates Jason’s fate. The slicer still rhythmically 
           cutting. He sips his coffee. Long beat.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Looks like I came out ahead then.

           CLOSE ON THE SLICER

           Mirroring the opening, the slicer is piling up beef. Higher 
           and higher. 

           CLOSE ON JASON

           He stares at the slicer. All the sounds of the restaurant 
           begin crashing in. Fryers sizzling, employee chatter, 
           microwaves humming. Overwhelming, claustrophobic. Tears well 
           in Jason’s eyes. He’s not going anywhere. 

           And one more time. Loud, overwhelming, that fucking miserable 
           drive-thru beep...

           BEEP.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
