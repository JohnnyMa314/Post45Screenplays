           EXT. DALLAS LOVE FIELD - 11:35 A.M. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE stand behind a chest-high chain link 
           fence. They cheer as their anticipation grows.

           Secret Service Agent JERRY KIVETT, 28, walks along the inside 
           of the fence where several DALLAS POLICE OFFICERS stand post. 

           NEWS FOOTAGE from WFAA-TV is spliced in, with the sounds of 
           BOB WALKER providing commentary.

                                 BOB WALKER (V.O.)
                        Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, 
                        this is Bob Walker speaking from 
                        Dallas Love Field... 

           Kivett breaks away from the fence and moves toward WELCOMERS 
           near a LINE OF CARS. He approaches Assistant Special Agent in 
           Charge RUFUS YOUNGBLOOD, 39, a focused strength.  

                                 AGENT KIVETT
                        Rufus. Everything’s set. That 
                        Lincoln convertible is yours. 

           Youngblood nods and returns his attention to the man he 
           protects, Vice President LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON, overweight, 
           hunched over, and with a face much older than his 55 years. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Mr. Vice President, we’ll be in the 
                        third car - the gray Lincoln. 

           A stoic Johnson nods. He holds a folded copy of the Dallas 
           News. The headline reads: “Yarborough Snubs LBJ.” 

           At Johnson’s side is his wife LADY BIRD, 50. She notices her 
           husband’s fixation on the newspaper. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Lyndon, would you put that away? 
                             (re: the crowd)
                        Have you ever seen such enthusiasm?

           Johnson scans their faces. Not a single eye looks back at 
           him. Everyone stares past him at the glistening blue and 
           white Boeing 707 that is AIR FORCE ONE. It taxis to a stop. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        What’s the word on Senator 
                        Yarborough?
                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        The President told Yarborough that 
                        he either rides with you today or 
                        he can walk through downtown 
                        Dallas. 

           Youngblood expected Johnson to be more amused by this 
           anecdote. Johnson just nods and hands the paper off.

           A set of stairs is wheeled up to the rear hatch of Air Force 
           One where a radiant JACKIE KENNEDY, 34, in her pink suit and 
           pillbox hat emerges. Just behind her is the captivating 
           President of the United States, JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, 46. 

                                 BOB WALKER (V.O.)
                        Here’s Mrs. Kennedy. And the crowd 
                        yells. And the President of the 
                        United States. And I can see his 
                        suntan all the way from here! 

           On the ground, White House Photographer CECIL STOUGHTON, 41 
           snaps a photo of the First Couple. 

           Johnson and Lady Bird move to the bottom of the steps at the 
           front of a RECEIVING LINE. As JFK and Jackie reach the 
           bottom, someone hands Jackie a bouquet of red roses. Johnson 
           is the first to shake hands with the President. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Mr. President. 

                                 JFK
                        Hello, Lyndon. 

           JFK follows Secret Service agents, but seeing the fervor of 
           the crowd, breaks away and moves to shake hands. People fight 
           for position, causing the fence to buckle. Johnson follows.

           JFK shakes hands. As he releases one, Johnson tries to grab 
           it but before he can, the hand is recoiled, its owner still 
           fixated on JFK. Johnson looks at his own outstretched hand. 

           Johnson steps aside and moves to his rented LINCOLN 
           CONVERTIBLE. Youngblood and Lady Bird follow. 

           Youngblood opens the car’s rear door and Johnson and Lady 
           Bird climb in. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Don’t ya just love Texas?

           Johnson nods, not looking at the crowd. He sets his WHITE 
           STETSON on his knee. 
                                 LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Is there any place you’d rather be?

           Johnson contemplates this question. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “TAJ MAHAL” - CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY - 1959

           SUPER: FOUR YEARS EARLIER

           The huge two-room suite in the U.S. Capitol Building that has 
           been converted into an ornate office.

           JUANITA ROBERTS, Johnson’s secretary, escorts an intimidated 
           Senator RALPH YARBOROUGH, 55, in from the outer office.

           The walls and the 20-foot high ceilings are golden and 
           covered with murals. A full-size portrait of Johnson hangs 
           over a marble fireplace. 

           AIDES and SECRETARIES hurry about. Among them are WALTER 
           JENKINS, 41, faithful servant of Johnson’s, and GEORGE REEDY, 
           42, Special Assistant and go-to whipping boy for Johnson. 

           The office is a whirlwind of organized chaos and at the 
           center of it all, behind his desk, stands the Senate Majority 
           Leader - Lyndon Johnson, four years younger than in Dallas. 
           He overflows with power. 

           Juanita shows Yarborough to his seat where he watches Johnson 
           wrap up a phone call in that strong Texas drawl. 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (into the phone)
                        Because I’m not General Custer and 
                        this isn’t Little fuckin’ Bighorn. 
                        If you have an objection, you make 
                        it now, before I head to the floor 
                        of the United States Senate... Well 
                        good. That’s what I like to hear. 

           Johnson hangs up and looks to Jenkins. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        We got him, Walter.  

           Jenkins makes a note of it. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Senator Yarborough-

           Yarborough stands, ready to shake Johnson’s hand. 
                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be right with you. 

           Johnson looks past Yarborough to Juanita entering with the 
           affable Majority Whip, Senator MIKE MANSFIELD, 56. 

                                 JUANITA
                        Senator Mansfield, sir. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Mike, come on in. I’ve been waiting 
                        on the count. Give me the number. 

                                 SENATOR MANSFIELD
                        About 48.

                                 JOHNSON
                        No. “About 48” is not a number. 

                                 SENATOR MANSFIELD
                        That’s the closest approximation I 
                        could get. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I want you to imagine putting your 
                        pecker on this desk. 

           Mansfield is amused, yet terrified.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Now if we put your little 2-inch 
                        pecker right here at the edge and 
                        then I grabbed a hatchet and told 
                        you I was gonna swing it down at 
                        about 2 and a half inches from the 
                        edge, are you nervous?

           Mansfield nods.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Damn right you are. Well that’s how 
                        nervous I get when I hear that our 
                        count is “about 48.” So go back and 
                        get me an actual number. 

                                 SENATOR MANSFIELD
                        Yes, Leader. 

           He departs. Johnson goes to a wet bar and fixes two scotches.

                                 JOHNSON
                        What the hell good is a whip who 
                        can’t count? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        Juanita, dear, call Dirksen’s 
                        office and tell them I’d like to 
                        speak to the senator at his 
                        earliest convenience. George, get 
                        my tailor on the phone. 

                                 REEDY
                        Who’s Mike Taylor?

                                 JOHNSON
                        What? No, not Mike Taylor - my 
                        tailor: the guy who makes my 
                        fucking clothes. Get him on the 
                        phone, would ya? Now, Senator 
                        Yarborough. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Mr. Leader.

           Johnson brings the drinks to Yarborough and offers him one.

                                 YARBOROUGH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t drink. 

           Johnson clearly thinks this concept is absurd. Oh well. He 
           pours Yarborough’s drink into his own and then sits next to 
           Yarborough in front of the desk.

                                 YARBOROUGH (CONT’D)
                        If you called me here to ask about 
                        my vote, I should tell you I 
                        haven’t made up my mind yet. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        That’s no problem. No problem at 
                        all. Listen, while I have you here, 
                        there is one thing I’ve been 
                        meaning to ask you... Have you got 
                        shit for brains?

           Jenkins and Reedy look to see what kind of storm is brewing. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Excuse me. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        What in the hell are you doing 
                        critizin’ the ‘57 Civil Rights Act?

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        I’d remind you that I voted for it. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        As did I. But now it seems that I’m 
                        the only one of us who supports it. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        It’s just not an impressive piece 
                        of legislation. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        It was the first civil rights law 
                        passed since the goddamn Civil War. 
                        It’s historic legislation. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        It was toothless. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        The only thing more irritating than 
                        a liberal is a liberal from Texas. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        My constituents want-

                                 JOHNSON
                        Your constituents are my 
                        constituents, and they have been 
                        for a lot longer so don’t tell me 
                        what they want. Just because after 
                        three failed attempts at the 
                        governor’s mansion you finally 
                        managed to win an election doesn’t 
                        mean you know a damn thing about 
                        what the voters of Texas want.

           Reedy approaches skittishly and hands Johnson a note. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Baker! 

           The Senate Secretary BOBBY BAKER, 31, a weasel of man, has 
           been sitting off to the side. He stands at attention now. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (re: the note)
                        This senator has forgotten he works 
                        for me. Bring him here and let’s 
                        give him a little reminder. 

                                 BAKER
                        You got it, Leader. 

           Baker eagerly exits to carry out the task while Johnson 
           returns his attention to Yarborough. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        With the Civil Rights Act of 1957 
                        we gave the negros the right to 
                        vote. So what’s your objection?

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Businesses can ban them, 
                        restaurants can refuse them, and 
                        schools won’t admit them. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You give a man the vote and he can 
                        speak for himself about everything 
                        else at the ballot box. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        It’s not that simple. 

           Juanita enters.

                                 JUANITA
                        Senator Dirksen is on the phone.

                                 REEDY
                        I’ve got your tailor as well. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You realize Juanita managed to get 
                        the Minority Leader of the Senate 
                        quicker than you could locate a man 
                        who sews for a living?

           Johnson shakes his head at Reedy and then grabs the phone.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        This is Lyndon Johnson... Yeah.

           Put on hold, Johnson looks up to Yarborough. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        You think this issue is more 
                        important to you than it is to me?

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        I voted for the 1957 Civil Rights 
                        Act because black citizens ought to 
                        have equality. You voted for it 
                        because you thought it would help 
                        you get elected president. So yes, 
                        I do think this issue is more 
                        important to me than it is to you.
                                 JOHNSON
                             (into the phone)
                        Senator Dirksen, this is Lyndon... 
                        We want to take this to the floor 
                        now but I want to make sure we can 
                        do that without our two parties 
                        nippin’ at each other like a pack 
                        of rabid dogs... Uh huh, well I 
                        thank you as always, Senator.

           Johnson hangs up and looks to Jenkins. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Get ready to move. 
                             (to Yarborough)
                        Now what were we talking about?

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Civil rights. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Oh yeah, you were accusing me of 
                        being for equality only to get 
                        elected president. Speaking of 
                        which, you haven’t endorsed me.

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        You haven’t announced. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        That’s beside the point. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        I’m not endorsing anyone... But if 
                        I were, it wouldn’t be you. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You like Kennedy?

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Senator Kennedy and I share many of 
                        the same principles, yes.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You got your show horses and you 
                        got your workhorses. Kennedy’s a 
                        show horse - easy on the eyes but 
                        when you need your field plowed he 
                        won’t do you any good. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        What’s most important to me-
                                 JOHNSON
                        Hold that thought. 

           Johnson picks up his phone. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        This is Lyndon Johnson... Hello 
                        there. Listen, last year you made 
                        me a blue suit that was near 
                        perfect. Now I want three more just 
                        like it but you gave me the 
                        standard trousers last time and 
                        they don’t fit me right. What I 
                        need is for you to let out the 
                        crotch about four inches. See, I’m 
                        what they call “well-endowed” so 
                        you give me the average man’s pants 
                        and I get all bunched up. I need 
                        some added room in there from my 
                        nuts to my bunghole so that my 
                        valuables can hang free... All 
                        right, I sure appreciate it. 

           Johnson hangs up. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        I was saying that what’s most 
                        important to me is-

                                 JOHNSON
                        Shit. Hold that thought. 

           Baker enters and Johnson motions him over. Baker whispers 
           into Johnson’s ear. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (to Baker)
                        Bring him in. 

           Baker, still holding the note that Johnson gave him, leads a 
           SENATOR, 50s, into the office. Johnson moves to him and gives 
           him a two-handed greeting, never letting go. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Senator. Here’s the deal - 
                        we’re bringing this thing to a vote 
                        A.S.A.P and I need to know right 
                        now that I have your support. 

                                 SENATOR
                        With all due respect-
                                 JOHNSON
                        Now here’s what I’m gonna do. My 
                        office has sent some flowers over 
                        to your wife to show our 
                        appreciation for her letting us 
                        keep you here tonight to burn the 
                        midnight oil. We have also rented 
                        you a room at that Hay-Adams. Now, 
                        you can either stay here and fight 
                        me all night until I beat you, as 
                        you know I will, or you can take 
                        that beautiful secretary of yours 
                        to the hotel and get a nice meal 
                        and maybe a little shuteye. 

           Johnson winks and the Senator knows he’s being threatened. 

                                 SENATOR
                        All right, Mr. Leader. You have my 
                        vote. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Why thank you, Senator. 

           Only now does Johnson let go of the Senator’s hand. The 
           Senator leaves. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (to Yarborough)
                        Some of ‘em you have to pet, some 
                        you have to prod. A good rancher 
                        knows the difference.

           Jenkins puts a call on hold and hands Johnson a note.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (re: the note)
                        Remind him that he’s up for 
                        reelection and nobody here liked 
                        him that much in the first place. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        What’s most important to me is that 
                        the Democratic nominee for 
                        president represent the best 
                        principles of our Party. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Show horses. Workhorses. Remember, 
                        you only get to back one horse. 

           Johnson looks to the door to the outer office where Georgia 
           Senator RICHARD RUSSELL, 61, a living legend, enters. TWENTY 
           SOUTHERN DEMOCRATIC SENATORS march behind him. 
           Russell enters the main office while the others stand in the 
           outer office. Johnson and Yarborough stand.  

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Senator Russell, I appreciate you 
                        getting here on such short notice. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        My troops are ready, Lyndon. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I see that. Senator Yarborough here 
                        was just informing me that he is 
                        not a fan of the Civil Rights Act 
                        of 1957. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Amen. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Yeah, but I think we should have 
                        done more for black people, not 
                        less.

                                 RUSSELL
                             (to Johnson)
                        God, I hate liberals. 

           Jenkins hangs up from a phone call. 

                                 JENKINS
                        We got him. That puts us over. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I want to call for unanimous 
                        consent right now. Let’s go!

           Everyone prepares to leave. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Mr. Leader, you don’t even know how 
                        I intend to vote.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Yes I do, Senator Yarborough. 
                        You’re going to vote for my bill. 
                        And not because you’re afraid of me 
                        or because I told you to - you’re 
                        going to vote for it because you 
                        know it’s the right thing to do. 
                        Not my favorite reason but in this 
                        case, I’ll take it. Those pesky 
                        principles of yours. Good talking 
                        with you.
           And with that, the Senate Majority Leader and his men exit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DALLAS LOVE FIELD - 11:53 A.M. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           Johnson sits in the CONVERTIBLE, staring at his STETSON on 
           his knee. He looks out toward JFK who’s still shaking hands. 

           Near the President is a smiling Senator Yarborough. 
           Yarborough’s eyes meet Johnson’s and the smile fades away.

           JFK leads Jackie from the crowd and into the MIDNIGHT BLUE 
           PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE. Its bubble top has been removed. 

           AT JOHNSON’S LIMO

           Yarborough opens the left rear door and sits. Lady Bird is 
           sandwiched between her husband and Yarborough, both silent. 

           Youngblood sits in the passenger seat next to the driver - 
           Texas Highway Patrolman HURCHEL JACKS who awaits instruction. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Let’s go.

           Johnson puts his Stetson on his head. 

           The half-mile long motorcade of 22 cars, 3 buses, and several 
           police motorcycles begins its departure from Love Field. 

                                 BOB WALKER (V.O.)
                        The presidential car moving up. The 
                        President and First Lady. Big, 
                        beautiful Lincoln. Secret Service 
                        men in the car behind. Then comes 
                        the Vice President and Mrs. 
                        Johnson, Senator Yarborough... And 
                        of course as we say, thousands will 
                        be on hand for that motorcade now 
                        which will be downtown Dallas, 
                        Cedar Springs to Harwood. And on 
                        Harwood he’ll turn on Main, from 
                        which point he’ll go all the way 
                        down to the courthouse area which 
                        is the end of Main. It’ll turn on, 
                        Houston Street to Elm, under the 
                        triple underpass...

           BANG! A BULLET FIRED FROM A RIFLE INTO THE SKY.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. JOHNSON RANCH - TEXAS - DAY - 1959

           Johnson, in hunting gear, holds a rifle and looks over to 
           BOBBY KENNEDY, 34, who has been tossed to the ground by the 
           recoil of the rifle he just fired. 

           Johnson grins as Bobby stands and brushes himself off. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Son, you got to learn to handle a 
                        gun like a man. I guess you 
                        Kennedys don’t do much deer 
                        huntin’.

                                 BOBBY
                        When Kennedys fire weapons its 
                        usually at Nazis. 

           Bobby moves stride for stride with Johnson. His fierce 
           determination and keen instincts make up for his smaller 
           size.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t come all this way to shoot 
                        at a defenseless animal. The 
                        primaries are less than a year away 
                        and my brother is making inroads 
                        all over the country. We need to 
                        know if you’re going to run. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m quite comfortable in my post as 
                        Majority Leader. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Then perhaps you could endorse my 
                        brother. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’ll endorse whoever wins our 
                        Party’s nomination.

                                 BOBBY
                        But there’s no chance that will be 
                        you, correct?

                                 JOHNSON
                        How many different ways do you want 
                        me to answer that question?

                                 BOBBY
                        One would suffice. 

           Johnson stops and moves face to face with Bobby. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        I have zero intention of running 
                        for president. 

           INT. THE ELMS - NIGHT - APRIL 5, 1960

           Johnson’s Washington home on 52nd Street. Jenkins, Reedy, and 
           JOHN CONNALLY, 43, (3 years before he’ll become Governor of 
           Texas) watch primary election coverage on a TV while Johnson 
           has a telephone conversation in the back. 

           ON TELEVISION:

           A NEWSCASTER reports from his desk. 

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        Senator John Kennedy of 
                        Massachusetts has defeated Senator 
                        Hubert Humphrey in Wisconsin at the 
                        first contested primary battle for 
                        the Democratic nomination...

           BACK TO SCENE

           MRS. ZEPHYR WRIGHT, 40s, Johnson’s black cook, clears plates 
           near Johnson who is getting heated on the phone. 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (into the phone)
                        I want to know why the hell you 
                        were putting up “Johnson for 
                        President” signs all over town... 
                        Well for starters, Johnson hasn’t 
                        said he’s running for president yet 
                        and the reason I know that is 
                        because I’m fuckin’ him!

           Johnson slams the phone down. He looks at his staff. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JENKINS
                        I think it’s time you announce.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I haven’t made up my mind.

                                 CONNALLY
                        Then what am I doing here, sir?
                                 JOHNSON
                        Basking in the pleasure of my 
                        company.

                                 JENKINS
                        I’ve been on the phone with 
                        delegates all evening. Every one of 
                        whom today is for Kennedy. And 
                        every one of whom would be yours 
                        tomorrow if you’d just announce 
                        that you’re running.

                                 JOHNSON
                        A Catholic won a Catholic state. 
                        Big fuckin’ deal. You think he can 
                        do that in the South? You think he 
                        can do that in West Virginia? This 
                        country is not going to elect a 
                        Catholic president. 

                                 CONNALLY
                        Kennedy is starting to pull away 
                        from the pack. And people can’t 
                        support another candidate if he 
                        won’t declare his candidacy. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Nominations aren’t won on the 
                        campaign trail - they’re won at the 
                        convention. So let Kennedy 
                        hopscotch the United States kissing 
                        babies. I’ll be here in Washington 
                        running the goddamn country!

           EXT. THE ELMS - NIGHT

           Jenkins and Connally walk to Jenkins’ car. They light up 
           cigarettes. Rather than getting inside, Connally stops at the 
           passenger side and speaks to Jenkins over the car. 

                                 CONNALLY
                        I didn’t leave Texas for this, 
                        Walter - to run a campaign that 
                        doesn’t have a candidate. 

                                 JENKINS
                        He’ll run. 

                                 CONNALLY
                        It’ll be too late. 
                                 JENKINS
                        He’s the Senate Majority Leader - 
                        maybe the best one this country’s 
                        ever had. He works harder than the 
                        other 99 senators combined. He 
                        doesn’t understand why he’s not 
                        already the Party’s favorite. He 
                        doesn’t understand why they don’t 
                        just give it to him. 

                                 CONNALLY
                        Nobody gets handed the presidency. 
                             (a beat)
                        This is his best chance at it. So 
                        he better decide if he wants it. 

                                 JENKINS
                        He’s never wanted anything more in 
                        his whole life. 

                                 CONNALLY
                        Then why won’t he commit? 

                                 JENKINS
                        He’s afraid. If he goes after this 
                        with everything he has and loses, 
                        it’ll eat him up.  

           INT. “TAJ MAHAL” - MAY 10, 1960 - NIGHT

           Johnson stares intently at the television. Lady Bird stands 
           behind him, staring intently at Johnson. They are surrounded 
           by Jenkins, Reedy, and Connally. 

           ON TELEVISION:

           A NEWSCASTER reports.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        In a surprising upset, Senator John 
                        Kennedy has won the West Virginia 
                        primary. Many experts believed the 
                        issue of his religion was 
                        insurmountable in a state like 
                        this, but here is what Senator 
                        Kennedy had to say about this 
                        issue...

           THE TV CUTS TO JFK GIVING A SPEECH FROM A PODIUM.
                                 JFK
                        When any man stands on the steps of 
                        the Capitol and takes the oath of 
                        office of president, he puts one 
                        hand on the Bible and raises the 
                        other hand to God as he takes the 
                        oath. And if he breaks his oath, he 
                        is not only committing a crime 
                        against the Constitution, but he is 
                        committing a sin against God.

                        I’ve never seen a movie star look 
                        that good on TV. 

           ON TELEVISION

           JFK places his hand on an imaginary Bible. 

                                 JFK
                        I do solemnly swear that I will 
                        faithfully execute the Office of 
                        President of the United States...

           Lady Bird notices Johnson mouthing the words along with JFK. 

                                 JFK (CONT’D)
                        ...and will to the best of my 
                        ability, preserve, protect and 
                        defend the Constitution of the 
                        United States, so help me God.

                                 REEDY
                        I think he just swore himself in.

           Lady Bird pulls Johnson away while the others continue 
           watching the TV. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        What is it, Bird?

                                 LADY BIRD
                        When I first met you, you insisted 
                        on taking me out for breakfast. As 
                        we were driving along I found 
                        myself so enamoured with you that I 
                        commented how I’d like to meet your 
                        mother some day. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LADY BIRD (CONT'D)
                        You turned the car around right 
                        then and there and headed straight 
                        for your mother’s house. You didn’t 
                        wait for me to agree, or object, 
                        you just drove.

           Johnson smiles as he remembers this. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        And then we went to see your 
                        father. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        That’s right. You told him all 
                        about your plans, your ambitions. 
                        And when you finally left, you know 
                        what my father said to me? He said, 
                        “Daughter, you have brought home a 
                        lot of boys; this time you brought 
                        home a man.” You knew exactly what 
                        you wanted. And here I am. 

           Johnson remembers this with pride. He looks to his men who 
           are all looking at him. 

                                 CONNALLY
                        Sir, the time has come. Right now.

                        candidate? 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re damn right I am.

           INT. DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION - DAY - JULY 11, 1960 

           FOOTAGE:

           A jam-packed Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Thousands of 
           delegates cheer and hold signs for their states and favorite 
           candidates: “ALL THE WAY FOR LBJ.” “WIN WITH KENNEDY.” 

           The CHAIRMAN takes the podium. 

                                 CHAIRMAN
                        The Convention of the Democratic 
                        Party of the United States is 
                        called in session.

           INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - CRYSTAL BALLROOM - DAY

           Across the street from the convention itself, TWO HUNDRED 
           DELEGATES have come to see the two candidates.
           Johnson speaks at a podium. JFK and Bobby sit on stage, 
           behind Johnson. Jenkins and Reedy are off to the side, 
           watching Johnson mid sermon, almost in admonition.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        For six days and nights we had 24-
                        hour sessions. Six days and nights 
                        I had to deliver a quorum of 51 
                        men. And I’m proud to tell you that 
                        on those 50 quorum calls, Lyndon 
                        Johnson answered every one of ‘em!

           The Delegates applaud, many supporters in this bunch. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Although some men who would be 
                        president answered none. On the 
                        roll calls on that bill there were 
                        45. Some senators missed 34 of 45! 
                        Lyndon Johnson answered all 45!

           Applause. Many stand for Johnson as he returns to his seat.

           JFK moves to the podium. 

                                 JFK
                        I’d like to commend Senator Johnson 
                        on his exemplary attendance record. 

           Laughter. Bobby loves it. 

                                 JFK (CONT’D)
                        Let me just say that I appreciate 
                        what Senator Johnson had to say. He 
                        made some general references to 
                        perhaps the shortcomings of other 
                        presidential candidates, but as he 
                        was not specific, I assume he was 
                        talking about other candidates and 
                        not about me. 

           More laughter. The Kennedy wit defuses all the tension. 

                                 JFK (CONT’D)
                        And so I come to you today in full 
                        support of Senator Johnson for 
                        Majority Leader. 

           Laughter and applause. Even Johnson has to grin and bear it. 
           INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY - JULY 13, 1960

           Johnson, Connally, Jenkins, Reedy, and Advisor JIM ROWE, 51, 
           march to the elevator. 

                                 ROWE
                        You need to go see the Wyoming 
                        delegation. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        How the hell are we still fightin’ 
                        over western states?

                                 CONNALLY
                        Their delegates are meeting with 
                        Kennedy right now. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Jack or Bobby?

                                 CONNALLY
                        Teddy.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Jesus Christ, this place is 
                        infested!

           Ding. The elevator doors open revealing Bobby, Yarborough, 
           and two members of Kennedy’s so-called “Irish Mafia” - Aide 
           LARRY O’BRIEN, 43, and Special Assistant KENNY O’DONNELL, 36. 

           All eyes on Johnson as he simply walks on and stands right 
           next to Bobby. Johnson’s staff follows and the doors close. 

           INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           A tense silence. All eyes face forward.

                                 BOBBY
                        “I have zero intention of running 
                        for president.” 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Had a change of heart. 

                                 BOBBY
                        How can you look another man in the 
                        eye and lie like that?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well it helps when the man I’m 
                        looking at is you. 
           Bobby looks around at Connally and Johnson’s men. 

                                 BOBBY
                        The next one of you who says a 
                        disparaging thing about Jack’s 
                        health, I’ll personally knock his 
                        teeth out. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I thought you said he’s never felt 
                        better. That wouldn’t be a lie, 
                        would it? And don’t threaten my 
                        guys.

           Bobby turns, squaring off with Johnson. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I can assure you that no one in 
                        this elevator or anywhere on the 
                        planet for that matter has ever 
                        been as loyal to you as I am to my 
                        brother. There is nothing I 
                        wouldn’t do to protect him. 

           Johnson looks at his watch. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Balloting starts in two hours. If 
                        you don’t take me down in the first 
                        two rounds, I’m gonna beat you. 

                                 BOBBY
                        There won’t be a second round. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re awful confident. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s because I can count. 

           Bobby flashes a folded list in his hand. Ding. The elevator 
           door opens and Bobby leads his team away. 

           INT. JOHNSON’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Room 7333 of the Biltmore Hotel. Johnson, Lady Bird, Reedy, 
           Connally, and Rowe are glued to the TV. Johnson holds his own 
           count sheet. They watch the convention while delegate tallies 
           grow with every state’s vote. The mood is grim. 

           FOOTAGE:

           An on-screen tally reads:
           “1st Ballot. 761 to nominate...

           Johnson: 405. Kennedy: 750. Stevenson: 79.5. Symington: 86.”

           MCCRACKEN of Wyoming’s delegation goes next.

                                 MCCRACKEN
                        Mr. Chairman, Wyoming’s vote will 
                        make a majority for Senator 
                        Kennedy... There are 15 votes from 
                        Wyoming for Kennedy.

           Kennedy’s tally changes from 750 to 765. The place goes 
           crazy. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Lady Bird fights back tears. Johnson drops his count sheet 
           and disappears into the bedroom with his scotch and soda. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DALLAS MOTORCADE ROUTE - 12:08 P.M. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           A couple miles down Lemmon Avenue. 

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S CAR - SAME

           The occupants look ahead to see what’s happening.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        Why are we slowin’ down?

           Youngblood listens to his earpiece and relays information.

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        School children. Up ahead. The 
                        President wants to get out to shake 
                        hands. You want to join him, sir?

                                 JOHNSON
                        No. 

           EXT. LEMMON AVENUE - DALLAS - MOMENTS LATER

           The motorcade has stopped. Youngblood stays nearby and keeps 
           watch as Johnson and Lady Bird walk away from the cars. 

           JFK and Connally (now Governor of Texas) speak with a group 
           of SCHOOL CHILDREN and a NUN. 
           Johnson kicks a rock with his boot. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        How’d he manage to find the only 
                        Catholics in Dallas?

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Could you please try to cheer up? I 
                        don’t want you like this when the 
                        President and Mrs. Kennedy visit 
                        our ranch. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You know Connally’s the most 
                        popular politician in Texas now?

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Seems to me the people love the 
                        whole lot of ya. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Come on, Bird. You’ve seen the 
                        numbers - I’m as unpopular here as 
                        Kennedy is now. You hang around 
                        these liberals long enough and the 
                        voters start to worry that it rubs 
                        off on you. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        You forget how much people love 
                        you.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Used to love me. Fickle sons of 
                        bitches. I can’t even deliver my 
                        own home state. If the President 
                        knew what was good for him, he’d 
                        put me out to pasture.  

                                 LADY BIRD
                        He couldn’t ask for a better vice 
                        president. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOBBY’S SUITE - MORNING - JULY 14, 1960 

           Room 8315 of the Biltmore Hotel. Bobby soaks in a bathtub, 
           cigar in his mouth and newspaper in his hand. 

                                 BOBBY
                        First round knockout, boys! Like 
                        Rocky Marciano!
           Bobby speaks through the open bathroom door to O’Donnell, 
           O’Brien and other members of the staff including Speechwriter 
           TED SORENSEN, 32, a friendly Nebraskan, and PIERRE SALINGER, 
           35, the heavyset Press Secretary. 

                                 SALINGER
                        The Times wants a comment. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Tell them there’s a new heavyweight 
                        champion of the world, and his name 
                        is Kennedy. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        How’s the acceptance speech coming?

                                 SORENSEN
                        Easiest speech I ever had to write. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                             (calling to the bathroom)
                        Bobby, we’re getting 20 calls a 
                        minute. Everyone wants a name. 

                                 BOBBY
                        First we need to pick a name.

           INT. JOHNSON’S SUITE - BEDROOM - 8 A.M.

           Drawn shades block the morning sun. The PHONE RINGS. Johnson 
           doesn’t stir. Lady Bird reaches over her husband, past a near-
           empty bottle of scotch, and grabs the phone. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Hello?... Lyndon. Lyndon! Wake up!

                                 JOHNSON
                        Huh? What’s wrong?

                                 LADY BIRD
                        It’s John Kennedy. 

           She has his attention now. They lock eyes, knowing that 
           they’re sharing the same thought. 

           INT. JOHNSON’S SUITE - MINUTES LATER

           Johnson and Lady Bird hurry around trying to get dressed. 
           Jenkins, Reedy, and Connally try their best to straighten up 
           the place. They clear drinks and snacks from the night 
           before. They hide LBJ campaign posters in a closet. 
           A KNOCK on the door. Johnson moves to it. He opens the door, 
           revealing JFK. And he’s come alone. 

                                 JFK
                        Good morning, Lyndon. 

           INT. BOBBY’S SUITE - MINUTES LATER

           Bobby is out of the tub and fully clothed. He pours himself 
           some coffee while giving orders to Sorensen and Salinger. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Make sure Symington, Humphrey, and 
                        Stevenson are all near phones. 
                        We’ll make our choice today.

           O’Donnell bursts in. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        You’re not going to believe where 
                        your brother is right now. 

           INT. JOHNSON’S SUITE - SAME

           Johnson and JFK sit on a couch. Just the two of them. It’s 
           almost as if he’s watching JFK make a decision in the moment.

                                 JFK
                        How would you feel about being my 
                        vice president?

           INT. KENNEDY’S SUITE - DAY

           Room 9333 of the Biltmore Hotel. JFK stands in the middle of 
           the room while O’Donnell and Bobby can’t sit still. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re out your damn mind, Jack! 
                        You couldn’t have made a worse 
                        choice if you tried. 

                                 JFK
                        You agree with Bobby?

           O’Donnell stops pacing and goes to speak but can’t find any 
           words to express his frustration. His face gets redder.
                                 BOBBY
                        You see that - Kenny’s so pissed he 
                        can’t even speak!

                                 JFK
                        I think we need to let cooler heads 
                        prevail. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Johnson and his men spent the last 
                        72 hours trying to convince the 
                        entire delegation that you have 
                        Addison’s disease!

                                 JFK
                        I do have Addison’s disease. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s not the fucking point!

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Labor hates him. Civil rights 
                        leaders hate him. All the liberals 
                        hate him. 

                                 JFK
                        We’re going to win the liberal vote 
                        anyway. We need Southerners. We 
                        need Texas.

                                 BOBBY
                        We can’t trust this man! He is a 
                        snake in the grass. The only person 
                        he’ll ever be loyal to is himself. 

                                 JFK
                        If I’m president, would you rather 
                        Lyndon Johnson serve under me as 
                        vice president or fight me for 
                        control of the government as the 
                        Majority Leader of the Senate?

                                 BOBBY
                        If you’re president, I want Lyndon 
                        Johnson as far away from your 
                        presidency as possible. 

                                 JFK
                        Well who knows, maybe you’ll get 
                        your wish. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What do you mean?
                                 JFK
                        He hasn’t accepted it.

           INT. JOHNSON’S SUITE - MINUTES LATER

           A disheveled Bobby stands alone near the couch.

           Johnson enters, alone. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You can’t take it. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Come again? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Decline the offer. Say it was an 
                        honor to be considered but your 
                        duty is to the Senate. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You don’t like the idea?

                                 BOBBY
                        No, I most certainly do not. I 
                        don’t think this is good for the 
                        Party and I don’t think this is 
                        good for my brother. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        And for me?

                                 BOBBY
                        I could give a damn if it’s good 
                        for you!

           OTHER ROOM IN THE SUITE

           Jenkins, Reedy, Connally, and Lady Bird stare at the door 
           where they can hear the louder words being spoken. 

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 JOHNSON
                        Is Senator Kennedy withdrawing his 
                        offer?

                                 BOBBY
                        You know he can’t do that. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        But he sent you down here to ask me 
                        to decline?
                                 BOBBY
                        I’m here on my own volition. 

           The slightest of grins comes across Johnson’s face. 

           INT. JOHNSON’S SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby exits the room and walks past Jenkins and the rest.

           Johnson emerges from the room looking rather pleased. 

           INT. KENNEDY’S SUITE - DAY

           Bobby sits on the edge of a bed. JFK sits in a chair pulled 
           right up to his brother. They both stare down at the floor in 
           this iconic shot of their silhouettes backlit by the window.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’ve never made a decision like 
                        this without consulting me first. 

                                 JFK
                        And I won’t do it again. But I 
                        spoke with Dad. We agreed that we 
                        need to Johnson in order to win. 
                        And we also agreed that we’d never 
                        convince you it was a good idea.

                                 BOBBY
                        This is a mistake. I know it. 

           A phone sits nearby, waiting to receive an incoming call. 

           INT. JOHNSON’S SUITE - DAY

           Johnson, Jenkins, Connally, and Rowe sit at the table. Lady 
           Bird moves around in the background. 

                                 ROWE
                        If you run with Kennedy and lose, 
                        what about your senate seat? Are 
                        you able to run for both offices? 

                                 CONNALLY
                        Yeah. We changed the law last year. 

                                 ROWE
                        Why?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Because I asked them to. 
           Reedy enters. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        What did you find out?

                                 REEDY
                        Ten of 36. 

           Johnson takes in this information. He stands and walks to the 
           window. Jenkins follows and gets in closer to his boss. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        What do you think?

                                 JENKINS
                        There’s a reason that you’re 
                        thinking about saying no - it’s a 
                        thankless job. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        So is being a school teacher in 
                        Blanco County, Texas. 

                                 JENKINS
                        If Kennedy loses the election then 
                        the Majority Leader will be the 
                        most powerful Democrat in the 
                        country. And if Kennedy wins, the 
                        Majority Leader will still be the 
                        most powerful Democrat in Congress. 
                        There is no power in the vice 
                        presidency. 

           AT THE TABLE

           Rowe leans in to Reedy.

                                 ROWE
                        Ten of 36?

                                 REEDY
                        Of the 36 men who have been vice 
                        president, 10 have gone on to 
                        become president.

           BACK TO THE WINDOW

                                 JOHNSON
                        How long have you been with me, 
                        Walter?

                                 JENKINS
                        Twenty-one years, sir. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        In 21 years, can you think of one 
                        time that I’ve taken over a new 
                        office and not made it 100 times 
                        more powerful than it was before I 
                        got there? Can you think of one 
                        time that hasn’t happened?

                                 JENKINS
                        No. 

           Johnson picks up the phone to dial. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Power is where power goes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DOWNTOWN DALLAS - 12:21 P.M. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           The motorcade turns right onto Main Street. HUNDREDS OF 
           SPECTATORS have gathered to cheer for the President. 

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S CAR - SAME

           Lady Bird sits between Johnson and Yarborough again. 

           Youngblood receives information through his earpiece and 
           turns around to relay it to Johnson.

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        We’re five minutes behind schedule. 
                        Should be at the Trade Mart in 15. 

           POP-POP! 

           Youngblood spins around to find TWO TEENAGERS banging the 
           hood of the Vice President's car. They run away. 

           The crowd is thick and the car slows to a crawl because 
           people are coming right up to it. Youngblood opens his door 
           about 45 degrees so as to push people away. 

           Johnson and Yarborough notice a group of BLACK CITIZENS 
           cheering for the President and waving small American flags.

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        They love him. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Go figure. 
                                 YARBOROUGH
                        They believe in him. They know that 
                        the President’s civil rights law is 
                        going to change everything. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        The President doesn’t have a civil 
                        rights law - he has a civil rights 
                        bill. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        I believe in my heart that Congress 
                        will get it passed. 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (sort of to himself)
                        Shit for brains. 

           An awkward silence. Lady Bird wants to break the tension. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        I thought Jackie looked absolutely 
                        radiant this morning. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        May I say you look very pretty as 
                        well, Mrs. Johnson. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Rufe, turn the radio on. 

           Youngblood tunes the radio to coverage of their trip.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - AFTERNOON - JANUARY 20, 1961

           Outside the Executive Office Building, the excitement from a 
           presidential inauguration floods the street. 

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - SAME

           Johnson stares out the window of room 274, a three-room 
           office. Impressive to be sure, but it’s not the Taj Mahal. 

           Jenkins, Reedy, and Juanita unpack boxes. Everyone is dressed 
           particularly well today. A TV near the desk is turned on.

           ON THE TELEVISION:

           A NEWSCASTER reports...
                                 NEWSCASTER
                        And here it is from earlier today, 
                        President John F. Kennedy 
                        delivering his inaugural address.

           The screen switches to JFK speaking from outside the Capitol, 
           delivering his Inaugural Address. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Jenkins looks to Reedy as they finish setting up their desks. 

                                 REEDY
                        You unpacked?

                                 JENKINS
                        Yep. 

                                 REEDY
                        So now what do we do?

                                 JENKINS
                        I haven’t the foggiest idea. 

           Johnson stares across Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House. 

                                 JFK 
                             (from the TV)
                        All this will not be finished in 
                        the first one hundred days. Nor 
                        will it be finished in the first 
                        one thousand days, nor in the life 
                        of this administration, nor even 
                        perhaps in our lifetime on this 
                        planet. But let us begin.

           Johnson gets a flash of inspiration. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Juanita, sit down here, dear. I 
                        need to write a letter. 

           Juanita sits in Johnson’s HIGH-BACK CHAIR at his GREEN-TOPPED 
           DESK. She grabs a pen, ready to transcribe his thoughts. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Dear Mr. President...

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           JFK’s Oval Office. A LIGHT BLUE CARPET and the famed RESOLUTE 
           DESK. JFK’s ROCKING CHAIR sits off to the side. 
           JFK and O’Donnell watch in amusement as Bobby reads a letter. 

                                 BOBBY
                        He didn’t write this. You’re 
                        pulling my leg, right?

                                 JFK
                        That’s his signature. 

                                 BOBBY
                        He did not write this. Even Lyndon 
                        Johnson is not this stupid. 
                             (reading)
                        “I hereby request that the State 
                        Department, the Defense Department, 
                        and the Central Intelligence Agency 
                        cooperate fully with the Vice 
                        President.” Who does he think he is 
                        - William Seward?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        He also requested oversight of the 
                        entire space program. 

                                 JFK
                        Johnson literally wants to control 
                        everything from here to the moon.

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m going over there to personally 
                        tell him what he can do with this 
                        request. 

                                 JFK
                        No you’re not. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Better still, I say we send this 
                        letter to The Washington Post. 
                        Publish it and humiliate the 
                        bastard. 

                                 JFK
                        No one is to do anything that’s 
                        going to embarrass my vice 
                        president. Last month Lyndon 
                        Johnson was the most powerful 
                        Democrat in Washington. Now he 
                        answers to my kid brother and his 
                        Harvard roommate. It’s hard enough 
                        for him to swallow that without us 
                        embarrassing him. 
                                 BOBBY
                        He embarrasses himself. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        You know he started calling himself 
                        “LBJ” after “FDR” was elected 
                        because he thought it made him 
                        sound more presidential. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well he’s no FDR, nor is he a JFK. 
                        He’s Lyndon I’ll-Never-Be-President-
                        In-A-Million-Years Johnson and I’m 
                        not about to waste my time worrying 
                        about the Vice President. 

                                 JFK
                        I know that, Bobby. That’s why I’m 
                        putting Kenny in charge of him. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        What?

                                 JFK
                        Congratulations, Kenny, you’re my 
                        new liaison to the Vice President. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Sir, please-

                                 JFK
                        I don’t want to hear it. You’re to 
                        handle him from now on. I can’t 
                        have him causing problems for me. 
                        He’s a sensitive man with an 
                        enormous ego. Your job is to 
                        placate him, and I don’t care if 
                        you have to kiss his ass all over 
                        town in order to do it. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What do you want to do about this 
                        letter?

                                 JFK
                        Let’s just pretend it never 
                        happened. 

                                 BOBBY
                        We’ve got to find something to keep 
                        Johnson occupied. 
           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY - JANUARY 1961

           Johnson’s face is hidden behind a one-page memo. He lowers it 
           in frustration. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        What the fuck is the P.C.E.E.O.?

           Johnson looks up from a seated position at Jenkins and Reedy 
           who stand in the doorway looking very uncomfortable. 

                                 REEDY
                        It’s the President’s Committee on 
                        Equal Employment Opportunity. 

           And now it’s clear that Reedy and Jenkins are in the doorway 
           of the office that connects to the private bathroom. And 
           Johnson is sitting on the toilet. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Sir, the President wants to ensure 
                        that all government agencies and 
                        contractors exercise fair hiring 
                        practices with regards to race. 

                                 REEDY
                        It’s Kennedy’s first major 
                        initiative on civil rights. The 
                        Southern Democrats are going to 
                        hate this committee. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        No shit. And when this lone 
                        committee inevitably fails to solve 
                        the country’s entire civil rights 
                        problem, the rest of the Democrats 
                        are gonna hate that.

           As Johnson goes to wipe, Jenkins and Reedy avert their eyes, 
           wishing this meeting was happening anywhere else. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        When 1968 arrives, I’d like to run 
                        for president. That means that we 
                        need to spend the next eight years 
                        building up new support, 
                        maintaining old friendships, and 
                        generally making sure that people 
                        fuckin’ like me!

           Johnson slams the door in the faces of Reedy and Jenkins, 
           leaving them on the other side of the door. 
                                 REEDY
                        How could anybody not like him?

           The toilet flushes. Johnson exits from the bathroom. He paces 
           for a moment, getting an idea, working it out in his mind. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        One time when I was about thirteen, 
                        I was driving home with my daddy 
                        and I made some smartass comment 
                        that pissed him off. He slammed on 
                        the brakes and tossed me out of the 
                        truck, told me I was walking home. 
                        I had about six or seven miles to 
                        go and it was hot. Well I start 
                        feeling bad for myself but then I 
                        look up and see this old Chevy 
                        kicking up dust down the way. I 
                        stick my thumb out and it pulls 
                        over. A woman with this curly red 
                        hair is behind the wheel. She 
                        offers me a ride. Woman had the 
                        biggest set of titties you ever 
                        saw. I stared right at ‘em the 
                        whole way home. And I never would 
                        have seen them if my daddy hadn’t 
                        tried to punish me in the first 
                        place.

           Reedy looks at Jenkins like “What the fuck is he talking 
           about?”

                                 REEDY
                        So what are you saying? When life 
                        gives you lemons you make lemonade? 

                                 JOHNSON
                        No, George, I’m saying when the 
                        Good Lord puts big, beautiful 
                        breasts right in front of ya, you 
                        don’t waste time crying over 
                        sillier things. 

                                 JENKINS
                        So there’s an upside to you being 
                        appointed chairman of this 
                        committee?

                                 JOHNSON
                        This damn civil rights issue is 
                        gonna tear the Democrats in two. We 
                        got rival camps in this Party and 
                        they are never going to come to an 
                        agreement. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        But as long as they sit at the 
                        table, they need an interpreter. 
                        The Kennedy’s don’t speak 
                        “Southern.” And the Southerners 
                        don’t speak “Kennedy.” I’m the only 
                        man who knows both languages. 

                                 REEDY
                        And which side are you on?

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re missing the point. As long 
                        as neither side conquers the other, 
                        and as long as neither side 
                        declares all out war, both sides 
                        need me. The best thing that can 
                        happen for me is that the debate on 
                        civil rights goes on forever. 

                                 JENKINS
                        And how do we make sure that 
                        happens?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Compromise. Endless compromise.

           INT. SENATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT - MARCH 1961

           At a large table in the austere room, Johnson and Russell 
           dine together, alone. Russell sits at the head of the table. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Chairman of the Equal Employment 
                        Opportunities Committee. Those 
                        Kennedys must really hate you.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        Yeah, I drew the short straw on 
                        this one. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Don’t worry about it. I don’t 
                        imagine this committee will be 
                        around very long anyway. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I wouldn’t be so sure. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        That’s what they said about the 
                        Fair Employment Practices 
                        Commission. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        Well it’s not 1948 and Truman’s not 
                        in the White House. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        I’ve had this fight with three 
                        presidents and I am fully prepared 
                        to have it with a fourth. My army 
                        may be small, but our cause is 
                        mighty.

           A BLACK WAITER clears some plates and leaves. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        The government has a one-billion 
                        dollar contract to build a new 
                        airplane. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Mm hmm. And I know just the place 
                        where that contract should go. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Yeah, I bet you do. And I want 
                        nothing more than to see that 
                        Lockheed plant in Georgia get this 
                        contract. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Glad to hear it. So convince your 
                        committee to sign off on it. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I will... after you convince 
                        Lockheed to make some changes at 
                        that plant. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        We’re not making any changes.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Come on, Dick, I can’t have signs 
                        all over that plant that say 
                        “colored this” and “white that.”

                                 RUSSELL
                        You don’t like separate drinking 
                        fountains? Fine. We’ll bring in 
                        paper cups. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You need to do more on this one. 
                        The plant needs to hire negros. 
                                 RUSSELL
                        Someone has to mop the floors. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m talking about engineers, 
                        skilled labor. These companies have 
                        to hire negros for some of these 
                        jobs. They’re calling it 
                        “affirmative action.” 

                                 RUSSELL
                        What right does the government have 
                        telling employers who to hire?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well it’s the government’s one 
                        billion dollars so I suppose we 
                        have some right. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Next you’ll want to tell employees 
                        what jobs they have to do. And last 
                        I heard we were against forced 
                        labor in this country. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You know you don’t have to convince 
                        me. I’m the one going fifteen 
                        rounds in the Oval Office with the 
                        Kennedys on this.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Those brothers from Massachusetts 
                        aren’t going to tell us how to run 
                        the state of Georgia. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Of course not. But they won the 
                        election by appealing to the 
                        colored man. They need to give him 
                        something in return. That’s just 
                        how politics works. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        You asking me to surrender? 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m asking you to give them these 
                        little victories here and there so 
                        they forget about the war. 
                        Otherwise my fear is that they’ll 
                        forget about these smaller issues 
                        and pursue something much more 
                        drastic.
                                 RUSSELL
                        Let them try. I will use all the 
                        means at my disposal and all the 
                        men under my control to defend this 
                        cause until the last breath of air 
                        escapes my lungs. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Am I talking to Richard Russell or 
                        Stonewall Jackson right now?

           Russell laughs. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        I’m the only ally you’ve got in the 
                        White House - make it easier for me 
                        to help you. All right?

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM - DAY - APRIL 1961

           Johnson enters and a ELEVEN MEN rise to their feet. 

           Johnson moves to the head of the table. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        This meeting of the President’s 
                        Committee on Equal Employment 
                        Opportunity is called to order. 
                        Take your seats. 

           They sit. Johnson remains standing as he surveys the room. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        By presidential order, this 
                        committee is to be comprised of... 
                             (consulting his notes)
                        Three of the joint chiefs, four 
                        members of the cabinet, and five 
                        heads of commissions. Just out of 
                        curiosity, who the hell are all of 
                        you?

           Everyone looks around. No one answers. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        We got the Undersecretary of State 
                        and the Undersecretary of Defense. 
                        I see Nick Katzenbach is here. 
                        What’s the matter Nick? Bobby 
                        Kennedy too busy to join us today?
                                 KATZENBACH
                        Sir, the Attorney General had a 
                        previous engagement. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Splendid. Well despite the fact 
                        that none of your bosses are here 
                        today, the Vice President did in 
                        fact show up so let’s get this 
                        meeting started. 

           Johnson sits. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Our first order of business is the 
                        one-billion-dollar contract to 
                        build a new transport airplane. 

                                 KATZENBACH
                        Senator Russell seems to think that 
                        contract is going to Georgia. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        That’s because it is. 

                                 UNDERSECRETARY OF LABOR
                        That Lockheed plant is one of the 
                        worst offenders on civil rights.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        Richard Russell is the leader of 
                        the Southern Democratic Caucus and 
                        Chairman of Armed Services. So we 
                        are going to work with Senator 
                        Russell on this. 

                                 UNDERSECRETARY OF LABOR
                        Sir, I know I speak for my boss 
                        when I say that this is a fight in 
                        which we should not give an inch. 
                        The Secretary of Labor drafted a 
                        list of demands that he wants 
                        addressed before we award any 
                        contract to that plant.  

           He slides a MEMO to Johnson. 

                                 UNDERSECRETARY OF LABOR (CONT’D)
                        We need to use this opportunity to 
                        demonstrate the full power of this 
                        committee.  
                                 JOHNSON
                        If your boss wants to make demands, 
                        you tell him to deliver them to me 
                        personally. 
                             (pointing at the memo)
                        And, son, if this committee had 
                        that kind of power, the men you 
                        work for wouldn’t have sent you. 
                        This meeting is adjourned. 

           Johnson remains seated as everyone else stands to leave. 

           The Undersecretary of Defense takes a step toward the door 
           and then pauses. He removes a MEMO from his briefcase and 
           sets it in front of Johnson. 

           As the room files out, more than half of the men drop their 
           own MEMOS on the pile. Each memo is more kindling for the 
           firing burning inside Johnson. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DOWNTOWN DALLAS - 12:28 P.M. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           At the intersection of Main Street and Houston Street, police 
           motorcycles lead the motorcade, turning right onto Houston 
           and then quickly left onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza. 

           The unmarked police car is first. The President’s limo is 
           just behind it, with JFK, Jackie, Governor Connally, and his 
           wife NELLIE CONNALLY, 44. They wave at the CHEERING CROWD. 

           Closely following the President’s car is the Queen Mary, with 
           O’Donnell, Special Assistant DAVE POWERS, 51, and six Secret 
           Service Agents. 

           Several car lengths behind, is the Vice President’s limo. 

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S CAR - SAME

           Johnson, Lady Bird, and Yarborough are quiet. Lady Bird and 
           Yarborough wave at the crowd. 

           In the front seat, Youngblood looks up at the buildings of 
           downtown Dallas - the Criminal Court, Old Courthouse 
           Buildings, and the Texas School Book Depository. 

           Youngblood hears Agent LEMS JOHNS through his earpiece.

                                 AGENT JOHNS (V.O.)
                        Five minutes to the Trade Mart. 
           Youngblood looks at the speedometer as Jacks slows to make 
           the turn onto Elm Street. They drop below 10 miles per hour. 

           They complete the turn and the car straightens out...

           Johnson is lost in thought...

           BANG!

           An explosion echoes throughout the plaza. Johnson is 
           startled. Everybody hears it. Nobody knows what it was.  

           Johnson looks outside the car and up ahead, trying to see the 
           source of the noise but all he sees is commotion, confusion. 

           Youngblood looks ahead. The Queen Mary blocks his view of 
           JFK’s car. In the Queen Mary, Agent GEORGE HICKEY stands. He 
           holds an AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE and he is ready to use it. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Get down! Get down!

           Youngblood reaches into the backseat and pushes Johnson to 
           the floor. Lady Bird and Yarborough both freeze. 

           Youngblood jumps over the seat and pins Johnson to the floor 
           with a knee into his back and an elbow into his shoulder. 

           Johnson’s face is smashed against the floor. All he can see 
           are Lady Bird’s shoes. 

           BANG!... BANG! 

           Two more loud explosions cry out. 

           Youngblood looks forward, past the Queen Mary. A gray blur of 
           debris explodes into the air. 

           Agent CLINT HILL runs forward for the President’s limo while 
           the cars in front of Johnson’s speed up, creating distance 
           between the Vice President and the front of the motorcade. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD (CONT’D)
                             (to Jacks)
                        Stay with them!

           Youngblood looks outside where people are scattering. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD (CONT’D)
                             (into his radio)
                        I’m switching to Charlie frequency!

           As he does, Youngblood hears Agent EMORY ROBERTS’ voice. 
                                 AGENT ROBERTS (V.O.)
                        Halfback to Lawson! The President’s 
                        been hit! Get us to the hospital!

           Johnson’s head is close enough to Youngblood’s to hear 
           fractured words from Youngblood’s earpiece. 

                                 AGENT ROBERTS (V.O.)
                        He’s hit! He’s hit!... Hospital!

           Lady Bird reaches for Johnson and he reaches back for her. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Stay down! 

           Youngblood forces Johnson to the floor. Lady Bird jumps back. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD (CONT’D)
                             (to Jacks)
                        Go, go, go!

           Jacks steps on the gas. They go over a curb, knocking 
           everybody around. 

           Jacks accelerates as they enter the shadow of the underpass. 

           Jacks continues to speed up as he gets the car onto:

           EXT. STEMMONS FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sirens blare as they follow the lead cars onto the freeway. 

           AT THE TRADE MART

           A few hundred feet from the freeway, an EXPECTANT CROWD waits 
           for the motorcade to arrive. All they hear are sirens. 

           At an adjacent building, a tall marquee reads: “MARKET HALL - 
           WELCOME PRESIDENT AND MRS. KENNEDY.”

           BACK TO THE FREEWAY

           The Vice President's Car follows the others down an off ramp. 
           Tires screech as they turn, almost out of control.

           The car speeds past a sign: “PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.”

           EXT. PARKLAND HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jacks throws the car into the driveway of the Parkland 
           Emergency entrance. 
           The lead car, the President’s car, and the Queen Mary come to 
           a quick stop in front of them. 

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S CAR - SAME

           Youngblood grabs the door handle as they approach.

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        We aren’t stopping for anything or 
                        anyone. Do you understand? 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Okay, partner. I understand. You 
                        ready, Bird?

                                 LADY BIRD
                        I’m ready. 

           The car screeches to a halt. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY - SPRING 1961

           Just outside the Oval Office, a child’s laughter fills the 
           air. Sounds of play come from the open door of the 
           President’s office. 

           The President’s Personal Secretary, EVELYN LINCOLN, 51, works 
           at her desk, paying no mind to Johnson who sits on a small 
           chair, like a kid waiting to be called into the principal’s 
           office. He’s hunched over a little. 

           Through the doorway, JFK sits in his rocker, holding a baby 
           JOHN F. KENNEDY, JR. and playing with CAROLINE KENNEDY, 3.

           Bobby enters and walks past Johnson without so much as a 
           glance, moving quickly. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln. 

                                 MRS. LINCOLN
                        Good morning, Mr. Kennedy. 

           As Bobby walks into the Oval Office, Caroline runs out. A 
           NANNY follows with JFK and the baby behind her. JFK hands 
           John Jr. to the Nanny. 

                                 JFK
                        Lyndon, sorry to keep you waiting. 
                        Come on in. 
           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           JFK, Johnson, and O’Donnell move to the couches in the 
           center. Bobby goes to the desk and leans against it. 

                                 JFK
                        How are you doing with the 
                        Committee?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Fine, Mr. President. 

           No one seems to buy this. 

                                 JFK
                        We need to make sure that this 
                        Lockheed contract conforms to the 
                        Committee’s purpose. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Senator Russell has assured me that 
                        we can expect to see some 
                        significant changes at the plant. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s not what I hear. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re the Attorney General, if 
                        you’re so concerned why don’t you 
                        come to our meeting instead of 
                        getting second-hand information?

                                 BOBBY
                        I’d be more than happy to express 
                        my dissatisfaction with your work 
                        in front of the entire Committee.

                                 JFK
                        Lyndon, we’re not awarding this 
                        contract to a plant that 
                        systematically continues to violate 
                        civil rights. 

                                 BOBBY
                        And remind Senator Russell that we 
                        don’t need his help on this. 
                        There’s a Lockheed plant in 
                        California that would be more than 
                        happy to build those planes for us. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        If we take this contract away from 
                        Russell, all that’ll show is that 
                        we can’t force him to do a single 
                        thing he doesn’t want to do. And 
                        you don’t want to make an enemy of 
                        Senator Russell. He’ll put the 
                        brakes on every piece of 
                        legislation we have in Congress.

                                 BOBBY
                        We’re not going to let one senator 
                        hold us hostage.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You want to see how powerful that 
                        one senator can be?

                                 JFK
                        What I need from the Committee is a 
                        strong record right from the start 
                        that demonstrates concrete change 
                        on civil rights. And we can’t do 
                        that by giving a huge contract to a 
                        discriminatory plant. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Taking away their contract won’t 
                        change anything either, Mr. 
                        President. 

                                 JFK
                        So what’s your recommendation?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Let’s keep the contract in Georgia, 
                        but let’s turn it into a victory 
                        for us.  

                                 JFK
                        And how do we do that?

                                 JOHNSON
                        By making sure that we get some of 
                        what we’re asking for from that 
                        plant. I can convince Russell to 
                        convince the plant to integrate. 
                        Give some of those jobs to negros. 
                        We’ll have white men and black men 
                        working side by side on assembly 
                        lines building America’s newest 
                        airplane. Now that would be a 
                        victory for this administration. 
                                 JFK
                        All right, Lyndon, let’s get that 
                        plant integrated. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Thank you, Mr. President. And if I 
                        may, there’s one other item I’d 
                        like to discuss.  

           O’Donnell shoots Bobby an inquisitive look. This was not part 
           of the scheduled meeting. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening with Sarah Hughes?

           JFK, needing information, half turns his head toward Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        The judge from Dallas. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You haven’t accepted my 
                        recommendation to nominate her. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s not your place to make that 
                        recommendation. 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (to JFK)
                        Not only would she make a damn fine 
                        federal judge, what’s more is I 
                        promised her that nomination. Now 
                        how’s it going to look to the 
                        people from my state if I can’t 
                        even get a federal judge appointed? 

                                 BOBBY
                        She’s too old. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Everybody seems old to you. 

                                 JFK
                        We have to let senators from their 
                        respective states make those 
                        recommendations, and Ralph 
                        Yarborough is the senior senator 
                        from Texas now. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well tough luck for Ralph 
                        Yarborough then. He hails from the 
                        same state as the Vice President. 
                                 JFK
                        I can’t just ignore his request.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I promised Sarah Hughes that 
                        appointment. I’ll look like a liar. 

           Bobby scoffs at that notion. Johnson tries to ignore him. 

                                 JFK
                        I understand your frustration, 
                        Lyndon, but this is how it’s got to 
                        be done. We’ll give Sarah Hughes a 
                        look next time. Thank you for 
                        stopping by. 

           JFK stands, letting Johnson know the discussion is over. 

           EXT. LOCKHEED FACTORY - MARIETTA, GEORGIA - SPRING 1963

           Russell and Johnson stand on the tarmac just outside of an 
           open factory where the C-141 AIRCRAFT is being constructed. 

           WORKERS inside construct the remaining parts of partially-
           assembled new airplanes. Some of the workers are black, some 
           are white. And they’re working side-by-side.  

                                 RUSSELL
                        She’ll be ready to take flight this 
                        summer. Record time. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You sure that big bitch’ll fly?

                                 RUSSELL
                        She’ll fly. Built by Georgia’s 
                        finest. Half of ‘em anyway. 

           Russell eyes some of the black workers. 

           Russell leads Johnson for a stroll. He holds a rolled up copy 
           of Life Magazine. He unrolls it. Bobby’s photo is the cover.

                                 RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        Did you see this?

                                 JOHNSON
                        On every news stand in the whole 
                        damn country. They’re calling him 
                        the number 2 man in Washington.
                                 RUSSELL
                             (reassuring)
                        No one has ever gone from Attorney 
                        General to President. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        There’s a lot of things these 
                        Kennedys are doing that no one has 
                        ever done.

           Russell puts the magazine away.

                                 RUSSELL
                        I’m hearing some disturbing talk 
                        about some civil rights bill. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m hearing it too. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        And what are you doing about it?

                                 JOHNSON
                        I can’t walk into the Oval Office 
                        and start barking orders. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        You can impress upon the President 
                        the severity of the moment. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        He’s not some snot-nosed junior 
                        senator and I’m not his boss. He 
                        doesn’t answer to me. Or you.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Kennedy won the presidency by a 
                        fraction of a percent. You know 
                        what my margin of victory was that 
                        same year?

                                 JOHNSON
                        You were unopposed. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Damn right I was. And six years 
                        before that, and six years before 
                        that, and six-

                                 JOHNSON
                        What’s your point?
                                 RUSSELL
                        I may not be president, but neither 
                        am I at risk of ever losing my job. 
                        If the President sends a civil 
                        rights bill to Congress, I will 
                        personally see to it that it dies 
                        in the Senate. And I’ll kill every 
                        other bill along the way. I don’t 
                        care if it costs my party the White 
                        House. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m sure we can all sit down and 
                        come to an agreement that everybody 
                        can live with. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Seems like every time that happens 
                        I’m the one giving something up. 
                        I’m running out of things I’m 
                        willing to live without.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m doing everything in my power.  

                                 RUSSELL
                        I sincerely hope that’s not true. 
                        Because if it is, then why the hell 
                        am I talking to you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PARKLAND HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - 12:36 P.M. - 
           NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           Several AGENTS and OFFICERS are clearing the room. DOCTORS 
           and NURSES move about frantically. 

           Youngblood leads the Vice President and his party. Youngblood 
           spots Agent Roberts who’s barking orders at a nurse.

                                 AGENT ROBERTS
                        Clear that area!

           Seeing Youngblood, Roberts points him toward a room. 
           Youngblood nods and leads his party to the door and into:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Youngblood pushes Johnson against the near wall while he 
           scans the room. The other agents do a quick sweep. 
           Youngblood gets the attention of a nearby AGENT.

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Nobody comes in here unless you 
                        know who he is and he’s got a damn 
                        good reason to be here!

           The agent nods and moves to the outside of the door.

           Youngblood moves Johnson to the wall farthest from the door. 

           Agent Kivett listens to his earpiece and relays a message.

                                 AGENT KIVETT
                        Youngblood, they want you to call 
                        Washington for an update. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        I’m not leaving this man’s side for 
                        anything. 
                             (to Johnson)
                        I’m sticking to you like glue. 

           Johnson nods, taking comfort in this notion. He looks at Lady 
           Bird in the corner to make sure she’s okay.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Rufus, can I see Jackie and Nellie?

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        I can’t let you leave this room. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        How about Lady Bird? Can she go?

           Youngblood thinks for a moment and then nods. 

           Agent Roberts enters and moves to Youngblood and Johnson. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening, Emory?

                                 AGENT ROBERTS
                        It looks bad. Both the President 
                        and Governor Connally have suffered 
                        gunshot wounds. I don’t know the 
                        Governor’s condition. But the 
                        President... it’s bad. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                             (to Johnson)
                        We need to get you back to 
                        Washington as soon as possible. 
                                 AGENT ROBERTS
                        I agree.

                                 JOHNSON
                        No. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Mr. Vice President, the safest 
                        place for you in Dallas is Air 
                        Force One. And the safest place for 
                        you in the world is the White 
                        House. We can’t stay here. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m not leaving President Kennedy 
                        while he fights for his life. 

           Youngblood sees that Johnson means it. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Come on, Jack. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT - SUMMER 1963

           A tense meeting is underway. Johnson, JFK, Bobby, O’Donnell, 
           Sorensen, Jenkins, Reedy, Salinger, and Special Assistant to 
           the President ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, 46, are spread around. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Come on, Jack! 
                             (catching himself)
                        Mr. President - every day it’s more 
                        demonstrations, it’s fire hoses and 
                        dogs. The South is burning. We have 
                        got to act now. 

           On the table between the couches, is a map of the U.S. that 
           has red circles around many Southern cities.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        You take legislative action now and 
                        all you’ll do is fan the flames. 

                                 SALINGER
                        I’m being bombarded with questions 
                        about when we’re going to send the 
                        civil rights bill to Congress. 
                                 O’DONNELL
                        We made promises during the 
                        campaign. If we sit idly by, our 
                        supporters will never forgive us.

                                 SCHLESINGER
                        It’s also the right thing to do. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        It’s the wrong time to do it. 

           Bobby holds up The New York Times. 

                                 BOBBY
                        The wrong time? We’ve got King 
                        writing letters from a jail cell 
                        and kids on the street getting 
                        their heads busted. Time is a 
                        luxury we don’t have. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’ve spoken with Senator Russell. 
                        You’re going to have enough trouble 
                        getting your budget passed without 
                        sending them the civil rights bill. 

                                 JFK
                        You think they’ll hold my budget 
                        bill hostage to block civil rights?

                                 JOHNSON
                        I think they’ll hold everything 
                        hostage to block civil rights. 

                                 BOBBY
                        To hell with Richard Russell. We’ll 
                        go around him. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You can’t go around Richard 
                        Russell. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Then we’ll go through him!

           Bobby throws the paper to the desk. JFK picks it up. 

                                 JFK
                             (reading)
                        “For years now I have heard the 
                        word ‘Wait.’ It rings in the ear of 
                        every Negro with piercing 
                        familiarity. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JFK (CONT'D)
                        This ‘Wait’ has almost always meant 
                        ‘Never.’ We must come to see that 
                        justice too long delayed is justice 
                        denied.”

           JFK folds the paper and places it back on his desk. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Mr. President, we’re talking about 
                        bombs. About lynchings. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I am not unsympathetic to the 
                        plight of the nigras-

           Off that word Bobby shoots Johnson a glare. The other Kennedy 
           men exchange shakes of their heads and smirks. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m not as smart as some of 
                        the men in this room. Maybe I’m not 
                        as smart as any man in this room. 
                        But when it comes to the workings 
                        of the Congress of the United 
                        States, I know what I’m talking 
                        about. Mr. President, if you send 
                        the civil rights bill to Congress 
                        right now it will never become law. 

           JFK thinks for a moment. 

                                 JFK
                        Thank you, Gentlemen. 

           Everyone files out except for JFK, Bobby, and O’Donnell. 

           Johnson is the last to leave. He looks back at three men in 
           the Oval Office as he closes the door. 

                                 JFK (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?

                                 BOBBY
                        The time for negotiation is over. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        We have to do something bold. 

                                 JFK
                        What about the Southern Democrats?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        We’re never going to get their 
                        support. 
                                 BOBBY
                        This is one of those times to draw 
                        a line in the sand. 

                                 JFK
                        Maybe we can send a message to them 
                        through Lyndon. Maybe they’ll 
                        listen to a Southerner who’s on our 
                        side. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What makes you think he’s on our 
                        side?

           JFK nods and walks to his desk. 

                                 JFK
                        Kenny, can we get this bill passed?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        I just don’t know, sir. It won’t be 
                        easy. 

                                 JFK
                        Well, we don’t do these things 
                        because they are easy; we do them 
                        because they are hard. Right? 

           Bobby and O’Donnell wait for a concrete order. 

                                 JFK (CONT’D)
                        This country needs a civil rights 
                        bill. We have to try. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        What should I tell Lyndon?

                                 BOBBY
                        The Vice President is no longer 
                        part of this discussion. 

           JFK nods in agreement. 

           INT. THE ELMS - DINING ROOM - NIGHT - SUMMER 1963

           Johnson and Russell eat steaks. Johnson has a scotch and 
           soda. Russell drinks whiskey. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        I have had it up to here with 
                        Yankees talking about racism in the 
                        South! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUSSELL (CONT'D)
                        These Kennedys spent their entire 
                        lives in private schools and now 
                        they want to talk about equality?

                                 JOHNSON
                        I swear that White House has more 
                        Harvards running around it than the 
                        whole city of Boston. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Is there nothing they think is 
                        outside of the scope of 
                        governmental control? Voluntary 
                        integration is one thing. But don’t 
                        you think that I, as an American 
                        citizen, have the right to eat a 
                        hamburger in a restaurant without 
                        being forced to sit next to someone 
                        that I don’t want to bump elbows 
                        with?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well I think as an American citizen 
                        you should never be forced to eat a 
                        hamburger. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Don’t be a wise ass, Lyndon. I 
                        don’t find this topic amusing. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I just don’t think that where we 
                        eat a burger is the most serious 
                        crisis this country has ever faced.
                        Here’s where I get confused. A baby 
                        calf is born, it grows into a cow, 
                        lives on a farm, is slaughtered, is 
                        butchered, is packaged, is shipped, 
                        is cooked, and is finally served to 
                        you on your plate. Most, if not all 
                        of those steps required the hands 
                        of black men. Why is it that when 
                        it comes time to eat it, you 
                        suddenly can’t stomach the thought 
                        of sitting next to a black man 
                        while you chew?

           Mrs. Wright, Johnson’s black cook, enters and begins to clear 
           the table.

                                 MRS. WRIGHT
                        May I clear your plates, sir?
                                 JOHNSON
                        Yes. Thank you, dear.

                                 RUSSELL
                        “If the law can compel me to employ 
                        a negro, it can compel a negro to 
                        work for me. Such a law would do 
                        nothing more than enslave a 
                        minority.” That’s what one senator 
                        had to say about civil rights 
                        legislation.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well that senator’s a moron. That 
                        was probably Strom Thrumond. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Actually it was you. 1949. Your 
                        very first speech on the Senate 
                        floor. 

           Johnson looks to Mrs. Wright who sort of pretends not to be 
           listening. Johnson looks away before they make eye contact.

                                 RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        You spoke for over an hour that 
                        day, in opposition to a civil 
                        rights bill just like the one 
                        they’re talking about today. I 
                        remember watching you deliver this 
                        speech and thinking to myself, 
                        “This young man is the future of 
                        the South.”

                                 JOHNSON
                        We are both from states where the 
                        best leaders of the time voted for 
                        secession. It nearly broke this 
                        country. Those great men almost 
                        destroyed America. I don’t ever 
                        want a history book to say that 
                        about me. 

           Mrs. Wright clears their plates while tension hovers in the 
           room. She leaves. 

           Aware that Mrs. Wright is just in the next room, Russell 
           LOWERS HIS VOICE so she won’t hear. Johnson does the same. 

                                 RUSSELL
                             (re: Mrs. Wright)
                        Is that equal, Lyndon? When was the 
                        last time you had a meal with her?
                                 JOHNSON
                        She’s an employee but if you think 
                        I’d have an objection to breaking 
                        bread with her, then you’re a fool. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        You telling me that woman is your 
                        equal?

                                 JOHNSON
                        That woman spends more time in this 
                        house than anyone except Lady Bird. 
                        That’s woman’s not just an equal - 
                        she’s family. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        I don’t know how I missed the 
                        resemblance. 
                             (a beat)
                        Look, what we’re talking about here 
                        is freedom. We’re talking about the 
                        preservation of a certain way of 
                        life - a way of life that you and I 
                        grew up with. And there is nothing 
                        wrong with that. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Then why are we whispering?

           INT. THE ELMS - NIGHT - JUNE 11, 1963

           Johnson sits alone on his couch, finishing a drink. He’s 
           slouched low and definitely a few drinks deep. 

           He gulps down the last sip and rises to make another. He 
           passes a television that is turned on, but with no volume. It 
           switches from the news to JFK addressing the nation. 

           Johnson puts ice in his glass and fixes his drink. As he 
           moves to return to the couch the TV catches his eye. He’s 
           surprised to see the President. He turns up the volume. 

           ON THE TELEVISION

                                 JFK
                        One hundred years of delay have 
                        passed since President Lincoln 
                        freed the slaves, yet their heirs, 
                        their grandsons are not fully free. 
                        And this nation, for all its hopes 
                        and all its boasts will not be 
                        fully free until all its citizens 
                        are free... 
           Johnson can’t believe what he’s seeing.  

                                 JFK (CONT’D)
                        I am therefore asking the Congress 
                        to enact legislation...

           Johnson throws his glass at the wall, shattering it. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT - FALL 1963

           JFK stands behind his desk, reading an opened newspaper.

           From the side door, Mrs. Lincoln shows Johnson inside. She 
           leaves them. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Good evening, Mr. President. I-

           As the man behind the desk looks up, Johnson realizes that 
           it’s not John Kennedy, but rather it’s Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY
                        The President’s at a dinner. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’ll reschedule. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What do you need?

                                 JOHNSON
                        It can wait. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Tell me what’s on your mind and 
                        I’ll relay it to the President. 

           Johnson hesitates but decides to proceed. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I would like to know what the 
                        President’s intentions are for 

           Bobby is not sure what Johnson’s getting at. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Does he still want me on the 
                        ticket?

                                 BOBBY
                        Dropping you from the ticket would 
                        be more trouble than it’s worth.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Now if that’s all, I don’t have 
                        much time. 

           Bobby grabs his jacket. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Why don’t you like me, Bobby?

                                 BOBBY
                        I definitely don’t have that much 
                        time.  

           Johnson has to follow Bobby as he moves. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Your brother likes me. Your father 
                        likes me. What is it that makes you 
                        hate me so much?

                                 BOBBY
                        We see the world in two very 
                        different ways. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Then why keep me around? You don’t 
                        use me for anything important and 
                        half the time you send me out of 
                        the country just to keep me away.

           Bobby offers no help. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        I was in Congress for 24 years, but 
                        you never want my help on 
                        legislative issues. I’m from the 
                        South but when you need help down 
                        there, you have other Southerners 
                        you’d rather work with. I’m 
                        irrelevant.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Did you ever consider that that’s 
                        by design? 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Just let me go. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What would you do if you weren’t 
                        vice president?

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’d go home to Texas where I could 
                        live in peace.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        You’ve made damn sure that I’m 
                        through with politics. I’ll never 
                        be able to run for office again. 
                        Hell, I’m not even sure I can help 
                        the President win reelection in 
                        ‘64.

                                 BOBBY
                        We’ve got concerns beyond that. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re not worried about me in ‘68? 

           Bobby looks up - Johnson is getting warmer. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        You’re not worried about me in ‘68. 
                             (thinking to himself)
                        But if the President was to have a 
                        new vice president, someone fresh, 
                        someone popular, then that man 
                        would likely be the Democratic 
                        nominee four years from now. So you 
                        keep me here because that way the 
                        vice president isn’t the 
                        presumptive nominee in ‘68... you 
                        are.

                                 BOBBY
                        You think I’d be that conniving? 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I would be. 

           Bobby puts his jacket on, readying to leave. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna keep me here next term 
                        and waste four more years of 
                        whatever life I have left so that 
                        you can have an easier shot at the 
                        presidency. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Any time you want to quit, I’ll be 
                        happy to take your resignation to 
                        the President. 

           Bobby exits through the rear door of the Oval Office. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Reedy and Jenkins walk behind Johnson who is walking very 
           slowly now, lost in a contemplative daze. They are concerned 
           but do not dare speak. 

           Johnson stops at a doorway. His head is lowered, shoulders 
           slumped forward. Three years of this has taken its toll and 
           he is tired, weakened, a defeated man. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        If either of you should get an 
                        offer for a better job, I suggest 
                        you take it. My future is behind 
                        me. 

           Reedy and Jenkins remain where they’re standing as Johnson, 
           hands in his pockets and head down, slowly walks away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - 1:13 P.M. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           Johnson leans against the wall, staring at the ground. 

           The door to the room opens and Johnson is the first to notice 
           O’Donnell enter, almost in a daze. He’s so quiet that it 
           takes a few seconds for everyone to notice him. 

           Lady Bird sits with THREE TEXAS CONGRESSMEN: HOMER 
           THORNBERRY, 52, JACK BROOKS, 40, and ALBERT THOMAS, 65. 
           Agents are spread out. A few more members of the staff are 
           here now as well. 

           O’Donnell walks toward the center of the room, never making 
           eye contact with anyone. He stops. His eyes are swollen. He’s 
           overcome with grief. He struggles to speak. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        He’s gone. 

           Johnson’s eyes swell, almost tearing for a moment. Then he 
           blinks and looks up. 

           A long pause and then it begins to sink in for everyone.

           Agent ROY KELLERMAN enters, visibly upset. O’Donnell passes 
           Kellerman on his way out. The room is silent and still.   

           AMIDST IT ALL, LYNDON JOHNSON RISES FROM LEANING AGAINST THE 
           WALL. 
           HE STRAIGHTENS UP TO THE ENTIRETY OF HIS 6’4” FRAME, SHEDDING 
           THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL SLUMP THAT HAS COME TO TYPIFY HIS 
           POLITICAL IMPOTENCE. UNNOTICED BY THE OTHERS FOR THE MOMENT, 
           HE ABSORBS THE INEVITABLE POWER THAT FLOWS TO HIM.

           Assistant Press Secretary MALCOLM KILDUFF, 36, enters the 
           room and timidly makes his way to Johnson.

                                 KILDUFF
                        Mr. President.

           The room stops. All eyes turn to, indeed, the President.

                                 KILDUFF (CONT’D)
                        I have to announce the death of 
                        President Kennedy. 

           Everyone looks anxiously to see how Johnson will respond. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        It’s time for us to leave. Rufus, 
                        get some cars set up and let the 
                        drivers know we’re ready to move. 
                        Emory, have your people locate Lucy 
                        and Lynda Bird - I want my 
                        daughters to meet us when we arrive 
                        in Washington. Also, have McNamara, 
                        Rusk, the whole cabinet on the 
                        ground at Andrews. 

                                 CARTER
                        Rusk is somewhere over the Pacific. 
                        So are five other members of the 
                        cabinet. They’re on a plane to 
                        Japan. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Turn it around. 
                             (to Agent Roberts)
                        I need you to tell Mrs. Kennedy 
                        that it’s time to go. 

                                 AGENT KELLERMAN
                        Mrs. Kennedy won’t leave here 
                        without the body. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well we’re not leaving here without 
                        Mrs. Kennedy.

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Sir, we need to get you in the air. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        Not without Jackie. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Then let’s wait for her at the 
                        plane. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Fine. Cliff, I need people I know 
                        close by. Find whoever you can and 
                        bring them to the plane. 
                        Congressmen, I want you flying back 
                        to Washington with me. Malcolm, 
                        you’re to announce President 
                        Kennedy’s death only after the rest 
                        of us are safely on board, 
                        otherwise you’re gonna make these 
                        boys’ jobs a whole lot harder. 

           Johnson sees that he has everyone’s undivided attention.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        On April 14th, 1865 two would-be 
                        assassins attempted to kill 
                        Secretary of State William Seward, 
                        stabbing him in his home. At the 
                        same time, another assassin was 
                        dispatched in a plot to kill Vice 
                        President Andrew Johnson. These 
                        events happened on the same night 
                        that John Wilkes Booth shot 
                        President Lincoln. We do not know 
                        the extent of this conspiracy or if 
                        it has run its full course. We do 
                        not know who is behind it or what 
                        other destruction they mean to 
                        inflict. Remain vigilant. Remain 
                        focused. We all have a job to do. 

           Youngblood receives a radio message. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        We’ve got two cars standing by.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Let’s move. 

           INT. PARKLAND HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Youngblood leads. Kivett, Johns, and Roberts add additional 
           protection for Johnson, Lady Bird, and their party. They move 
           swiftly, yet as discreetly as possible. 
           Carter breaks away as the rest pass a classroom where the 
           entire Press Pool sits. No one notices as they walk by. 

           Near the reception desk, Cecil Stoughton does notice. Unsure 
           of what’s happening, he looks at the double doors to the 
           operating room and then back to Johnson and his movement.

           It hits him. Cecil grabs his camera and runs for the exit.

           EXT. DALLAS LOVE FIELD - 1:32 P.M. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

           Two unmarked cars come to a stop in front of the plane, 
           heavily guarded now by AGENTS and OFFICERS. 

           Youngblood exits the front car. Johnson steps out and looks 
           up at the glistening Boeing 707, tail number “26000” and the 
           words “United States of America” painted across the fuselage.

           The parties from both cars make their way up the steps and as 
           Johnson enters the plane it officially becomes Air Force One. 

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - AFT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           The pilot, COLONEL JIM SWINDAL, 46, stands inside the rear 
           hatch. Swindal salutes Johnson as he enters. 

           Johnson walks through the small aft compartment and along the 
           narrow hallway on the left side of the plane.

           Youngblood peers out a window, scanning the rooftops. 

                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        Let’s get these shades pulled down!

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           This compartment spans the entire width of the plane. The 
           office contains a sofa, a table, the president’s desk, and a 
           TV. A second door at the front leads to the press seats. 

           Johnson enters quietly. Youngblood follows. Lady Bird and the 
           three congressmen have joined Johnson aide BILL MOYERS, 29, a 
           few SECRETARIES, STAFFERS, and CREW MEMBERS who surround the 
           TV, watching the news. 

           NEWS FOOTAGE

           WALTER CRONKITE sits at his news desk, reporting. 
                                 CRONKITE
                        ...It was only on October 24th that 
                        our ambassador to the United 
                        Nations, Adlai Stevenson was 
                        assaulted in Dallas, leaving a 
                        dinner meeting there. 
                             (reading a note)
                        From Dallas, Texas, the flash, 
                        apparently official: President 
                        Kennedy died at 1 P.M. central 
                        standard time, 2 o’clock eastern 
                        standard time, some 38 minutes ago. 
                             (fighting back tears)
                        Vice President Lyndon Johnson has 
                        left the hospital in Dallas but we 
                        do not know to where he has 
                        proceeded. Presumably he will be 
                        taking the oath of office shortly 
                        and become the 36th President of 
                        the United States. 

           This statement ignites a thought for Johnson. 

           While many in the stateroom share in Cronkite’s tears, 
           Johnson moves to the corner where the three congressmen 
           stand, away from the others. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Congressmen, I need to decide when 
                        and where I should take the oath.

                                 CONGRESSMAN BROOKS
                        I think you should take it 
                        immediately. Establish continuity. 

                                 CONGRESSMAN THORNBERRY
                        No, wait ‘til we get back to 
                        Washington. You can have Warren 
                        swear you in. 

                                 CONGRESSMAN THOMAS
                        I believe we need to reassure 
                        everyone that America has a 
                        president now. But this is a 
                        delicate line to walk. You need to 
                        protect the legitimacy of the 
                        moment.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well then let’s make sure that no 
                        one can object. Rufus, where can I 
                        get the most privacy in here?
                                 YOUNGBLOOD
                        The bedroom I suppose. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I need to make a phone call. 

           EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - MINUTES LATER

           A car arrives. Cliff Carter steps out, along with LIZ 
           CARPENTER, 43, MARIE FEHMER, 29, and JACK VALENTI, 42. 

           A remaining stowaway exits the car: photographer Cecil 
           Stoughton managed to catch a ride.  

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnson and Youngblood move toward the back of the plane. 
           They pass Carter and his three companions. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Thank you all for getting here so 
                        quick. I’d like you to accompany me 
                        to Washington. Marie, would you 
                        join me in the other room please?

           Johnson moves without waiting for a reply. Youngblood stays 
           with him. Fehmer follows them into:

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Fehmer stops in her tracks upon realizing what room she’s in. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        It’s all right, get on in here. 

           Johnson removes his jacket and hangs it in the closet. 
           President Kennedy’s BROWN AIR FORCE ONE BOMBER JACKET catches 
           his eye. He runs his fingers along the leather sleeve.

           Johnson moves to the farthest of the two perfectly made twin 
           beds. He sits, propping some pillows behind his back. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        This is Lyndon Johnson... Yeah. 
                             (to Fehmer)
                        I need you to take notes.

           Fehmer quickly moves toward the corner table.
           INT. HICKORY HILL - BOBBY’S OFFICE - SAME

           ED GUTHMAN, 44, covers the mouthpiece of a phone. Bobby 
           stares out a window.

                                 GUTHMAN
                        Sir. 

                                 BOBBY
                        We’ve made so many enemies. I 
                        thought they’d get one of us, but I 
                        thought it would be me. 

           Bobby turns and looks at the telephone. He takes it. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        This is Robert Kennedy. 

           INTERCUT PHONE CALL 

                                 JOHNSON
                        This is Lyndon Johnson. 

           Silence. Who should start?

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Bobby, I’m very sorry for your 
                        loss. Words can’t express. The 
                        whole country mourns with you. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Thank you. 

           Silence. Bobby’s still not sure why this call is necessary.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Listen, Bobby, I need your opinion 
                        on something. People down here are 
                        saying I should take the oath of 
                        office as soon as possible... 
                        Before we depart... What do you 
                        think about that?

                                 BOBBY
                        I think it would be nice for 
                        President Kennedy to return to 
                        Washington as the president. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I understand that, I really do, but 
                        we’ve got confusion down here and 
                        it’s liable to turn to panic. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        It would put a lot of people at 
                        ease if I took the oath right now. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Perhaps it would put you at ease. 
                        What’s the matter, Lyndon, you 
                        afraid you’ll arrive in Washington 
                        and the White House won’t be here?

                                 JOHNSON
                        It’s important that the world knows 
                        America’s government is functioning 
                        and that we have someone in charge. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I don’t know what the hurry is but 
                        if you’re insistent on taking the 
                        oath then just take the damn oath. 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (for Fehmer’s benefit)
                        Okay, Bobby, then I’ll take the 
                        oath. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s just fine, Lyndon. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        We have to be absolutely certain we 
                        do this the right way. I need you 
                        to get me the precise wording.

           Bobby would jump through the phone if he could. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Is that all?

                                 JOHNSON
                        One more thing. Who do we need to 
                        administer it?

                                 BOBBY
                        Any judge can do it. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Thank you.

           Johnson hangs up and looks to Marie. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Get me Sarah Hughes. 
           EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - 2:11 P.M. 

           Jackie, O’Donnell, O’Brien, and Sorensen, along with other 
           Aides and Agents have arrived at the plane. 

           The men are attempting to carry the coffin up the narrow 
           steps. An awkward task. They stumble and nearly drop it. 

           From 50 feet away, Cecil Stoughton points his camera at this 
           scene and snaps a photo. 

           From the open hatch of the plane, Kilduff notices Stoughton.

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - AFT CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnson exits the bedroom and literally runs into Jackie, 
           startling her. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Oh, Jackie, excuse us.

           She’s visibly caught off guard. Fehmer looks to the ground, 
           embarrassed. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh no, I just didn’t expect - it’s 
                        quite all right. 

           From the door to the stateroom, Lady Bird hurries to them. 

           Johnson quickly puts his jacket on. 

           Jackie moves to a seat near the coffin. Lady Bird sits next 
           to her and looks at her pink suit, now stained with blood and 
           dark colors.  

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Dear God.

                                 JACKIE
                        What if I hadn’t been there? I’m 
                        just so glad I was. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        We never wanted it this way. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh, Lady Bird, we’ve always liked 
                        the two of you so much. 

           Johnson puts a consoling hand on Jackie’s shoulder. No 
           helpful words come to him. 
                                 LADY BIRD
                        Perhaps we should find you 
                        something else to wear. 

                                 JACKIE
                        No. I want them to see what they 
                        have done to Jack. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Jackie, before we take off, if 
                        you’re feeling up to it, there is 
                        one thing I’d like to ask of you. 

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - STATEROOM - 2:34 P.M. 

           The tiny room is filled with 27 people, all focused on the 
           same thing - Johnson, with Lady Bird on his right and Jackie 
           on his left. He faces the tiny JUDGE SARAH HUGHES, 67, who 
           holds a little Catholic missal in her hand. 

           Kilduff kneels down next to Judge Hughes. He holds a 
           Dictaphone.

           Stoughton is perched on the couch with his camera ready. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        All right, Judge. 

           Johnson places his left hand on the small missal and raises 
           his right hand in the air. Kildruff turns the Dictaphone on.

           The room of grief-stricken faces, aides, and friends of JFK 
           as well as Johnson, bear witness to the moment. 

           Judge Hughes administers the oath of office, piece by piece 
           with a somber and steady Johnson repeating.

                                 JUDGE HUGHES/JOHNSON
                        I do solemnly swear / that I will 
                        faithfully execute / the office of 
                        President of the United States / 
                        and will to the best of my ability 
                        / preserve / protect / and defend / 
                        the Constitution of the United 
                        States...

           Stoughton snaps the historic photograph. 

                                 JUDGE HUGHES
                        ...So help me God.

                                 JOHNSON
                        ...So help me God. 
           EXT. DALLAS LOVE FIELD - 2:47 P.M. 

           Air Force One speeds down the runway and takes flight.

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NOVEMBER 22, 1963 - NIGHT

           The sun has set on the nation’s capital. 

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Jenkins and Reedy work. Juanita hands Jenkins a note.

                                 JENKINS
                        Tell him to expect a call tonight. 

           Jenkins looks to her to see if the message is received but 
           she has now stopped, something else has her attention. 

           At the doorway, Johnson stands, looking at his office. 
           Carter, Moyers, and Valenti are behind him. 

           Youngblood and THREE AGENTS do a quick sweep. 

                                 REEDY
                        Welcome back, sir. 

           Juanita carries several sheets of paper to Johnson but 
           emotion takes over as she nears him. 

                                 JUANITA
                        Initially the reports were that 
                        you’d been shot or that you had a 
                        heart attack. It took over an hour 
                        before we knew that you were-

                                 JOHNSON
                        Don’t you worry. Agent Youngblood 
                        took excellent care of me. 
                             (re: sheets of paper)
                        What do you have there?

                                 JUANITA
                        Calls to return, sir. They’re in 
                        the hundreds. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Marie Fehmer will be here shortly 
                        to help you with that. I think you 
                        all remember Jack Valenti. I’ve 
                        asked him to join us as well. We 
                        need all the help we can get 
                        because there is much to be done. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        We’ll start with the Speaker, 
                        Majority Leader, and Richard 
                        Russell. I also want to talk to 
                        every former living president. And 
                        hell, if you can get a hold of the 
                        dead ones, I’ll call them too. 
                        Maybe George Washington has some 
                        good advice for me. 

           Russell enters and moves to Johnson, putting out his hand. 
           Johnson shakes his hand. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Mr. President. Thank God you’re 
                        safe. I’ll be in my office all 
                        night. You call on me if you need 
                        anything. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I will. 

           Russell nods and exits. 

                                 JUANITA
                        How many of these calls would you 
                        like to make tonight?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Every one of them. 

           National Security Advisor MCGEORGE BUNDY, 44, enters.

                                 BUNDY
                        Mr. President, we’ll have a 
                        security briefing ready in 20 
                        minutes. Will you be... where will 
                        you be staying tonight?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Lady Bird and I will remain at the 
                        house for the foreseeable future. 

                                 BUNDY
                        That’s fine, sir. As far as your 
                        office, you and your staff should 
                        move into the Oval tomorrow 
                        morning. 

           Jenkins and Reedy exchange a look, it’s starting to hit them. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Good. We’ll see you in 20. 

           Bundy leaves. 
                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Every person in this room needs to 
                        be thinking one word: “priorities.” 
                        Budget bill, Congress, the D.N.C. 
                        These things need to fall in line 
                        one after the other and in a hurry. 
                        We need to come up with an agenda 
                        and then we need to make it a 
                        reality. 

                                 REEDY
                        You want to start talking about the 
                        election already?

                                 JOHNSON
                        The Republicans will be. We need to 
                        turn chaos into order, panic into 
                        calm. If we can keep the wheels 
                        from falling off the wagon, and 
                        keep the country on track, then 
                        we’ll have done our immediate job.

                                 JENKINS
                        We need to sit down with civil 
                        rights leaders. They’re anxious to 
                        know what’s going to happen to the 
                        civil rights bill.

                                 JOHNSON
                        It’s the wrench in the gears that’s 
                        caused everything to halt. We have 
                        to remove the wrench. Simple as 
                        that. All right, everybody here 
                        knows his role. You’ve done it 
                        before, you’ll do it again. Let’s 
                        get to it. 

           Everyone moves. Johnson finds two sheets of paper.

                                 REEDY
                        Something we can help you with?

                                 JOHNSON
                        No. I want to write a letter to 
                        John Jr. and Caroline. 

           Reedy nods and goes to work. 

           Jenkins stands, mesmerized by Johnson. Their eyes meet. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Sir, I just wanted to say... 
                        welcome back. 
           Jenkins means it in more ways than one and Johnson knows 
           that. He nods in appreciation. Jenkins gets to work. 

           Johnson looks out his window at the illuminated White House.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN BEDROOM - SAME

           Bobby sits on the floor, against the bed. Tears roll down his 
           face. Alone with his emotions, the grief consumes him.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Why, God? 

           The grief begins turning into anger and the anger into 
           resolve. 

           EXT. THE ELMS - NOVEMBER 23, 1963 - MORNING

           The sun begins to show itself on a new day. 

           Johnson’s house has become a fortress overnight. SECRET 
           SERVICE AGENTS guard the new castle. 

           INT. THE ELMS - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Moyers, Valenti, and Fehmer wear fresh clothes. They grab a 
           quick breakfast and coffee. 

           Johnson enters, throwing on his jacket. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Sleep beyond five hours is just 
                        laziness my grandma always said. 

           He grabs a coffee mug off the table that was clearly Moyers’.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Time’s a wastin’.

           Johnson heads out and the rest scramble to follow. 

           INT. SORENSEN’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Sorensen wears casual clothes. He sits at his table with a 
           cup of coffee. He is lost in thought. The PHONE RINGS. He 
           snaps out of it and answers. 

                                 SORENSEN
                        Ted Sorensen. 
           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - SAME

           Moyers, Valenti, and Fehmer all sit in the car watching 
           Johnson talk on the car’s phone.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Ted, this is Lyndon Johnson. 

           INTERCUT PHONE CALL

                                 SORENSEN
                        Hello... Mr. President. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m glad I tracked you down. 
                        Listen, Ted, I want to tell you I 
                        know how much you loved President 
                        Kennedy. And he loved you.

                                 SORENSEN
                        Yes.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You were a trusted servant, loyal 
                        to the end... I need you now, Ted. 
                        I need you even more than he did... 
                        Ted?

           Johnson waits for a response but it doesn’t come. 

           INT. SENATE OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAYS - DAY

           Johnson walks with his staff from the limo. Jenkins and Reedy 
           see them and hurry to catch up. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Do either of you know what this 
                        meeting is about?

                                 JENKINS
                        Russell just said he wanted five 
                        minutes of your time. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        There aren’t many senators who 
                        would summon a president. 

           INT. RUSSELL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnson opens the door and enters, expecting to see Russell. 
           Instead, this small office is filled with TWENTY SENATORS.
           Everyone rises to their feet. Johnson, Jenkins, and Reedy 
           look around, surprised. Russell moves to greet him. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Mr. President. 

           Everyone applauds wholeheartedly. The clapping dies down.

                                 RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        In this dark hour of our nation’s 
                        history, we must remember to give 
                        thanks for the blessings upon us. 
                        From the despicable ashes of a 
                        presidential assassination a new 
                        leader has emerged. We are here to 
                        offer you our support. After a 
                        century of persecution, a century 
                        of being treated as inferior, after 
                        one hundred long years, we finally 
                        have one of our own leading this 
                        nation. America has a Southern 
                        president. And we could ask for no 
                        finer representative of our people. 
                             (bowing his head)
                        Lord, continue to bless our 
                        President, watch over him, and fill 
                        him with strength and wisdom as he 
                        works to do the same for all your 
                        children. Amen. 

                                 ALL
                        Amen. 

           Johnson smiles but the implicit threat has been heard. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAYS - DAY

           Johnson and his staff march through the halls. Youngblood 
           walks in front of them. 

           Walking toward them are O’Donnell and O’Brien. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        What the hell is he doing here?

           The groups reach each other. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Good morning, gentlemen. I’m 
                        pleased to see you back at work 
                        already. I know how much the 
                        President meant to you both. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        He had an impressive group of men 
                        working for him. I need you now, 
                        even more than President Kennedy 
                        needed you. 

           Neither man can respond to this request. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Not that I loved Caesar less, but 
                        that I loved Rome more. 

           Johnson nods and he and his group continue on their way.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I can’t believe he just quoted 
                        Shakespeare. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        I can’t believe he just quoted 
                        Brutus. 

           INT. OUTER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Lincoln and Kennedy’s other SECRETARIES pack up some 
           items from around the office. 

           Johnson and his staff enter.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln. I have 
                        a 9:30 meeting. Can I have my girls 
                        in your office by then?

                                 MRS. LINCOLN
                        I don’t know. That’s so soon.

                                 JOHNSON
                        As best you can, okay?

           Johnson continues through the door into:

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Johnson takes a few steps and then stops. Something is off. 
           He looks down. The light blue carpet has been replaced with a 
           DEEP RED CARPET, changing the complexion of the room. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Mrs. Kennedy had the new carpet 
                        installed when everyone left for 
                        Texas. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Bobby moves through the hallways. He rounds a corner and 
           bumps into Mrs. Lincoln. She is clearly upset. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MRS. LINCOLN
                        Mr. Johnson just told me to clear 
                        everything out of the Oval Office 
                        immediately. 

           Bobby is pissed. He jogs away.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby throws open the door. Johnson stands on one side of the 
           presidential seal in the carpet. Bobby moves to the other 
           side of it. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You don’t waste any time, do you, 
                        Lyndon?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Excuse me?

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s going to take some doing to 
                        get all of President Kennedy’s 
                        belongings packed and relocated. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I was told to use this office. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Just like you were told to take the 
                        oath in Dallas?

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m not trying to force anybody 
                        anywhere. In fact, I’ve made it 
                        absolutely clear that Jackie can 
                        remain in the East Wing for as long 
                        as she likes. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well that’s not really the part of 
                        the building that you’re interested 
                        in, is it?

           Johnson offers no reply. He wasn’t looking for this fight.
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        My brother’s coffin is down the 
                        hall. This is not where our 
                        attention should be. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        While many mourn for your brother, 
                        someone needs to tend to the 
                        business of the country. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Mourning for my brother is the 
                        business of the country. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        The President of the United States 
                        needs an office. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I’ll let you know when this office 
                        can be made available to you. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        We can come back later, after my 
                        cabinet meeting this afternoon. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Your cabinet? 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (treading carefully)
                        I know you’ve got a lot on your 
                        mind, but I’m counting on you to 
                        stand with me as Attorney General. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You’ve already got one photograph 
                        with a grieving Kennedy at your 
                        side. You’re not getting another. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’d appreciate it if you kept me 
                        apprised of any change in plans you 
                        might have. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I know where to find you. 

           Bobby stands fast, letting Johnson know it’s time to leave. 
           Johnson holds steady for a beat and then heads for the exit. 
           His staff follows.  
           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAYS - MINUTES LATER

           Johnson speeds through the hallway with his entire staff. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I swear to Christ I’m done worrying 
                        about that son of bitch!

           They round the corner and see Bundy. 

                                 BUNDY
                        Mr. President. I just left a note 
                        at your desk. It turns out you 
                        can’t use the Oval Office today. 

           Johnson gets right up in Bundy’s face.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re in charge of intelligence 
                        for the United States of America, 
                        right?

                                 BUNDY
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Then God help us!

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnson moves to his desk, still heated. Most of the staff 
           stay in the outer office. Jenkins and Reedy follow Johnson 
           inside. Jenkins closes the door. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Sir, we need to discuss when you’re 
                        going to address a joint session of 
                        Congress. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m not ready for that yet!

                                 JENKINS
                        President Kennedy’s burial has been 
                        set for Monday. With Thursday being 
                        Thanksgiving, we don’t have much of 
                        a window. You’re going to have to 
                        get ready. 

           Johnson looks out his window at:

           THE WHITE HOUSE GATES
           THOUSANDS OF MOURNERS pay tribute to the fallen president. 
           They surround the gate while NEWS CREWS capture footage. 

           Johnson moves to the TV and turns it on. 

           ON TELEVISION

                                 CRONKITE
                        People gathered outside the grounds 
                        of the White House today. Our 
                        reporter David Schumacher was 
                        outside the White House and talked 
                        to some of those people. 

           The coverage switches from Cronkite in the studio to DAVID 
           SCHUMACHER and his interviews of CITIZENS.

                                 WHITE WOMAN
                        I feel the profound grief that 
                        surrounds the whole area and that 
                        something dreadful has happened and 
                        uncertainty about what is going to 
                        happen after this. 

                                 WHITE MAN WITH GLASSES
                        Well I think that we all, more than 
                        with any other president, I think 
                        the people of the United States 
                        have identified themselves with the 
                        Kennedy family and I think the 
                        grief that we all feel at this 
                        event, this tragedy is much more 
                        real and much more personal than if 
                        it would have happened to other 
                        presidents. 

                                 BLACK MAN
                        Just words, I just can't describe 
                        how I feel at this time. 
                             (looking at the White 
                              House)
                        It just seems empty. It just 
                        doesn't seem like anybody else 
                        could fill the place the way he 
                        did. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Johnson is impacted by these sentiments. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Sir, right now you need to focus 
                        your attention on Kennedy’s cabinet 
                        and his staff. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        They’ll never love me either. But 
                        you’re right, I have to have them. 
                        They’re my link to John Kennedy. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - AFTERNOON

           A black catafalque stands in the center of the room. Upon it 
           rests the bronze casket with an American Flag draped over it. 
           A NAVY LIEUTENANT stands at attention at the head of it. 
           Candles flicker at all four corners. 

           Sorensen, O’Donnell, O’Brien, Powers, and Schlesinger stand 
           close by.

                                 POWERS 
                        He said he needed me more than 
                        President Kennedy did. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        That’s the same line of shit he’s 
                        given all of us. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Johnson’s not going to be satisfied 
                        until every one of us promises to 
                        serve him. 

                                 SORENSEN
                        So what should we do?

           Bobby appears, having overheard this. Everyone looks to him. 
           Bobby looks each man in the eye and then walks to the casket. 

                                 BOBBY
                        My president is in this coffin. 

           INT. OCCIDENTAL GRILL & SEAFOOD - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           On the second floor of the old D.C. restaurant many of 
           Kennedy’s men have assembled, including O’Donnell, Salinger, 
           WALTER HELLER, 48, KEN GALBRAITH, 55, SAM BEER, 52, PAUL 
           SAMUELSON, 48, WILLIAM WALTON, 53, AND RICHARD GOODWIN, 31. 

           O’Donnell and Salinger sit near the front of the large table 
           that fills the room. 

           Sorensen and O’Brien enter and seem a little surprised to 
           discover what they are walking into. 
                                 O’BRIEN
                        You need a Harvard degree to eat 
                        here?  

                                 WALTON
                        Hey!

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Oh, sorry, Walton. I didn’t see you 
                        there. 

           O’Brien and Sorensen move to O’Donnell and Salinger while the 
           rest return to their side conversations. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Johnson gave Pierre the-
                             (in a Texas drawl)
                        “I need you even more than he 
                        needed you” speech. Tell him what 
                        you said. 

                                 SALINGER
                        I told him I’d stay on as Press 
                        Secretary as long as he wanted... 
                        until Tuesday. 

           They laugh. 

                                 SORENSEN
                        So what are we doing here?

           Schlesinger enters and moves to the head of the table. This 
           is his meeting. He remains standing as everyone quiets down. 

                                 SCHLESINGER
                        In his inaugural address, President 
                        Kennedy declared that the torch had 
                        been passed to a new generation of 
                        Americans. The question before us 
                        now is who should be the custodian 
                        of that torch?

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO - NOVEMBER 24, 1963 - DAY

           EIGHT MILITARY PALLBEARERS carry JFK’s coffin out of the 
           White House, past a line of UNIFORMED MEN, and set it on a 
           CAISSON that is pulled by six gray horses.

                                 SCHLESINGER (V.O.)
                        The Constitution may say that the 
                        Vice President is next in the line 
                        of succession... 
           At the doorway, Jackie, dressed in black, holds the hands of 
           JOHN JR. (1 day shy of 3 years old) and CAROLINE (3 days shy 
           of 6 years old). Behind them is Bobby. More KENNEDYS trail. 
           Johnson and Lady Bird follow the family. 

           A SINGLE DRUM begins to play...

           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Back to the dinner that Schlesinger leads.

                                 SCHLESINGER
                        But does anyone here believe that 
                        Lyndon Johnson is the rightful heir 
                        to President John F. Kennedy?

           INT. LIMO - DAY

           Bobby stares straight ahead. Johnson sits in the seat behind 
           him, looking over Bobby’s shoulder. 

                                 SCHLESINGER (V.O.)
                        Does anyone not think that we can 
                        do better?

                        I didn’t come to Washington just to 
                        work for John Kennedy; I came here 
                        to work for what John Kennedy 
                        believed in.

                        There is unfinished work and right 
                        now our only hope of completing it 
                        is by serving his successor. 

           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           So many objections to O’Brien’s statement that they drown 
           each other out. Salinger takes the floor.  

                                 O’BRIEN
                        We’ve come too far to put 
                        everything on hold!

                                 BEER
                        You think Johnson will continue the 
                        work of President Kennedy? This is 
                        a man who voted against every piece 
                        of civil rights legislation for 20 
                        years.

                                 SALINGER
                        And even if Johnson believed in 
                        what we believe in, how much do you 
                        think he could really accomplish in 
                        one year? 

                                 GALBRAITH 
                        Can we mount a challenge by then?

                                 SALINGER 
                        Bobby is already more popular and 
                        more powerful than any other 
                        candidate including Lyndon Johnson.

           INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - ROTUNDA - DAY

           Kennedy’s coffin has been placed in the center of the Rotunda 
           for MOURNERS to see. 

                                 SORENSEN (V.O.)
                        Dividing the Party might only make 
                        matters worse. 
                                 BEER (V.O.)
                        You can’t honor Kennedy by serving 
                        Johnson. 

           An ARMY SERGEANT walks backwards, carrying a large WREATH. He 
           sets it down in front of the casket. Johnson follows and 
           stops at the wreath, lowering his head in prayer.

                        see a president - a President 
                        Kennedy - lead us to a better 
                        world. And the people of this

                        Just what are you asking us to do? 
                        To quit? Or betray Lyndon Johnson?

           O’Donnell stands up and everyone gets quiet. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        No one is being asked to sabotage 
                        anything. No one is calling for a 
                        mass exodus. And this is certainly 
                        not a coupe d’état.

                        But Johnson still has to make his 
                        case to the American people. He 
                        still has to prove that he is

                        stumbles...

           Everyone from the previous meeting is here. All of Johnson’s 
           men, and all of Kennedy’s men have gathered. 

           Jackie moves toward the grave and is handed a TORCH. Once 
           ignited, this will be the eternal flame.

           Jackie stops, turns, and hands the torch to Bobby. Bobby 
           ignites the flame. He watches it burn and then looks up 
           through the flame at Johnson. Johnson looks back at Bobby.

                        We can’t just sweep the rest of the 
                        agenda under the rug.

                                 FORTAS
                        He has to make some progress on 
                        civil rights. 

                                 REEDY
                        Some, yes. But we have got to be 
                        realistic.

           INT. THE ELMS - KITCHEN - SAME

           Johnson walks in, tired from a long day. He pours himself a 
           drink while listening to the discussion in the next room. 

           Mrs. Wright chops vegetables. Lady Bird makes a cup of tea.

           Jenkins exits the meeting and approaches Johnson. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        How’s it going in there?

           Jenkins shrugs. Johnson nods. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Have we heard back from any of the 
                        Kennedy men?

                                 JENKINS
                        Two nights ago they had a meeting.

                        All of them. 

           Johnson nods, almost sad. He knows what this means. 

           AS THE ARGUMENT IN THE NEXT ROOM GROWS LOUD ENOUGH TO HEAR.

                                 SENATOR HUMPHREY (O.S.)
                        The civil rights bill was the 
                        cornerstone of Kennedy’s 
                        presidency! 
                                 MOYERS (O.S.)
                        The civil rights bill stalled in 
                        the Senate months ago. Even Kennedy 
                        was going to have to compromise 
                        eventually.  

                                 REEDY (O.S.)
                        Exactly! And nobody expects Johnson 
                        to be John F. Kennedy. 

           That sentiment strikes Johnson to his core. Lady Bird watches 
           as Johnson exits.  

           INT. THE ELMS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnson walks to the closet and removes his jacket. He hangs 
           it up and loosens his tie. 

           Lady Bird enters and moves behind him.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        The country will never accept me. 
                        History will say I was the 
                        illegitimate heir to the throne. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        It’s been four days. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        No man should rise to the top this 
                        way. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        But many have. Truman did. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        FDR was never going to live through 
                        his last term. The moment Truman 
                        became Vice President, he knew it 
                        was his inheritance. Somewhere 
                        between Majority Leader and Dallas, 
                        I lost all hope that I would ever 
                        have this opportunity. And now that 
                        it’s mine... What if I fail?

                                 LADY BIRD
                        You won’t. 

           He shakes his head. He turns to face Lady Bird. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I used to spend so much time 
                        thinking about how to get here. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        I never thought about what I’d do 
                        once I arrived. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        I don’t worry for one second that 
                        the answer to that question lies 
                        within you. A former congressman, a 
                        former senator, the majority 
                        leader, and a vice president. I 
                        knew you as all of those men. I 
                        loved you as all of those men. I 
                        loved you before you were any of 
                        those men. And now you’re the 
                        President of the United States, and 
                        what a grand one you will be. 

           Johnson lets this sink in. 

           INT. THE ELMS - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnson enters and his eyes meet Mrs. Wright’s. They listen 
           to the argument from the other room. 

                                 VALENTI (O.S.)
                        If we don’t make some progress on 
                        civil rights, we’ll face a 
                        challenge at the convention. 

                                 MOYERS (O.S.)
                        From Bobby?

                                 VALENTI (O.S.)
                        From someone. 

                                 REEDY (O.S.)
                        The question is: What’s the minimum 
                        we need to accomplish on civil 
                        rights in order to win reelection 
                        in November?

           On this, Johnson gives Mrs. Wright a half-smile and then 
           looks away, toward the door to the dining room. 

           INT. THE ELMS - DINING ROOM - SAME

           The argument continues.

                                 JENKINS
                        All right, then what kind of 
                        compromise can we live with?
           Johnson opens the door. Everyone stops. He moves to his seat 
           and nods at them to continue. 

                                 JENKINS (CONT’D)
                        Compromise.

                                 MOYERS
                        We need to pass some piece of 
                        legislation. 

                                 VALENTI
                        Kennedy’s bill has a lot of 
                        provisions in it. Which ones can we 
                        get rid of?

                                 FORTAS
                        You’re squandering an opportunity.

                                 REEDY
                        We need to work towards realistic

                        And weaken the bill right out of

                                 REEDY
                        Absolutely. We shouldn’t risk 
                        everything going after ambitious 
                        goals.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        Then what the hell’s the presidency 
                        for?!

           The room stops. Johnson looks at each of them.

                        It can’t just be about a shiny 
                        airplane and a room with no 
                        corners. More power emanates from 
                        this office than any other position 
                        in the world. Surely we can have 
                        larger goals than merely occupying 
                        this office for as long as 
                        possible. Surely there is some 
                        better use of this awesome power.

                        So you want to back Kennedy’s civil

                                 MOYERS
                        It’ll monopolize all of our

                                 REEDY
                        And are you even in favor of it?

           Johnson contemplates before answering. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        About a year ago, Mrs. Wright, my 
                        private cook, was driving from here 
                        back to the ranch in Texas. I asked 
                        her if she would take my dog with 
                        her so that it’d be there when I 
                        got home. Mrs. Wright said no. She 
                        said it’s hard enough driving 
                        through the South as a black woman 
                        without having a dog to worry 
                        about. Finding a place to eat, to 
                        sleep, to use a restroom is a 
                        challenge in and of itself. The 
                        personal cook for the Vice 
                        President of the United States had 
                        to drive through towns without 
                        stopping, and then squat to pee on 
                        the sides of roads. A hundred years 
                        ago she’d have been a slave. A 
                        hundred years from now, hell maybe 
                        she could be president. But today 
                        is a time of too much uncertainty. 
                        Where can she eat? Where can she 
                        sleep? Can she vote? If she does, 
                        will she be harassed for casting 
                        that vote? Can she attend school? 
                        And if so, which school? Can she 
                        travel the cities and towns of this 
                        land without fearing for her 
                        safety? What rights that belong to 
                        the men in this room are not 
                        afforded to her? There are too many 
                        questions looming over this country 
                        today. It’s time to answer them.

                        the people who have always had your 
                        back. And if you aren’t successful, 
                        you’re never going to earn the 
                        support of anyone else. There’s no 
                        points for effort. Your entire 
                        future will hinge on the outcome of 
                        this bill - a bill that four other 
                        presidents have failed to pass.

                        have the third shortest presidency 
                        in history. Every time a president 
                        fights Congress on this, Congress 
                        defeats him.

                                 JOHNSON
                        This time Congress won’t be 
                        fighting a president - it’ll be 
                        fighting two. Never underestimate 
                        the intensity of a martyr’s cause, 
                        or the size of a Texan’s balls. 
                             (standing up)
                        There will be no compromise. There 
                        will be no negotiation. And there 
                        will be no failure. We’re going to 
                        do something historic. We’re going 
                        to do something grand. Otherwise, 
                        what the hell’s the presidency for?

           EXT. THE ELMS - NIGHT

           Johnson’s staff exits the house, many of them with a newfound 
           pride in their boss. Valenti and Moyers hang back. The rest 
           move toward cars. Jenkins addresses them all. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Gentlemen, make it so. 

           Humphrey pulls Jenkins aside.

                        Does he really support the civil

           Humphrey assumes that Jenkins is joking but upon examining 
           Jenkins’ face, he realizes he’s dead serious.

           Youngblood moves to the side of the office as Johnson, 
           Jenkins, Reedy, Moyers, Valenti, and Carter enter. 

           Juanita is at the desk where Mrs. Lincoln used to sit.

                                 JUANITA
                        Good morning, Mr. President.

                        Good morning, Juanita. 

           Johnson arrives at the door and notices a new rack standing 
           next to it. His WHITE STETSON hangs on the top hook. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Johnson takes two steps into the Oval Office - his Oval 
           Office. 

           Kennedy’s Resolute desk has been replaced with Johnson’s 
           GREEN-TOPPED DESK. Behind it sits his HIGH-BACK GREEN CHAIR.

           A new PORTRAIT OF FDR hangs above the mantle. 

           Kennedy’s rocker has been removed. 

           The carpet is still red and the walls still need decorating, 
           but this is a different office now.  

           Johnson moves to his desk. He runs his hand along the many 
           buttons on his phone. He picks up the receiver. 

           The staff members flow in around. They are mesmerized by the 
           mystique of the room. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Let’s get to work.

                        We’re moving ahead full tilt with 
                        his civil rights bill, his entire 
                        agenda. This is about making 
                        President Kennedy’s vision a 
                        reality. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - TINY OFFICE - DAY

           Sorensen stands at an empty desk in a small office. Moyers, 
           Reedy, and Jenkins drop piles of notes in front of him.

                                 JENKINS
                        That should bring you up to speed. 

           Sorensen looks at the mountain of work before him. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Johnson and Secretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 47, stand 
           near the rear glass doors.

                                 JOHNSON
                        What I’m thinking about Vietnam is 
                        I don’t want to think about 
                        Vietnam. I got a damn country in 
                        mourning, a congress that needs to 
                        get off its ass, and an entire 
                        presidential term to squeeze into 
                        11 months. 

           McNamara isn’t satisfied with this answer.

                        All right, we’re not gonna let 
                        Vietnam fall to the communists, 
                        obviously. But I don’t want it to 
                        interfere with our agenda. So for 
                        now let’s just stay the course and 
                        see if we can’t solve this thing 
                        before it becomes a bigger problem 
                        than it already is.

           Sorensen sits at his desk. He scribbles on a piece of paper, 
           then tears it off and trashes it.

           He picks up his notes and heads for the door. He bumps into 
           Jenkins who was on his way in, spilling his notes.

                                 JENKINS
                        It’s both. This is the country’s

                        Rusk needs 10 minutes. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        He can have them in 20. 

           Senator Mansfield enters. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Mike, give me good news. 
                                 SENATOR MANSFIELD
                        There’s definitely going to be a 
                        Southern filibuster, Mr. President. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        No shit, Sherlock. How are we 
                        looking on cloture? What’s the 
                        count?

                                 SENATOR MANSFIELD
                        About 56. 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (trying to remain calm)
                        About 56? Thank you, Mike. Leave. 
                        Now. 

           Mansfield exits. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Thank God he can’t be Majority 
                        Leader and Whip at the same fuckin’ 
                        time. Hubert, you’re gonna have to 
                        manage this one. When I ask for a 
                        count, I want a goddamn number.

                                 SENATOR HUMPHREY
                        Yes, sir. You’ve got me day and 
                        night, but we’re going to need more 
                        good men working on this. Men who 
                        are devoted to this bill. And it 
                        wouldn’t hurt to have a Southerner. 

           Johnson nods in agreement. 

           INT. OUTER OFFICE - LATER

           Juanita escorts Senator Yarborough past her desk and into:

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Yarborough looks around at the newly redecorated office. 

           Humphrey and TWO OTHER SENATORS sit on the couches, having 
           their own discussion.

           Johnson walks to Yarborough, damn near accosting him. Johnson 
           sticks out his hand. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Senator Yarborough, it’s good to 
                        see you. 
           Yarborough shakes Johnson’s hand. He looks confused.

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Good to see you, sir. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Senator, we’re about to go to war 
                        on civil rights. We’re gonna push 
                        that bill through Congress, intact. 
                        I need men, men with principle who 
                        are prepared to take some shots 
                        along the way. You up for that?

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        I serve at your pleasure, sir. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Good. Hubert will get you set up.

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        Sir, just out of curiosity, what’s 
                        your reasoning?

                                 JOHNSON
                        I don’t give a damn what color a 
                        man’s skin is; every man deserves a 
                        fair shot. And if he can’t get it 
                        on his own then we ought to help 
                        him out. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        I hate to tell, Mr. President, but 
                        I think you might be a liberal. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Don’t call me names in my own 
                        office. 

                                 YARBOROUGH
                        No, sir. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Get to work.

           INT. SENATOR DIRKSEN’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Johnson sits across from Illinois Senator EVERETT DIRKSEN, 
           67. They each have a drink in hand. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Do you know why I’ve come here?
                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        Because there’s a civil war in the 
                        Democratic party. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’d think that would be welcomed 
                        news for the Republicans. 

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        Can’t say it’s bad news. But I’m 
                        not sure it’s something I want to 
                        get involved in either. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Just stand back and watch us kill 
                        each other?

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        Why not?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Because there’s more at stake than 
                        just politics. 

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        Yes, there is.  

                                 JOHNSON
                        The civil rights bill is going to 
                        have its day. 

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        It’s going to have more than a day, 
                        sir. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Yes it will. 

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        Might I suggest removing the parts 
                        of the bill that many find-

                                 JOHNSON
                        Can’t do it, Ev. I’m not gonna 
                        weaken this bill. 

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        I’m not interested in the politics 
                        on this one. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        That’s why you and I are having 
                        this conversation. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        The Southerners in my party, at 
                        least most of ‘em, are gonna rise 
                        up against us. If we’re to win this 
                        battle, it’s going to be the 
                        Republicans, you, Senator Dirksen, 
                        are going to fire the final shot. 

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        Respectfully, sir, I won’t put 
                        myself on the line until I believe 
                        you’re willing to do the same. You 
                        need to make me believe. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I will. And once I do, it is my 
                        sincere hope that the Republicans 
                        will cast the deciding vote on the 
                        Civil Rights Act. And I can’t think 
                        of anything more appropriate, more 
                        poetic for the Party of Lincoln. 

                                 SENATOR DIRKSEN
                        Neither can I, Mr. President. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT

           Johnson’s MOTORCADE departs the Capitol. The American Flag 
           above still flies at half-mast. 

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - NIGHT

           Johnson sits quietly as the car moves. 

           Outside the window, Johnson looks as the LINCOLN MEMORIAL 
           appears. 

                                 JOHNSON
                             (to Lincoln)
                        You know this is your fuckin’ mess 
                        I’m cleaning up. 

           IN THE DISTANCE 

           The stone face of Lincoln offers no reply. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           Johnson enters the dimly lit office. Russell is standing in 
           the center of it, waiting for him. An unexpected visit. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        Good to see you, Dick. 

           Johnson extends his hand but Russell doesn’t take it. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        How dare you, Mr. President. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Why don’t we have a drink?

                                 RUSSELL
                        I am done drinking with you. You 
                        are turning your back on the people 
                        who made you who you are today. And 
                        for what?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Civil rights is an idea whose time 
                        has come. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        I have gone head-to-head with four 
                        different presidents on this issue. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You haven’t gone head-to-head with 
                        me.

                                 RUSSELL
                        This could define your presidency. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Let’s hope so.  

                                 RUSSELL
                        You’ll never get enough Democrats 
                        to support it. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Then I’ll use the next best thing. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Republicans?

           Johnson’s face indicates he’ll do just that. 

                                 RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        You willing to hitch your wagon to 
                        the outcome of this bill?
                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m tired of having this 
                        conversation with you. We talk all 
                        day long but don’t say a thing. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        What is it you want to say to me? 
                        That you intend to turn your back 
                        on me? That you don’t care about 
                        everything I’ve done for you? That 
                        you’re willing to betray me!

                                 JOHNSON
                        That you’re a racist!

                                 RUSSELL
                        I beg your pardon. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        All your talk about “the Southern 
                        way of life.” You talk about loving 
                        the negro as your brother and all 
                        the while you plot against him like 
                        he’s your sworn enemy. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        I don’t care where we’re standing - 
                        no man is gonna call me a racist.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re not a good man, Dick. You’re 
                        a great man. World class. I admire 
                        you more than you’ll ever know. But 
                        you’re wrong on this one. You’re 
                        just plain wrong!

                                 RUSSELL
                        I will fight you with everything I 
                        have. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Then fight me, but not in here, not 
                        in the back rooms or inside these 
                        walls. Fight me before the entire 
                        world. Fight me on the Senate 
                        floor. And on that battlefield, let 
                        each man write his own legacy. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        My army is small, but our cause is 
                        great. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        Well my cause is great too. And my 
                        army is bigger.

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY - NOVEMBER 27, 1963 

           The sun rises over the nation’s capital. Its monuments 
           glimmer in all of their glory. 

           INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           Jenkins, Moyers, Reedy, Valenti, and Carter wait outside the 
           Oval Office with O’Donnell, O’Brien, and Salinger. Juanita 
           sits at her desk. 

           Many seem nervous, particularly Reedy. O’Brien approaches.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        You need to settle down. 

                                 REEDY
                        He’s never delivered a speech of 
                        this magnitude. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I’m sure the speech is excellent.

                                 REEDY
                        I’m not worried about the speech - 
                        I’m worried about the speaker. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 REEDY
                        You ever seen him address an 
                        audience?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        He’s passionate. 

                                 REEDY
                        Passionate? No, he’s... 
                             (searching for an 
                              explanation)
                        Did your father ever get drunk and 
                        yell at you?

                                 O’BRIEN
                        I’m Irish. 
                                 REEDY
                        Okay, so imagine that, only instead 
                        of yelling at a little boy, he’s 
                        yelling at 435 congressmen, 100 
                        senators, nine justices of the 
                        Supreme Court, and one entire 
                        nation that desperately needs to 
                        feel the warm paternal embrace of 
                        its president.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        George, does Johnson scare you?

                                 REEDY
                        Every day.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - SAME

           Sorensen stands at the President’s desk while Johnson looks 
           over the speech in front of him. He has a pen in hand and 
           scratches notes in the margin, crosses a few things out, and 
           with each stroke of the pen gives more concern to his 
           speechwriter. Finally, Johnson looks up. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        This is one of the finest things 
                        I’ve ever read.  

                                 SORENSEN
                        It was the hardest speech I’ve ever 
                        had to write. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’ve made a few adjustments to make 
                        it my own, but Ted, this is a job 
                        well done. I want you to know that 
                        I’m very grateful. And you did 
                        right by him as well. 
                             (pointing to the door)
                        Would you bring ‘em all in? 

           Sorensen moves to the door to let everyone in.

           Johnson stands and grabs his speech. He looks to the door as 
           both staffs, Johnson’s and Kennedy’s, enter the Oval Office 
           and spread out. 

           He walks to the front of his desk. 
                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Each of you came to Washington 
                        because you wanted to change the 
                        world. Together that’s exactly what 
                        we’re going to do.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           The President’s motorcade leaves the White House.

           INT. PRESIDENT’S LIMO - DAY

           Agent Youngblood sits in the front seat, ever vigilant. 

           In the back seat, Johnson looks out his window at the 
           buildings on Pennsylvania Avenue. Flags blow in the wind, 
           still at half-mast. 

           INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - LARGE HALL - DAY

           Johnson marches toward the end of the hall, followed by 
           Jenkins, Reedy, O’Donnell, O’Brien, Sorensen, Salinger, 
           Moyers, and Valenti.

                                 REEDY
                        Sir, just remember not to look at 
                        the Southern caucus when you’re 
                        talking about civil rights. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Where will they be sitting?

                                 REEDY
                        I don’t know. But they’ll be the 
                        ones not clapping. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re annoying me.  

           Reedy backs off. 

           They come to the door that leads to the floor of the House of 
           Representatives. At the door, DOORKEEPER WILLIAM “FISHBAIT” 
           MILLER, 54, stands waiting. Everyone stops. 

                                 MILLER
                        Are you ready, sir?

           Johnson looks down. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HICKORY HILL - BALLROOM - NIGHT - WINTER 1962

           Bobby Kennedy’s house. A big dinner ball. Twenty tables are 
           spread throughout the room, each with a dozen GUESTS. 

           AT JOHNSON’S TABLE

           Vice President Johnson starts in on a new scotch and soda, 
           keeping to himself. He hears laughter from nearby and he 
           looks over to the:

           HEAD TABLE

           Bobby, Schlesinger, Sorensen, Salinger, and THEIR WIVES are 
           all being entertained by O’Donnell who is telling a story 
           rather loudly. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        ...So I get the reporter back on 
                        the phone and I tell him that if he 
                        ever runs a story like that again, 
                        he’s going to be sorry. The S.O.B. 
                        has the nerve to ask if he can get 
                        a quote from the President. I say, 
                        “No, President Kennedy is a very 
                        important man and doesn’t give 
                        quotes to pesky little reporters 
                        from podunk papers.” Then he asks 
                        if Bobby can give him a quote. I 
                        say, “No, Bobby’s even more 
                        important than the President.”

           They all laugh. 

                                 O’DONNELL (CONT’D)
                        So I say, “Listen, if you really 
                        want a quote, why don’t you call 
                        Lyndon Johnson?” And he goes, “Say, 
                        what ever happened to Lyndon 
                        Johnson?”

           The entire table bursts out laughing. Apparently no one 
           realizes that Johnson is here. Or no one cares. 

           Johnson slumps in his chair and lowers his head. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - LARGE HALL - DAY - NOVEMBER 27, 1963

           Johnson looks up at Miller and gives an affirmative nod. 

           Miller turns and pulls open the doors as he walks into:
           INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           As Miller enters he makes a loud declaration in a booming 
           Mississippi accent:

                                 MILLER
                        Mr. Speaker, the President of the 
                        United States! 

           The entire chamber rises to its feet as Johnson walks down 
           the center aisle towards the podium in front of the SPEAKER.

           On the floor sit 435 CONGRESSMEN including Thornberry, 
           Brooks, and Thomas. Also present are all 100 SENATORS, 
           including Yarborough, Mansfield, Humphrey, Dirksen, and 
           Russell. 

           Toward the front are the JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT and 
           the entire CABINET.

           UP IN THE GALLERY 

           A mixture of FRIENDS, FAMILY, and CITIZENS. 

           In the front row stands Lady Bird. To one side are their two 
           daughters, LYNDA BIRD, 19, and LUCY, 16. On her other side is 
           the family’s personal cook, Mrs. Wright. 

           CAMERAS are set up to broadcast live across the world. 

           IN THE BACK

           Along the walls, STAFFERS are bunched together. 

           Schlesinger joins O’Donnell and the other Kennedy men. 

                                 SCHLESINGER
                        Will he stumble?

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Will he fall?

           Reedy, Jenkins, Moyers, and Carter huddle together. 

           AT THE FRONT

           Johnson walks past his Cabinet, including the Attorney 
           General. Bobby’s face is like stone. Neither man gives 
           anything away. 

           Johnson walks up to the podium. He puts his glasses on and 
           opens his speech.  

           Everyone sits. Silence.  
                                 JOHNSON
                        Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members 
                        of the House, Members of the 
                        Senate, my fellow Americans: All I 
                        have I would have given gladly not 
                        to be standing here today. The 
                        greatest leader of our time has 
                        been struck down by the foulest 
                        deed of our time. Today, John 
                        Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the 
                        immortal words and works that he 
                        left behind. He lives on in the 
                        mind and memories of mankind. He 
                        lives on in the hearts of his 
                        countrymen. No words are sad enough 
                        to express our sense of loss. No 
                        words are strong enough to express 
                        our determination to continue the 
                        forward thrust of America that he 
                        began. 

           Reedy and Jenkins are nervous but none of their concerns have 
           materialized. He’s strong, steady, confident, almost warm. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        An assassin’s bullet has thrust 
                        upon me the awesome burden of the 
                        Presidency. And in this critical 
                        moment, it is our duty, yours and 
                        mine, as the government of the 
                        United States, to do away with 
                        uncertainty and doubt and delay, 
                        and to show that we are capable of 
                        decisive action; that from the 
                        brutal loss of our leader, we will 
                        derive not weakness, but strength; 
                        that we can and will act and act 
                        now. 

           A strong, supportive applause from everyone.  

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        On the 20th day of January, in 
                        nineteen and sixty-one, John F. 
                        Kennedy told his countrymen that 
                        our national work would not be 
                        finished “in the first thousand 
                        days, nor in the life of this 
                        administration, nor even perhaps in 
                        our lifetime on this planet. But,” 
                        he said, “let us begin.” Today, in 
                        this moment of new resolve, I would 
                        say to all my fellow Americans, let 
                        us continue. 
           The chamber rises to its feet to applaud. The Kennedy men are 
           particularly moved by this. O’Donnell pats Sorensen on the 
           back. 

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        No memorial oration or eulogy could 
                        more eloquently honor President 
                        Kennedy’s memory than the earliest 
                        possible passage of the civil 
                        rights bill for which he fought so 
                        long. We have talked long enough in 
                        this country about equal rights. We 
                        have talked for one hundred years 
                        or more. It is time now to write 
                        the next chapter, and to write it 
                        in the books of law. 

           Much of the audience applauds loudly. Dirksen has been 
           convinced.

           The Southern contingent remains seated. Russell and his 
           fellow Southern Democrats are silent.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        I profoundly hope that the tragedy 
                        and the torment of these terrible 
                        days will bind us together in new 
                        fellowship, making us one people in 
                        our hour of sorrow. So let us here 
                        highly resolve that John Fitzgerald 
                        Kennedy did not live, or die, in 
                        vain. And on this Thanksgiving eve, 
                        as we gather together to ask the 
                        Lord’s blessing, and give Him our 
                        thanks, let us unite in those 
                        familiar and cherished words: 
                        America, America, God shed His 
                        grace on thee, and crown thy good 
                        with brotherhood from sea to 
                        shining sea. 

           The entire room leaps to its feet and erupts in thunderous 
           applause, an applause that does not stop, does not waver as 
           the President begins his walk out of the chamber. 

           Lady Bird and Johnson’s friends and family are overcome with 
           pride as they cheer him. 

           Every person in this room applauds in support and 
           appreciation. Every person, with his applause, conveys a 
           newfound dedication to Lyndon Johnson. 

           Those who support Johnson are invigorated. Those who oppose 
           him are petrified. 
           Those who might benefit from him stumbling are left with no 
           hope. Those who want him to succeed are ready to go into 
           battle with him. 

           And then there’s Bobby...

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY - SPRING 1964 

           The eternal flame on JFK’s grave burns, blowing in the wind. 

           Bobby Kennedy stands at the grave, wearing President 
           Kennedy’s AIR FORCE ONE BOMBER JACKET. 

           Behind him stand O’Donnell, Sorensen, O’Brien, Schlesinger, 
           and Salinger. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        He already got the budget through 
                        Congress. And civil rights - it’s 
                        going to be a battle but I think 
                        he’s going to get it passed. 

                                 BOBBY
                        President Kennedy’s Civil Rights 
                        Act is going to be signed into law 
                        by Lyndon Johnson. 

           Bobby shakes his head in disbelief. 

                                 SCHLESINGER
                        He’s got the support of both houses 
                        and the country. He’s no longer 
                        vulnerable. Not now. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Johnson stands at his desk. Jenkins, Reedy, Valenti, Moyers, 
           and Carter face him. 

                                 VALENTI
                        The Republicans are going to 
                        nominate Goldwater. And no Democrat 
                        is going to challenge you, not even 
                        Bobby. 

                                 REEDY
                        Rumor has it he’s so grief-stricken 
                        that he may retire from politics 
                        all together. 
                                 JOHNSON
                        Let me tell you something about men 
                        like Bobby Kennedy. Men like him, 
                        who’ve held the reins of power, 
                        they don’t just let it slip away. 
                        They wait, like a snake in the 
                        grass, for their moment to strike. 
                        Men like Bobby Kennedy may lose 
                        power but they always come back for 
                        it. 

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY

           Bobby and his men continue their conversation. 

                                 SALINGER
                        You could run for Governor of 
                        Massachusetts. 

                                 O’DONNELL
                        Or the senate seat in New York. 

                                 SCHLESINGER
                        The polls say you’re the odds-on 
                        favorite to be Johnson’s Vice 
                        President. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Never in a thousand years would I 
                        take that job. 

           Bobby looks down at his brother’s grave and then turns to 
           face his men. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I would have dedicated my entire 
                        life to my brother. But I can’t be 
                        John Kennedy. 

                                 SORENSEN
                        Then be Bobby Kennedy. 

           A soft wind blows in Bobby’s face. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Johnson continues his meeting. 

                                 JENKINS
                        We’re going to have to move beyond 
                        civil rights. We need to think 
                        about what else we aim to do.
                                 JOHNSON
                        If we’ve learned anything from 
                        President Kennedy it’s that life is 
                        frail and time is precious. I don’t 
                        intend to waste either. Mistakes 
                        will be made but inaction won’t be 
                        one of them. We’re going to move 
                        forward, always forward and at full 
                        speed. John Kennedy gave people 
                        hope. Now we’re going to give them 
                        results. Let’s get to work. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Thank you, Mr. President. 

           Everybody follows this order. The office becomes a whirlwind 
           of organized chaos and at the center of it all, behind his 
           desk, stands Lyndon Johnson, President of the United States. 

           Amidst the activity in the scene, words appear on screen:

           “President Lyndon Johnson's first 11 months in office 
           launched the most progressive social agenda of the century. 

           “On July 2, 1964, 378 days after President Kennedy sent the 
           civil rights bill to Congress, President Johnson signed into 
           law the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

           “On November 3, 1964, Lyndon Baines Johnson defeated Senator 
           Barry Goldwater of Arizona for the presidency, winning 44 of 
           50 states and the District of Columbia. President Johnson 
           received 61.1% of the popular vote, the largest victory since 
           1820. No president since has surpassed this accomplishment.

           “During the next term of his presidency, Johnson continued to 
           pursue an aggressive domestic agenda in hopes of achieving 
           his dream of The Great Society. Johnson would also continue 
           to escalate the war in Vietnam. By 1968, American deaths 
           reached an all-time high. 

           “On March 16, 1968, the junior senator from New York, Robert 
           Francis Kennedy, declared his candidacy for the Democratic 
           nomination for President of the United States. Fifteen days 
           later, Lyndon Johnson withdrew from the race, becoming the 
           last sitting president to choose not to seek reelection. 

           “On June 5, 1968, moments after winning the California 
           presidential primary, Bobby was assassinated. 

           “Three days later he was buried next to his brother at 
           Arlington National Cemetery. Lyndon Johnson looked on as 
           Bobby Kennedy was laid to rest.”

           FADE OUT.
