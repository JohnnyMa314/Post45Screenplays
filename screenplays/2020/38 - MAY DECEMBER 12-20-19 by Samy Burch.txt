           EXT. THE OUTDOORS-- DAWN

           A monarch butterfly lands on the leaf of a milkweed plant. 

           Its thick black body curves up underneath and lays the 
           smallest little white egg you’ve ever seen. 

           And then it flies away. 

           The delicate egg sticks to the bottom of the leaf impossibly. 

           A bit further back, we see there are hundreds more. 

           EXT. CAMDEN, MAINE-- DAY

           Memorial Day. A beautiful small town on the coast. An area of 
           New England that still somehow feels untouched. And pure.

           American flags in store windows, young girls in baton 
           twirling outfits readying themselves for the parade.  

           The houses are beautiful and old, but modest. Pastel colors, 
           big yards, trees everywhere. A bright, breezy day. 

           INT. KITCHEN-- DAY

           GRACIE ATHERTON-YU, 59, floats around her sun-drenched 
           kitchen, spreading whipped cream on cakes and laying 
           strawberries atop them in a pleasing way. 

           There’s energy in the house, and in the backyard, which can 
           be seen from the kitchen windows. 

           With her is RHONDA, 60s, who’s filling up deviled eggs with a 
           piping bag.

                                 RHONDA
                        This one or this one?

           She holds out two metal tips. 

                                 GRACIE
                        The open star-- start in the 
                        center, end in the center. 

           Rhonda gets it.

           MARY ATHERTON-YU, 18, runs through the kitchen with her 
           friends.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Where you going?
                                 MARY
                        The roof.

           A hard look. And then a permissive nod.

                                 GRACIE
                        Go on. I will not be calling 
                        anyone’s mother today to say 
                        someone broke their neck and died, 
                        do you hear me?

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        We’ll be so safe. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Honestly.

           She muddles up some fresh blackberries and drains the juice.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        The actress is coming.

                                 RHONDA
                        Today??

                                 GRACIE
                        Mm-hmm.

                                 RHONDA
                        Are you worried?

                                 GRACIE
                        Worried? Why would I be worried?

                                 RHONDA
                        Oh. I don’t know. That’s just where 
                        my mind goes I guess.

                                 GRACIE
                        I just hope she’s polite. Not 
                        sitting there with big Jackie O 
                        sunglasses, too good for 
                        everything. If she’s gonna be here, 
                        I want her to participate. 

                                 RHONDA
                        I’m sure she will. Look at this 
                        beautiful day.

           It is beautiful. 

           JOE YU, 36, comes in from the backyard and gently kisses 
           Gracie on the cheek. He too is beautiful. Like a despondent 
           aristocrat in a Dutch painting. 
                                 GRACIE
                        You just never know, I told you 
                        what happened when I met Judge 
                        Judy...

           Joe takes a beer from the fridge and heads out.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                             (to Joe)
                        That’s two. 

           An embarrassed smile. 

                                 JOE
                        Rhonda.

                                 RHONDA
                        Joe.

           Big smile back from Rhonda as he leaves. 

                                 GRACIE
                        But I’m sure you’re right. I’m sure 
                        we’ll be right as rain. 

           She hands Rhonda the paprika from the cabinet before she 
           asked for it. 

           Then suddenly a dark cloud overtakes Gracie’s expression, 
           like something very terrible has just occurred to her. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think we have enough 
                        sausages. 

           EXT. BACKYARD-- CONTINUOUS

           Joe mans the grill. There are so, so many sausages. Kids and 
           dogs are running around playing. Adults drink. They’re not on 
           a lake but one feels close by.

           He stands with his friend BEN, 40s, who kind of evokes “P.E. 
           Teacher.”

                                 BEN
                        I saw a movie she was in, a really 
                        weird one, where she gets naked and 
                        does like a blood ritual. I 
                        couldn’t follow it.

                                 JOE
                        Where’d you see it?
                                 BEN
                        Just on TV.

           Joe rolls his eyes.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Alright I looked up “Elizabeth 
                        Bryce naked.”

           A CHILD SCREAMS A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM-- but then it’s fine, 
           he just fell.

                                 JOE
                        Why don’t you go deal with that. 

           He flips the sausages, one by one. 

           INT. LAKE STREET INN-- DAY

           ELIZABETH BRYCE, 36, unpacks and reorganizes the room of the 
           small town bed & breakfast. She wears all black, big chunky 
           running sneakers, and talks through wireless headphones.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah... It’s quaint...

           She picks up a sand dollar and drops it in a drawer with 
           disdain. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        It’s very “Maine.” Mm-hmm... Mm-
                        hmm... 

           She looks out the window. Across the street is a middle 
           school. Closed for the holiday but colorful remnants remain. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Mm-hmm... I’m listening! You 
                        said...

           There is a slight pause but she gets there, has the recall of 
           a trained bird.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        “I feel bad because I’ve canceled 
                        the last few times and she’s so 
                        nice...” You know what I’m gonna 
                        say, I think you shouldn’t do 
                        anything you don’t want to do. 

           She notices a gift basket on the chair. 
           A note: Ms. Bryce, We are so excited to you have here. We 
           hope you fall in love with Maine. Best, Management (Bonnie & 
           Jim). P.S. We are huge fans of “Animal Hospital” 

           She rolls her eyes.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You know what-- tell her that 
                        you’re having a birthday dinner 
                        that night and you were just about 
                        to invite her, and then you don’t 
                        have to go to her party and you get 
                        the credit for inviting her to 
                        something. Even if you never would. 

           INT. LAKE STREET INN-- A BIT LATER

           Elizabeth rips the top blanket off and sits cross-legged on 
           the bed. She opens a brand new (tiny) notebook. Page one. 

           She writes: Gracie

           And then she underlines it. And then she thinks.

           EXT. ATHERTON-YU HOUSE-- AFTERNOON

           Now in a carefree summer dress, Elizabeth drives up in her 
           rental car to the house. She looks different, has an ease. 
           She carries a bottle of wine from the gift basket she was 
           given. 

           No one hears her front door knock, so she goes around the 
           side, following the playful noises.

           EXT. ATHERTON-YU BACKYARD-- CONTINUOUS

           The barbecue is in full swing. A touch football game going 
           on, the teens sprawled out on the roof. Everyone wears red, 
           white and blue. But in a subdued way. In a Maine way. 

           Elizabeth scans the crowd, where she finds Gracie already 
           starring right at her. She waves. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hi. 

           She puts her hand to her heart.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        It’s such a pleasure to meet you.
                                 GRACIE
                        Oh I don’t know about that. 

           They hug.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re so tall! 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ll try to work on it.

           She offers the bottle.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I cannot thank you enough for 
                        welcoming me into your life-- you 
                        didn’t have to, and I so appreciate 
                        it.

                                 GRACIE
                        Well, of course! I want you to tell 
                        the story right, don’t I? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s all I want. I want you to 
                        feel known--

           Three large Clumber Spaniels rush up to protect Gracie. Big, 
           sloppy white dogs that look like melted ice cream.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Oh wow.

                                 GRACIE
                             (to the dogs)
                        It’s okay, my boys, settle down. 
                        You can trust her.

           Elizabeth tries to look happy petting them. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Striking.

                                 GRACIE
                        They were bred to be hunting dogs. 
                        For kings. 

           Joe approaches. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Here he is. 

           Elizabeth really takes him in. She knows she must remember 
           this moment.
                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Joe, Elizabeth.

           They shake hands.

                                 JOE
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 GRACIE
                        Elizabeth-- so formal-- do you have 
                        a nickname?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, just Elizabeth. Growing up it 
                        was Betsy, but I sort of outgrew 
                        it.

           Gracie doesn’t follow.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        What a beautiful property.

                                 GRACIE
                        Thank you. Joe does all the 
                        landscaping.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Lovely.

           They all just stand there, admiring the shrubs. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Well, look, I don’t want to be in 
                        your way, I certainly don’t want to 
                        interrupt your party.

                                 JOE
                        Can I get you something to drink? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m fine, thank you.

                                 GRACIE
                        You do what you gotta do, look 
                        around, talk to people, but first 
                        go get yourself a hot dog.

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (has literally never had a 
                              hot dog)
                        Great. 
           EXT. BACKYARD-- A BIT LATER

           Elizabeth wanders dreamily around like the ghost of this 
           party. 

           She takes notes in her tiny leather book: Americana. Is there 
           something underneath? 

                                 MARY
                        Hi. 

           Mary and her two best friends (MOLLY & SOFIA, both 18) hover 
           by the back door.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hello. Are you Mary?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah. 

           They giggle.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re the youngest, right?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, my sister’s at college 
                        already. 

           The trio stares at Elizabeth, her make-up, her clothes. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never met anyone who was on TV 
                        before. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, your parents.

                                 MARY
                        Yeah but like, for real. 

                                 SOFIA
                        What is James Marsden like?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So sweet. Really nice guy. 

                                 MARY
                        I want to minor in Drama. We were 
                        all in the play together last fall. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s wonderful-- which play?
                                 MARY
                        Macbeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        “I have no spur
                        To prick the sides of my intent, 
                        but only
                        Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps 
                        itself
                        And falls on the other.”

                                 MARY
                        Oh it was like, translated. 

                                 MOLLY
                        We were the witches. 

           EXT. BACKYARD-- SUNSET 

           The party has settled into a nice lull. Everyone sits on 
           picnic blankets or lawn chairs. Kids run around with 
           sparklers. 

           Elizabeth sits next to Rhonda, but watches Gracie, who’s 
           curled up in Joe’s arms. Her hand holds his tight. 

                                 RHONDA
                        Sweet, aren’t they?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Very. 

                                 RHONDA
                        It really feels like things just 
                        settled down. And now you’re making 
                        a movie.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s a great, human story. And 
                        Roberto is such a thoughtful, kind-
                        hearted director.

                                 RHONDA
                        Well, I won’t get to sit on the 
                        lawn with Roberto. So I’m telling 
                        you: This is their real life. 
                        They’ve been put through the 
                        ringer, and have come out the other 
                        end of it. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know. 
                                 RHONDA
                        All the awful things people said. 
                        For a while there she lost 
                        everything. She’s very strong, but 
                        there are limits.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I completely agree.

                                 RHONDA
                        Just be kind, that’s all.

           Elizabeth nods as the fireworks start in the sky over the 
           trees. She looks over, Gracie still grasping Joe’s hand, 
           knuckles white. 

           INT. ATHERTON-YU ENTRANCE-- NIGHT

           Cleaning up, most guests have gone. Gracie fusses as 
           Elizabeth gathers her things.

                                 GRACIE
                        I was thinking you may want to come 
                        with me to my class tomorrow. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’d love to. 

           Gracie opens the front door.

                                 GRACIE
                             (calling upstairs)
                        Oh no. Joe!

           Elizabeth peers over to see a barely taped together package. 
           Gracie just shakes her head in a knowing way. Joe comes down.

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 GRACIE
                        You’re not gonna believe this. 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll get a garbage bag.

           Gracie puts on some colorful rubber gloves and takes the box 
           inside-- she flips the lid.

                                 GRACIE
                        I knew it. My goodness, we haven’t 
                        gotten a box of s-h-i-t in I don’t 
                        know how long.
           Joe holds out a garbage bag, she drops it in. He wraps it up 
           and heads outside. Routine.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Someone put... s-h-i-t in a box and 
                        delivered it here?

                                 GRACIE
                        And on a holiday too. 

           INT. LAKE STREET INN-- NIGHT

           Elizabeth, in sleepwear, sits up in bed with a People 
           Magazine from 1997. 

           Gracie, twenty years earlier, is on the cover in handcuffs, 
           starring off into the distance in a dreamy way. We get a 
           sense in pieces. 

           “Gracie Atherton pleads guilty to pet shop romance!” “13-year-
           old lover will be father of her child!” “Ouch mommy I hwurt 
           my finger!” etc.

           Picture of young Joe completely back-lit to hide his face. 
           One of Gracie with lovely, soft curls, her pastel prison 
           jumpsuit very flattering. 

           Elizabeth hits her light in the same way. The same martyred 
           expression.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Who me? 

           Strikes the pose again. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I just want to go home, your honor.

           INT. ATHERTON-YU DEN-- NIGHT

           Joe is mindlessly scrolling on Facebook-- mainly made up of 
           his incredibly active Raising Monarch Butterflies group (”Has 
           anyone seen this before?” “What to do about frozen milkweed?” 
           etc). 

           He hesitates but then types “Elizabeth Bryce” into youtube-- 

           Interviews, weird montages set to music, her winning an MTV 
           Movie Award. 

           He clicks on a commercial for a skin care line. It’s 
           Elizabeth, in like 2005. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        So pure, you can hardly tell its 
                        there.

           She smiles, fresh and dewy. A SLOW MOTION shot of her 
           splashing water on her face and smiling, her hands rising up 
           in a way that feels oddly religious. 

           Joe rushes to turn the sound down to mute. 

           He replays it over-- Elizabeth splashing herself in the face, 
           and loving it. 

           INT. ATHERTON-YU BEDROOM-- A BIT LATER

           Joe quietly gets into bed, Gracie is facing the side, looks 
           asleep.

                                 GRACIE
                        You smell like charcoal. 

                                 JOE
                        ... Smoke. 

           She turns suddenly.

                                 GRACIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 JOE
                        We have a gas grill, not a charcoal 
                        grill, so, you must be smelling 
                        just smoke.

           Her ears move back in her head, and she stares at him 
           blankly.

                                 GRACIE
                        Well you’re stinking up the sheets.

                                 JOE
                        Do you want me to shower? 

                                 GRACIE
                        No what I want is for you to have 
                        already showered, before you got 
                        in. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m sorry. 

           She closes her eyes and tears start to immediately, quietly 
           fall.
                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Gracie. 

           He pulls her into his chest. She looks relieved, but then.

                                 GRACIE
                        More smoke. 

           He rips his shirt off, pats some bedside water on his chest. 

                                 JOE
                        Okay? 

           She curls up in his lap, still gently weeping. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Okay. 

                                 JOE
                        Everything’s fine.

                                 GRACIE
                        Okay. 

           He pets her hair as she falls asleep. 

           EXT. BACKYARD-- EARLY MORNING

           It’s quiet and still, the sun just rising. Joe tiptoes around 
           his milkweed bushes, looking at each leaf really carefully. 

           When he finds one with tiny little pearlescent eggs he 
           delicately clips it off the plant and lays it on his tray. 

           It’s slow work, and deliberate. 

           INT. DINING NOOK-- A BIT LATER

           Joe takes his leaves and puts them gently inside white mesh 
           cages that are lined up on the table and chairs in the small 
           room. It’s a well-organized space, and his routine feels 
           lived in. 

           He adjusts the shades and observes. Nothing is moving-- 
           they’re just eggs. 

           He gets out his phone and takes a picture of one leaf that 
           has three eggs in a perfectly straight line. 

           He considers, but then texts it to MICHELA “MONARCHS” (as he 
           has her listed in his phone).
                                 JOE
                             (texting)
                        Looks like “...” doesn’t it? Like 
                        they’re about to text me something? 

           She immediately starts writing back (...)

                                 MICHELA
                        OMG so funny. I’ve never seen them 
                        in such a straight line before!

                                 JOE
                        I know, strange right?

                                 MICHELA
                        I wonder if it was one who laid 
                        them in a row, or just a weird 
                        coincidence. 

                                 JOE
                        I know, me too.

           Pause. A natural time to put away his phone but he hesitates. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        How’s your day going?

                                 MICHELA
                        Good, I just got to work. You?

                                 JOE
                        Peaceful. 

                                 MICHELA
                        Great.

           (...)

                                 MICHELA (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy it!

           He chews his lip and puts his phone away. 

           INT. WINDOWLESS COMMUNITY CENTER-- AFTERNOON

           Gracie and Elizabeth share a table in the back of a flower 
           arranging class. They both have a vase, a hunk of that green 
           spongy stuff, and access to flowers. 

           There are a half dozen other women also at their stations, 
           and a teacher (LYDIA, 60s, in a loose-fitting sunflower 
           smock). 
                                 LYDIA
                        That is lovely, Sheila. 

           SHEILA, 80s, blushes with pride. It’s a gentle environment 
           but people talk among themselves. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How long have you been coming?

                                 GRACIE
                        A little over ten years now.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Amazing. What draws you to this?

                                 GRACIE
                             (duh)
                        The flowers.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Right. But--

                                 LYDIA
                        Beautiful, Gracie. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Thank you. Lydia, this is 
                        Elizabeth. She’s playing me in a 
                        movie.

                                 LYDIA
                        How interesting. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Trying to show her a good time. 

                                 LYDIA
                        That I don’t doubt.

           Lydia strolls away. Gracie’s arrangement is really tight and 
           organized. Formal. Elizabeth (who does not care) is making 
           one that’s more breezy and natural.

                                 GRACIE
                        You want to start in the center and 
                        build outward.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What’s the reason for that?

                                 GRACIE
                        It’s just the rule. 

           Elizabeth tries to copy Gracie’s style and movements. 
                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        My brother Scott, he’s a Rear 
                        Admiral in the Navy, he always 
                        says, “Order is its own reward”-- 
                        No, like this. 

           She takes over her arrangement.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        See? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Got it. 

           She distractedly places carnations in a row. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        ... So did you have any classes 
                        like this in prison?

           A harsh, flip of the head-- Gracie holds a rigid finger up at 
           Elizabeth like you would a dog. They lock eyes until an Alpha 
           is established (guess who won?). 

                                 GRACIE
                        Not here. 

           Elizabeth sucks her teeth as she shoves handfuls of baby’s 
           breath in her stupid fucking vase. 

           INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT

           Elizabeth and Joe sit in their seats at the kitchen table as 
           Gracie sets plates in front of them of meatloaf and mashed 
           potatoes. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Do you want milk?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Milk? Um, no thank you. 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll take a beer.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Water would be great. 

           She doesn’t seem thrilled with either answer but brings them 
           to the table.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Mary?
                                 GRACIE
                        She’s at her friend’s house, 
                        they’re working on a project. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well thank you for having me for 
                        dinner, I really appreciate it.

                                 GRACIE
                        Of course. 

           They begin.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mmm, this is wonderful, thank you.

                                 GRACIE
                        An Atherton-Yu special. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It really is unlike any meatloaf 
                        I’ve had.

                                 GRACIE
                        It’s moose. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Is it?

                                 GRACIE
                        I brought her home myself.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You... shot a moose, and ground up 
                        its meat and, that’s this meatloaf? 

                                 GRACIE
                             (getting a kick out of 
                              this)
                        Yes.

                                 JOE
                        Gracie hunts all the time.

           Elizabeth strains. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Remarkable. 

                                 GRACIE
                        My daddy taught me, I started going 
                        with him and my brothers when I was 
                        really young. Four, five.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wow. This was in Virginia? 

           Gracie raises her eyebrows, still not quite thrilled about 
           research being done.

                                 GRACIE
                        Tennessee, and then Illinois, and 
                        then Montana, and then Virginia. 

           Chew, chew, chew, swallow.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What was like to move so much? To 
                        have to uproot your life--

                                 GRACIE
                        It was fine. I made friends 
                        everywhere I went. I always had my 
                        brothers. My childhood was 
                        exceptional. 

           Next topic.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, I do have a lot of questions 
                        for you both, please let me know if 
                        now’s not the time.

                                 GRACIE
                        Good a time as any. 

           Tight smile.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Great.

           She gets out her tiny book and pen. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember the first time you 
                        met?

                                 JOE
                        I don’t.

                                 GRACIE
                        I met Joe... let me think. It must 
                        have been his first day of 
                        Kindergarten I would think? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (acting casual)
                        Oh.
                                 GRACIE
                        My son, Georgie, was the same year 
                        as Joe, and all the mother’s would 
                        go for the first day of school. So 
                        that was probably the first time. 
                        We didn’t talk or anything. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course.

                                 GRACIE
                        And then I had processed the 
                        family, his dad was a tailor, I 
                        would go get dresses taken in, that 
                        kind of thing, and I’d see him at 
                        the recitals and the soccer games 
                        and all that. 

           Elizabeth takes studious notes. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        And then around sixth grade I think 
                        it was, Joe and Georgie got a 
                        little closer, and they were at the 
                        same pool parties, and slumber 
                        parties-- one of them was at my 
                        house! If you can believe that. 

           She laughs and takes a big gulp of her milk. Elizabeth also 
           manages a laugh. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        And the next year, that next 
                        summer, he came in to the pet store 
                        and said he was looking for a 
                        summer job.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This was the summer after sixth 
                        grade?

                                 JOE
                        Seventh. 

                                 GRACIE
                        And he started working there in the 
                        afternoons and on weekends. And 
                        that’s when we... Got close. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Were you still friends with 
                        Georgie?
                                 JOE
                        At the time, yeah. But not after... 
                        I really haven’t ever talked to 
                        George, uh, ever again really. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Georgie is really sensitive, he was 
                        always a really sensitive boy. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What’s your relationship like with 
                        him and his siblings now?

                                 GRACIE
                             (suddenly harsh)
                        How is that relevant?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Um.

                                 GRACIE
                        My understanding is that the movie 
                        is taking place in 1996-1998, why 
                        would you need to know anything 
                        really about my life after that?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well sometimes things that exist 
                        inside people don’t come to a head 
                        until later... And I’m looking for 
                        the seeds of those things. So... I 
                        feel it’s my job to get to know you 
                        as best I can, and part of that is 
                        a bit of reverse engineering, I 
                        guess you would call it. 

           Gracie thinks about it, skeptical.

                                 GRACIE
                             (cheery)
                        Alright...

           Elizabeth and Joe both look relieved. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Yes I talk to George, I talk to 
                        Billy and Cassidy. We keep things 
                        pretty separate when we can. 

                                 JOE
                        Are you gonna tell her about 
                        graduation?

           Gracie clears her throat.
                                 GRACIE
                        Mary is in the same class as 
                        Cassidy’s son Peter, my grandson. 
                        So we’ll all be at the graduation, 
                        which you are welcome to come to if 
                        you’re still in town. 

           A big smile.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Now who wants cake?

           EXT. ATHERTON-YU HOUSE-- NIGHT

           Joe takes the trash out as Elizabeth goes to her rental car. 
           The moon looms large over their Kia Sedona. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Goodnight.

                                 JOE
                        Goodnight. 

           She hesitates, doesn’t get in the car. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Actually. I wanted to ask you.

           She approaches the bins.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        How would you feel about me coming 
                        to work with you one of these days?

                                 JOE
                        Fine.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay great. That’s great. 

           He’s giving nothing away but it is taking him a long time to 
           deal with the trash. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s no problem.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Great. 
                                 JOE
                        Good. 

           She stares at his face. Grasping. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I just realized that we’re probably 
                        the same age.  

                                 JOE
                        Is that right?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m 36.

           He nods. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Funny. I keep thinking of you as 
                        younger. 

                                 JOE
                        Makes sense.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But, only in the last few years 
                        have I been able to imagine having 
                        a baby, I can’t imagine doing it 
                        when you did.

                                 JOE
                        I was almost too young to know what 
                        a big deal it was, in a way.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Right. 

           They stand there.

                                 JOE
                        I should probably head inside.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course. 

                                 JOE
                        But. I didn’t mean to make it seem 
                        like I have any regrets. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh no, I didn’t think that. 

                                 JOE
                        I really don’t.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey, I mean, I have regrets.

                                 JOE
                        I just think the way people have 
                        written about us in the past, it’s 
                        like I’m a victim. And... we’ve 
                        been together almost twenty-four 
                        years now... like... why would we 
                        do that if we weren’t happy? If 
                        you’re together for that long it’s 
                        because you’re happy being together 
                        for that long...?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Makes sense. 

           A light goes on in a second floor window. They both notice it 
           and pretend they haven’t. 

                                 JOE
                        All right, well, get home safe.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks, you too.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP-- MORNING

           Feels like the kind of place that was thriving in the ‘90s-- 
           dark wall paint, fun lighting fixtures, fliers for bands. 

           Elizabeth finds TOM ATHERTON, early 60s, sitting a booth, 
           waiting for her. He’s aged since that 1997 People Magazine 
           where he looked like the heir to a boat fortune, but he’s a 
           handsome, straight-forward man. 

                                 TOM
                        I ordered you a coffee.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I can’t tell you how much I 
                        appreciate this.

                                 TOM
                             (bashful)
                        It’s just coffee.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, I mean-- well, yes, thank you 
                        for the coffee. But meeting me. I’m 
                        sure it’s not your favorite thing 
                        to talk about.
                                 TOM
                        I don’t mind. I think talking can 
                        feel... good.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, great. Me too.

                                 TOM
                        Do you want anything to eat? They 
                        have quiche, and they even make 
                        crepes here with all kinds of crazy 
                        fillings. Kind of what they’re 
                        known for.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m okay with just coffee.

                                 TOM
                        An actress.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Excuse me?

                                 TOM
                        Seems typical of an actress. I 
                        haven’t met one before but it seems 
                        that way.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes. Ha. 

           She takes out her book. 

                                 TOM
                        That’s small!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, it’s discrete. 

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know, if I saw someone 
                        writing in that I’d think-- what 
                        are they writing? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, you’d just have to wonder I 
                        guess.

           He waves to his friend who walks by the front window.

                                 TOM
                        That’s Carla from my dentist’s 
                        office.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        So, why don’t you tell me about 
                        what Gracie was like when you first 
                        met?

                                 TOM
                        Aw, Gracie was beautiful. We met at 
                        a party and I was really drunk, 
                        just blotto. And she took care of 
                        me. 

           Nurtures the wrong men, she writes and quickly covers. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        And then we dated for a bit. Gracie 
                        was in high school-- a senior, it 
                        was all, you know, above board-- 
                        and I was in college. And I 
                        graduated, and she graduated and I 
                        proposed and that was that. We had 
                        a really fun wedding with all our 
                        friends there, and then I got with 
                        the same company I’m with now, and 
                        we moved up here and started our 
                        family. It was kind of A, B, C... 
                        D, you know?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Would you describe your marriage as 
                        a happy one?

                                 TOM
                        I would! I know later, she said 
                        that things weren’t working but at 
                        the time I thought everything was 
                        normal. Couples fight sometimes. 
                        She would spend too much money, I 
                        would leave my shoes in the wrong 
                        place-- stuff like that. But our 
                        house was really organized and the 
                        kids are so fun-- will you meet 
                        them?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’d love to.

                                 TOM
                        Billy is such a ham, and Cassidy is 
                        beautiful and a real over-achiever, 
                        and George-- he’s creative. But we 
                        had a great family I thought. I was 
                        shocked. Shocked. And then when I 
                        found out with who.
           His jaw tightens.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I imagine that was hard.

                                 TOM
                        It was just so strange. I started 
                        to feel like... I didn’t even know 
                        Gracie. I didn’t know what was 
                        going on in her head, you know? It 
                        used to make me really angry but 
                        I’m able to control it now. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How did you find out?

                                 TOM
                        I found out with everyone else! 
                        After they got caught in that 
                        stupid stockroom, and she was 
                        arrested. The police came to my 
                        house to tell me. I was like... Uh, 
                        what? 

           Not smart, she writes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m so sorry, I can’t imagine. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s okay. Ultimately it was for 
                        the best. I met Tina and we have 
                        such a nice life now-- she’s a 
                        nurse.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s great. 

                                 TOM
                        And I mean I don’t really see them 
                        too much but her and the boy seem 
                        happy too. 

           “The boy.”

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        All’s well that ends well, I guess. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - X-RAY ROOM-- DAY

           Joe puts that heavy blanket on an older man’s bare legs and 
           lines up the X-Ray machine.
                                 MR. WOGENSEN
                        It’s cold.

                                 JOE
                        I know, Mr. Wogensen. It’ll be over 
                        before you know it, I promise. 

           He goes into the other room. Click, it goes white. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - X RAY ROOM-- LATER

           Joe lines up different x-ray slides of lungs. Scary pictures 
           that he does not interpret, only takes.  

           INT. BRIDAL SHOP-- AFTERNOON

           Gracie and Elizabeth sit on a plush bench in a sunny, 
           feminine store for women.  

           Mary comes out from behind the curtain wearing a modest white 
           dress with long sleeves and lace.

                                 GRACIE
                        Isn’t that lovely! 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Beautiful.

                                 MARY
                        I feel like a bride.

                                 GRACIE
                        You look youthful-- like the first 
                        day of Spring.

                                 MARY
                        I just feel like everyone else is 
                        gonna be wearing like more summer-y 
                        dresses.

                                 GRACIE
                        And who cares about everyone else?

                                 MARY
                        Me, I, am saying I don’t like it.

                                 GRACIE
                        Fine. Go try on the others. 

           She goes back behind the curtain.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Will they not be wearing robes?

                                 GRACIE
                        They’ll be wearing robes. It’s for 
                        under the robe. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Does it have to be white?

                                 GRACIE
                        No, I like white. 

           Elizabeth checks her phone. Mary comes back out in a white 
           sleeveless number. She looks happy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So cute.

                                 MARY
                        I love it.

           She’s admiring herself in the mirror.

                                 GRACIE
                        It’s lovely-- I love the fabric.

                                 MARY
                        I like how it flows.

                                 GRACIE
                        Mary, I really want to commend you. 
                        For being so brave and showing your 
                        arms like that. I really mean it, 
                        that’s something I’ve always wished 
                        I could do. Just not care about 
                        these unrealistic standards. You’re 
                        a modern woman. 

           Elizabeth looks really uncomfortable, Mary straining to 
           maintain her dignity.

                                 MARY
                        I’m gonna try the other ones on... 
                        I really like this one but I think 
                        maybe it’s too similar to the one 
                        Molly has.

                                 GRACIE
                        Whatever you want.

           She slinks off. 
                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        I heard you saw Tom.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, for coffee. 

                                 GRACIE
                        What’d you think?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Handsome.

                                 GRACIE
                        He is.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And I could see how being in a 
                        marriage with him could be 
                        isolating. 

           Gracie snaps her head towards her in shock. And then she 
           smiles.

                                 GRACIE
                        Good.
                             (beat)
                        It’s not my business who you talk 
                        to around here, go through the 
                        phone book for all I care, but let 
                        me know ahead of time so I won’t 
                        have to lie to my neighbors. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Understood.

                                 GRACIE
                        It’s a small town. 

           Mary comes back out in a girlish baby-doll dress, sleeves to 
           the elbows. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        How sweet is that?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Really sweet.

                                 MARY
                        You like it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Very in. 
           Mary looks at herself in the mirror, was clearly just crying. 
           They all pretend. 

           INT. PET STORE-- DUSK 

           The bells chime as Elizabeth peeps her head in. The sun is 
           about to set on charming Main Street visible from the big 
           glass windows. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hi.

           MR. HENDERSON, 70s, looks flustered behind the counter. 
           Puppies and kittens whine and roll around in the front areas.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        You must be Ms. Bryce. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, so nice to meet you.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        The pleasure is all mine. Do you 
                        want to, um...

           He motions like-- “play with the puppies?”

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So tempting, but no I’d rather just 
                        look around. If you want to show 
                        me... how the pet store works?

           INT. PET STORE-- CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Henderson gives Elizabeth a tour. Tidying things as he 
           goes, trying to impress her. 

           Birds, Fish, Hamsters, Mice, Frogs, Lizards, Snakes. Some 
           skittish, some lethargic, but they all seem to look at her 
           like they know they’re in jail. 

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        So this is the bulk of the 
                        business.

           He motions to the food aisle. 

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Pets are only about 10% of sales.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How long have you owned this place?
                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        It was my mother’s. She opened it 
                        up in 1972. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And she hired Gracie.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        Yes. Her health was in decline. And 
                        Gracie had been a really loyal 
                        customer, they opened a K-Mart in 
                        Waterville.

           Clearly a sore subject to this day.

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        And Gracie-- have you met her dogs? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        We don’t carry specialty breeds 
                        like those-- usually we just have a 
                        golden retriever, and a lab, and 
                        something small and fluffy. But we 
                        work with customers to find 
                        breeders if they want something 
                        specific, like Gracie. 

           A pause as she writes.

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Are you an animal lover, Ms. Bryce?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I grew up with cats. 

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        Well that may kick in again for you 
                        at some point, I’ve seen it a 
                        million times.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We’ll see I guess. So, at what 
                        point did Gracie start working 
                        here?

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        It was after mother’s fall. That 
                        was... 1995, October. First she was 
                        just watching the store-- I wasn’t 
                        living in town then.

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT'D)
                        And then she took on more and more 
                        responsibilities, balancing the 
                        books, orders... She’s very 
                        organized, we still use some of the 
                        systems she put in place. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Like what?

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        Well like we have this.

           He pulls out a huge dusty Rolodex. 

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        And instead of it being organized 
                        by name it’s by date, so that we 
                        can call, say... 

           He picks one out, so slowly.

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Bundy, and remind her that 
                        she’s almost out of bird feed, or 
                        that her flea medication is up in a 
                        month. That kind of thing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Incredible. 

           She notices she’s about to run out of pages...

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Did she have other co-workers?

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        No it was just her, the store 
                        wasn’t open full time. And then in 
                        the summer of ‘96 she asked if she 
                        could hire a part-time helper for 
                        minimum wage and mother said yes 
                        and she put a little sign out that 
                        said, “Help Wanted” and we were all 
                        quite surprised to have been part 
                        of then what had happened. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What was that like?

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        “Henderson Pets” was suddenly in 
                        print in every major publication in 
                        the country. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT'D)
                        Our friends, the O’Connor’s, 
                        brought us back a tabloid newspaper 
                        from Rome that even said it. We 
                        have it in a scrapbook somewhere-- 
                        “Il negozio di animali Henderson.”

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Bene. 

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        But the journalists were 
                        relentless. The photographers 
                        swarmed right outside. Oh, I have--

           He looks through a drawer and pulls out a photo of himself 
           twenty years younger screaming in the center of a huge mob of 
           media. “Henderson Pets” painted in the store window.  

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        That’s when I still had hair! 

           She stares at the image, really does seem to be moved. 

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Well I supposed you want to see the 
                        stockroom. 

           INT. STOCKROOM-- A BIT LATER

           The door creaks open, and Mr. Henderson pulls the light on 
           with a draw string. The light bulb swings. 

           Elizabeth steps inside.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        I don’t like to come back here 
                        honestly. I’ll let you look around 
                        if you don’t mind.

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (barely noticing him)
                        Great.

           He closes the door. 

           It’s pretty big. And grey. Dark wooden floors, no windows. 
           Some waist high shelves and a couple of aisles. Places to 
           hide, places to duck. 

           Elizabeth walks around the space with bated breath. 

           The darkest corner is almost pitch black, a narrow aisle of 
           fish tanks. They glow, and so do the creatures inside. 
           INT. BACK OF THE STOCKROOM-- CONTINUOUS

           She turns the corner and sees a private area with A COUPLE OF 
           WOODEN STAIRS leading up to the furnace room.

           On one side is a shelf of files and old leather books. On the 
           other is a REFRIGERATOR with clear glass doors. 

           Inside are frozen mice, barely alive crickets. Things that 
           tick with a tiny pulse. She runs her fingertip over the 
           glass. 

           She sits on the stairs. Then she lies back. Tries to get 
           comfortable. She puts one leg up on the book shelf. She 
           covers her own mouth as if someone else is doing it. As if 
           she’s about to scream with pleasure. 

           Then she sits up, and nods to herself, like, “Yeah, that 
           would do.”

           INT. BUTTERFLY CAGES-- NIGHT

           Progress has been made. The eggs have hatched and now the 
           bottoms of the cages are full of thick, green caterpillars of 
           various sizes. 

           They squirm on a bed of leaves and eat and eat to their 
           hearts content.

           Their meaty bodies writhe around in a hedonist swell. 

           INT. ATHERTON-YU DEN-- NIGHT

           Joe sits in a lounge chair watching the TV on low. “This Old 
           House” on PBS-- a show where really calm older men explain 
           how air conditioners work in extreme detail. 

           Upon closer inspection, he’s antsy. Can’t sit still, can’t 
           focus on the air conditioner. 

           He takes out his phone. It’s 9pm. Pretty late. Or is it? 
           Still prime time, no? Friends text other friends at all 
           times.

                                 JOE
                             (texting)
                        Up to twenty-five so far, how about 
                        you?

           (...)
                                 MICHELA
                        31 but I lost one tonight.

                                 JOE
                        Oh no, I’m sorry.

                                 MICHELA
                        I think it was the milkweed I 
                        bought at Lowe’s-- they said it was 
                        organic but I don’t trust them.

                                 JOE
                        It’s crazy how untrustworthy they 
                        are.

           (...)

           But then it disappears and nothing comes. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        How was your day?

                                 MICHELA
                        Kind of shitty-- between that and 
                        work.

                                 JOE
                        What happened?

                                 MICHELA
                        It’s just really stressful because 
                        it’s peer review week and I feel 
                        like I spend a lot of my day 
                        managing my boss’s moods.

                                 JOE
                        That’s hard. I know how that can 
                        be.

                                 MICHELA
                        But whatever, it’s fine. I’m home 
                        now, gonna relax and take a bath.

           Joe hesitates. Stares at the word “bath” as if it’s 
           pulsating. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m sorry you had a rough day.

                                 MICHELA
                        That’s sweet of you.

                                 JOE
                        I--
                                 GRACIE (O.S.)
                        Joe where’s the step stool! 

           He jumps so far, drops his phone down the side of the chair. 

                                 JOE
                        One sec!

           INT. KITCHEN-- A BIT LATER

           Joe brings the step stool in. Gracie is in the middle of 
           making several layer cakes. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Where was it?

                                 JOE
                        I hung some netting for the 
                        caterpillars. 

           She takes the step stool and uses it to get down food 
           coloring and a variety of sprinkles from the tall-person 
           cabinet. 

                                 GRACIE
                        What are you gonna do with your 
                        bugs when the Poversteins come 
                        over? 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll figure it out.

           He heads back to the den.

                                 GRACIE
                             (calling after)
                        Don’t put them in our bedroom 
                        again.

           Now back to the cakes. Well, she never really broke her 
           stride or looked up at him to begin with.

           She mixes dark red dye in with some batter. It ripples in a 
           hypnotic way.

           She smears chocolate, watches a strawberry jam bubble on the 
           stove, whips cream. 

           All of the textures evoke a certain eroticism and she tastes 
           with her finger are she goes. But she doesn’t enjoy those 
           tastes, it’s scientific. 
           INT. LAKE STREET INN-- NIGHT

           Elizabeth sits in bed her robe (one from home, obviously). 

           She takes a few puffs of her asthma INHALER, and opens an e-
           mail that says “Joe - Pre-read Selects” and clicks a link. 

           It’s a casting website with auditions posted. About ten 13 
           YEAR OLD BOY ACTORS.  

           She starts to click through.

                                 BOY ACTOR #1
                        Benny Kim, 5’4”, I’m 13 years old, 
                        my date of birth is September 8th, 
                        2006, and I’m with Coast to Coast. 

           He smiles as the camera pans up his tiny body. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        2006, Jesus Christ. 

           The scene begins.

                                 BOY ACTOR #1
                        Do you need help?

                                 READER (O.S.)
                        That’d be great, Joe, thank you. 

                                 BOY ACTOR #1
                        What should I do?

                                 READER (O.S.)
                        If you want to get the box of 
                        pinkies from the back-- I’m feeding 
                        the snakes.

                                 BOY ACTOR #1
                        Live mice?

                                 READER (O.S.)
                        They’ve been in the freezer so I 
                        don’t think they feel anything.

                                 BOY ACTOR #1
                        Cool. 

           He fake looks in a fake box.

                                 BOY ACTOR #1 (CONT’D)
                        So small.
                                 READER (O.S.)
                        They’re little babies. 

                                 BOY ACTOR #1
                        Where is their mom?

                                 READER (O.S.)
                        In the mice tank with the other 
                        grown ups. 

           She skips to the next boy.

                                 BOY ACTOR #2
                             (super slick)
                        Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Ko, 
                        I’m 5’6”, I’m 14 years old--

           Skips to the next. We see a few. None of them feel like Joe. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - X RAY ROOM-- DAY

           Elizabeth watches as Joe lines up a lot of slides of broken 
           arms. Even we can tell they’re broken. 

           It’s quiet and dark, besides the glow of the walls. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Is this a bad one?

                                 JOE
                        Pretty average. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How’d he do it?

           He checks a chart.

                                 JOE
                        Skateboarding.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ah.

                                 JOE
                        It’s usually something like that. 
                        Playing on the roof, falling from a 
                        tree. A lot of times their friends 
                        are filming it, so we sometimes add 
                        that to the report for the doctor. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Can I see?
           He shows her the file. There are pictures of a tiny boy. One 
           of him on the skateboard (a screen shot) and one of his 
           scratched up face). 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        He’s thirteen. 

           She puts her hand up to one of his on the wall. It’s so tiny 
           in comparison. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Are these true to scale?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So small. 

                                 JOE
                        I mean, skin adds a bit, but yeah. 

           She turns to face him. She stares into his eyes, neither say 
           anything for a beat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s peaceful in here.

                                 JOE
                        Very different than a movie set, I 
                        would think. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s true. It’s not very peaceful 
                        when I’m working usually. Except 
                        right before we shoot and everyone 
                        has to be very quiet and perfectly 
                        still. 

           He just smiles. He seems very comfortable in silence.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Or backstage, when the play is 
                        going on. It’s kind of like this.

                                 JOE
                        You act in plays?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sometimes. I should do it more. 
                        It’s how I started. 

                                 JOE
                        I’ve seen your show.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, god.

                                 JOE
                        It’s very intense.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ve been very lucky to have it but 
                        I wish no one ever watched it. 

                                 JOE
                        I saw one where you had to operate 
                        on an elephant.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m so embarrassed, I’m gonna go 
                        jump off the roof with those boys. 

           She covers her face sweetly with the chart. It’s easy to see 
           why she’s a movie star.

                                 JOE
                        Was it a real elephant?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Part of the time it was, yes, her 
                        name was Lola, she was very smart. 
                        And then on the table it was like a 
                        huge slab of silicone that they 
                        filled with all kinds of disgusting 
                        goo I had to get elbow-deep in.

                                 JOE
                        That’s pretty gross.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s not as romantic as one would 
                        think.

           They hold each other’s eyes for a moment too long, in the 
           silence. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for taking me to work.

                                 JOE
                        You think it helped?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I do. Because I can start to 
                        feel... what it was like. A little 
                        bit.
                                 JOE
                        What what was like?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sneaking around with you.

           It’s too dark to tell, but he is definitely blushing.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I hope you don’t mind my saying so.

                                 JOE
                        No. I don’t. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m glad.

           A beat.

                                 JOE
                        Do you think she’ll come off well? 
                        In the movie?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m gonna do my best. I want the 
                        audience to understand her. To see 
                        what had been missing in her life, 
                        and what a relief it was. To find 
                        you. 
                             (beat)
                        And I’ll smooth out any rough 
                        edges.

                                 JOE
                        Rough edges?

           Uh oh.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I just meant. Sometimes, I’ve 
                        found, she can be a little... Maybe 
                        harsh is too strong a word--

                                 JOE
                        I don’t see her that way at all.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And neither do I, that’s all I’m 
                        saying. I want America to 
                        reconsider all that they thought 
                        they knew. And how badly they 
                        treated her.
                                 JOE
                        Right.

           He puts the file in the wall pocket, opens the door, and 
           flips the little colored plastic switch on the frame.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        It’s kind of lunch time now.

           She nods and leaves.

           EXT. RHONDA’S HOUSE-- DAY

           Gracie unloads her minivan in front of Rhonda’s sweet house. 

                                 RHONDA
                        Oh isn’t that lovely.

           It’s a birthday cake for a young child. Sprinkles and spooky 
           creatures. 

                                 RHONDA (CONT’D)
                        He will love it! Look at these 
                        little werewolves!

           Gracie attempts to hide all pride. Only business.

                                 GRACIE
                        There’s the full moon in the 
                        middle. That’s lemon curd. 

                                 RHONDA
                        I love it!

                                 GRACIE
                        And here’s your weekly coffee cake.

                                 RHONDA
                        Mmm, Frank’ll be thrilled. 

           Rhonda hands her about $60 in cash.

                                 RHONDA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing now?

                                 GRACIE
                        I still have a few more deliveries. 

           Rhonda looks around the empty street, steps closer.

                                 RHONDA
                             (whisper)
                        How’s it going?
                                 GRACIE
                        Just fine!

                                 RHONDA
                        Good, good. Is she participating? 

                                 GRACIE
                        Why yes she is. 

           INT. DIVE BAR-- EARLY EVENING

           Elizabeth sits down in the corner booth of a seemingly clam 
           chowder-themed establishment. It has some sloppy, mellow live 
           music playing. 

           Across from her is MORRIS SPERBER, 60s. He’s a lawyer-- 
           criminal defense attorney. Short, sweet smile, the kind of 
           New York accent you don’t hear anymore.

                                 MORRIS
                        I must say, you evoke her. You 
                        really do. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you.

           She wipes away an old ketchup stain on her side of the table.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        What specifically?

                                 MORRIS
                        You just have a loveliness-- a 
                        brightness. It seems like there’s 
                        not an angry bone in your body. 

           She gives a big smile, but dead eyes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s very sweet.

           Elizabeth has graduated to a yellow notepad. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        So when did you meet Gracie?

                                 MORRIS
                        My wife and kids and I had just 
                        moved up from New York. I had been 
                        doing some pretty high-profile 
                        cases, defending some pretty 
                        despicable men, as it were.

                                 MORRIS (CONT'D)
                        Sharon finally had had it, she said 
                        I’m moving to Maine, feel free to 
                        come with, I said fine. It was a 
                        change of pace, and it is 
                        beautiful. 

           He waits for her to agree.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It is.

                                 MORRIS
                        Well it was funny really, because 
                        for all the rapists and murderers, 
                        blackmailers, frauds, hit men! 
                        Never did I end up on the front 
                        page of the New York Times. For 
                        Gracie, I ended up on the front 
                        page of the New York Times. Up in 
                        slow Maine. It was very funny, in 
                        that way. 

           He puts some oyster crackers in his soup. 

                                 MORRIS (CONT’D)
                        I get the call to go down to the 
                        police station. It’s right after 
                        dinner. And I walk in and sitting 
                        there in this little flowery blouse 
                        is Gracie, and I look around-- I 
                        almost thought she was another 
                        lawyer. I said, “I think I know 
                        you.” She said, “My name is Gracie 
                        Atherton, I’m your neighbor, I 
                        brought you a blueberry pound 
                        cake.” And of course it was. I had 
                        moved into a house on her very 
                        block, and she had brought us a 
                        very wonderful pound cake, a few 
                        weeks earlier. So I said, “What can 
                        I help you with?” And that’s when 
                        she told me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How did she word it exactly?

                                 MORRIS
                        She said, “I’ve been caught having 
                        an affair.” And I said, Gracie, 
                        forgive me, but that’s not illegal 
                        in this country, and if it were a 
                        lot of people would be in serious 
                        trouble. It was then that she 
                        started to cry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MORRIS (CONT'D)
                        She said, “We’re in love. I didn’t 
                        mean for it to happen, but we fell 
                        in love.” 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So she was in denial, you would 
                        say?

                                 MORRIS
                        She was... firm. Right from the 
                        beginning she didn’t feel they had 
                        done anything wrong, she was head 
                        over heels, she trusted him 
                        completely. She didn’t seem to 
                        believe she may be going to prison, 
                        she thought the judge would 
                        understand if they just explained 
                        it. It was a bit Romeo and Juliet, 
                        a bit starry-eyed.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        When did it sink in?

           He takes a sip of his cream soda.

                                 MORRIS
                        Does it seem like it’s sunk in now? 

           There’s a big crash of the drum cymbals over in the live 
           band. The LEAD SINGER is visibly drunk. 30s, blonde hair dyed 
           pastel colors, wearing a wife beater. 

                                 MORRIS (CONT’D)
                             (motioning to him)
                        Have you met Georgie yet?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s Georgie? 

                                 MORRIS
                        I had hoped things would turn out 
                        better for him, he was a very sweet 
                        boy. Very sensitive. 

           GEORGIE flings some Sprite onto his bandmate, who gets up and 
           leaves the set in the middle of covering “Landslide”.

           Georgie scoffs, and his eyes suddenly snap into focus on 
           Elizabeth and Morris. He drops the microphone and walks right 
           over to them. (His drummer is left to sing, which to his 
           credit, he does). 

                                 GEORGIE
                        Well look what the cat dragged in. 
                                 MORRIS
                        Georgie, how are you? This is 
                        Elizabeth Bryce. 

                                 GEORGIE
                        Oh I know who this is. I know 
                        perfectly well.

           He stumbles, pulls up a chair and sits on it backwards, 
           straddling. He taps his temple with his index finger, sizing 
           her up. 

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                        So how much are they paying you?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Excuse me?

                                 GEORGIE
                        Is it a lot? Are they paying her?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s an independent film... 

                                 GEORGIE
                        Turn to the side?

           She hesitates, but does it with contempt. 

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re prettier than her. 

                                 MORRIS
                        Well Georgie, we don’t mean to 
                        interrupt your set--

                                 GEORGIE
                             (to Elizabeth)
                        Look me in the eye and scream at me 
                        how selfish I am. 

           This really cracks him up. 

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                        Then I’ll tell you how close a 
                        match. 

                                 MORRIS
                        Let’s get the check.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m glad this happened, I’ve been 
                        wanting to meet you. 
                                 GEORGIE
                        Oh really.

           He twiddles his fingers. 

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                        What have you heard?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That you’re creative, and 
                        sensitive, and sweet.

                                 GEORGIE
                        They would say that wouldn’t they.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What are you then?

                                 GEORGIE
                        I’m a phoenix rising from the 
                        ashes, I’m a ghost. 

           He takes a little plastic cup of half & half and downs it 
           like a shot. And then, yuck, regrets it. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So tell me what you think I should 
                        know.

                                 GEORGIE
                        They’re both liars, and they 
                        deserve each other. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What did they lie about?

                                 GEORGIE
                        To me! They lied to me. He said, 
                        “oh I can’t sleep over,” blah blah 
                        blah. Or, “ugh, your mom’s so 
                        tough, I have to work extra at the 
                        shop.” And her! “Your friend seems 
                        a little fast, I don’t want you 
                        going to that party, I don’t want 
                        you renting Mallrats” on and on-- 
                        and why not?? It was all fake, it 
                        was just lies.

           He grabs a bottle of beer from a waitress’s tray who’s 
           passing by. Gulps some.

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, kind of still tastes like the 
                        milk from before. 
           Morris motions for Elizabeth to let it go.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you remember when you found out?

                                 GEORGIE
                        Of course I remember. Tommy sat me 
                        down in my room. And I thought he 
                        was lying to make me upset until I 
                        went and found my dad and he said 
                        it was true. He had slammed his 
                        fist down on his desk so hard that 
                        this part had split and was 
                        bleeding. 

           He stares at the fold of skin under the pinky, when 
           clenching. His eyes struggle to focus a bit. 

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                        It was right before my birthday. We 
                        forgot to cancel the party but only 
                        one guy came anyway and we just 
                        hung out in my room and ate so many 
                        warheads that I threw up, and we 
                        watched the portable TV until the 
                        sun was almost up and I gave him a 
                        handjob and then he never spoke to 
                        me again. 

           A beat where no one knows what to say. And then his band 
           suddenly starts playing Leon Russell’s “Tight Rope” (a fun, 
           upbeat-sounding song that I think is about suicide).

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh this is my favorite one, I gotta 
                        go. 

           He rushes over to the stage like a rag doll. 

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                             (shouting back at them)
                        See you around, nice to meet you! 

           He grabs the mic from his drummer and picks up singing in the 
           middle of sentence.

                                 GEORGIE (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        ---tightwire! Linked by life and 
                        the funeral pyre,
                        But the top hat on my head is all 
                        you see...
                                 MORRIS
                        Well, as you can see, the situation 
                        is not without casualties. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Strange that him and Joe are the 
                        same age. 

           Morris shrugs as he pays the bill. 

                                 MORRIS
                        A lot more people in this town feel 
                        the way that he does, than the way 
                        I do. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        From what I’ve seen, she’s pretty 
                        well-liked here. 

                                 MORRIS
                        She has a community that takes care 
                        of her. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        She seems busy with her business.

           He hesitates.

                                 MORRIS
                        You may want to check the names on 
                        those orders. It’s a handful that 
                        repeat over and over, my wife’s is 
                        one of them. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        People are just ordering things to 
                        keep her busy? 

                                 MORRIS
                        It’s a kindness. How many pineapple 
                        upside-down cakes could one family 
                        need? 

           INT. JOE’S CAR-- DUSK

           Joe sits in the front seat, about to run into the grocery 
           store. 

                                 MICHELA
                             (text)
                        Just found out I’ve got some time 
                        off later in the year, I’m trying 
                        to decide if I should go somewhere. 
                                 JOE
                        That’s exciting.

                                 MICHELA
                        Where would you go?

                                 JOE
                        I don’t even know, I haven’t gone 
                        anywhere in a long time. 

                                 MICHELA
                        I was thinking maybe Mexico, to the 
                        butterfly sanctuary in Piedra 
                        Herrada. 

           She sends a picture-- so many orange butterflies line the 
           trees that they look like fall leaves. 

                                 JOE
                        Wow, I never knew this existed. 

                                 MICHELA
                        Amazing right??

                                 JOE
                        Incredible.

           (...) and then it disappears, and then reappears a few times. 

                                 MICHELA
                        Maybe we could make a trip of it. 
                        Like a field trip. 

           He just stares at it. Then (...)

                                 MICHELA (CONT’D)
                        Finally see where all these 
                        butterflies we raise end up. 

           He still doesn’t write.

                                 MICHELA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure you’ve got your vacation 
                        days allotted for family time 
                        though. It was just an idea. 

           He puts his phone in his pocket and heads into the store. 

           INT. LAKE STREET INN BATHROOM-- DAY

           Elizabeth puts her make-up on in the mirror, her phone 
           propped up on speaker. She’s on with her boyfriend AARON, 
           30s. 
                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        So the two of them basically 
                        haven’t spoken since Nana’s 
                        funeral, and Aunt Judy has just 
                        gotten them both to agree to sit 
                        down together! 

           She’s busy with precise eyeliner. 

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, that’s great!

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        Yeah it feels like a really big day 
                        for the family. I’m so relieved. 

           She rolls her eyes really far back in her head.

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (with a smile)
                        A huge relief!

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        How much longer do you think you’ll 
                        be there?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not sure, I’m getting a lot of 
                        good work done.

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        What are you doing today?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Going to speak at the high school.

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        As you or as Gracie?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What? As me. How could I go speak 
                        as Gracie?

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        Oh I don’t know, like method 
                        acting.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. Her daughter asked me. 
                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        Well stay away from the young boys.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Excuse me?

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        Because of your character.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I get it. 

           A beat.

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        You’re starting to sound like her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t think you know what she 
                        sounds like at all.

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        Only what you’ve told me.

           She mutes her side and screams towards it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well maybe I haven’t given you a 
                        minute-to-minute report because it 
                        wouldn’t really mean much to you 
                        anyway because you’re a fucking 
                        podiatrist!

           Un-mutes.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        No, you’re right, I’m sorry, I 
                        think I’m just really in it right 
                        now.

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        Totally. I know how that can be.

           She makes a ridiculous face.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL-- DAY

           In slow motion, Elizabeth walks down the crowded hallway of 
           lockers. It’s in between classes and there’s a lot of 
           movement. 
           The kids look so young. 

           Elizabeth locks eyes with a CONFIDENT FRESHMAN BOY as he 
           jumps to tap the door frame to impress her. 

           She gives him a little nod like she is impressed. 

           INT. BLACK BOX THEATER-- A BIT LATER

           Elizabeth sits on a painted black cube next to drama teacher 
           MS. LABRIOLA, 40s, severe bob, chip on her shoulder. A co-ed 
           class of about twenty (including Mary) sit in the stands.

                                 MS. LABRIOLA
                        This is the first time in my 
                        experience, I’ve worked here twenty 
                        years, that a Juilliard-educated 
                        actor has sat in this theater. It’s 
                        an incredible opportunity-- 
                        Cameron, quit it.

           A kid named CAMERON stops fucking around. 

                                 MS. LABRIOLA (CONT’D)
                        Ask questions. 

           A DOPEY BOY, 16, raises his hand.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes.

                                 DOPEY BOY
                        Have you acted in sex scenes?

                                 MS. LABRIOLA
                        You’re staying late.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, I have. 

                                 MS. LABRIOLA
                        You don’t have to--

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, it’s fine. I have, and it is a 
                        strange part of acting. 

                                 DOPEY BOY
                        Like what?

           His friends giggle. She really thinks about it.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        It can vary. Sometimes it’s really 
                        mechanical, choreographed like a 
                        dance, where the only thing you can 
                        really think about is where you’re 
                        supposed to be and when. And other 
                        times I’ve gone into kind of a 
                        fugue state. I forget where I am, I 
                        forget that I’m an actor, I forget 
                        that I’m a person, really. Just 
                        repetitive, hypnotic energy. 

           The boys have stopped giggling. A BLONDE GIRL raises her 
           hand.

                                 BLONDE GIRL
                        How did you become famous?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, I’m not that famous. Like, 
                        internationally my name doesn’t 
                        mean that much, but, hmmm. Well I 
                        trained, I learned a lot about 
                        myself and others. And I got a job 
                        right out of school. I think that’s 
                        the unfair part, how much is 
                        chance. I think because I was 
                        pretty and went to Juilliard it was 
                        easier for me to get that first 
                        pilot. And then once you get one, 
                        it’s easier to get the next, work 
                        begets work. And I’ve seen it now 
                        happen over and over with the young 
                        pretty girl from Juilliard, or 
                        Yale, or some interesting movie 
                        star’s daughter, or even a writer’s 
                        daughter. Just a short cut. “Who is 
                        that?” “Oh she’s x, y, z.” Even you 
                        Mary, “Oh she’s Gracie Atherton-
                        Yu’s daughter” that would be enough 
                        to get your in some doors, but 
                        you’d have to be really careful. 
                        You’re not starting necessarily at 
                        a fresh clean slate, there’s more 
                        notoriety, you’d have to 
                        overcompensate by making only 
                        classy choices-- good directors, 
                        FX, HBO, A24-- you know what I 
                        mean? 

                                 DOPEY BOY
                        ...What’s a pilot? 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s the first episode of a TV show 
                        that they usually don’t air.

                                 DOPEY BOY
                        Why?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        They like make the show to see if 
                        it works. 

                                 DOPEY BOY
                        Why can’t they just read the script 
                        and imagine it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not sure.

                                 MARY
                        How do you choose your roles?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        When I have the choice, I want to 
                        play characters who are complex. 

                                 MARY
                        Do you always like them?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. 

           INT. KITCHEN-- AFTERNOON

           Gracie is in the middle of baking as the front door shuts 
           loudly. 

           The spaniels bark really loudly as they enter but then settle 
           down.

           Mary clomps up the stairs, Elizabeth enters the kitchen, puts 
           her purse down. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hello.

                                 GRACIE
                        How was it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I think it went well.

           Mary’s door SLAMS from above.
                                 GRACIE
                        Great.
                             (beat)
                        Why don’t you give me a hand?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’d love to. 

           She throws her an apron.

                                 GRACIE
                        Do you bake?

           She grimaces.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, go get a stick of butter from 
                        the fridge. 

           She does.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Now heat up a cup of sugar over 
                        medium in that thick pot, yes that 
                        one. Stir it with that red spatula. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Just dry sugar?

                                 GRACIE
                             (almost concerned)
                        It’ll melt. 

           It starts to.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Just keep stirring. 

           It turn into an amber liquid.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Ok this all happens quickly. 

           She hands her a whisk. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Put the butter in and whisk 
                        constantly.

           They both peer over the pot to see caramel starting to form 
           and bubble.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wow. 
           Gracie pours in some cream by sight. Elizabeth whisking 
           furiously.

                                 GRACIE
                        It’s temperamental. You have to 
                        keep an eye on it every second or 
                        you could ruin it. 

           She adds a pinch of salt.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Alright now pour it into this pan.

           Elizabeth grabs for the hot handles.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Fuck!

                                 GRACIE
                        Well, use the mitts...

           She does. Gracie scraps out every last bit. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Now line these up, and really do it 
                        nicely, it matters how it looks.

           Elizabeth places dark red cherries in the caramel. Gracie 
           mixes a batter and looks over Elizabeth’s shoulder.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s very nice.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you. 

           They work in silence for a bit, side by side.

                                 GRACIE
                        This is my brother Bill’s favorite 
                        cake. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Is it for him?

                                 GRACIE
                        No, he’s in Minneapolis. He works 
                        for the Twins.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Which twins?

                                 GRACIE
                        It’s a professional baseball team.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh. Of course. 

                                 GRACIE
                        He played Varsity, and then college 
                        ball and now he’s the assistant 
                        pitching coach.

           Elizabeth keeps lining up cherries.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s pretty great.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wonderful. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Growing up he was always really 
                        protective of me, even though he 
                        was younger. He was so big, in 
                        stature. Any boys that got near me 
                        he’d throw up against the locker 
                        and say, “What are your 
                        intentions!” 

           She laughs about this, lovingly. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What were their intentions?

           Gracie gives her a side-eyed glance. She pours the batter in 
           pan over the cherries.

                                 GRACIE
                        This way, once it’s baked we flip 
                        it and the caramel and cherries are 
                        on top. That’s why they call it an 
                        upside-down cake. 

           Elizabeth watches her put the cake in the oven. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        You know Joe’s slept with more 
                        women than I have men. 

           Elizabeth tidies up, tries not to look her in the eye, tries 
           not to spook her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Is that right?

                                 GRACIE
                        Nobody really seems to remember 
                        that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACIE (CONT'D)
                        But I had only slept with Tom 
                        before Joe. He had slept with two 
                        or three girls before me. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        When he was in seventh grade?

                                 GRACIE
                        Yes.

           She mixes frosting for something else.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        He lead a very different kind of 
                        life than I did. I was very 
                        sheltered. My father had a lot of 
                        rules. And there were a lot of 
                        consequences for not obeying them. 
                        Joe, he had a lot of responsibility 
                        put on him very young. The oldest. 
                        He grew up fast. 

           She holds out a spoon of light blue frosting.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Does this look too blue? I don’t 
                        like it when it looks artificial.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s a... subtle blue.

                                 GRACIE
                        For the Aaberg’s baby shower. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How nice. 

                                 GRACIE
                        I wanted to show you something. 

           She hands her a poem, written by a child. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Joe gave that to me, back then. I 
                        just think it’s lovely. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        “Peace is sitting by a lake in the 
                        summertime,                              
                        Peace is a Coca Cola on a hot 
                        summer day,                           
                        Peace is being with you.”
                                 GRACIE
                        The assignment was “What is peace?”

           INT. DEN-- AFTERNOON

           Joe, home from work and in casual clothes, watches more “This 
           Old House” on PBS. 

           The curtains are drawn but room has that warm, sickly 
           afternoon glow. 

           On screen, TOMMY SILVA instructs a HOMEOWNER as she caulks 
           her bathroom tile. 

                                 TOMMY SILVA
                        Push it in there, there you go, put 
                        your hand closer to the tip, keep 
                        the gun level...

           The woman’s hands move slowly along her bathtub, the sexual 
           connotations obvious (though not to Tommy, completely 
           innocent on his part, all my respect to Tommy Silva). 

           Joe seems hypnotized be the caulking. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Knock-knock.

           Gracie and Elizabeth poke their heads into the den. It does 
           oddly look like he’s seeing double.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Sweetie, I was hoping you could 
                        clear your bugs out before Honor 
                        comes home tomorrow. And then pick 
                        up dinner, I’m swamped. 

                                 JOE
                        Sure. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I can help. 

                                 JOE
                        Sounds good. 

                                 TOMMY SILVA (O.S.)
                        Now that’s a caulking that will 
                        stand the test of time. 
           INT. DINING NOOK-- A BIT LATER

           Joe and Elizabeth stare into the mesh cages. His caterpillars 
           have gotten even plumper, wiggling around eating leaves.

                                 JOE
                        They’re hungry this year. 

           He starts to carefully prepare them for a move into the den.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How long have you been doing this?

                                 JOE
                        Four years I think. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What started it?

                                 JOE
                        I saw an article on Facebook about 
                        how the Monarch butterfly 
                        population is dwindling 
                        dramatically, and they mentioned 
                        that people help raise them. I’m 
                        not the only who does this-- Gracie 
                        makes it seem that way, but all 
                        over the country people are doing 
                        this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you send away for a kit or 
                        something?

                                 JOE
                        No you just keep your eyes open. 
                        Look for the eggs, take them inside 
                        and protect them, so they have a 
                        chance to grow. 

           On this subject Joe lights up in a way we haven’t seen 
           before.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        We’ve actually made a significant 
                        impact, the numbers are up by the 
                        thousands.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Who’s we?
                                 JOE
                        People like me. I’m part of a 
                        Facebook group... I don’t know, 
                        that sounds dorky when I say that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Not at all.

                                 JOE
                        It’s really active. We have almost 
                        ten thousand members. 
                             (beat)
                        My friend Michela, from the group, 
                        she’s in Pittsburgh, she actually 
                        told me to put these little wooden 
                        sticks inside. They sort of act as 
                        ladders, to help them along. 

           Elizabeth nods.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I know it’s boring.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, I think it’s amazing. 

           Joe blushes, as he takes the cages to the next room. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD-- A BIT LATER

           Late afternoon, the sun still bright. Joe and Elizabeth take 
           a walk through the neighborhood. Tall, old trees everywhere. 
           Flowers, blue sky. Historic houses. Basically no one on the 
           road. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This is a beautiful place to live. 

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, it’s been really nice.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you think you’ll stay here 
                        forever?

                                 JOE
                        I’m not sure. It’s the only place 
                        I’ve ever lived.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Have you traveled?
                                 JOE
                        I’ve been to Boston, I’ve been to 
                        Portland... Other places in Maine. 
                        My sisters live more inland. And 
                        Gracie was in Warren, at the 
                        prison. 

           He picks a leaf off a tree and tears it up, absentmindedly. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to visit other places. 
                        Korea, Mexico... 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I went to Japan last year, it was 
                        gorgeous. 

           He nods. 

                                 JOE
                        Where are you from?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Right outside San Francisco. It’s 
                        very pretty like this, but bigger. 
                        Not as much shrimp. 

                                 JOE
                        Right.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And then I lived in New York for 
                        five years, and I’ve been in LA 
                        since then. Except for some movies 
                        on location for little chunks at a 
                        time. 

           They walk along in agreeable silence.

                                 JOE
                        What do you think of all this? Of 
                        us. It’s hard to tell exactly.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m trying to approach this without 
                        judgement. My only obligation is to 
                        see and interpret what I believe to 
                        be true. 

                                 JOE
                        And what’s true?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I think you have a nice family. I 
                        think you’re both interesting 
                        people. 

                                 JOE
                        What else?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I think that even if I can 
                        understand her motivations, and her 
                        perspective at the time... what she 
                        did was wrong. 

                                 JOE
                        How can you say that?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You were really little.

           He doesn’t seem upset, just tired.

                                 JOE
                        It’s different in my memory. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah.

                                 JOE
                        I was a lot older than the kids 
                        around me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m sure you were. 

                                 JOE
                        And I wanted it. 

           That kind of just hangs there.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah... I guess, just as your 
                        friend, I would hope that you’ve 
                        dealt with it. With the past. If 
                        everything is great now, you’re 
                        happy where you are, then that’s 
                        all that matters. Mary’s great, 
                        Honor seems to be thriving. I just 
                        know from my own past how things 
                        have a way of bubbling up. 

                                 JOE
                        I guess. I don’t know. 
           A tight, barely passable smile.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Oh you may want to see this. 

           EXT. SWIMMING HOLE-- CONTINUOUS

           Joe and Elizabeth trek through old trees to reveal a 
           beautiful, natural swimming hole with clear water. Surrounded 
           by plants and smooth rocks to sit on. A heaven. The sun 
           streams in a lovely way. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Holy shit. Is it safe?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, kids swim in it all the time. 

           She touches the water.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Should we dip our feet in?

                                 JOE
                        Sure. 

           They giggle as they take their shoes off at how cute and dumb 
           it all is. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I love it here. 

                                 JOE
                        I do too. 
                             (beat)
                        Gracie and I used to come here 
                        sometimes that first summer. 

           Elizabeth looks around and seems to mentally note all the 
           places where one could have sex. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t blame you. 

           She leans back, basking and stretching.

                                 JOE
                        What did you mean before, about her 
                        motivations? 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I guess the way I see it, she 
                        wasn’t getting what she needed at 
                        home, she saw something she wanted, 
                        so... she took it. 

           He looks at her, she’s almost completely silhouetted by the 
           sun. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You were both at a really sexually 
                        heightened phases in life. 

                                 JOE
                        Is that right?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Women reach their sexual peak at 
                        thirty-six. Did you really not know 
                        that?

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I found that out in a People 
                        Magazine from 1997, but I looked it 
                        up to confirm.

                                 JOE
                        Does it feel true?

           She considers it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah.

           They stare at each other, an energy between them.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I just mean that I 
                        understand some of it. It’s fun to 
                        have a secret.

                                 JOE
                        Do you have secrets?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, I have a secret. 

                                 JOE
                        What is it?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I can’t tell you, or else it 
                        wouldn’t be one, would it? 

           She kicks a bit of water in his direction.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah. 

           INT. ATHERTON-YU HOUSE-- DUSK

           Joe comes back into the house as the sun setting and can 
           immediately tell something is amiss. All the lights are off. 
           It’s silent. 

           He drops his head like, “fuck.”

           INT. ATHERTON-YU BEDROOM-- A BIT LATER

           From the doorway Joe can see Gracie silently weeping, laying 
           flat on the bed. The last light from the window making the 
           room feel pale blue. 

                                 JOE
                        What happened?

           Silent weeping, stillness. Finally some sniffling, words 
           caught in her throat.

                                 GRACIE
                        Joyce Mercer called and cancelled 
                        her order, and all future orders. 

           He lets out an almost undetectable sigh of relief, sits on 
           the bed.

                                 JOE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 GRACIE
                        And I told her I had already made 
                        it (!) and she said she’d pay for 
                        this one but that she didn’t need 
                        it, and they were leaving town. 

                                 JOE
                        Where are they going?
                                 GRACIE
                        To visit her sick Aunt or something-
                        - it doesn’t matter! I wasted hours 
                        that I could have used, and I just 
                        feel stupid. 

                                 JOE
                        You couldn’t have known.

                                 GRACIE
                        I know but... She had called me 
                        yesterday and I didn’t call her 
                        back. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s okay.

                                 GRACIE
                        I just hate making mistakes.

                                 JOE
                        I know.

                                 GRACIE
                        And now I have this cake that’ll go 
                        right in the garbage.

                                 JOE
                        You don’t have to throw the cake in 
                        the garbage.

           She starts to slow down. Turns her head to face him but is 
           still lying down. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Where were you?

                                 JOE
                        Oh I just took a walk, showed 
                        Elizabeth the neighborhood.

                                 GRACIE
                        Elizabeth.

           He treads very carefully. Starts folding the clothes that 
           Gracie shed on her way to the bed.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        She’s getting on my last nerve.

                                 JOE
                        Why?
                                 GRACIE
                        She’s just everywhere I look. And 
                        for what?

                                 JOE
                        I don’t know. She’ll be gone soon.

           She examines his face for something, but doesn’t find it. She 
           gives a last sob, wipes her tears, sits up. She looks so 
           tiny.

                                 GRACIE
                        So do you want the cake?

           INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT

           Gracie presents her cake to Joe. It’s pretty sizable, three 
           layers. Covered in frosting with mounds of shredded coconut.

           She cuts him a big piece and smiles at him, expectantly.

           He smiles back. He takes a big bite as she watches, chin on 
           her hands. 

                                 JOE
                        Mmmm, so good.

                                 GRACIE
                        There’s a layer of butterscotch 
                        cream inside.

                                 JOE
                        I can definitely taste that.

           It looks very sweet. They sit in silence as he chews and she 
           watches.

           INT. LAKE STREET INN-- MORNING

           Roberto, Italian film director, is on the phone with 
           Elizabeth, who is distracted and happens to be looking up the 
           Sex Offender Registry for Maine. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m telling you, it’s going great, 
                        I think I’ll have all I’ll need by 
                        next week.

                                 ROBERTO (V.O.)
                        I’m very happy to hear this, but 
                        you’re already over the amount of 
                        days that we budgeted for.
                                 ELIZABETH
                             (with a smile)
                        Well it sounds like the crew wrap 
                        sweatshirts have just turned to 
                        crew wrap mugs, doesn’t it? 

           They both laugh. She takes a few puffs of her inhaler. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I know you trust me, and I’m 
                        confident that all of this is going 
                        to enrich my performance, my sense 
                        memories, my physicality--

           She finds Gracie’s registry photo-- it looks like the ID for 
           a country club. A big, toothy, confident smile and a bow in 
           her hair.

                                 ROBERTO (V.O.)
                        Ok, ok. I’ll tell Carlo. Now, did 
                        you watch the “Joe” tapes? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I did.

                                 ROBERTO (V.O.)
                        Wonderful.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Look, I’m sure they’ve seen a lot 
                        of people, but have they covered 
                        New York? Chicago? The kids I saw 
                        were cute, but they just weren’t 
                        like, sexy enough. He has this 
                        certain quiet confidence, or 
                        something. 

           A pause on the line.

                                 ROBERTO (V.O.)
                        I think... you need to come home. 

           EXT. AIRPORT-- DAY

           HONOR ATHERTON-YU, 22, runs up to the car with her rolly 
           suitcase. She has bleached hair, looks like she just pulled a 
           few all-nighters.

           Mary bounds out of the car to hug her. 

           Joe looks on so happily as he loads her suitcases. 

           She hugs him.
                                 JOE
                        I’ve missed you.

                                 HONOR
                        I’ve missed you too.

           INT. JOE’S CAR-- A BIT LATER

           They have a beautiful drive through town and to their house. 
           The girls sit together in the backseat as Joe drives. 

                                 JOE
                        How’s the roommate?

                                 HONOR
                        She’s fine, we got over it.

                                 JOE
                        I knew you would.

                                 HONOR
                        How’s mom?

                                 JOE
                        Great. Busy.

           Mary rolls her eyes and looks out the window. The girls hold 
           hands gently. 

           Mary starts to trace letters on the back of Honor’s hand. A 
           secret way to communicate. T-H-E, a gentle pat for a space. A-
           C-T-R-E-S-S, space, I-S, space, A-N, space, A-S-S-H-O-- Honor 
           starts to laugh and nod like she gets it.

           Joe watches them from the rearview mirror but doesn’t have a 
           guess. 

           INT. SEAFARER’S-- DUSK

           Gracie, Joe, Honor, Mary and Elizabeth sit at a the corner 
           table of an upscale seafood restaurant. Outside the window is 
           the bay. It’s a busy night. 

           In front of each of them sits a giant, bright red lobster. 
           Side dishes of melted butter, rolls. The girls have Shirley 
           Temples, Joe has a beer, Gracie white wine, Elizabeth water. 
           They hold their glasses up, mid-toast.
                                 GRACIE
                        I am so glad that Honor was done 
                        with her finals in time to come 
                        watch our little Mary walk across 
                        that stage tomorrow. I couldn’t be 
                        prouder of the both of you. And to 
                        Joe.

           She gives him a big (maybe a little theatrical) warm smile.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        The love of my life. To entering 
                        this next phase of our life 
                        together. But as our little girls 
                        fly away from the nest, they know 
                        they can always come home. 

           They all click glasses, and start cracking into the lobster.

           Elizabeth struggles a bit. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How’s my technique?

                                 HONOR
                        You don’t eat lobster in Hollywood?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s a rare treat. And never have I 
                        seen ones this big, my goodness.

                                 GRACIE
                        Crack its claw like this-- there 
                        you go.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Delicious. 

           They eat (in a calm manner) but don’t talk to each other.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I read that lobster used to be food 
                        for the poor before it became a 
                        delicacy.

                                 GRACIE
                        Is that right?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        There was such an overabundance, 
                        they fed them to prisoners. 

           She seems to have realized what she said right as the word 
           left her lips.
                                 GRACIE
                             (smiling)
                        How interesting.

           Elizabeth nods. Becomes quiet. Slowly, she starts to copy 
           Gracie’s movements. Posture.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Honor, when we get back home I’ll 
                        show you what your dad and I got 
                        Mary for graduation.

                                 HONOR
                        Is it a scale?

                                 GRACIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 HONOR
                        When I went to college you bought 
                        me a scale.

           Gracie’s ears pull back in her head.

                                 GRACIE
                        That was just part of setting you 
                        up at your school, you know 
                        perfectly well that wasn’t your 
                        graduation present. 

                                 HONOR
                        Well it came wrapped with a bow.

                                 GRACIE
                        We got her a necklace! With her 
                        birthstone on it, just like we got 
                        you, although I see you’re not 
                        wearing it.

           Honor sucks her teeth. 

           Gracie eyes Elizabeth.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Is this you trying to sit like me?

           Completely caught.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What? No. I just--

                                 GRACIE
                        How long does this usually take? 
                        This method acting.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s not really what method 
                        acting is--

                                 GRACIE
                        And you. I got you that scale, like 
                        I told you at the time, as a 
                        tradition, because that’s what my 
                        mother gave to me when I graduated 
                        high school. And try going through 
                        life without a scale!

           An indignant scoff.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        See how that goes.

                                 WAITRESS
                        How are we doing?

           They all say, “Great, thank you so much” in a scattered 
           chorus. 

           INT. LADIES ROOM-- LATER

           Elizabeth comes out of the stall to find Gracie washing her 
           hands. She goes to the next sink.

           The bathroom has a very distinct color scheme and odd, formal 
           touches. 

                                 GRACIE
                        My brother, Mark, he still lives in 
                        Richmond. He always says to keep 
                        your expectations low and that way 
                        you’ll never be disappointed. I 
                        always forget that. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (with disdain)
                        How many brothers do you have? 

                                 GRACIE
                        Four. Two younger, two older. 

           Elizabeth dries her hands.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So what were your expectations? 
                                 GRACIE
                        That tonight would go well. That my 
                        children would love me, that my 
                        life would be perfect. 

           She pops open her lipstick and applies it in the mirror, 
           emotionless. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s a little naive. 

                                 GRACIE
                        I am naive. Always have been. In 
                        some ways, it’s been a gift. 

           She smacks her lips together.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        When you started the affair, do you 
                        really mean to tell me you didn’t 
                        know what would happen? 

                                 GRACIE
                        I knew I wasn’t supposed to because 
                        of my husband. His age didn’t 
                        factor into it. 

           She plops her things in her little purse and turns to leave.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Our house is closer than the inn, 
                        he’ll drop us off and then swing 
                        back around for you. 

           The door closes behind her.  

           INT. JOE’S CAR-- NIGHT

           Joe drives the empty streets with Elizabeth in the front. 
           Elizabeth coughs.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I think she’s had enough of my 
                        being here.

                                 JOE
                        Maybe.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t blame her, I guess.

           More coughing.
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, the air feels different here. 

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, it’s clean.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sometimes I think it’s the 
                        different pollen, or something.

                                 JOE
                        Are you asthmatic?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah.

           She takes out her inhaler and puffs.

                                 JOE
                        My little sister is too.

           She tips her inhaler to him like a top hat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s been bad today.

                                 JOE
                        Do you have a nebulizer up there? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You really do know about asthma. 
                        Yeah I think I’m gonna do that now 
                        actually. 

           He pulls up to the Inn. A big tree hangs overhead. It’s very 
           end-of-the-date. 

                                 JOE
                        Do you need help?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you mind?

                                 JOE
                        No, not at all. 

           INT. LAKE STREET INN-- A BIT LATER

           Joe enters Elizabeth’s room stiffly. She immediately goes to 
           set up her asthma breathing machine (rinsing tubes, getting 
           out little plastic vials of liquid).
                                 JOE
                        This is a nice room.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Isn’t it? 

           They sit together on the floor. She drops the chemicals in 
           and turns the machine on. It hums loudly and a chemical steam 
           starts to come out the little mouthpiece, which she inhales. 
           Her words are a bit muffled.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        This is funny. You’re one of very 
                        few people I’ve nebulized in front 
                        of. 

                                 JOE
                        They haven’t changed this machine 
                        since the 80’s. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know. Thank you for helping me, I 
                        get a little shaky afterwards.

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (taking away mouthpiece)
                        I get a little shaky usually.

                                 JOE
                        Oh, yeah, of course. My sister had 
                        this so bad, thankfully she’s 
                        mainly grown out of it. But I 
                        remember when she was really little 
                        she’d sometimes wake me up in the 
                        middle of the night she would be 
                        wheezing so much, it sounded like a 
                        duck or something. It was scary.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Where were your parents?

                                 JOE
                        They usually woke up before the sun 
                        came up and would be working. I got 
                        my sisters and I ready for school 
                        most days. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How old were you?

           He sighs, thinking about it.
                                 JOE
                        Maybe nine? Something like that. 
                        And they were six and four. That 
                        sounds right. 

           She takes the mouthpiece away, chemical vapor pours out of 
           her mouth like smoke.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’ve always had so many 
                        responsibilities.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah. But it’s okay.

           She puts her hand on his and keeps breathing. He stares at 
           her.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to give you something. 

           He hands her a tattered letter in a pink envelope. Several 
           handwritten pages in feminine cursive. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        It’s the only one I could save.

           We can see bits of it:

           “My love...”

           “I think about you all the time...”

           “Please burn this, you know what could happen to me...”

           “I think I’ve lost track of where the line is...”

                                 ELIZABETH
                        She knew what she was doing was 
                        wrong. 

           He chews on his thumb. 

           She turns the machine off. It’s suddenly so quiet. She gets 
           closer to him. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You are so young. Believe me. You 
                        could start over. 

                                 JOE
                        If I left she would fall apart.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        You can’t give everything to her. 
                        She’s taken a lot already.

           She holds his hands in hers.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        And honestly, she’ll find someone 
                        to do keep her pieces in place, 
                        people like that always do. 

                                 JOE
                        What am I supposed to do? Where 
                        would I even go?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You can go anywhere. 

                                 JOE
                        You don’t know what it’s like. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Some of my friends are just now 
                        deciding what they want to do. 

                                 JOE
                        But the people you’re around... 
                        It’s just different. You’re so much 
                        more together, you have 
                        opportunities. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Me? I’m a mess.

                                 JOE
                        You seem... Perfect. 

           She laughs. Holds up her shaking hands from the Albuterol.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not.

                                 JOE
                        You’re a movie star.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ugh, barely.

                                 JOE
                        You’re beautiful, you’re talented. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re really kind to say those 
                        things. 
                                 JOE
                        How do you not see that?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I feel like... I keep trying to 
                        build a house on quicksand. And 
                        even though I know it’ll sink, you 
                        think, well one of these days all 
                        the houses will have stacked up on 
                        top of each other and hit the 
                        bottom. Then, maybe. 

           Without warning, he kisses her. They look at each other and 
           she kisses him back. 

           She leans onto the floor as he climbs on top of her. It’s 
           hurried and passionate. 

           Her position mimics the one on the pet shop stockroom stairs.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Wait, once second.

           She grabs a condom from her suitcase on the floor next to 
           them. 

           They fumble with it.

                                 JOE
                        I’ve never actually used one of 
                        these before.

           She laughs, but then a second later when his head is buried 
           in her hair she makes an expression like, “what the fuck.”

           It doesn’t last long but there’s force. The tension between 
           them finally breaking. If she’s acting we can’t tell. 

           He gets up and goes to the bathroom. Not embarrassed, not 
           cold. 

           Once out of sight she scrambles to get her notebook, quickly 
           writes: 

           Loving, eye contact. Solid, strong. Smells like black pepper--

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Should we get in the bed?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s a great idea.

           She slides the book aside and gets into bed with him. Lies 
           her head on his bare chest.
                                 JOE
                        That was crazy. 

           She traces her fingers over his skin. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know. 

                                 JOE
                        How’s your breathing?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s good, thank you. 

           The trees outside the window sway in a comforting way. 

                                 JOE
                        How much longer do you think you’ll 
                        stay?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Probably just until Sunday. I’ve 
                        been pushing it. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh. Then were do you go?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ll go back to LA for a few weeks, 
                        and then we shoot this in Atlanta, 
                        yuck, and then I’ve got a little 
                        time before my show goes back in 
                        Vancouver. Thinking I may go 
                        somewhere with my boyfriend. 

                                 JOE
                        You have a boyfriend?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. You have a wife.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, I know. 

           He picks at his nail.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Where do you think you’ll go?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not sure, maybe Portugal. Maybe 
                        South Korea, actually. My friend’s 
                        been working at a design studio 
                        there.
                                 JOE
                        Wow.

           He seems to be sinking, where she is perfectly at ease.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You know, if you do decide to leave 
                        Gracie, it would kind of be smart 
                        to wait until a time where it would 
                        really resonate.

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Like right before the movie comes 
                        out, or if it premieres at a 
                        festival. Like you could time it 
                        with something. 

           He sits up suddenly, she falls off his chest in the process.

                                 JOE
                        I can’t tell if you’re joking.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jesus, it was just a thought, you 
                        don’t have to get to hysterical. 

                                 JOE
                        Do you even like me?

           She rolls her eyes big time.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Calm down. 

           She gets a vape pen from her side table. 

                                 JOE
                        What kind of asthmatic are you?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s just CBD, it’s fine. 

                                 JOE
                        I feel like I don’t know you all of 
                        a sudden.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I mean... you don’t...? But it’s 
                        okay. Really. Everything’s fine.
                                 JOE
                        Why did I do this?

           He sits on the edge of the bed, stares at the nebulizer on 
           the floor. She crawls up next to him, puts her lovely 
           manicured hand on his leg. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        If you want my honest opinion, I 
                        think you’re trying to blow up your 
                        life.

                                 JOE
                        I’m not. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And I don’t think anyone would 
                        blame you. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s a rotten thing to say. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s true. She’s a lot, and she 
                        took advantage of you, and she’s 
                        still taking advantage of you.

                                 JOE
                        Stop!

           She stacks her pillows to a sitting position. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Alright, you know what? Go play 
                        with your bugs.

           “Your bugs.” He just stares at her as she takes out her phone 
           and scrolls. 

           He dresses quickly. 

                                 JOE
                        I thought you were very different 
                        from this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, well, I’m an actress. 

           He leaves. The pink envelope with the letter inside still 
           sits on floor. 
           INT. ATHERTON-YU BEDROOM-- LATER

           It’s the middle of the night. Joe has showered and is sitting 
           in the rocking chair of their dark room, watching Gracie 
           sleep. 

           She’s lying on her back, occasionally wincing from some 
           dream. 

           Suddenly she snorts awake. Sees him in the corner.

                                 GRACIE
                        You’re lucky I’m not jumpy. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 GRACIE
                        What happened?

           She turns the lamp on.

                                 JOE
                        I’ve just been thinking. 

           She adjusts her pillows and sits up in bed, the same as 
           Elizabeth earlier. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Okay.

                                 JOE
                        I think there are a lot of things 
                        that we haven’t talked about in a 
                        long time. Maybe ever.

                                 GRACIE
                        What kind of things?

                                 JOE
                        Things about our relationship. How 
                        it started. 

           Gracie starts to tense up.

                                 GRACIE
                        Well I’m not gonna cross examine 
                        you, say what you want to say.

                                 JOE
                        I’ve just been remembering things, 
                        feeling strange, and creeped out. 

           He’s struggling for composure. 
                                 GRACIE
                        What brought this on? 

                                 JOE
                        What does it matter?

                                 GRACIE
                        Is it the actress? Did she say 
                        something? 

                                 JOE
                        No. I don’t see what difference it 
                        makes, it’s how I’m feeling. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Come sit by me.

           He does. On the edge of the bed as she’s still inside it. She 
           rubs his back. It’s very “Mom I had a bad dream.” 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Now what’s making you feel creeped 
                        out?

                                 JOE
                        Just, that what if... What if I 
                        wasn’t ready to be making any of 
                        those decisions and I’ve just stuck 
                        to them because of the girls, and 
                        because I was too... scared, of 
                        what it would mean if I didn’t.

                                 GRACIE
                        I don’t understand what you’re 
                        saying. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m saying what if I was too young. 

           She sits up straight.

                                 GRACIE
                        You seduced me. 

           He just stares at her. Her formal nightgown, her sleeping 
           headband. 

                                 JOE
                        I was thirteen years old. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Don’t give me that.
                                 JOE
                        But I was. 

                                 GRACIE
                        You weren’t a typical thirteen year 
                        old, you know that.

                                 JOE
                        Maybe not, but...

           He shakes his head, confused, trying to work it all out. She 
           rubs his back again.

                                 GRACIE
                             (soothing)
                        I think because of this movie, it’s 
                        drudging up old stuff, you’re 
                        hearing voices that aren’t yours 
                        and it’s feeling confusing.

                                 JOE
                        It’s not that! It’s not about the 
                        fucking movie. 

           She whips her arms away and crosses them.

                                 GRACIE
                        Language. 

                                 JOE
                        I am your husband, we are in our 
                        bedroom, I am allowed to curse in 
                        here.

                                 GRACIE
                        Oh really. You know I’ve been very 
                        sympathetic but you’re starting to 
                        upset me.

                                 JOE
                        You have not been sympathetic. Not 
                        for a second. You’re not listening 
                        to me, you’re not understanding. 
                        Why can’t we talk about it? If 
                        we’re really as in love as we say, 
                        if we have that... rare connection-- 
                        shouldn’t I be able to talk about 
                        this with you? 

                                 GRACIE
                        “If we’re really as in love as we 
                        say”?
                                 JOE
                        You know what I mean! Gracie. I’m 
                        begging you. I’m feeling lost. I 
                        need you to help me. Please. 

           Her arms stay firmly crossed and she looks past him at the 
           wall.

                                 GRACIE
                        “If we’re really as in love as we 
                        say”...

           Shaking her head. He holds out for a moment but then gives 
           up, hunches over. Looks to the floor. 

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking a shower. 

           She brushes past him, but pauses at the bathroom door.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        And on Graduation. 

           She leaves. He lies down in their bed with his clothes on. 
           Sick. 

           INT. LAKE STREET INN-- NIGHT

           Elizabeth looks at herself deeply in the mirror. She seems 
           different. The pink envelope and letter sit on the chest in 
           front of her, already read. 

           Her voice has changed, her rhythm. The look in her eye. 

           She feels like Gracie. Not a cutesy impression, but something 
           real, almost as if channeling. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        My love. After you left tonight I 
                        thought about the kind of life we 
                        could have if things were 
                        different. If I had been born 
                        later, or you long ago. But who 
                        knows what we’d be like then, or 
                        where? Or what tragedies we’d have 
                        had to faced, or what bad luck 
                        along the way. This isn’t ever what 
                        I would have wanted, but I’m so 
                        grateful that our paths have lead 
                        us to this road, no matter what the 
                        cost. I think about you all the 
                        time. And the feeling that I get 
                        when we look each other in the eye. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        Do you feel that too? I know that 
                        you don’t have much to compare it 
                        to (except those girls at your 
                        cousin’s barbecue haha) but let me 
                        assure you that it’s rare. I’ve 
                        gone my whole life without it, and 
                        now that I’ve found it, I can’t 
                        imagine going back. And pretending. 
                        Sometimes I wish we hadn’t met. Or, 
                        you hadn’t gotten a job at the pet 
                        shop at least. Because I know that 
                        our lives will be forever changed 
                        because of this, no matter how it 
                        turns out. I know that my husband 
                        and my children, oh God... This 
                        will affect them too. My hope is 
                        that we can keep our secrets until 
                        at least there’s no danger from the 
                        law. Maybe by then I’ll have enough 
                        time to end things cleanly, and 
                        make sure my children know that I 
                        love them. Maybe by then we’ll have 
                        figured out what to say. When this 
                        first started, I didn’t know what 
                        to think. I knew we had crossed a 
                        line, and I felt in my heart we 
                        would cross it again. But now, I 
                        think I’ve lost track of where the 
                        line is. Who even draws these 
                        lines? All I know is that I love 
                        you, and you love me. And you gave 
                        me so much pleasure tonight. I hope 
                        I did the same for you. I’ll see 
                        you on Saturday. Please burn this, 
                        you know what could happen to me if 
                        it were ever found. Good luck on 
                        your Algebra quiz. Your Gracie. 

           Damn she really did go to Juilliard.

           INT. MESH CAGES-- DAWN

           The sun is just rising out the window. A few dozen 
           chrysalides (green pods with butterflies inside) hang from 
           the tops of the white fabric cages. Each has a delicate rim 
           of glowing, metallic gold. 

           We focus on one in the corner, who’s the furthest along. 

           Gracie gets ready in the background, we can’t see what she’s 
           doing but she moves from room to room, packing things. 
           The chrysalis starts to move. From the bottom, a nudging, as 
           slowly a monarch butterfly nibbles his way out, leaving the 
           clear shell behind him like dead skin. 

           EXT. BACKYARD-- A BIT LATER

           We see now that Gracie was preparing to hunt. She’s in full 
           gear, and holds a rifle. 

           The sun is still low in the sky, and she heads out into the 
           woods behind their home. 

           She whistles and her large spaniels follow her. 

           INT. ATHERTON-YU BEDROOM-- MORNING

           Joe wakes up suddenly, surprised how bright it is. It’s a few 
           hours later and the room feels yellow and hot. He’s still in 
           his clothes, on top of the blankets. Gracie is gone. 

           He sits up and sighs, takes it in. 

           INT. KITCHEN-- A BIT LATER

           Joe makes breakfast for four but he’s the only one there so 
           far. As he brings the plates to the table he notices movement 
           in his butterfly nook. 

           INT. DINING NOOK-- CONTINUOUS

           The one hatched butterfly flitters around the green pods. Joe 
           bends down to meet him.

                                 JOE
                        Oh, hi. 

           He unzips the cage, and puts his finger inside. The butterfly 
           hops on. 

           INT. KITCHEN-- CONTINUOUS

           Joe walks slowly with the butterfly perched on his hand. He 
           goes over to the window and carefully opens it.

           He reaches his hand outside, feels the wind.

                                 JOE
                        Good luck. 
           It flies away. Simple as that. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Mary’s in the doorway in the sweet, but childish, white 
           dress. 

                                 JOE
                        Wow, you look so great.

                                 MARY
                        Thanks.

                                 JOE
                        Are you hungry?

                                 MARY
                        No. 

           She sees the plates of pancakes.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe coffee?

                                 JOE
                        Coffee. That’s new.

           She shrugs, he gives her a mug.

                                 MARY
                        When are we gonna leave?

           He thinks about it.

                                 JOE
                        Uh, we... We’ll leave in twenty 
                        minutes. I’ll just run up and get 
                        changed. Is your sister up?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah. Mom’s gonna hate her dress.

           Joe laughs.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Where is mom? 

                                 JOE
                        I don’t know honestly, but there’s 
                        no doubt in my mind that she’ll be 
                        there. I bet she went to the 
                        hairdresser. 
           EXT. THE WOODS-- DAY

           Gracie holds up her rifle, ready to shoot. Her dogs stand at 
           attention.

           She’s making direct eye contact with an incredibly still 
           BEARDED WILD TURKEY.

           He’s VERY fancy-- haloed by golden tail feathers, with a fat 
           chocolate body, a bright blue head, and an impressive crimson 
           wattle. 

           He looks like a mythical god of the land, and stands proudly 
           as such. 

           But Gracie, too, stands proudly. And then she pulls the 
           trigger and shoots him in the head.  

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD-- DAY

           A clear blue sky silhouettes the handsome face of actor 
           PATRICK DEMPSEY, 53. He smiles that crooked smile we can all 
           picture, and scans the horizon with his sapphire eyes.  

                                 PATRICK DEMPSEY
                        Today is a day of hope. 

           He speaks into a microphone, on a podium, at this high school 
           graduation. 

                                 PATRICK DEMPSEY (CONT’D)
                        As a proud Mainer, born and raised, 
                        I was honored to get the call to 
                        come and speak with you today. 

           Mary and her classmates wear robes and hats the color of 
           blood. It pops against the sky in a way that’s so pretty it 
           almost makes your eyes hurt. 

           The crowd is placid. 

           In the very back row sits Elizabeth, Gracie and Joe. All 
           wearing dark sunglasses, all looking tired. They stand out.

                                 PATRICK DEMPSEY (CONT’D)
                        As some of you may know, in 
                        addition to acting, I have spent 
                        the last ten years racing cars. And 
                        I wanted to share with you some 
                        lessons that I’ve learned from 
                        doing that. 

           As he speaks we focus on the three of them.
                                 PATRICK DEMPSEY (CONT’D)
                        When you’re driving, as I’m sure 
                        you’ve all learned to do by now, 
                        it’s important not only to focus on 
                        what’s directly on the road in 
                        front of you. But then again, as 
                        many of us do, it’s easy to get 
                        caught up in what’s way down the 
                        line. What we can’t even see yet. 
                        Well I’m here to tell you that the 
                        key to a successful life is to find 
                        a balance in the middle. If you’re 
                        too busy thinking long term, you’ll 
                        miss the important things along the 
                        way. And if you get caught up in 
                        all the little details right in 
                        front of you, you’ll have no idea 
                        where you’re going. You have to 
                        find the middle ground, of the far 
                        and the near. This isn’t easy to 
                        do, it took me years to figure it 
                        out. It may take you that long too. 

           He bows his head. 

                                 DOPEY BOY
                             (calling out)
                        McDreamy!

                                 PATRICK DEMPSEY
                        Yes, that’s right. To the Class of 
                        2019 of Camden High School in the 
                        great state of Maine-- may you 
                        drive safely and enjoy the ride. 

           The crowd gives him a standing ovation which he humbly 
           accepts.

                                 GRACIE
                        Do you know him? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. 

           They sit back down. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD-- A BIT LATER

           The kids walk across the stage as their names are called. 
           Mary waves to Joe, they all cheer. 

           The class throws their red-orange hats into the air! There 
           are so many of them, a swarm.
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD-- A BIT LATER

           It’s over and everyone is excitedly milling about. 

           Mary hugs Honor and then she runs off with Molly and Sofia. 
           Honor wears a short halter dress with a frayed hem. 

           Tom, Georgie, and Gracie’s other two adult children (BILLY, 
           40, and CASSIDY, 38) walk reluctantly over. 

           Before they get there, Joe ducks away.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Mom. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Wasn’t that great? 

           Gracie hugs them, shakes Tom’s hand. 

                                 TOM
                             (to Elizabeth)
                        Nice to see you again.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You as well.

                                 GRACIE
                        What are y’all doing today?

                                 TOM
                        Having a barbecue. How about you?

                                 GRACIE
                        Also having a barbecue. 

                                 CASSIDY
                        Mary looked beautiful up there.

                                 GRACIE
                        Thank you.

           None of them look happy. Georgie, hungover and with bold 
           fashion choices, has not looked at Gracie at all. 

                                 GEORGIE
                        Alright, enough of this, I can’t.  

           He turns around and walks away. 

                                 TOM
                        Sorry about that.
                                 GRACIE
                        There are a lot of people to see 
                        today. 

           She shakes hands goodbye with the rest of her old family. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD-- A BIT LATER

           In a shadier area under some trees Joe sits with his father 
           JOE SR., 70. He drinks from a little plastic cup of water 
           that people have been passing out. 

                                 JOE
                        Did you like Patrick Dempsey’s 
                        speech?

                                 JOE SR.
                        I did. I didn’t recognize him.

                                 JOE
                        I didn’t realize he was from Maine.

           Joe Sr. nods, contemplatively. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Pretty amazing. That Mary’s off to 
                        college. 

                                 JOE SR.
                        It is. 

                                 JOE
                        Two adult kids. 

                                 JOE SR.
                        Yes.

           There’s a nice breeze. 

                                 JOE
                        Dad, did you suspect anything? At 
                        the time.

                                 JOE SR.
                        Yeah. 

                                 JOE
                        Did mom?

                                 JOE SR.
                        No, your mother thought I was 
                        paranoid. 
           He shrugs like, “We sure showed her.” 

                                 JOE
                        Why didn’t you do anything?

                                 JOE SR.
                        What was there to do?

                                 JOE
                        Maybe, you could have talked to me 
                        about it.

                                 JOE SR.
                        Maybe. 

                                 JOE
                        Even after, I don’t really remember 
                        talking with you about it.

                                 JOE SR.
                        We were very busy. You, your 
                        sisters, and then a new baby in the 
                        house. 

                                 JOE
                        Yeah.

           Rhonda comes over with her pitcher. 

                                 RHONDA
                        Would you like some more water Mr. 
                        Yu?

                                 JOE SR.
                        Thank you.

                                 RHONDA
                        Summer has arrived.

                                 JOE SR.
                        It has. 

           She scoots over to others.

                                 JOE
                        But did you ever worry about me?

                                 JOE SR.
                        About what?

                                 JOE
                        That was I too young. That I would 
                        be damaged. 
           Joe Sr. thinks about it.

                                 JOE SR.
                        When I was growing up there was a 
                        lot to worry about. So much 
                        destruction. It’s hard to look back 
                        on, but I can still feel it. I 
                        wanted your life to feel like fresh 
                        air. To not burden you with worry 
                        and fears. You seemed happy. I’m 
                        sorry if that wasn’t the right 
                        thing to do. 

           Joe holds his hand.

                                 JOE
                        It’s okay. 

                                 JOE SR.
                        Okay. 

           They watch a family take a group picture. Smiles all around.

           INT. FOOTBALL FIELD-- A BIT LATER

           Elizabeth and Gracie stand next to each other but both scan 
           the crowd. Honor sits on one of the folding chairs behind 
           them, on her phone. 

           It’s clear that a lot of people are whispering about Gracie. 
           Little whispers, points, glances. Elizabeth sees it too. 

           Gracie holds her head high behind her dark round glasses. 
           Ignores it all.

                                 GRACIE
                        Are you leaving tomorrow?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes.

                                 GRACIE
                        Good. 

           She nods. Surveys the land like an army general.

                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        Insecure people are dangerous. They 
                        will do just about anything.

           Elizabeth watches her but she doesn’t look back.
                                 GRACIE (CONT’D)
                        I am secure. Make sure you put that 
                        in there. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I will. 

           Gracie gives one last nod and marches into the crowd, her 
           tiny body lost immediately. 

           Elizabeth sits next to Honor in the empty stands. 

                                 HONOR
                        Hi.

           She still has her phone out. Is very blasé. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey.

                                 HONOR
                        So this is really just the 
                        beginning for you, huh.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I guess so. We start shooting in 
                        two weeks. 

                                 HONOR
                        I really wish they weren’t making 
                        this movie.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sorry. 

                                 HONOR
                        I mean, it’s more people than just 
                        you I would think. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s true.

                                 HONOR
                        And all the people that would want 
                        to see it. They’re part of it too. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But maybe you’ll feel like the it 
                        had something to say. That we 
                        captured... the truth.

           Honor laughs.
                                 HONOR
                        Doubt it. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He’s a really good director.

                                 HONOR
                        I just think it’s too complicated, 
                        to really “get”-- my mom is... 
                        really complicated. Maybe for like 
                        a TV show, where you have a lot of 
                        hours. Or a novel, really. I guess 
                        I just see a movie being really 
                        bad. Like one of those things that 
                        comes out and you can tell 
                        everyone’s wearing a wig and you’re 
                        like ugh, no thanks. You know? 

           She looks her right in the eye. Smiles. There’s a resemblance 
           to Gracie that clicks in that moment. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. I know. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL-- A BIT LATER

           Joe waits for his father to come out of the men’s room. He 
           takes out his phone.

           He pulls up the thread with Michela, scrolls through. Since 
           asking him to go to Mexico she’s written a few times-- “Are 
           you okay?” “I’m so embarrassed that I said that” etc. He 
           hasn’t responded.

                                 JOE
                             (texting)
                        Hey.

           He sends it immediately. An act of bravery, no going back.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I didn’t get back to you 
                        before, it’s been really hectic 
                        over here and I’ve been thinking a 
                        lot. 

           He takes a deep breath.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go to Mexico. 

           (...) 
           Before he even sees her response, he smiles. 

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE-- DAY OR NIGHT (*CREDITS*)

           As if watching dailies, we see the following scene over and 
           over. Raw, with the clapper and fuck-ups.

           The set is an exact replica of the pet shop stockroom. 

           Elizabeth, as Gracie, sits next to a YOUNG ACTOR, as Joe. 

           The costumes are a little broad. Gracie holds a striking, 
           medium-sized snake.

                                 ROBERTO (O.S.)
                        Action!

                                 “GRACIE”
                        Are you scared?

                                 “JOE”
                        No. 

                                 “GRACIE”
                        It’s okay to be scared.

                                 “JOE”
                        I’m not. 

                                 “GRACIE”
                        She won’t bite.

                                 “JOE”
                        How do you know?

                                 “GRACIE”
                        She’s just not that kind of snake. 

           He takes the snake from her, their hands intertwined. 

                                 ROBERTO (O.S.)
                        Still rolling, take it from the 
                        top.

           And they do. Over and over and over.

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (out of character)
                        Honestly, do we not have it? I’m 
                        hitting my limit.
                                 ROBERTO (O.S.)
                        One more time, I promise. It’s 
                        almost perfect. 

                                                                THE END
