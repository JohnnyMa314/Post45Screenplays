           OVER BLACK.

           We hear the muffled bass of Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy.”

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        It’s over. It’s all over.

                        Poor, kid. You are sorely mistaken. 
                        We’re just getting started.

           FADE IN:

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Colorful streamers sway from the ceiling. A variety of old 
           yearbook photos hang on the walls. A few straggling STUDENTS 
           enter the hotel ballroom in formal attire.  

           JOY ROBINSON (Black, 17) wears a tea-length dress and a 
           corsage on her wrist. She’s at the end of the hall, gripping 
           a USB FLASH DRIVE. PRINCIPAL JERALD O’DONNELL (White, 46) 
           stands at the other end of the hall, dressed like a 1940s 
           mobster. A menacing smile on his face. 

                                 JERALD
                        Let the games begin.

           Joy raises an eyebrow. Jerald suddenly breaks into a sprint 
           and LUNGES at her.

           FREEZE FRAME on Jerald in the air. A crazed look in his eyes. 

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        Believe it or not, that man right 
                        there is my principal. He’s a 
                        crazy, racist psychopath. You can 
                        almost see it in his eyes. The pure 
                        evil.

           FREEZE FRAME on Joy. Her eyes wide, jaw dropped.

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        I stumbled upon a secret from his 
                        past. One that threatened to ruin 
                        his flawless reputation. It could 
                        have all gone away so easily. But 
                        it’s never that easy.

           Jerald lands on top of Joy. He yanks the flash drive from her 
           hand. He rises to his feet, slips the device into his jacket 
           pocket, and instinctively fixes his hair. 
                                 JERALD
                        You don’t belong at Glen Cove, Joy. 
                        Never have. Never will.

           He scans the empty hallway. Jerald hurries away, disappearing 
           into the ballroom.

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        Ain’t that about a bitch.

           INT. ROBINSON APARTMENT - DAY

           An alarm blares throughout a cramped two-bedroom apartment. 

           Joy jolts awake in her bunkbed, banging her head on the top 
           bunk where her twin sisters, MINNIE and STEVIE (11), sleep 
           soundly.

                                 JOY
                        Rise and shine, ladies. Let’s get 
                        moving.

           She kicks the top bunk with her feet. Minnie rolls off the 
           bunk and falls to the floor. Joy yawns.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Do you want sausage or bacon?

                                 MINNIE
                             (groans in pain)
                        Bacon.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROBINSON KITCHEN - DAY

           Minnie and Stevie sit restlessly at the kitchen table while 
           Joy prepares breakfast. Waffles, bacon, and eggs galore. 

           Joy places two plates in front of the girls. Minnie’s eyes 
           dart back and forth between her food and Stevie’s.

                                 MINNIE
                             (to Joy)
                        You gave Stevie more bacon than me.

                                 STEVIE
                        No she didn’t, stupid face! 
                                 MINNIE
                        You’re the stupid face!

                                 JOY
                        If one of you has a stupid face, 
                        the other one also has a stupid 
                        face. So, do me a favor and shut 
                        your stupid faces.

           The front door bursts open. Joy’s mother, GINA ROBINSON (40), 
           meanders inside, dragging her feet. Her waitress uniform is 
           stained with an assortment of breakfast items. She plops down 
           at the kitchen table, exhausted.

           Joy pours a steaming cup of tea and serves it to her mother.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Rough shift?

                                 GINA
                        Baby, you don’t even know the half 
                        of it.

           Gina takes a sip of tea, but it sounds more like a prolonged 
           slurp.

                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for looking after the 
                        girls.

           Joy looks back at the twins. They bicker over the last piece 
           of bacon on Stevie’s plate.

                                 JOY
                        Ma, I have to be honest with you. 
                        Your daughters are going to grow up 
                        to be awful human beings.

                                 GINA
                             (shrugs)
                        At least I got one good one.

           She puts a hand on Joy’s cheek.

                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        My baby. Soon-to-be-college-bound. 
                        I’m so proud of you.

                                 JOY
                             (wide smile)
                        Thanks, Ma. 

           Joy glances at the clock.
                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        I gotta go. Don’t wanna miss the 
                        bus.

                                 GINA
                        Don’t forget to talk to the 
                        principal about that recommendation 
                        letter.

                                 JOY
                        Going straight to his office when I 
                        get there.

                                 GINA
                        You need that scholarship. 
                        Otherwise, I’mma be working twenty-
                        four hour shifts to put you through 
                        school. I’ll have to put the girls 
                        up for adoption.

           The twins drop their utensils. Mouths wide open.

                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        I’m just playin’ babies.

           Gina looks back at Joy and shakes her head. She wasn’t 
           kidding.

                                 JOY
                        Don’t worry, Ma. It’s in the bag.  

           Joy strides over to the fridge. She pulls out an extra plate 
           covered with a paper towel. She places it in front of the 
           girls and removes the paper towel, revealing an extra helping 
           of BACON. Their eyes grow wide.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t say I never did anything for 
                        you.

           Joy winks at the twins, kisses Gina on the cheek, grabs her 
           backpack and heads out the door.

           EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

           Joy waits patiently among WORKING PROFESSIONALS and YOUNG 
           PARENTS.

           Earbuds in. Music on full blast. The music only partially 
           drowns out the noise of her fellow commuters.
           INT. CITY BUS - DAY

           Joy pushes her way to the back of the crowded bus. She snags 
           a free seat next to a SINGLE MOM and her BABY. The single mom 
           forces Joy to hold the infant while she rummages through her 
           purse. It immediately starts scream-crying.

           Annoyed, Joy gazes out the window. The dirty, crowded inner 
           city streets slowly turn into the spacious clean roads of the 
           suburbs. 

           The bus speeds past a sign: WELCOME TO GLEN COVE.

           EXT. GLEN COVE BUS STOP - DAY

           Joy chases after the single mom and forces her to take her 
           child back. Joy awkwardly pats her on the back, wishes her 
           good luck, and proceeds to run in the opposite direction.

           Without looking, Joy steps out into the street. A FLASHY 
           MERCEDES BENZ comes to a screeching halt, nearly hitting her. 
           A WOMAN IN WHITE (White, 40), reminiscent of an angel, sits 
           in the driver’s seat. She rolls down her window to speak to 
           Joy. A smile on her face.

                                 WOMAN IN WHITE
                        You better be careful, darling. 
                        Wouldn’t want you to get hurt.

                                 JOY
                        Sorry, ma’am.

           Joy steps out of the way. The Woman in White waves as she 
           speeds off down the street.

           EXT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The three-story modern building looks like it belongs on the 
           cover of Architectural Digest. Joy bounds up the front steps, 
           greeting her classmates.

           INT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The student population is mostly white with a few sprinkles 
           of color here and there. As Joy enters the lobby, she follows 
           the sound of loud chants. 

           Members of For All People — or FAP — stand in front of the 
           historic school mural. They hold signs and posters with the 
           slogans “FAP Against Racism” and “FAP For Justice.” 
           The school mural shows Christopher Columbus “discovering” 
           America. Native Americans stand in the background, depicted 
           as insensitive stereotypes. 

           Joy approaches JACK (17), a stereotypical dumb jock.

                                 JOY
                        What’s going on?

                                 JACK
                        FAP wants the mural removed. They 
                        think it’s racist.

                                 JOY
                        It is racist. Not to mention 
                        inaccurate.

                                 JACK
                             (shrugs)
                        Kristoff Columbus looks good 
                        though.

           Joy starts to reply but decides it’s not worth her time. The 
           chants grow louder. The students grow rowdier. DARNELL 
           JEFFERIES (Black, 55), the introverted vice principal and 
           sole black staff member, musters up his confidence and pushes 
           his way to the front of the crowd.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Please quiet down, everyone. I 
                        understand the concern. I’ve been 
                        working with the school board for 
                        years to get this thing removed.

                                 PROTESTER #1
                        Then why is it still here?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        It’s a lengthy process. There are 
                        certain steps we have to take-- 

                                 PROTESTER #2
                        If you really cared about ridding 
                        the world of injustice, you would 
                        have it removed now!

           The chants resume. Mr. Jefferies tries to quiet down the 
           crowd to no avail.

                                 JERALD (O.S.)
                        Students, students. I hear you. I 
                        feel you. I see you.
           Jerald stands in the entryway, hands on his hips. His stance 
           mirrors that of Superman. Salt and pepper hair slicked back. 
           Bright white smile on display. He’s basically the George 
           Clooney of Glen Cove High School.

           He confidently strides toward the crowd of students.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        I understand why this mural upsets 
                        you. It upsets me too.

           He puts his hand on a FRESHMAN GIRL’s shoulder. She swoons 
           and faints from excitement. Jerald steps over her. He reaches 
           the front, bumping Mr. Jefferies out of the way.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        That is why I guarantee this mural 
                        will be removed by the end of the 
                        year!

           The students erupt in CHEERS. Jerald soaks in the 
           recognition. Mr. Jefferies slumps behind him.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Now, off to class. And take those 
                        FAP signs with you.

           As the students disperse, Joy pushes her way through the 
           crowd. She tries to get Jerald’s attention, but Mr. Jefferies 
           reaches him first.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Hey, Jerald. You know, my brother 
                        could help us with the mural-- 

                                 JERALD
                        Your brother? I don’t think a 
                        mechanic will be able to help us.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        My brother’s not a mechanic, he’s-- 

                                 JERALD
                        That’s quite alright, Darnell. I’ll 
                        figure it out myself.

           Mr. Jefferies awkwardly nods and leaves. Joy taps Jerald on 
           the shoulder. 

                                 JOY
                        Excuse me, Principal O’Donnell?
                                 JERALD
                        Joy Robinson. We’ve been over this. 
                        Call me, Jerald.

                                 JOY
                        Right. Jerald.

                                 JERALD
                        What can I, Jerald, do for you, 
                        Joy?

                                 JOY
                        I just wanted to remind you about 
                        the letter of recommendation for 
                        the Haines Foundation Scholarship. 

                                 JERALD
                        Oh, yes. I’ll have it to you by the 
                        end of the week.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you, sir. I mean, Jerald.

                                 JERALD
                        My pleasure. The Haines Foundation 
                        has allowed so many African 
                        American students to further their 
                        education. They should be honored 
                        to have you.

           Joy beams. Jerald gives her a thumbs up.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Give my girl a pat on the head for 
                        me.

           Jerald winks at Joy. He proceeds to moonwalk into his office.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           DRAYA PETERS (Half Black, Half White, 18) stands front and 
           center while other STUDENTS listen attentively. She holds a 
           clipboard with a lengthy to-do list attached. The blackboard 
           behind her reads “PROM COMMITTEE.” 

                                 DRAYA
                        Listen up! Since the school board 
                        deemed our Euphoria theme “too 
                        inappropriate,” we have to make 
                        some last minute changes. 

           FRANKIE (17) saunters into the room. Draya rolls her eyes. 
           She steps in front of him.
                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Frankie! You’re five minutes late. 
                        What kind of committee do you think 
                        we’re running here? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        The prom kind?

                                 DRAYA
                        Exactly. We’ve already gone over 
                        several very important things on my 
                        very important checklist. It is 
                        never okay to be tardy. 

           Joy strolls into the room in the middle of Draya’s rant.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Hey, girl.
                             (to Frankie)
                        Like I was saying. Don’t be late 
                        again. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What if it’s an emergency? What if 
                        I’m sick?

                                 DRAYA
                        Then take some Emergen-C and sit 
                        your ass down.

           Frankie stalks to the back of the room while Joy settles in 
           the front row. She turns and mouths “sorry” to Frankie. He 
           grins at her. 

           Draya returns to her post at the front of the room. She 
           attempts to regain her composure.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        As I was saying before Frankie 
                        rudely interrupted us, the new 
                        dance theme is “Blast from the 
                        Past.” We have less than one week 
                        to rearrange decorations. So, any 
                        ideas?

           Blank stares from the committee. 

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Anyone? Anything? 

           Draya becomes increasingly agitated.
                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Y’all won’t quit talking all year 
                        long and now you got nothing to 
                        say? Well, I’ve got something to 
                        say. I never liked any of you. 
                        Screw every single one of you. You 
                        are dead to me. And I hope the 
                        death was slow and painful. 
                             (beat)
                        Especially you, Frankie.

           Defeated, Draya plops down in her chair. Frankie and the rest 
           of the committee look terrified. Joy jumps up from her seat.

                                 JOY
                        Alright! Meeting adjourned 
                        everyone. 

           The prom committee quickly gathers their belongings and 
           leaves. Joy eyes Draya, confused by her outburst.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck was that?

                                 DRAYA
                        They deserved it.

                                 JOY
                        You told them to die.

                                 DRAYA
                        And the world will be better off. 

           Joy raises an eyebrow and looks at Draya expectantly. 

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                             (sighs)
                        I’ll apologize later. But right now 
                        I have more important things to 
                        deal with. Prom is going to be a 
                        disaster.

                                 JOY
                        It’ll be fine. We’ll just put up 
                        some streamers and call it a day.

           Draya slowly stands, her eyes filled with rage.

                                 DRAYA
                        Streamers? Fucking streamers? Do 
                        you know what I went through to get 
                        decorations for our Euphoria theme? 
                        I literally ordered mints that look 
                        like Fentanyl. 
           Joy shakes her head.

                                 JOY
                        That’s just problematic on every 
                        level. Drug addiction is a serious 
                        problem. 

           Draya wails. Joy wraps her in a tight hug and awkwardly pats 
           her on the head. 

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        That’s from your uncle.

           Draya grins.

                                 DRAYA
                        Did he show you his moonwalk?

                                 JOY
                        Yes. And somehow I still think he’s 
                        cool.

           Draya giggles. She pulls away from the hug, slightly calmer 
           than before.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        What do you need from me?

                                 DRAYA
                        Old yearbooks. Maybe it’ll inspire 
                        some decoration ideas.

                                 JOY
                        Fine. I’ll talk to the yearbook 
                        staff. But you know Rayne hates 
                        you.

                                 DRAYA
                             (sing-song)
                        Good thing she doesn’t hate my best 
                        friend.

           Draya pinches Joy’s cheeks. Joy shakes her off.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        I owe you.

                                 JOY
                        Big time. Now stop telling people 
                        to die and get rid of the mints. 

           Joy slings her backpack over her shoulder and struts out of 
           the classroom.
           INT. SCHOOL YEARBOOK ROOM - DAY

           A tiny room at the end of the hall on the third floor.

           The yearbook editor, RAYNE RODRIGUEZ (Latinx, 16), gives an 
           impassioned speech about journalistic integrity.

                                 RAYNE
                        And furthermore we should not be 
                        punished for searching for justice 
                        in this cruel and unforgiving 
                        world!

           She slams her hand on the table, signaling the end of her 
           rant. 

           REVEAL: There’s only one other person in the room. Yearbook 
           photographer SONYA KHAN (Pakistani American, 15) watches 
           videos on TikTok. She suddenly looks up.

                                 SONYA
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Were you saying 
                        something?

           Rayne groans. 

           A knock at the door. Joy enters the room.

                                 JOY
                        Rayne, I need a favor.

                                 RAYNE
                        Not now, Robinson. Can’t you see 
                        we’re in the middle of a staff 
                        meeting?

           Joy scans the nearly empty classroom.

                                 JOY
                        Where is the rest of the staff? 

                                 SONYA
                        Rayne scared them off.

                                 RAYNE
                        I did no such thing. They just 
                        simply took a leave of absence 
                        after I showed up.

                                 JOY
                        Look, this’ll only take a minute. I 
                        need to borrow some old yearbooks.
                                 RAYNE
                        Why?

                                 JOY
                        I’m helping out a friend.

                                 RAYNE
                        Which friend?

                                 JOY
                        You know, just like, a friend.

                                 RAYNE
                        Yeah, I got that. I asked you which 
                        friend.

           Joy looks down at her feet, avoiding eye contact.

                                 JOY
                             (quietly)
                        Draya.

                                 RAYNE
                        What was that?

                                 JOY
                             (quietly)
                        Draya.

                                 RAYNE
                        Come again?

                                 JOY
                        Draya, okay! I’m helping Draya.

                                 RAYNE
                        That’s what I thought. I’m going to 
                        impolitely tell you to fuck off.

           Rayne guides Joy back to the door.

                                 JOY
                        Please, Rayne! I know you two don’t 
                        get along. 

                                 RAYNE
                        She got Sonya and I kicked off the 
                        newspaper staff! She single-
                        handedly ruined our lives.

                                 SONYA
                        Correction. She ruined your life. 
                        I, personally, am enjoying my 
                        newfound free time.
           Sonya walks over to the bookshelf. She begins collecting old 
           yearbooks.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you, Sonya. 
                             (to Rayne)
                        You can’t blame this whole thing on 
                        Draya.

                                 RAYNE
                        She’s a whistleblower. She blew the 
                        goddamn whistle. 

                                 JOY
                        Because you interrogated the lunch 
                        lady. And made her cry.

           Rayne crosses her arms defensively.

                                 RAYNE
                        They never proved that she didn’t 
                        put something in that marinara 
                        sauce.

                                 SONYA
                        Oregano. She put oregano in the 
                        sauce-- 

                                 RAYNE
                        Draya is responsible for our 
                        resignation.  

                                 SONYA
                        We were definitely fired-- 

                                 RAYNE
                        Working for the yearbook was our 
                        only other option.

           Sonya hands over a stack of yearbooks to Joy. 

                                 SONYA
                        These range from ‘75 to ‘93. Go 
                        wild. 

                                 JOY
                        Good lookin’ out, Sonya. I’ll bring 
                        these back tomorrow.
                             (to Rayne)
                        Sorry about the newspaper.

           Joy leaves the room. Rayne frowns. 
           INT. DRAYA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Posters of Beyoncé and Drake plaster the walls. A banner that 
           reads ‘The Future is Female’ hangs above the closet.

           Draya and Joy lounge on the bed. They aimlessly flip through 
           the yearbooks. With each page flip, Draya becomes more 
           revolted.

                                 DRAYA
                        Fuckin’ hippies.

           Draya tosses the yearbook aside in frustration. She turns her 
           attention to Joy.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Please tell me the eighties were 
                        better than the seventies.

                                 JOY
                        Nope. Just white boys and mullets.

                                 DRAYA
                        Ugh, I hate everything.

           Draya leans back against her headboard and looks out the 
           window. A mischievous smile creeps up on her face. 

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Perfect timing. 
                             (to Joy)
                        Come on.

           Draya drags Joy over to the window and points next door. Her 
           neighbor, AMY (White, 60), blasts “Gangsta’s Paradise” by 
           Coolio in her bedroom. She recites the lyrics like a pro. The 
           girls are amused.

                                 JOY
                        I’m almost impressed.

                                 DRAYA
                        You should be. She’s had at least 
                        three glasses of wine by now.

           Amy suddenly glances over toward Draya’s bedroom. The girls 
           quickly drop to the floor. They break into a fit of giggles, 
           struggling to catch their breath.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                             (abruptly)
                        Hey, you still need a prom date. 
                                 JOY
                        I told you, D. I’m going by myself.

           Draya squeezes Joy’s hand and stares at her intently.

                                 DRAYA
                        Joy, I love you.

                                 JOY
                        Aw, Draya. I love you, too.

                                 DRAYA
                        But if you think I want you third-
                        wheeling on my date with Sabrina, 
                        you must be outta ya damn mind.

           Joy snatches her hand away.

                                 JOY
                        I mean, I could go with Frankie.

                                 DRAYA
                        I said you need a date. Not a 
                        Frankie.

           Joy rolls her eyes. She resumes flipping through the 
           yearbook.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        What about Trey? I think he just 
                        broke up with Victoria. Or maybe 
                        Harold? I know he has that 
                        snaggletooth. We can tell him to 
                        keep his mouth closed for the 
                        pictures.

           Joy’s face drops.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Okay, fine. Maybe he can get 
                        veneers before Friday. That’s a big 
                        ask though... 

                                 JOY
                        Draya. Shut up and look.

           She points at a yearbook picture in the bottom right corner. 
           In the picture, TWO WHITE STUDENTS laugh at their FRIEND in 
           BLACKFACE.
                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                             (reads caption)
                        “Sophomores Sullivan Chance and 
                        Tripp Carney laugh at Jerald 
                        O’Donnell who’s Michael Jackson 
                        costume was a big hit.”

           Bewildered, Draya grabs the yearbook from Joy.

                                 DRAYA
                        No way. That can’t be him.

           Joy stands abruptly. She begins pacing back and forth.  

                                 JOY
                        I can’t believe this. I thought 
                        Jerald was down for us. I mean, his 
                        name is Jerald.
                             (beat)
                        With a J.

                                 DRAYA
                        Calm your tits. I’m sure he’s 
                        embarrassed by it now.

           Joy stares at her, incredulous.

                                 JOY
                        Are you actually defending that man 
                        right now?

                                 DRAYA
                        I’ve known the guy all my life. It 
                        was a different time. Doesn’t mean 
                        he’s a bad guy. 

           Draya stands, matching Joy’s eye level.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        All I’m saying is, give him a 
                        chance to explain before you go all 
                        crazy. 

                                 JOY
                             (deep breath)
                        When did you become the rational 
                        one in this friendship?

           Draya glances at an imaginary watch on her wrist.

                                 DRAYA
                        Precisely two minutes ago. Don’t 
                        worry. It never lasts long.
           Draya plops down on her bed. She continues to mull over Joy’s 
           date options while Joy stares blankly at the yearbook photo.

           INT. SCHOOL FRONT OFFICE - DAY

           The bell RINGS. Joy sits outside Jerald’s office, yearbook in 
           hand. She closes her eyes and gives herself a pep talk.

                                 JOY
                        Be rational and respectful. You 
                        still need that recommendation 
                        letter. Just show him the picture 
                        and let him explain. And do not, I 
                        repeat, do not call him a racist 
                        son of a bitch.

                                 MRS. REESE (O.S.)
                        Honey, who are you talking to?

           Joy opens her eyes to see MRS. REESE, the school secretary, 
           staring at her. 

                                 JOY
                        Nobody.

           The office door opens. Jerald and BRETT MORGAN (45), a 
           businessman type, appear in the doorway.

                                 JERALD
                        My girl, Joy! 
                             (gesturing toward Brett)
                        This is my buddy, Brett. He was 
                        just stopping by to say hello. 

                                 BRETT
                        Nice to meet you, Joy.

                                 JOY
                        You too.

           Brett pats Jerald on the back. 

                                 BRETT
                        See you next week?

                                 JERALD
                        You betcha.

           Brett bids them farewell and exits the office.

                                 JOY
                             (curious)
                        What’s next week?
                                 JERALD
                        Nothing too crazy. Just a little 
                        shindig with some old pals. 

                                 JOY
                        I’m guessing Draya’s parents will 
                        be there?

                                 JERALD
                             (chuckles)
                        Nah. It’s not their scene.

           He steps back inside his office. Joy follows. 

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Framed degrees are displayed on the wall. A picture of Jerald 
           shaking Barack Obama’s hand inside the Oval Office sits on 
           his desk. Next to it, is a photo of Jerald and the Peters 
           family at Draya’s third birthday party. 

           Joy takes this all in as she sits down. Jerald leans back in 
           his chair and kicks his feet up on the desk. He looks at her 
           expectantly.

                                 JERALD
                        So? What’s up?

           Joy looks down at the yearbook in her lap.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Is that an old yearbook?

                                 JOY
                        Uh-huh. You were a sophomore, 
                        actually.

                                 JERALD
                        Oh, boy. Let me see.

           He pries the yearbook from Joy’s grip.

                                 JOY
                        There’s, um, an interesting picture 
                        of you on Page 46.

           Jerald flips through the pages excitedly.

                                 JERALD
                        How embarrassing. How was my hair? 
                        Was my hair okay? I used a lot of 
                        gel.
           He finds the page and immediately stops talking. He peers 
           over the yearbook at Joy. An unreadable expression on his 
           face.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Joy, I don’t know what to say.

                                 JOY
                        I thought I’d give you a chance to 
                        explain. It was a long time ago.

                                 JERALD
                        That’s no excuse. There is never an 
                        excuse for this kind of behavior. 
                        Never.

           Jerald slams the book shut, causing Joy to jump.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m just...mad at 
                        myself. I was so young and 
                        uneducated.

           He tucks the yearbook under his arm and walks around to the 
           front of his desk.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        I was just a kid trying to make my 
                        friends laugh. I was unaware of the 
                        historical context behind it. And 
                        for that, I am so very sorry.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you. That means a lot.

                                 JERALD
                        I hope you are able to forgive me.

                                 JOY
                             (shrugs)
                        We all make mistakes, I guess.

                                 JERALD
                        It is part of being human.

           A comfortable moment of silence between them.

                                 JOY
                        Well, I guess I should get going. 
                        I’m late for anatomy.

           She reaches for the yearbook, but Jerald SNATCHES it away.
                                 JERALD
                        I think it’s best if I keep this 
                        here. You know, for safe keeping.

           Joy’s brow furrows. Jerald displays his pearly whites. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Off to class now, Joy.

           Joy rises from her seat. She gives Jerald an awkward wave 
           before exiting his office.

           INT. HEALTH CLASS - DAY

           The anatomy teacher, MR. MARTIN (probably 100), snores softly 
           at his desk, while the class watches the Season One finale of 
           House. In this particular episode, Dr. Gregory House meets up 
           with his ex-girlfriend and her husband. 

           Joy sits at a desk in the back. She’s nearly falling asleep 
           herself when someone taps her on the shoulder. She turns to 
           find TANNER (White, 17) sitting beside her. Sunglasses on, 
           shirt collar popped.

                                 TANNER
                        Are you still applying for the 
                        Haines Scholarship?

                                 JOY
                        Yes, I am.

                                 TANNER
                        Oh, cool. Me too.

                                 JOY
                             (laughs)
                        Good one.

                                 TANNER
                        No really. 

                                 JOY
                        Oh.

                                 TANNER
                        Jerald said I should apply. Just in 
                        case.

                                 JOY
                        In case what?
                                 TANNER
                        I don’t know. He said he didn’t 
                        want the wrong person to get it.

                                 JOY
                             (stunned)
                        Uh-huh. And when exactly did he say 
                        this to you?

                                 TANNER
                        Like a month ago.

                                 JOY
                        A whole month ago?

                                 TANNER
                        Yeah. Well, good luck.

           Joy shifts in her seat to face the projection screen. As she 
           does, a particular line from Dr. House catches her attention. 
           Dr. House: “Oh, he’s good. If you can fake sincerity, you can 
           pretty much fake anything.”

           Joy considers this. She grabs her backpack and rushes out of 
           the room, inadvertently waking Mr. Martin from his sleep. 

                                 MR. MARTIN
                        No talking!

           He immediately falls back into a deep sleep.

           INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Joy barges into the office. 

           Jerald hovers over a PAPER SHREDDER. He holds the open 
           yearbook in one hand, Page 46 in the other.

                                 JOY
                        What are you doing?

                                 JERALD
                        It was a mistake, Joy. A stupid, 
                        stupid mistake.

           He puts the page through the machine. The photo turns to 
           shreds. Jerald shuts the yearbook and tosses it to Joy. She 
           barely catches it.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        This is what you came for. Right?
           Joy has no response. Jerald pats her on the back and walks 
           toward his desk. He picks up his Obama photo, breathes on it 
           heavily, and shines it with his sleeve.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        I’m afraid I have some bad news for 
                        you, Joy. I’ve decided to recommend 
                        another student for the Haines 
                        Foundation Scholarship. Simply put, 
                        you are just not qualified. 

           Speechless, Joy shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 JOY
                        No disrespect, but I’m more than 
                        qualified. You said you would--

                                 JERALD
                        So sorry. You know, I hear Glen 
                        Cove Community College is a great 
                        institution for those who are 
                        financially unable. 

           Jerald holds out his hand for a handshake.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        No hard feelings, right?

           Joy stares at his hand with disdain. Her fists clenched.

                                 JOY
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        Have a nice day, Principal 
                        O’Donnell.

                                 JERALD
                        Come on, Joy. Call me-- 

           But Joy is already out the door. It slams shut behind her.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Jerald.

           Jerald laughs.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Joy wanders down the hall. Tears threaten to spill over her 
           eyes when she suddenly bumps into Frankie. She ignores him 
           and keeps walking. 

           Frankie raises an eyebrow. He jogs in front of her, blocking 
           her path.
                                 FRANKIE
                        Joy! Hey, look at me. What’s wrong?

                                 JOY
                        It’s nothing.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Doesn’t seem like nothing. Who do I 
                        need to kill?

                                 JOY
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, but 
                        I don’t think you’re capable of 
                        killing somebody. You’re like the 
                        size of a really big rabbit.

                                 FRANKIE
                        First off, rabbits are consistently 
                        voted the cutest animal in the 
                        world. So, thank you. Second, I 
                        wouldn’t personally commit the 
                        murder. I’d pay somebody to do it.

           Joy cracks a smile.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        There she is. Look, you don’t gotta 
                        tell me what happened. I just 
                        wanted to make sure you’re good. 
                        You good? 

                                 JOY
                        I’m good.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Good. 

                                 JOY
                             (smiles)
                        Good.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m sure it’s quite the story 
                        though. Whatever happened to you.

           Joy’s eyes light up.

                                 JOY
                        You’re right, Frankie. It is quite 
                        the story.

           Joy sprints up the stairs. Frankie stares after her, both 
           confused and amused.
           INT. SCHOOL YEARBOOK ROOM - DAY

           Rayne and Sonya argue over the yearbook format. 

           Joy BURSTS into the room. In a fit of rage, she kicks over a 
           chair. Rayne and Sonya stare at her blankly. 

                                 SONYA
                        That felt unnecessary.

           Joy hastily picks up the chair, returning it to its rightful 
           place. She takes a moment to catch her breath.

                                 JOY
                        I have a story for you.

           Rayne and Sonya exchange glances.

                                 RAYNE
                        We’re listening.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL YEARBOOK ROOM - LATER

                                 RAYNE
                        He shredded the picture? Right in 
                        front of you?

                                 SONYA
                        That’s a power move if I’ve ever 
                        heard one. It’s kinda sexy.

           Joy gives Sonya a pointed look.

                                 SONYA (CONT'D)
                        And bad. Bad, Jerald, bad.

                                 RAYNE
                        I can see the headline now. 
                        “Principal Perfect Has a Bad Angle 
                        After All.”

           Rayne jots down notes.

                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        We’ll have to visit his house to 
                        gather more evidence.

                                 JOY
                             (chuckles)
                        Sorry. It sounded like you said we 
                        have to visit his house.
                                 RAYNE
                        Your ears are working correctly.

           Joy’s smile falters.

                                 JOY
                        I don’t know if I’m comfortable 
                        with that. It feels like an 
                        invasion of privacy.

                                 RAYNE
                        Look, Joy. I’m afraid I’m going to 
                        have to be blunt.

           She puts a hand on Joy’s shoulder.

                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        You gotta get rid of this nice guy 
                        act. If you want to be a 
                        journalist, you gotta get down and 
                        dirty.

                                 JOY
                        Oh, I don’t wanna be a journalist-- 

                                 RAYNE
                        And if you want to be a really 
                        great journalist, you have to be 
                        willing to break a few laws. 

                                 SONYA
                        Fuck the police!

           Sonya pins a picture of Jerald to the wall.

                                 SONYA (CONT'D)
                        And fuck that dude, too.

           Rayne and Sonya high five.

                                 RAYNE
                        We start after school. Meet us in 
                        the parking lot at sixteen-hundred 
                        hours.

                                 SONYA
                        That’s four o’clock--

           Rayne holds a hand up to silence her.

                                 RAYNE
                        No. If she can’t tell military 
                        time, then she’s not a real 
                        journalist.
                                 JOY
                        I don’t want to be a journalist!

                                 RAYNE
                        And with that attitude, you never 
                        will be.

           Rayne and Sonya gather their things and leave. Joy is left 
           alone, baffled. She stares at Jerald’s photo. Oddly enough, 
           it seems to be staring back.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Draya stands with her head inside her locker. Her muted 
           screams are still distinguishable. SABRINA (17) gently rubs 
           her back.

           Joy cautiously approaches them.

                                 JOY
                             (to Sabrina)
                        What happened this time?

                                 SABRINA
                        Calculus. She needs to pass this 
                        test on Monday. 
                             (whispers)
                        Or else she won’t graduate.

                                 DRAYA
                             (muffled)
                        I can hear you!

           Draya emerges from the locker. Bloodshot eyes, cheeks stained 
           with mascara.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        I am stressed the fuck out, man!

           Draya stomps down the hall. Joy and Sabrina exchange looks 
           and reluctantly trail behind. 

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        How does the world expect me to 
                        plan the perfect prom and know 
                        about shapes and shit? It’s 
                        physically impossible.

                                 JOY
                        Dear lord. Please tell me you know 
                        the difference between calculus and 
                        geometry. 
                                 SABRINA
                        I’ve tried to explain it to her 
                        several times.

                                 DRAYA
                        It doesn’t matter. I’m just gonna 
                        talk to Uncle Jerry about it. He 
                        won’t let this happen.  

           Joy flinches. 

                                 JOY
                        Or you could just study really hard 
                        and earn the grade yourself.

           Draya lets out a HARSH LAUGH.

                                 DRAYA
                        It’s like you don’t know me at all.

           Draya takes a sudden detour into the bathroom. Sabrina and 
           Joy hover outside the door, debating the next move.
                                                         SABRINA

           She’s your girlfriend.
                                              She’s your best friend.

           Sabrina sighs. She holds out her fist, indicating a game of 
           ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS. Rock. Paper. Scissors. Shoot. 

           Sabrina’s paper beats Joy’s rock. She silently celebrates her 
           victory, while Joy groans.

                                 SABRINA (CONT'D)
                        Tell her I love her.

                                 JOY
                        Don’t make me slap you.

           Sabrina skips away. Joy enters the bathroom. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Joy checks the stalls while Draya attempts to fix her makeup.

                                 JOY
                        Are you sure you want to get 
                        Principal O’Donnell involved?

                                 DRAYA
                        You back to calling him that?

           Joy leans against the sink, crossing her arms. Draya applies 
           mascara. 
                                 JOY
                        I went to talk to him today. About 
                        the blackface.

                                 DRAYA
                        And?

                                 JOY
                        He destroyed the picture. Shredded 
                        it right in front of me.

                                 DRAYA
                        Can you blame him? It’s not a good 
                        look.

                                 JOY
                        Also, I told Rayne.  

           Draya drops her mascara wand. 

                                 DRAYA
                        Are you insane? Why would you tell 
                        that psycho? She’s gonna turn this 
                        into something it isn’t. 

                                 JOY
                        O’Donnell told me I wasn’t 
                        qualified for the scholarship. He’s 
                        recommending someone else.

           Draya takes a small, intimidating step closer to Joy.

                                 DRAYA
                        Oh, I see. You’re not mad about the 
                        blackface. You’re mad about the 
                        scholarship.

                                 JOY
                        No. Well, yes, but that’s not why-- 

                                 DRAYA
                        You tryna ruin his whole life 
                        because something didn’t go your 
                        way?

                                 JOY
                        You didn’t see the look in his eye. 
                        Something’s not right. 

                                 DRAYA
                        That’s my uncle, Joy!

                                 JOY
                        Play uncle.
                                 DRAYA
                        Whatever, I don’t want any part of 
                        this.

           Draya packs up her makeup.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        This shit storm will turn into a 
                        shit hurricane before you know it. 
                             (beat)
                        And I don’t wanna see the 
                        aftermath.

           Draya storms out of the bathroom. Joy glares after her.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Joy walks down the hall, muttering to herself. She walks 
           briskly past the principal’s office, but she sees something 
           out of the corner of her eye that causes her to backtrack. 

           Through the window, she spots Draya having an animated 
           conversation with Jerald. He appears to listen to her 
           intently. They smile and share a laugh. 

           Joy peers at the interaction, astonished. She turns and walks 
           away in a bit of a haze.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           The school bell RINGS. Students exit the building. Joy 
           searches for Rayne and Sonya to no avail. She pulls out her 
           phone to send a text.

           An eardrum-bursting CAR HORN sounds. 

           Joy covers her ears and follows the noise to a JEEP WRANGLER. 
           Rayne and Sonya sit inside. Rayne’s hand rests on the horn.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RAYNE’S JEEP - DAY

           Joy climbs into the backseat.

                                 JOY
                        I thought the goal was to not draw 
                        attention to ourselves.

                                 RAYNE
                        Chill. No one noticed.
           A FRESHMAN walks past the front windshield. He rubs his ears 
           and flips them off simultaneously. 

                                 JOY
                        Now what?

                                 SONYA
                        We wait. 

                                 RAYNE
                        Jerald usually leaves his office 
                        around five.

                                 JOY
                        That’s an hour from now.

                                 RAYNE
                        Good for you, Joy. You can tell 
                        time.

                                 JOY
                        I’m just saying I woulda packed a 
                        snack or something.

           Joy’s phone rings. She frowns and answers the phone.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Hey, ma.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Gina wipes down tables with a rag. She cradles her phone with 
           her shoulder.

                                 GINA
                        Hey, baby. Can you make dinner for 
                        Minnie and Stevie tonight? Looks 
                        like I’m working the late shift 
                        again.

           INTERCUT JOY/GINA

                                 JOY
                        Sure, but I might be home a little 
                        late.

                                 GINA
                        Where you at?

                                 JOY
                        Oh, I’m just...doing some work for 
                        the yearbook.

                        too many extracurriculars.

           Gina swings the rag over her shoulder. She grabs a WATER 
           PITCHER off the counter. She gives CUSTOMERS refills.  

                                 GINA
                        Look at my baby. Overachiever.

                        It’s not that big of a deal...

                        Northwestern next year on the 
                        Haines Foundation Scholarship. It’s 
                        very prestigious.

                        daughter?

                                 JOY
                        I don’t have the scholarship yet.

                                 GINA
                        But you will. Said so yourself.

           Joy looks down at her lap. 

                                 JOY
                        I gotta go, Ma.

                                 GINA
                        Alright. Be safe, baby.

           Joy hangs up the phone.

                                 SONYA
                        Man. It’s gonna be so awk when your 
                        mom finds out you didn’t get the 
                        scholarship.

                                 JOY
                             (annoyed)
                        Oh, I’m getting that scholarship. 
                        With or without a recommendation 
                        from that jerk face.
                                 SONYA
                        Jerk face? More like fine face, am 
                        I right?

           Sonya holds her hand out for a dab. Joy leaves her hanging.

                                 RAYNE
                        Well, well, well. Looks like 
                        Principal Perfect is taking off a 
                        little early today.

           Through the WINDSHIELD, the girls see Jerald emerge from the 
           school. He waves to students lounging on the steps and 
           marches toward the parking lot. He climbs into a CHERRY RED 
           CONVERTIBLE and starts the ignition. The radio blasts DAVE 
           MATTHEWS BAND. He puts the top down and proceeds to speed out 
           of the parking lot.

                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        Here we go.

           Rayne puts the Jeep in drive, following Jerald.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The girls trail Jerald at a safe distance. Jerald drives 
           recklessly. He weaves in and out of traffic. Rayne struggles 
           to keep up.

           Jerald makes a sharp right turn onto a DIRT ROAD lined with 
           massive oak trees. The never-ending road twists and turns 
           until they finally happen upon their destination. A gated 
           community.

           The gate slowly opens as Jerald’s car nears. The convertible 
           races inside. Rayne revs the engine, launching the Jeep into 
           the neighborhood before the gate closes.

           INT. RAYNE’S JEEP - DAY

           The girls stare at the view. Wide eyes. Jaws dropped.

           Humongous two-story homes with white picket fences and bright 
           green lawns. CHILDREN ride their bikes. COUPLES walk their 
           dogs. Grins on their faces.  

                                 SONYA
                        I don’t know how to say this 
                        without sounding like an asshole, 
                        but I thought teachers were 
                        supposed to be poor.
                                 JOY
                        They are. This doesn’t make sense.

                                 RAYNE
                        But it does. I did a little digging 
                        to prepare for our investigation. 
                        Jerald is a trust fund baby. His 
                        dad co-founded Buena Comida.

                                 JOY
                        The Mexican food chain? A white 
                        dude founded that place?

                                 RAYNE
                        Think about it. The guacamole has 
                        raisins in it. Raisins.

           Jerald’s convertible pulls into the driveway of a classic 
           COLONIAL-STYLE home with navy blue shutters and a porch 
           swing. An AMERICAN FLAG is displayed by the front door.  

           Jerald jumps out of his car and proceeds to walk inside. 
           Rayne parks her Jeep a few houses down. 

                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        Sit back and relax ladies. We could 
                        be here for a long, long-- 

           Jerald reappears in the doorway, hands on his hips. He now 
           wears a POLO SHIRT and FLANNEL SHORTS. He struts down his 
           driveway and down the street.

                                 JOY
                        Where is he going?

                                 RAYNE
                        Only one way to find out.

           Rayne puts the car in drive and follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - DAY

           Dozens of WHITE NEIGHBORS gather for a block party. Jerald 
           mingles with guests. WAITERS serve hors d'oeuvres. BARTENDERS 
           prepare mixed drinks at the bar. Several white folding chairs 
           surround a microphone at the center of the cul-de-sac. 

           Joy, Rayne, and Sonya pop up behind a bush. 
                                 SONYA
                        It’s settled. I’m moving here. 
                        Either of you down to split the 
                        rent?

                                 JOY
                        We wouldn’t fit in.

                                 SONYA
                        Excuse you. 

                                 RAYNE
                        She’s right. Look around.

           Sonya scans the party, eyeing every single guest. 

                                 SONYA
                        Damn. It’s whiter than a blizzard 
                        in here.

           An intimidating MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN struts up to the microphone 
           wearing a conservative dress and pearls. She taps the mic and 
           clears her throat, beginning to address the crowd.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                        Attention, everyone! Please find a 
                        seat. It’s time to get started.

           The crowd quiets down and moves to the folding chairs.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        For those of you who don’t know me, 
                        my name is Mrs. Terri Kensington. 
                        My husband, William Kensington, is 
                        the mayor of our lovely Glen Cove. 

           A polite round of applause.

                                 TERRI
                        He may be the mayor, but I’m the 
                        president. The president of the 
                        Cove Heritage Neighborhood 
                        Association. Four years running.

           NEIGHBOR BILL (40s) jumps up from his chair.

                                 BILL
                             (chants)
                        Four more years! Four more years!

                                 TERRI
                        Stop it, stop it. You’re far too 
                        kind. Please have a seat, Bill.
           Like a well-trained dog, Neighbor Bill does as he’s told.

                                 TERRI (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get to the agenda, shall we? 
                        Now, I’m aware several of you have 
                        children at Glen Cove High School. 
                        Many of you have expressed concerns 
                        about protests on campus. Lucky for 
                        us, there’s someone willing to 
                        address that very issue tonight. 
                        And he lives right here in our 
                        special neighborhood. Please 
                        welcome Glen Cove Principal Jerald 
                        O’Donnell. Jerry?

           The crowd gives him a warm welcome. Jerald basks in the 
           glory, flashing his million dollar smile. Terri hugs Jerald a 
           little too tight before she lets him take center stage. 
           Jerald speaks into the microphone.

                                 JERALD
                        Thank you for having me. It’s true. 
                        There have been protests at Glen 
                        Cove in recent days. Students have 
                        brought forth concerns about our 
                        school mural. Issues of historic 
                        inaccuracy and insensitive 
                        depictions of our Native American 
                        friends.

           Murmurs from the crowd.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        However, that same mural has 
                        welcomed thousands of students to 
                        Glen Cove High School for the past 
                        seventy years. This will all blow 
                        over in time. But I assure you 
                        this: the mural is here to stay.

           The crowd bursts into applause and cheers. Outraged, Joy 
           jumps up from behind the bush.

                                 JOY
                             (loudly)
                        What the actual fuck-- 

           Rayne immediately yanks Joy back down behind the bush. 
           Neighbors look around wildly.

           Terri gently pushes Jerald to the side, moving back in front 
           of the microphone.  
                                 TERRI
                        Thank you, Jerald, for that update. 
                        I think we can all agree it would 
                        be a shame for the mural to be 
                        removed. Now, let’s move on to the 
                        next item on the agenda: The Summer 
                        Soiree.

           In the distance, Joy, Rayne, and Sonya crawl out from behind 
           the bush and away from the cul-de-sac.

           INT. RAYNE’S JEEP - DAY

           Rayne drives away from the cul-de-sac. Sonya snaps pictures 
           of the neighborhood while Joy boils with anger in the 
           backseat. 

                                 JOY
                        He’s a liar. A goddamn liar. A 
                        motherfucking liar!

                                 RAYNE
                        Joy, pull it together. We’re not 
                        done here.

           Rayne parks a few doors down from Jerald’s house.

                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        I need you guys to go inside and 
                        see what you can find.

                                 JOY
                        You’re not coming with?

                                 RAYNE
                        Someone has to be the lookout. 
                        Since Sonya has a way with the 
                        camera--

                                 SONYA
                        I took ninety selfies in under a 
                        minute once.

                                 RAYNE
                        --and you have some obvious anger 
                        to resolve, I figure I should be 
                        the lookout.

           Rayne grabs a duffel bag from the backseat. She digs through 
           it, retrieves TWO PAIRS OF GLOVES, and hands them to Joy and 
           Sonya. 
                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t touch anything. Don’t leave 
                        anything behind. 

           Rayne UNLOCKS the car doors.

                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        And don’t fuck this up.

                                 SONYA
                        Would it kill you to say please?

           Sonya begrudgingly gets out of the vehicle. Rayne gives Joy a 
           slight nod of encouragement. Joy takes a moment to collect 
           herself and exits the Jeep. 

           EXT. JERALD’S HOUSE - DAY

           Joy and Sonya creep up to the front door. Locked. They check 
           the windows next. Also locked. 

           They scurry around to the side of the house. They spot a 
           window, half open. Joy suddenly stalls. 

                                 JOY
                        I don’t think we should do this.

                                 SONYA
                        Are you really gonna chicken out? 
                        We already got out of the car.

                                 JOY
                        It’s a federal crime.

                                 SONYA
                        So is taking someone else’s mail, 
                        but I read my neighbor’s Cosmo 
                        every month. Now, woman the fuck up 
                        and let’s go.

           Sonya bends over and clasps her hands together. She looks at 
           Joy expectantly. Joy groans and places one foot into Sonya’s 
           hands. Sonya hoists her through the window. She lands inside 
           with a LOUD CRASH.

                                 JOY (O.S.)
                        I’m okay!

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JERALD'S GUEST BATHROOM - DAY

           Sonya jumps down from the window. Joy cleans up the 
           toiletries she knocked over upon entry. They look around, 
           pleasantly surprised. Potpourri in a decorative bowl. Plush 
           towels on the rack.

                                 SONYA
                        Surprisingly clean for a dude. He’s 
                        even got the foamy soap.

           She starts snapping photos with her phone.

                                 JOY
                        C’mon. Let’s go.

           Joy and Sonya exit the bathroom.

           INT. JERALD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sonya and Rayne enter the gigantic living space. A 
           sophisticated yet modern aesthetic. THREE LARGE SELF 
           PORTRAITS of Jerald hang on the wall behind the L-shaped 
           sofa. 

                                 SONYA
                        Damn, Jerald. I see you with the 
                        natural lighting and the self love.

           Sonya plops down onto the sofa.

                                 SONYA (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god. Joy, you have to sit on 
                        this couch. Come sit.

                                 JOY
                        Sonya, we do not have time for-- 

           Sonya pulls Joy down next to her.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Oh. This is nice. This is really 
                        nice.

           Joy becomes distracted by a MANILA FOLDER on the coffee 
           table. The label reads HAINES FOUNDATION.

                                 SONYA
                        The coffee table’s nice, right? 
                        What kind of wood is this? Oak?
           Joy swipes the folder from the table and examines its 
           contents, finding files on previous Haines Scholarship 
           recipients.

                                 SONYA (CONT'D)
                        Anything good in there?

                                 JOY
                        I’m not sure yet.

           She closes the folder and tosses it to Sonya.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Take pictures of everything in that 
                        folder. I’m going to find his 
                        bedroom.

           Joy departs the living room while Sonya takes snapshots.

           INT. JERALD'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Joy peeks her head inside. She slowly steps into the room, 
           taking in her surroundings. Neutral tones. Modern art design 
           on the walls. The massive king-size bed is perfectly made. 

           Joy investigates the contents of the dresser. Then the side 
           table. Nothing of interest. She huffs and pushes her way into 
           the 

           CLOSET

           Joy finds the light switch and flicks it upward, illuminating 
           the room. Her jaw immediately drops.

           The closet is the size of a small apartment. Color-
           coordinated shirts and jackets line the walls. Dozens of 
           pairs of shoes are organized in cubbies. She opens a drawer 
           to find an impressive watch collection.  

           Joy becomes distracted by her environment and bumps into a 
           wall, knocking a SMALL BOX off of a shelf and onto the floor. 
           A flood of POLAROIDS spill out of the box. Joy tilts her 
           head. She squats down to examine the photos.

                                 JOY
                        Jackpot.

           The polaroids show white people in BLACKFACE. Each of them 
           dressed as notable black entertainers and politicians. Joy 
           becomes increasingly disgusted as she flips through the 
           photos. She finds a photo of Jerald dressed as Barack Obama 
           and flips it over. Handwritten on the back - Blackface Party 
                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Gotcha, O’Donnell.

           She continues to skim the photos. She slowly realizes Jerald 
           isn’t the only recognizable face in them. AMY. BRETT. 
           NEIGHBOR BILL. THE WOMAN IN WHITE. They are all there too.   

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        What the--

           Joy’s phone buzzes. She looks at the notification.

                                 RAYNE (TEXT)
                        Jerald sighting. Get out now!

           Joy promptly puts the polaroids into her back pocket. She 
           returns the box to its spot on the shelf and rushes out of 
           the closet.

           INT. JERALD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sonya takes selfies of herself on the sofa. Joy runs into the 
           room, grabs her arm, and pulls her into the...

           FOYER

           They make their way to the front just as the door UNLOCKS. 
           Their eyes widen. They rush into the coat closet, quickly 
           closing the door behind them. 

           Jerald and Terri stumble into the house, sloppily making out. 
           Terri pulls away, out of breath.

                                 TERRI
                        Your speech was so hot, Jer-Bear. 

           He picks her up. She wraps her legs around his waist.

                                 JERALD
                        You think so? I was honestly 
                        worried about my hair. Did my hair 
                        look okay?

                                 TERRI
                        Amazing.

           Terri grabs his hair and yanks it. She smashes her lips to 
           his. 
           INT. COAT CLOSET - DAY

           Joy and Sonya cringe upon hearing a series of muffled moans 
           and grunts. Sonya lowers her voice, whispering to Joy.

                                 SONYA
                        I’m gonna throw up.

                                 JOY
                             (responding quietly)
                        Don’t do it. Don’t you do it.

           The moans grow louder.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        You have to take a picture.

                                 SONYA
                        I’d rather claw my eyes out.

                                 JOY
                        Sonya. Take the goddamn picture.

           Sonya grimaces. She gets her phone in position and pushes the 
           door open just a tad. Through the door opening, she sees 
           Jerald and Terri tangled together, fully-clothed. Sonya 
           squirms and takes a series of photos. She quietly closes the 
           door.

                                 SONYA
                        I think...I think this ruined sex 
                        for me.

                                 JERALD (O.S.)
                        I’m going to make us some drinks. 
                        I’ll meet you in the bedroom.

                                 TERRI (O.S.)
                        Don’t keep me waiting too long.

           Footsteps sound from outside the door.

                                 JOY
                        This might be our shot.

           She peeks through a crack in the door. No one in sight. Joy 
           and Sonya tiptoe out of the coat closet and back into the... 

           FOYER

           They creep quietly toward the door.
                                 TERRI (O.S.)
                             (yelling from upstairs)
                        Oh, I almost forgot to ask.

           Joy and Sonya hesitate. Terri’s heels click-clack down the 
           stairs. She returns to the foyer. Miraculously, Joy and Sonya 
           have vanished.

                                 TERRI (CONT'D)
                        William is meeting with the Haines 
                        Foundation Board this week. Will 
                        you be there?

           Jerald returns with two glasses of whiskey.

                                 JERALD
                        Nope.

                                 TERRI
                        Why not?

                                 JERALD 
                        Those people have a negative impact 
                        on my aura. That’s why. Plus, I’ve 
                        done my part. I wrote a 
                        recommendation letter today for the 
                        most qualified applicant. An all-
                        star student. No one deserves it 
                        more.

                                 TERRI
                        Your niece’s friend, right?

                                 JERALD
                        Ugh, no. Fuck her. I recommended 
                        Tanner Hollingsworth the Third.

           Terri stares at him blankly.

                                 TERRI
                        But the scholarship is for black 
                        students.

                                 JERALD
                        How dare you assume that Tanner 
                        isn’t black.

                                 TERRI
                        Jerry-- 

                                 JERALD
                        Terri, white students deserve to go 
                        to college just as much as black 
                        students. Don’t you agree?
                                 TERRI
                        Yes, but-- 

                                 JERALD
                        Far be it from me to deny that 
                        young white man of his dreams.

           Terri takes a drink from Jerald. She downs it and puts the 
           glass down onto the entryway table.

                                 TERRI
                        Just take me upstairs.

                                 JERALD
                        As you wish, my lady.

           Jerald picks Terri up, hoisting her over his shoulder.

           CREAK.

           Jerald spins around, knocking Terri’s head into the wall. She 
           groans.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        What was that?

                                 TERRI
                        Jerry, I swear to god if you don’t 
                        take me upstairs right now.

           Jerald takes one last look around the foyer before carrying 
           Terri up the stairs. He grunts with each step he takes.

                                 JERALD (O.S.)
                        Did you gain a couple of LB’s? 

           Jerald’s voice becomes more and more distant until a door 
           slams shut at the top of the stairs. The foyer is silent.

           The front window curtains suddenly slide open, revealing Joy 
           and Sonya in their hiding spot. Sonya rocks back and forth on 
           her feet, the floor creaking while she does. 

                                 SONYA
                        You’d think that a house like this 
                        would have better flooring.

                                 JOY
                        Let’s just get the hell out of 
                        here.

           Joy and Sonya make a break for the front door. The OBAMA 
           BLACKFACE POLAROID falls out of Joy’s pocket onto the floor 
           as they exit.
           INT. DRAYA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Draya sits at the kitchen table, struggling to focus on her 
           homework. Draya’s mom, KEISHA (Black, 46), enters the kitchen 
           in a bright power suit. She sets her briefcase on the 
           counter. 

                                 KEISHA
                        Hey, baby girl. How was your day?

           Draya is too distracted to answer.

                                 DRAYA
                        Mom, what do you think of Uncle 
                        Jerry?

                                 KEISHA
                        What do I think of him?

                                 DRAYA
                        Yeah.

                                 KEISHA
                        Jerald is...Jerald.

                                 DRAYA
                        What does that mean?

                                 KEISHA
                        It means, he’s your father’s best 
                        friend.

                                 DRAYA
                        Isn’t he your friend too?

           Keisha smiles, but it doesn’t reach her eyes.

                                 KEISHA
                        He’s never quite been a friend of 
                        mine.

           Keisha kisses Draya on the forehead and exits the kitchen. 
           Draya frowns.

           She pulls out her phone, scrolls through her contacts, and 
           hits dial.

           INT. SCHOOL YEARBOOK ROOM - NIGHT

           Joy, Rayne, and Sonya enter. Joy’s phone rings. She looks at 
           the screen. Draya’s calling.
                                 SONYA
                        You gonna get that?

           Joy hits the decline button and slips her phone into her back 
           pocket.

                                 JOY
                        No. It’s just Draya.
                             (to Rayne)
                        How did you get a key to the 
                        school?

                                 RAYNE
                        The news never sleeps, Robinson. 
                        But the janitor does. I stole the 
                        key during his afternoon nap.

                                 MINNIE (O.S.)
                        I really don’t wanna be here.

           REVEAL: Minnie and Stevie push past the teenagers, entering 
           the room. 

                                 RAYNE
                        To be fair, we don’t want you here 
                        either.

                                 JOY
                        Shut up, Rayne.
                             (to Minnie and Stevie)
                        I promise it won’t take long. We 
                        just have to take care of a few 
                        things. You have to promise not to 
                        tell Ma I brought you here, 
                        alright?

           Stevie and Minnie glance at each other. They look back at 
           Joy, crossing their arms. Joy sighs.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Fine. What do you want?

                                 STEVIE
                        Twenty bucks.

                                 JOY
                        Does it look like I have twenty 
                        bucks?

                                 MINNIE
                        It doesn’t look like you even have 
                        five bucks.
                                 STEVIE
                        She actually has six dollars and 
                        seventy cents in her wallet. I 
                        checked. 

           Stevie whispers into Minnie’s ear.

                                 MINNIE
                             (to Joy)
                        Six dollars and seventy cents plus 
                        extra bacon with breakfast for the 
                        next two weeks or we walk.

                                 JOY
                        Deal. Now stop talking and go sit 
                        in the corner.

           Minnie and Stevie do as they’re told. Joy turns her attention 
           back to Rayne and Sonya.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Do you think we have enough for an 
                        exposé?

                                 SONYA
                        Oh, we have more than enough. 

                                 RAYNE
                        The real question is, are you 
                        willing to take the risk? 

           Joy glances at the CLOCK. 7:19 p.m. Then, her eyes linger on 
           the picture of Jerald pinned to the wall.

                                 JOY
                        Let’s take the motherfucker down.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - Rayne furiously types away at a computer. Three empty cups 
           of coffee sit next to her. 

           - Sonya posts the scandalous affair photos on Instagram 
           through an anonymous account.

           - Joy makes copies of the blackface polaroids. 

           - Sonya sleeps on a desk. Stevie and Minnie draw on her face 
           with permanent marker.

           - The printer works in overdrive. 
           - Dozens of articles sit on the desk. Jerald’s blackface 
           photos are displayed on the front page. The title: “Two-
           Faced.” The author: Anonymous.

           - The girls beam at their work.

           - The clock now reads 11:08 p.m.

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. ROBINSON APARTMENT - DAY

           Bacon SIZZLES in a pan. Joy stands next to the stove. Minnie 
           and Stevie watch happily from the kitchen table.

           Gina enters the apartment, immediately taking in the smell.

                                 GINA
                        Bacon again, huh? You are such a 
                        good big sister.

           Joy glares at the twins. They return mischievous smiles.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Jerald’s convertible speeds into the lot, coming to a 
           screeching halt in his parking space. He steps out of the 
           vehicle, beaming from ear to ear. He gleefully skips up the 
           front steps. 

           A STUDENT ATHLETE leans against the front door. Jerald holds 
           up his hand for a high-five. The student athlete stares at 
           his hand with repulsion.

                                 STUDENT ATHLETE
                        Guess you ran out of makeup.

           She slaps his hand away and enters the school. Jerald 
           stumbles for a moment, confused. He clears his throat, 
           straightens his tie, and fixes his perfectly coifed hair.

           INT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Loud whispers fill the lobby. Copies of the blackface 
           polaroids hang on the walls. Students and faculty huddle in 
           packs reading the exposé. Two teachers, MS. MORTON and MRS. 
           YARBOROUGH, stand side-by-side. Mrs. Yarborough reads the 
           article thoroughly causing Ms. Morton rolls her eyes.
                                 MS. MORTON
                        I don’t know why you’re reading 
                        that. It’s filled with lies.

                                 MRS. YARBOROUGH
                        The facts are on the page, Debra. 
                        Check this out, he’s even sleeping 
                        with the mayor’s wife!

           Ms. Morton snatches the exposé from Mrs. Yarborough and scans 
           the page. She’s visibly disappointed.

                                 MS. MORTON
                        But...he said I was the only person 
                        he was sleeping with.

           Jerald confidently strides into the building. Ms. Morton 
           immediately marches up to him and SLAPS him across the face. 
           She huffs and walks away. 

                                 JERALD
                             (yells after her)
                        What the hell was that?

           Jerald rubs his bright red cheek. He laughs it off and turns 
           to the students. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Women. Am I right?

           His smile quickly fades upon noticing scowls from the school 
           population. He glances around the lobby, eyes landing on the 
           exposé in the hands of a HIPSTER STUDENT. Jerald yanks the 
           article from her and flips through it. The color drains from 
           his face. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                             (under his breath)
                        No. No. No. No. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

           Jerald hastily grabs every exposé in sight. He rips down the 
           photos plastered on the walls.  

                                 HIPSTER STUDENT
                        Don’t like the way you look? You 
                        racist piece of shit.

           Students echo the hipster, yelling expletives. For the first 
           time, Jerald looks fearful as the teenagers angrily crowd 
           around him. He races into his office, hiding from the growing 
           flock of young people. 
           Joy, Rayne, and Sonya (with faint marker on her face) stand 
           at the end of the hall, watching the scene unfold from afar. 
           Rayne literally gives them pats on their backs. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Joy strolls into homeroom. Draya reads the exposé at a desk 
           in the back. She surveys the room, appearing somewhat 
           anxious, until she locks eyes with Joy. Joy immediately 
           averts eye contact and claims a seat next to Frankie. He 
           leans over, resting an arm on her desk.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I know what you did.

                                 JOY
                        What?

                                 FRANKIE
                        “Two-Faced.”

                                 JOY
                        That wasn’t me.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Fine. You don’t have to tell me.

                                 JOY
                        Good. Because I have nothing to 
                        tell.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 JOY
                        I don’t.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Of course not.

           Frankie sits upright. He taps his pencil on the desk. Joy 
           scribbles in her notebook.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Nice weather outside. 

                                 JOY
                        Yeah. A little windy.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Heard it might rain later.
                                 JOY
                        I’ve got an umbrella in my locker.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Right next to the blackface photos 
                        of Jerald.

           Joy stutters. Frankie smirks.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Relax. I won’t tell anybody.

                                 JOY
                        It’s not you I’m worried about.

           Joy glances back at Draya. Suddenly, a voice speaks over the 
           INTERCOM.

                                 MRS. REESE (V.O.)
                        Joy Robinson to the principal’s 
                        office. Joy Robinson to the 
                        principal’s office.

           The class hears incessant yelling in the background over the 
           intercom.

                                 MRS. REESE (V.O.)
                        For the love of God, please hurry.

           The intercom abruptly turns off. Joy’s classmates mutter 
           while she gathers her things. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’ll walk with you. 

                                 JOY
                        No. I’ve got this.

           She reaches over and gives Frankie’s hand a squeeze before 
           exiting the room.

           INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Jerald furiously paces back and forth. Arms crossed. Sweat on 
           his brow. Face beet red.

           There’s a knock at the door. Mrs. Reese timidly pokes her 
           head inside.

                                 MRS. REESE
                        Joy Robinson is here to see you. 
           Jerald sits down at his desk. His normally perfectly coifed 
           hair hangs in his face.

                                 JERALD
                        How do I look?

                                 MRS. REESE
                        A little red...

                                 JERALD
                        Nobody asked you, Delilah. 

                                 MRS. REESE
                        You just asked--

                                 JERALD
                        Why are you still here? Send her 
                        in.

           Mrs. Reese scurries away from the doorway. Moments later, Joy 
           arrives. She sits opposite Jerald, stone-faced and ready for 
           war.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Joy.

                                 JOY
                        Principal O’Donnell.

           Jerald leans forward on his desk, clasping his hands 
           together. He lowers his voice.

                                 JERALD
                        Why don’t you just come clean? 
                        Admit what you did. It’ll be better 
                        for you in the long run.

                                 JOY
                        And what exactly did I do?

           Jerald pulls out the OBAMA BLACKFACE POLAROID from his 
           pocket. He tosses it on the table.

                                 JERALD
                        You broke into my house. Stole 
                        private photos. Published them for 
                        the school to see.

                                 JOY
                        I’m afraid none of that rings a 
                        bell.

                                 JERALD
                        This is a crime.
                                 JOY
                             (shrugs)
                        It’s only a crime if someone gets 
                        caught.

           Jerald grimaces.

                                 JERALD
                        Look. I’m trying my best to be nice 
                        because you’re best friends with my 
                        niece--

                                 JOY
                        Play niece. She’s half black by the 
                        way. But, I guess you don’t see 
                        color.

           Jerald leaps out of his chair. He moves over to Joy, leans 
           down and intimidatingly whispers in her ear. 

                                 JERALD
                        Listen up, you little shit. You 
                        think you’re gonna destroy me? Huh? 
                        You thought wrong. I’m gonna 
                        destroy you. I’m gonna make you 
                        wish you never left the hood. I’m 
                        gonna make you wish you had joined 
                        the army. I’m gonna make you wish 
                        you had a twin so you could pin the 
                        crime on her--  

           Mrs. Reese opens the door. Jerald instantly changes his 
           demeanor.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                             (to Joy)
                        And that’s why you continue to be 
                        one of my very favorite students.
                             (to Mrs. Reese)
                        Yes, Delilah?

                                 MRS. REESE
                        Mrs. Kensington is on the phone for 
                        you. 

                                 JERALD
                        Thank you. Tell her I’ll just be a 
                        minute.

           Mrs. Reese nods and exits. Jerald proceeds to finish his 
           threatening spiel.
                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna make you wish you were 
                        never fuckin’ born, kid. 

           Joy picks at her nails, unfazed.

                                 JOY
                        You think the mayor knows about the 
                        affair?

                                 JERALD
                             (points to the door)
                        Get the fuck out of my office.

                                 JOY
                        Gladly.

           Joy pushes past Jerald, but she pauses in front of the door.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Oh, and Principal O’Donnell? I’ll 
                        be going to college with or without  
                        that scholarship. I don’t know how 
                        yet...but I know that I sure as 
                        hell don’t want any help from you.
                             (nods to the phone)
                        Tell Mrs. Kensington I say hello.

           Joy leaves. Jerald refocuses his attention to the phone, 
           takes a deep breath, and answers.

                                 JERALD
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, Ter-Bear.

           He immediately pulls the phone away his ear. Terri yells 
           through the receiver, going on a prolonged rant. Then, 
           suddenly, the line goes dead. Jerald sighs, hangs up, and 
           contemplates his next move.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)

                        Delilah! I need all students in the 
                        auditorium for an emergency 
                        assembly. Now!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           A packed room. Students chat amongst themselves. Joy squeezes 
           her way through a crowded row of seats, finding a spot in the 
           middle. 
           The stage lights rise. Jerald steps up to the podium. Upon 
           his appearance, the audience boos loudly. Jerald clears his 
           throat and speaks into the microphone. 

                                 JERALD
                        You all have every right to be 
                        upset with me. I took advantage of 
                        your trust.

                                 STUDENT #1
                        Racist!

                                 STUDENT #2
                        Get off the stage!

           More students yell from the audience. Jerald dodges random 
           items of food thrown from the crowd. He frantically glances 
           around the room, seemingly looking for a way out-- when 
           suddenly, he breaks into a dramatic COUGHING FIT. 

           The crowd watches uncomfortably as he hacks on stage.

                                 JERALD
                        I’m sorry. Oh, I’m so sorry. It 
                        must be a side effect of the 
                        cancer.

           The audience mumbles. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        I apologize for burdening you with 
                        this truth so abruptly. I received 
                        the diagnosis three months ago. I 
                        was trying my best to keep this to 
                        myself. I don’t deserve your pity 
                        after the things I’ve done.

           Joy rolls her eyes. She slinks down in her seat, covers her 
           mouth, and disguises her voice.

                                 JOY
                             (yells)
                        What kind of cancer?

           Jerald searches the crowd for the person who asked the 
           question, but he’s unsuccessful.

                                 JERALD
                        Colon. Doctors say that it has 
                        spread to my brain. I’m afraid I 
                        might not have long left. Two, 
                        maybe three years tops. The fact 
                        that I might not get to see some of 
                        you graduate breaks my heart.

                        After all, I do consider each and 
                        everyone of you my children. 

           Jerald bursts into tears. Mrs. Reese runs onto stage with a 
           box of tissues. He quietly thanks her and wipes his damp 
           cheeks.

           The crowd buys it. Students hold back tears. 

                                 STUDENT #3
                        We love you, Jerald!

                                 STUDENT #4
                        We know you didn’t mean it! You’re 
                        the best!

           The audience rises to their feet. They start to chant.

                                 CROWD
                        Jerald! Jerald! Jerald!

                                 JOY
                        You gotta be kidding me.

           An irate Joy remains seated, barely able to contain her 
           exasperation. She looks back at Rayne and Sonya, neither of 
           whom can hide their bewilderment. 

           Joy then shifts her attention to Draya. She stands on the 
           other side of the auditorium with her peers. An unreadable 
           expression on her face.

           Finally, Joy returns her focus to the stage. Jerald beams 
           triumphantly.

           INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE - DAY

           Teachers and faculty enjoy light conversation at generic-
           looking tables. In the corner, Mr. Jefferies sits alone. He 
           flips through the newspaper. A coffee stain visible on his 
           dress shirt.

           Joy, Rayne, and Sonya barge into the room. Mr. Jefferies 
           promptly tries to hide behind his paper.

                                 SONYA
                        Mr. Jefferies. We can see you. 

           Mr. Jefferies drops the paper. Clear annoyance on his face.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Oh. Hi, girls. 
                                 RAYNE
                        Please don’t take this the wrong 
                        way, but where the hell have you 
                        been? 

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Around.

                                 JOY
                        Around where?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Not that it’s any of your business, 
                        but I had a family emergency. Turns 
                        out, my brother’s wife-- 

                                 RAYNE
                        We don’t have time to pretend to 
                        care. Are you aware of everything 
                        that’s happened today?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Vaguely.

           Mr. Jefferies takes a long sip of his coffee.

                                 JOY
                        Well? Are you going to do anything 
                        about it?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        About what?

                                 RAYNE
                        Jerald. He’s faking a cancer 
                        diagnosis to distract from his 
                        blatant racism. 

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        I try not to get involved in school 
                        matters.

                                 RAYNE
                        That’s literally your job.

           Mr. Jefferies, feeling prying eyes, peers around the room. He 
           signals for the girls to lean closer. They oblige. He lowers 
           his voice.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Look. Those pictures pissed me off 
                        too, but politics are involved 
                        here. That man has been tryna get 
                        rid of me since the day I got here.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        All I gotta do is step outta line 
                        once and...   

           He uses his hand to make the CUTTHROAT GESTURE. 

                                 SONYA
                             (confused)
                        He’s gonna massage your neck?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        He’s gonna get me fired.

                                 JOY
                        What about the school board? Can’t 
                        they do something?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                             (loudly)
                        The school board won’t do shit!

           Mr. Jefferies coworkers whip their heads around, giving him 
           daggers. He shields his face with one hand.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        Superintendent Powell has been 
                        trying to take down O’Donnell since 
                        she was appointed. 

                                 JOY
                        Why?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        It’s plain and simple. She’s sick 
                        of his privileged ass. The only 
                        reason O’Donnell has this job is 
                        because his daddy is the school 
                        district’s biggest donor. It’s 
                        shitty, but that’s just the way it 
                        is. 

           He stands abruptly from his chair.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        I’m afraid there’s nothing I can 
                        do. 

           Mr. Jefferies drags his feet toward the door but stops short. 
           He looks at the determined students with sad eyes.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        If it makes you feel any better, 
                        I’ve always thought the guy 
                        deserved a nice, swift punch in the 
                        face.
           With one last look at the girls, Mr. Jefferies disappears 
           from the lounge. The girls exchange devastated glances. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Hungry students swarm the space. Joy, Rayne, and Sonya move 
           down the lunch line, trays in hand. The LUNCH LADY plops peas 
           onto Rayne’s plate. They glare at each other, forcing Sonya 
           to drag Rayne away.

           The girls spot an unoccupied table near the window and claim 
           the seats. Joy stabs at her food with her fork. Frustrated, 
           she throws her utensil down onto her plate.

                                 JOY
                        How can one person have so much 
                        power over people?

           Rayne simply points to her skin.

                                 RAYNE
                        That’s how.

                                 SONYA
                        And having a dick doesn’t hurt.

                                 JOY
                        Maybe. But does he have the balls 
                        to go up against us?

           Rayne and Sonya exchange glances.

                                 RAYNE
                             (smirks)
                        To be honest, I always thought he 
                        was overcompensating for something.

           The girls break into laughter. 

           Frankie takes notice from a few tables over. He bids farewell 
           to his friends, grabs his lunch tray, and saunters over. With 
           a curious look on his face, he attempts to insert himself 
           into the conversation.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What’s so funny?

           Still chuckling, the girls ignore him.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Was there a joke? I like jokes.
           Joy glances out the window into the courtyard. She suddenly 
           stops laughing. 

                                 JOY
                        What the... 

           Joy rises from the table and bolts out of the cafeteria. 
           Sonya, Rayne, and Frankie run after her.

           EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

           A beautiful enclosed space with various flowers and plants. A 
           three-tier traditional limestone FOUNTAIN is mounted in the 
           middle of the courtyard. 

           Nearby, CHEERLEADERS man a table with a LARGE BANNER attached 
           to the front. It reads “HELP OUR FEARLESS LEADER. DONATE 
           TODAY.” Jerald’s framed headshot sits in the center of the 
           table.

           CYNTHIA (17), an overly peppy cheerleader with an overly 
           peppy ponytail, accepts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL from a LOVESICK 
           SOPHOMORE. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                             (to Lovesick Sophomore)
                        Jerald’s health is dependent on 
                        loyal students like you, Craig.

                                 LOVESICK SOPHOMORE
                        My name’s Greg-- 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Thank you so much, Craig. See you 
                        around.

           Cynthia waves the Lovesick Sophomore away. 

           Joy charges into the courtyard and beelines for the table. 
           Sonya, Rayne, and Frankie trail behind.

                                 JOY
                        Cynthia, what the fuck are you 
                        doing?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Nice to see you, Joy. Would you 
                        like to donate?

                                 JOY
                        No!
                                 CYNTHIA
                        A dollar goes a long way. 

                                 JOY
                        The man is a monster. Why are you 
                        hosting a fundraiser for him?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        He’s not a monster.

                                 JOY
                        Blackface. Recommending white 
                        students for a black scholarship. 
                        Having an affair with the mayor’s 
                        wife. Need I go on? 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I think he’s just a man who’s been 
                        blinded by his own privileges in 
                        life. He shouldn’t have to die 
                        because of that.

                                 JOY
                        He’s lying about the fucking 
                        cancer! He’s lying!

           Cynthia crosses her arms.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Joy, everyone knows you’re just 
                        upset about the scholarship. Sucks 
                        to suck. 

           Joy launches at Cynthia, but Frankie grabs her by the waist 
           and carries her out of the courtyard. Sonya and Rayne stay 
           behind. They glare at Cynthia. 

                                 RAYNE
                        Hey, Sonya. What’s the term for 
                        someone who thinks they know 
                        everything when in actuality they 
                        know nothing?

                                 SONYA
                        Know-it-all?

                                 RAYNE
                        No.

                                 SONYA
                        Braggart?

                                 RAYNE
                        Nope.
                                 SONYA
                        Oh, stupid-ass-bitch.

                                 RAYNE
                        That’s the one.

           Rayne knocks over the can of donations. She proceeds to flee 
           the courtyard with Sonya.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Joy stomps down the hall. Frankie jogs to catch up.

                                 JOY
                        Leave me alone, Frankie.

           Frankie cuts her off, blocking her path for a second time 
           this week. This amuses Frankie.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We gotta stop meeting like this.

           Joy rolls her eyes and attempts to brush past him.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Wait! I just wanna help. Tell me 
                        how I can help.

           Joy glances at the TRASH BIN beside her. She spots several 
           copies of the Two-Faced exposé crumpled up inside. She 
           exhales.

                                 JOY
                        You can’t. Game over. He wins. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        You can’t just give up.

                                 JOY
                        I have no choice, Frankie! That man 
                        will always win. No matter who he’s 
                        up against.

                                 FRANKIE
                        But he’s never been up against Joy 
                        Robinson before. And from what I 
                        heard, she ain’t no punk.

           They gaze into each other’s eyes. They slowly lean in, 
           preparing for a fairytale moment, until-- 
                                 DRAYA (O.S.)
                        Oh, hell no. Absolutely not. Step 
                        away from her, Frankie!

           Draya stands at the end of the hall. She gives Joy an 
           apologetic look.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        I’m the only one who gets to 
                        comfort my best friend after this 
                        shitty day.

           On the brink of tears, Joy sprints over to Draya and hugs her 
           tight. 

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        I’m so sorry. I should’ve listened 
                        to you.

                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry, too.

           Frankie rocks back and forth on his feet, awkwardly watching 
           the exchange.

                                 DRAYA
                        Fuck off, Frankie.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yep.

           Frankie takes off down the hall. Draya turns to Joy.

                                 DRAYA
                        Look, you don’t owe me an apology. 
                        You were right. I was just too 
                        blind to see it. He manipulated me. 
                        He manipulated everyone. It’s our 
                        turn to manipulate him. 
                             (beat)
                        Together.

                        What did you have in mind?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL YEARBOOK ROOM - DAY

           Rayne stares straight ahead, embarrassed. Sonya dances wildly 
           around with room with HEADPHONES on.
                                 SONYA
                             (singing)
                        Why men great ‘til they gotta be 
                        great.
                             (yells to Rayne)
                        I’m listening to Lizzo!

                                 RAYNE
                        You don’t say!

                                 SONYA
                             (singing)
                        I’m a hundred percent that-- 

                                 RAYNE
                        Bitch!

                                 SONYA
                        Yasss! Get into the Lizzo spirit! 

                                 RAYNE
                        No, I mean there’s an actual bitch 
                        in the room.

           Joy and Draya enter the room. Sonya ignores them and 
           continues to dance.

                                 DRAYA
                        Rayne, didn’t your parents teach 
                        you to be polite?

                                 RAYNE
                        Yes. They also taught me to be 
                        honest.

                                 JOY
                        Everyone just take a step back and 
                        calm down. Sonya, stop dancing!

           Sonya pauses mid-twerk. She reluctantly takes off her 
           headphones. 

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                             (to Rayne)
                        Draya and I came up with the 
                        perfect plan to take down 
                        O’Donnell. For real this time. 
                        I know you two don’t like each 
                        other. But for the sake of taking 
                        down the devil himself, would you 
                        please try and tolerate each other?
                           RAYNE
                                                          DRAYA
           I guess.
                                                (under her breath)
                                              If she can shut her mouth for 
                                              two seconds.

                                 RAYNE (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 DRAYA
                        I said what you said.

           Rayne rolls her eyes. She moves to the front of the room.

                                 RAYNE
                        So, what’s this perfect plan of 
                        yours?

                                 DRAYA
                        Dinner.

           Rayne stares at her blankly.

                                 RAYNE
                        Well, I’ve heard enough. Your 
                        services will no longer be needed. 

                                 JOY
                             (sternly)
                        Rayne.

           Rayne sighs.

                                 RAYNE
                             (to Draya)
                        Continue.

                                 DRAYA
                        My parents invited Jerald over for 
                        dinner tonight.

           Sonya snaps her fingers signaling a proposal.

                                 SONYA
                        We should poison his food! Then we 
                        can dump his body in the lake.

                                 DRAYA
                        What? No. What’s wrong with you?
                             (beat)
                        Send me in with a microphone. I’ll 
                        get him to admit he’s lying about 
                        the cancer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        We record the whole thing and send 
                        it over the superintendent. If we 
                        have proof, the school board can’t 
                        ignore it.

                                 RAYNE
                        What if we’re wrong? What if he’s 
                        not lying?

                                 DRAYA
                        He is. 

           Draya suddenly becomes very interested in her shoes. She 
           wanders over to the other side of the room and props herself 
           up onto a desk.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        He rubbed his neck. 

                                 RAYNE
                        Excuse me?

                                 DRAYA
                        Jerald used to babysit me when I 
                        was a kid. When my mom and dad went 
                        on business trips.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           INT. DRAYA’S HOUSE - DAY

           YOUNG DRAYA (8) runs throughout the house. She wears a 
           Princess Tiana costume. YOUNGER JERALD (36) chases after her 
           donning a MASK. 

                                 DRAYA (V.O.)
                        We used to dress up and run around 
                        the house. Something my parents 
                        never did with me.

           Younger Jerald pops up behind the dinner table, startling 
           Young Draya. She bumps into the CHINA CABINET, knocking an 
           ANTIQUE CERAMIC GRAVY DISH off the top shelf. It shatters on 
           the floor. 

                                 DRAYA (V.O.)
                        I’d accidentally break something 
                        every time. But every time, he’d 
                        lie and say it was his fault.   
           Younger Jerald RUBS THE BACK OF HIS NECK while he explains 
           the broken dish to Draya’s parents, YOUNGER EDDIE (White, 36) 
           and YOUNGER KEISHA (Black, 36). Young Draya clocks this. 

                                 DRAYA (V.O.)
                        He gets nervous when he lies. Rubs 
                        the back of his neck. He did it 
                        today too. In the auditorium.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - EARLIER

           Draya watches Jerald’s speech from the audience. She observes 
           as he rubs the back of his neck, then breaks into a coughing 
           fit. Her jaw drops.

           END FLASHBACK

           INT. SCHOOL YEARBOOK ROOM - DAY

           Draya twiddles her thumbs.

                                 DRAYA
                        He’s lying about having cancer. And 
                        he should get what he deserves.

           Joy gives Draya’s hand a squeeze. Intrigued, Rayne taps a 
           pencil on her desk.

                                 RAYNE
                        It’s not a bad idea. The dinner, I 
                        mean.

           Draya manages a small smile. Rayne reciprocates.

                                 SONYA
                        So, no poison? 

           The girls glare at Sonya.

           INT. DRAYA’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jerald and EDDIE, now 46, roar with laughter. They sit on one 
           side of the dining room table. Keisha and Draya sit across 
           from them, clearly annoyed. Keisha takes a long sip from her 
           wine glass.

                                 EDDIE
                        And then our buddy shit his pants.
                                 JERALD
                        Shit everywhere! On the walls. On 
                        the ceiling.  

           Jerald nearly cries from laughing so hard.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        The best part is that he works in 
                        sanitation now.

           Eddie howls. Jerald directs his attention to Keisha.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        How is that delightful next-door 
                        neighbor of yours?

                                 KEISHA
                        Amy? I think she’s doing okay.

                                 JERALD
                        Good. You know, we run into each 
                        other from time to time. She always 
                        has the sweetest things to say 
                        about you, Keisha. I mean, how 
                        could she not? You are...perfect.

           He looks at her with hungry eyes. Keisha looks away.

                                 KEISHA
                             (changing the subject)
                        Jerald, Draya told us about the 
                        protests at school. Over the mural. 

                                 JERALD
                        It has been an eventful couple of 
                        days at Glen Cove. That’s for sure.

                                 KEISHA
                        How do you plan on handling it?

                                 JERALD
                        Well, the students have made their 
                        position on the issue clear. The 
                        mural will be removed by the end of 
                        the year.

                                 DRAYA
                        I thought you changed your mind 
                        about that.

                                 JERALD
                        Of course not, Draya. Don’t believe 
                        everything you hear.
           Draya winces. She adjusts the collar of her shirt, 
           accidentally hitting the TINY MICROPHONE attached to her 
           clothing. Audio feedback reverberates into Draya’s... 

           BEDROOM

           Joy, Rayne, and Sonya crowd around a laptop. They listen 
           intently to the dinner conversation. Joy holds a microphone 
           of her own.

                                 JOY
                             (into microphone)
                        D, forget the mural. Mention the 
                        assembly.    

                                 RAYNE
                        When is she gonna bring it up?

                                 JOY
                        Give her time.

           CRUNCH.

           Joy and Rayne glance at Sonya. She munches loudly on potato 
           chips.

                                 SONYA
                        What? They can eat, but I can’t?

           Joy shushes her and refocuses her attention on the laptop.

           CRUNCH.

           Joy yanks the bag of chips from Sonya’s hands and pushes her 
           hard. Sonya falls off the bed, landing on the floor with a 
           THUD.

           DINING ROOM

           The noise startles the dinner party.

                                 KEISHA
                        What was that?

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t know. I’ll check.

           Eddie begins to depart from the table. 

                                 DRAYA
                        No!

           The adults glance at Draya curiously. 
                                 JOY (V.O.)
                             (through earpiece)
                        Books! Tell them it was your books!

                                 DRAYA
                        I mean, my books. They must have 
                        fallen off my desk.

                                 EDDIE
                        How would you know that-- 

                                 DRAYA
                        Daddy, this chicken is delicious.

           Draya points to the food on her plate. Eddie, now distracted, 
           returns to his seat.

                                 EDDIE
                        Thank you, sweetheart. I spent 
                        hours trying to get the seasoning 
                        right.

                        You did good, pal.

           Jerald takes a bite of the chicken on his plate. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                             (mouth full)
                        Anyway like I was saying, those 
                        protests have been somewhat of a 
                        nuisance. But they’ve died down 
                        over the past couple of days.

                                 DRAYA
                        Probably because everyone is 
                        worried about you.

                                 EDDIE
                        Why would they be worried?

                                 DRAYA
                        I thought you knew, Daddy. Uncle 
                        Jerry has cancer. He told the whole 
                        school today during an assembly.

           Mid-gulp, Jerald chokes on his wine. Eddie pats him on the 
           back. A look of concern on his face.

                                 EDDIE
                        Cancer?

                                 JERALD
                        I have a tiny bit of cancer, yes.
                                 EDDIE
                        And you didn’t tell me?

                                 JERALD
                        I didn’t want you to worry.

                                 EDDIE
                        How long have you known?

                                 JERALD
                        Six months--

                        I thought you said it was three.

           Jerald eyes Draya. She innocently takes a bite of her own 
           chicken.

                                 JERALD
                        You’re right, Draya. Feels like six 
                        though.

                                 DRAYA
                             (to Eddie)
                        It’s colon cancer, Daddy. Already 
                        spread to his brain and everything.

           Eddie drops his fork. His eyes begin to water.

                                 JERALD
                        Aw, buddy. Don’t cry.

                                 EDDIE
                        You can have my colon. Take it.

                                 KEISHA
                        I don’t think it works like that, 
                        honey.

                                 EDDIE
                        Well, something has to work. I’ll 
                        call my friend, Jason. He’s a 
                        surgeon over at Sinai Grace.

                                 KEISHA
                        A plastic surgeon.

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t see you coming up with any 
                        suggestions, Keisha!

                                 KEISHA
                        Yell at me again! I dare you!
           Jerald stands from the table abruptly.

                                 JERALD
                        Keisha, calm down. You people can 
                        be so loud.

                                 DRAYA
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

           Jerald ignores her. The insensitive quip goes right over 
           Eddie’s head, but Keisha gives him a death stare.

                                 JERALD
                        I don’t want to ruin the night by 
                        talking about my stupid cancer. 
                        C’mon! We were having a good time.

           Keisha glances toward the kitchen.

                                 KEISHA
                        Eddie did make a triple chocolate 
                        cake. It’s delicious.

                                 EDDIE
                        Only because I used your recipe.   

           Eddie and Keisha’s demeanors soften. They hold hands across 
           the table. Jerald stares at them with disdain. 

                                 JERALD
                        You do make quite the team. But 
                        let’s not forget the reason you two 
                        met in the first place.

                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah, yeah. Thank you for daring me 
                        to ask her out.

                                 JERALD 
                        To be fair, I didn’t think you’d 
                        actually do it.

                                 EDDIE
                        You just wish you had asked her out 
                        first.

                                 JERALD
                        Maybe.

           Jerald takes a long swig of his wine. He walks around the 
           table and places a hand on Draya’s shoulder.
                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Isn’t that crazy, Draya? If I had 
                        been braver that night...I could’ve 
                        been your father.

           Draya stands unexpectedly, shaking Jerald’s hand off her 
           shoulder.

                                 DRAYA
                        I have to go to the bathroom. 
                        Please excuse me.

           Draya exits the room at a normal pace before SPRINTING up the 
           stairs. She barges into her...

           BEDROOM

           The microphone immediately emits a HIGH-PITCHED SCREECH. The 
           girls cover their ears while Sonya turns down the volume on 
           the laptop.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        You guys hearing everything?

                                 SONYA
                        Unfortunately. Please tell your dad 
                        that wine is meant to be sipped not 
                        slurped.

           Draya plops down on the bed.

                                 RAYNE
                        You gotta get to the point.

                                 JOY
                        She’s right, D. You have to get him 
                        to say that he lied.  

                                 DRAYA
                        It’s not that easy, okay? It’s not 
                        like he’s going to admit that he’s 
                        an asshole in front of my parents.

                                 JOY
                        Tell your parents that you need to 
                        talk to him about a school matter 
                        in private.

                                 RAYNE
                        Please. No one would believe that 
                        Draya wants to talk about school. 
                             (to Draya)
                        No offense.
           Draya’s face suddenly pales.

                                 DRAYA
                        I think I’m going to be sick.

           Draya sprints out of the room. Joy sighs and follows her into 
           the...

           BATHROOM

           She closes the door behind her. Draya stands in front of the 
           sink, splashing water on her face. 

                                 JOY
                        You aren’t pregnant, are you?

           Draya scowls. Joy sits on the toilet seat lid.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        I know this is hard, but you have 
                        to do it.

                                 DRAYA
                        He’s done so much for me, Joy. 

                                 JOY
                        He also lied to you. He lied to me. 
                        He lied to his best friend. Who 
                        knows what else he’s lying about?

           There’s a knock at the door.

                                 JERALD (O.S.)
                        Draya? I came to check on you. 
                        You’ve been up here an awfully long 
                        time.

                                 DRAYA
                        Uh, I’ll be right out!

           Draya hastily grabs a towel and wipes water off her face.

                                 JOY
                             (whispers)
                        Shit. I don’t think we’re recording 
                        anymore. I need you to distract 
                        him. 

                                 DRAYA
                             (whispers)
                        And how do I do that?
                                 JOY
                             (whispers)
                        Get him to talk about himself. He 
                        loves doing that.

           Draya takes a breath, opens the door and steps into the...

           HALLWAY

           Draya swiftly closes the bathroom door.

                                 DRAYA
                             (sing-song)
                        Hey, Uncle J. What’s up? 

                                 JERALD
                        I was wondering if you still needed 
                        help with your calculus teacher? I 
                        can talk to her tomorrow.

                                 DRAYA
                        Oh. I’m good actually. Think I’m 
                        just gonna study. It’s only fair.

                                 JERALD
                        What’s the point of having a super 
                        cool principal uncle if you don’t 
                        take advantage?

                                 DRAYA
                        Like I said, I’m good. Thank you 
                        though.

           Jerald nods.

                                 JERALD
                        Well, I’ve had one too many glasses 
                        of wine. Gotta relieve myself.

           Jerald puts his hand on the bathroom door handle. Draya’s 
           eyes grow wide. She quickly grabs Jerald by the shoulders and 
           whips him around. His back faces the bathroom door. 

                                 DRAYA
                        I was hoping we could talk 
                        actually.

                                 JERALD
                        About what?

                                 DRAYA
                        Everything. The pictures. The 
                        cancer you don’t have.
           The bathroom door opens slightly. Joy pokes her head out into 
           the hallway. Draya notices and immediately pulls Jerald into 
           a tight hug.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                             (over-enthusiastic)
                        I care about you, Uncle J. I want 
                        to help you. 

           Joy tiptoes behind Jerald. She scurries down the hall and 
           back into Draya’s room, accidentally closing the door with 
           force.

           The noise causes Jerald to jump. He pulls away from the hug 
           and glances around the hallway suspiciously.

                                 JERALD
                        Is someone up here?

                                 DRAYA
                        Don’t change the subject. You can 
                        tell me, Uncle J. We tell each 
                        other everything.

           Jerald runs his fingers through his hair.

                                 JERALD
                        You don’t understand. I had no 
                        choice but to lie. 

                                 DRAYA
                        There’s always a choice.

                                 JERALD
                        You saw the way everyone was 
                        looking at me. 

           Draya stares at him, slightly frightened. He smirks. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Kinda like the way you’re looking 
                        at me right now. Like I’m some sort 
                        of monster.

           He chuckles, trying to ease the tension.

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Draya. It’s still me. Same old 
                        Uncle J.

                                 DRAYA
                        Same old Uncle J. Blackface and 
                        all.
           Jerald hesitates. 

                                 JERALD
                        Those pictures were from a long 
                        time ago.

                        I didn’t realize last year 
                        qualified as a long time.

                                 JERALD
                        Look, I can only apologize for my 
                        actions so many times. 

                                 DRAYA
                        That’s the problem! You haven’t 
                        apologized at all!

                                 JERALD
                        Why should I? It’s not like I’m 
                        racist. My best friend’s wife is 
                        black.

                                 DRAYA
                        Jesus. 

                                 JERALD
                        Draya--

                                 DRAYA
                        You recommended a white student for 
                        the Haines scholarship. Over Joy.

           Jerald takes a step back, exasperated. 

                                 JERALD
                        Of course. Fuckin’ Joy. Your little 
                        friend is ruining my life.

                                 DRAYA
                        She’s just doing what’s right.

                                 JERALD
                        You tell that little bitch to stay 
                        in her lane.

                                 DRAYA
                        Don’t call her that.

                                 JERALD
                        You want me to call her something 
                        worse?

           Draya studies him carefully. Fury in her eyes.
                                 DRAYA
                        Like what exactly?

           Jerald grinds his teeth. The word on the tip of his tongue — 
           but he doesn’t say it. Instead, he takes a step back.   

                                 JERALD
                        Good luck passing calculus.

           Jerald disappears down the staircase. Draya stands frozen, 
           breathing staggered. She slowly slinks back inside the... 

           BEDROOM

           The girls look at her sympathetically. She blinks back tears 
           and avoids eye contact.

                                 DRAYA
                        You got what you needed, right?

           Draya collapses to the floor, breaking down into tears. Joy 
           sits next to her, pulling her into a warm embrace. Rayne and 
           Sonya join them, forming a group hug. The girls sit on the 
           floor in silence.

           INT. ROBINSON APARTMENT - NIGHT

           SUPER: Friday Evening. 6:00 p.m.

           The local news airs on the living room television. Gina sits 
           on the couch braiding Minnie’s hair. Stevie appears from her 
           shared bedroom and clears her throat.

                                 STEVIE
                        May I have your attention, please! 
                        Presenting the prettiest girl in 
                        the whole world. My big sis, Joy 
                        Robinson.

           Joy wears a tea-length dress. Her makeup is fully done, hair 
           pinned into an updo. Gina and Minnie marvel at her 
           transformation.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        I did her makeup!

                                 JOY
                        I let her put my lipstick on. And 
                        then I took it off and did it 
                        myself.

           Gina stands from the couch. She affectionately puts her hands 
           on Joy’s cheeks.
                                 GINA
                        You look fabulous, baby.

                                 JOY
                        Ma, I have to be honest with you-- 

                                 GINA
                        You didn’t get the scholarship.

           Joy’s jaw drops.

                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        You’ve been sulkin’ around here for 
                        days. You thought I wouldn’t 
                        notice?

                                 JOY
                        O’Donnell recommended someone else.

                                 GINA
                        Screw that guy.

           Minnie and Stevie gasp.

                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        Don’t repeat that, girls.
                             (to Joy)
                        Baby, it’s okay.

                                 JOY
                        But we can’t afford-- 

                                 GINA
                        Let me worry about that. You should 
                        be worried about having a good time 
                        tonight.

           Gina pulls out her iPhone. 

                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        Now, give me your best Tyra.

           She snaps photos, creating an impromptu photoshoot. Joy poses 
           for the camera. The doorbell rings.

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh, is that the boy?

                                 STEVIE
                        It better be.

                                 GINA
                        Girls, behave yourselves.
                             (to Joy)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        I’m surprised you found somebody to 
                        go with so last minute.

           Gina opens the front door to reveal Frankie. Wearing a suit 
           with a skinny tie and a fedora, he holds a box with a corsage 
           inside.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hi, ma’am. I’m here to take your 
                        daughter to the prom. If that’s 
                        okay with you. Oh, shit. I mean, 
                        shoot. Should I have asked for your 
                        permission? Maybe I should just 
                        go... 

                                 GINA
                        You must be Frankie. Please come 
                        in.

           Gina steps aside, letting Frankie inside. His jaw drops as 
           soon as he sees Joy. Distracted, he walks straight into a 
           LAMP. He rubs his face and tries to hide his embarrassment.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Wow. You look, you look-- 

                                 STEVIE
                        Spit it out, dumb dumb.

                                 MINNIE
                        She looks amazing!

                                 JOY
                             (to Frankie)
                        These are my sisters, Minnie and 
                        Stevie.

           Minnie yanks Frankie by the arm, pushing him onto the couch. 
           Minnie and Stevie stand in front of him, arms crossed.

                                 MINNIE
                        Exactly what are your intentions 
                        with our sister?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh, well-- 

                                 STEVIE
                        Because she’s a queen who deserves 
                        a king.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I agree-- 
                                 MINNIE
                        Are you a virgin?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 STEVIE
                        Answer the question, Frankie. If 
                        that’s even your real name.

                                 GINA
                        Girls, that’s enough. Let him 
                        breathe.
                             (to Frankie)
                        They’re protective. 

           Stunned, Frankie stands from the couch and moves beside Joy 
           who stifles a giggle.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s okay. They’re...cute.
                             (to Joy)
                        I got you this.

           Frankie takes the corsage out of the box and slides it onto 
           Joy’s wrist.

                                 JOY
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Just like you.

           Minnie makes an over-exaggerated gagging noise. Gina slaps 
           her upside head. She starts to scold her, but something 
           catches her eye on the television.

                                 GINA
                        Baby, look. They’re talking about 
                        the Haines Foundation.

           She turns up the volume. 

           ON SCREEN

           News anchor NIKKI HAMILTON (40) reports from the news desk.  

                                 NIKKI HAMILTON
                        This just in, the Haines Foundation 
                        is under investigation by the FBI. 
                        This, after previous scholarship 
                        recipients claim they only received 
                        a portion of the money they were 
                        promised.
           A photo of the BOARD OF DIRECTORS appears in the over-the-
           shoulder graphic next to Nikki’s head. Among them is Jerald’s 
           friend, Brett.

                                 NIKKI HAMILTON (CONT'D)
                        We reached out to the Haines 
                        Foundation for comment, but they 
                        did not immediately respond.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Joy’s eyes grow wide.

                                 JOY
                        Holy shit.

           Gina turns off the television. 

                                 GINA
                        Nun-uh. You better watch your 
                        mouth, little girl. We don’t speak 
                        like that up in here.

                                 JOY
                        My bad. I’m just...surprised.

                                 GINA
                        Well, thank goodness you don’t have 
                        to be involved in that mess. A 
                        blessing in disguise. 

                                 JOY
                        Yeah, I guess.

                                 GINA
                        You two better get going. Don’t 
                        want to miss the pictures.

                                 JOY
                        Let me just grab my purse.

           Joy disappears into her bedroom. She reappears moments later 
           with a small SILVER CLUTCH. Gina guides Joy and Frankie out 
           the door. She yells after them.

                                 GINA
                        Don’t come back pregnant!

           The twins join Gina in the doorway.

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t think he’s a virgin.

           Gina laughs and shakes her head.
           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Joy and Frankie walk toward his mom’s MINIVAN. He opens the 
           passenger side door for Joy.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Sorry about the ride.

                                 JOY
                             (distracted)
                        It’s fine.

           Frankie eyes her carefully.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We’re not gonna make the pictures, 
                        are we?

                                 JOY
                        Just gotta make one stop first.

           Joy and Frankie get into the van and drive off.

           EXT. CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Draya and Sabrina wait at the entrance. Draya wears an 
           extravagant gown that could be mistaken for a wedding dress. 

           Joy struts up to the hotel, slightly out of breath. Draya 
           grunts in frustration. 

                                 DRAYA
                        Where were you? You missed the 
                        pictures! And the party bus! 

           She gapes as Frankie appears behind Joy.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Please tell me Frankie is lost.

                                 JOY
                        He’s my date.

           Draya groans.

                                 DRAYA
                             (to Frankie)
                        Why won’t you go away?

                                 JOY
                        Keep it together, D.
                                 DRAYA
                        I thought you were coming with 
                        Jake.

                                 JOY
                        Why would you think that?

                                 DRAYA
                        Because you said you were coming 
                        with someone I wouldn’t want to 
                        murder.

                                 JOY
                        Draya. Be nice. 

           Draya rolls her eyes. She looks Frankie up and down.

                                 DRAYA
                        You don’t look awful.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’ll take that. You look lovely.

                                 DRAYA
                        I mean, that’s obvious.

           Sabrina puts an arm around Draya and nods toward the door.

                                 SABRINA
                        Shall we?

           Joy contorts her face, letting out a series of grunts in an 
           attempt to get Draya’s attention.

                                 SABRINA (CONT'D)
                        Oh shit. I think Joy’s having a 
                        stroke.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’ll get her some water!

                                 DRAYA
                        Don’t try to be a hero, Frankie. 
                        She’s fine. Right, Joy?

           Joy gives a thumbs up.

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                             (to Sabrina)
                        You go ahead. I gotta help Joy fix 
                        her makeup.
                                 SABRINA
                        Suit yourself. 
                             (to Frankie)
                        C’mon, Frankie. You get the first 
                        dance.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Let’s waltz back into yesteryear, 
                        madam.

                                 DRAYA
                        Ugh. And to think I was just 
                        starting to like you.

           Sabrina kisses Draya on the cheek.

                                 SABRINA
                        See you inside.

           Sabrina and Frankie enter the hotel. Draya and Joy speak in 
           hushed tones.

                                 JOY
                        I did a thing.

                                 DRAYA
                        A good thing or a bad thing?

                                 JOY
                        An interesting thing.

                                 DRAYA
                        Can we go to jail for this thing?

                                 JOY
                        No. Not unless the cops find out 
                        about the other thing.

                                 DRAYA
                        Do I need to know about the thing?

                                 JOY
                        Which thing? The first thing or the 
                        second thing?

                                 DRAYA
                        The first thing. I already know 
                        about the second thing.

           Joy considers this.

                                 JOY
                        I’m not sure how you’ll react.
           Draya links her arm with Joy’s.

                                 DRAYA
                        I trust you. Now, let’s do the damn 
                        thing.

           Joy and Draya share a smile before marching into the hotel.

           INT. CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

           The hotel lobby is overrun with high school kids dressed in 
           vintage formal attire from every decade. Joy and Draya walk 
           toward the ballroom.

           Jerald enthusiastically greets students by the ballroom door. 
           When he spots Joy and Draya, his smile fades for just a 
           moment. Joy’s grip tightens around her clutch. 

                                 JERALD
                        Joy. Draya. You ladies look lovely.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you.

           Draya ignores him. She walks ahead of Joy and enters the 
           ballroom. Jerald’s eyes remain focused on Joy.

                                 JERALD
                        Enjoy your night.

                                 JOY
                        I will.

           Joy grins. She brushes past him and sets foot into the

           BALLROOM

           The room is an overwhelming blast from the past. A JUKEBOX 
           plays vintage tunes in the corner. Peace signs and smiley 
           faces are scattered on the walls. Students have the option to 
           pose beside cardboard cutouts of Sonny and Cher or Kid n’ 
           Play. 

           Joy examines the room in awe. She joins Draya by the door.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Draya, this place looks-- 
                                 DRAYA
                        It’s a hot mess. The streamers are 
                        green instead of blue, the disco 
                        ball isn’t authentic, and to top it 
                        all off, the jukebox is on the 
                        wrong side of the room. I 
                        specifically said to put it on the 
                        left side.

                                 JOY
                        It looks perfect, okay? 

           Joy’s smile fades to a frown as she notices Jerald sauntering 
           toward them.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Let’s just try to enjoy the night 
                        before we have to deal with some 
                        serious shit.

           She grabs Draya’s arm and tugs her onto the dance floor to 
           join their dates, missing Jerald by just a hair. His gaze 
           stays fixated on them from afar.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER

           The dance floor is jam-packed. Joy, Draya, Frankie, and 
           Sabrina dance with their peers. Whitney Houston’s voice fades 
           into the tunes of a modern pop song. Draya is less than 
           pleased.   

                                 DRAYA
                        Who the fuck put this song on the 
                        playlist? The theme is Blast from 
                        the motherfuckin’ Past!

                                 SABRINA
                        What you got against my girl, 
                        Billie?

                                 DRAYA
                        You mean Billie ‘I was born in the 
                        2000s like the rest of us’ Eilish? 
                        This song is messing up my theme!

                                 FRANKIE
                        I thought you didn’t like the 
                        theme.

                                 DRAYA
                        Frankie, why do you constantly 
                        insist on talking?
                                 JOY
                        D, chill. I’ll go change the song.

                                 DRAYA
                        Thank you. Throwbacks only.

                                 JOY
                        Got it.

           Joy walks briskly over to the jukebox, passing Mr. Jefferies 
           at the punch bowl. The miserable vice principal pulls out a 
           FLASK and spikes the juice. A LANKY SENIOR approaches and 
           reaches for the ladle, but Mr. Jefferies slaps his hand away.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        No, no, son. This is adult juice.

           Joy arrives at the jukebox. She chooses a new song selection, 
           but the jukebox continues to play “Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish. 
           Joy frowns. She hits the side of the jukebox repeatedly with 
           her clutch. 

                                 JERALD (O.S.)
                        What did that jukebox ever do to 
                        you?

           Joy spins around. Jerald stands behind her, hands in his 
           pockets.

                                 JOY
                        It’s broken. Keeps playing the same 
                        song. 

                                 JERALD
                        It’s a good one.

                                 JOY
                        I’m gonna go find somebody to fix 
                        it.

           Joy starts to walk away, but Jerald stops her by gently 
           grabbing her arm.

                                 JERALD
                        Can we talk?

                                 JOY
                        No.

                                 JERALD
                        It’ll only take a second. Please?

           Joy looks over at the dance floor. Her friends are too 
           distracted to notice her current predicament.
                                 JOY
                        Fine.

           Jerald leads her out of the ballroom. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A few stragglers enter the ballroom as Jerald guides Joy to 
           the end of the hallway. He takes a gander around the deserted 
           area and lowers his voice. 

                                 JERALD
                        I think we can both agree this has 
                        gone far enough. Let’s call a 
                        truce.

                                 JOY
                        A truce?

                                 JERALD
                        We forget about the events of the 
                        past week. All of it. The pictures, 
                        the petty arguments. I’ll even 
                        write you that recommendation 
                        letter.

                                 JOY
                             (scoffs)
                        You should really watch the news 
                        more often.

                                 JERALD
                        Why would I watch the news when I 
                        can get all my information through 
                        my Twitter feed? You act like an 
                        eighty-year-old woman.

                                 JOY
                        And you act like a fifteen-year-old 
                        boy. 

           Joy takes a step forward.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Principal O’Donnell--  

                                 JERALD
                        Jerald.

                                 JOY
                        Principal O’Donnell, you have a 
                        whole school of students who look 
                        up to you.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        They admire you more than anyone. 
                        But how can you expect them to 
                        respect someone who’s a liar, a 
                        cheater, and an actual criminal? 

           Jerald narrows his eyes at her. He rubs the back of his neck.

                                 JERALD
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 JOY
                        That’s okay. The police will tell 
                        you.

                                 JERALD
                        Police? What are you-- 

                                 JOY
                        They probably don’t have great 
                        health care in prison. Good thing 
                        you aren’t actually sick.

           Joy takes a FLASH DRIVE out of her clutch. She holds it up 
           for Jerald to see.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Or, at least, that’s what you told 
                        Draya.

           She brushes past Jerald, marching toward the ballroom doors. 
           Jerald clenches his jaw. 

                                 JERALD
                        Joy. Give me the flash drive, Joy.

           Joy keeps walking. Jerald breathes heavily and raises his 
           voice. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Give me the fucking flash drive!

           Joy whips around to face Jerald.

                                 JOY
                        It’s over. It’s all over.

                                 JERALD
                        Poor, kid. You are sorely mistaken. 
                        We’re just getting started.

           A menacing smile appears on his face.
                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        Let the games begin.

           Jerald breaks into a sprint, lunging at Joy. He TACKLES her 
           to the ground and yanks the flash drive from her hand. He 
           stands, slips the flash drive into his jacket pocket, and 
           instinctively fixes his hair. 

                                 JERALD (CONT'D)
                        You don’t belong at Glen Cove, Joy. 
                        Never have. Never will.

           He scans the hallway. It’s empty. Jerald hurries away, 
           disappearing into the ballroom. 

           Joy lies on the floor, motionless. She stares up at the 
           ceiling. The light nearly blinding her until someone steps 
           into her eye-line. 

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Ms. Robinson. What are you doing on 
                        the floor?

                                 JOY
                        Oh, you know. Just thinking.

           Mr. Jefferies helps Joy to her feet. She’s slightly 
           disheveled now.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        I should go back inside.

           She fixes herself and starts toward the ballroom.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Did he take the bait?

           Joy stops in her tracks. She turns around. A smile creeps up 
           on her face.

                                 JOY
                        Like a big ass catfish.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           EXT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           SUPER: Two Hours Earlier.

           Frankie leans against his mini-van in the otherwise empty 
           parking lot. He looks around, keeping watch.
           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Joy sneaks inside. She rummages through Jerald’s desk 
           drawers, not quite sure what she’s looking for. Suddenly, she 
           notices a BLINKING LIGHT coming from the BOOKSHELF. 

           Joy approaches the bookshelf, discovering a PERSONAL LAPTOP 
           wedged between two books. She grabs it and attempts to log-
           in. She guesses a variety of passwords: JERALD. DRAYA. GOOD 
           HAIR. GREAT HAIR. PERFECT HAIR.

           Joy sighs in frustration. She glances around the room for 
           clues, eyes landing on the photo of Jerald and the Peters 
           family at Draya’s third birthday party. She looks closer. 
           Jerald isn’t focused on the camera-- he’s focused on Draya’s 
           mom. Joy raises an eyebrow and attempts one more password: 
           KEISHA. 

           She’s in.

                                 JOY
                             (whispers)
                        What a freak.

           Joy immediately searches through the laptop files. She comes 
           across an email thread between Jerald and Brett. Bank account 
           information. Money transfers. It’s all there. Jerald and 
           Brett were working together.  

           Off Joy’s reaction--

           EXT. RICHMOND HILLS - NIGHT

           Frankie’s minivan speeds past the RICHMOND HILLS WATER TOWER. 
           The suburban streets are virtually empty.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           The minivan slows to a stop in front of a quaint home in a 
           quiet neighborhood.

           INT. JEFFERIES HOUSE - NIGHT

           A mostly gray living area with minimal decorations. A FRAMED 
           PHOTO of Mr. Jefferies and his BROTHER sits above the 
           fireplace.

           Mr. Jefferies wears a baby blue tuxedo and one dress shoe. He 
           grunts as he crouches down and peers under his worn-down 
           recliner. 
                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Where is that damn shoe?

           The doorbell rings. He mumbles under his breath as he 
           struggles to stand up. Mr. Jefferies meanders to the front 
           door and opens it to find Joy and Frankie standing on his 
           porch. He stares at them, wildly confused.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 JOY
                        We need your help.

           She holds up the FLASH DRIVE. Mr. Jefferies looks at them, 
           intrigued. He steps aside and lets them in.

           END FLASHBACK

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Joy shakes Mr. Jefferies’s hand.

                                 JOY
                        It’s your turn now. 

           Mr. Jefferies grins. They stride toward the ballroom.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Joy joins Frankie, Draya, and Sabrina on the dance floor.

                                 DRAYA
                        Where were you? Is everything okay?

                                 JOY
                        It will be.

           Mr. Jefferies steps up on stage. He waves Mrs. Reese over in 
           a hurry. She holds TWO PLASTIC CROWNS and a SMALL ENVELOPE. 
           Mr. Jefferies takes the envelope and takes his place in front 
           of the microphone.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Settle down, everyone! It’s time to 
                        announce prom king and queen. 
                        Principal O’Donnell, if you could 
                        please join me on stage.

           Students erupt in applause. Jerald, calm and collected, joins 
           Mr. Jefferies on stage. They shake hands. 
                                 JERALD
                        Thank you, Darnell.

           Jerald attempts to release Mr. Jefferies’s hand, but Mr. 
           Jefferies holds on tight and continues to speak into the mic. 

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Jerald, we know the past few weeks 
                        have been rough for you, and we 
                        wanted to do something special in 
                        your honor.

                                 JERALD
                        Is that so?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Yes. I truly believe that you 
                        should get everything you deserve.

           Jerald tilts his head. He covers the microphone with his 
           hand.

                                 JERALD
                        What are you doing?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        I think you should be recognized 
                        for the things you’ve done. So, I 
                        called my little brother.

                                 JERALD
                        Your brother-- 

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Well, half-brother. Same mom, 
                        different dads. Point is, I told 
                        him about everything you’ve done 
                        for the school. For the students. 
                        He wanted to come talk to you about 
                        it.

           Jerald lets out a harsh laugh.

                                 JERALD
                        What’s the mechanic want to talk 
                        about? How to fix a radiator?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        He’s not a mechanic. He’s the 
                        mayor.

           Jerald’s eyes grow wide. 
           The ballroom doors BURST OPEN, and as if he heard his 
           illustrious title, MAYOR WILLIAM KENSINGTON (Black, 50), 
           glides into the room like a true politician. Beside him 
           stands SUPERINTENDENT TRACY POWELL (Black, 40). Rayne and 
           Sonya serve as their escorts.

           Draya glances over at Joy, who doesn’t seem at all surprised.

                                 DRAYA
                        Holy shit. 
                             (to Joy)
                        Did you do this?

                                 JOY
                        Maybe.

           Mayor Kensington shakes hands with students as he and 
           Superintendent Powell stroll up to the stage. Rayne and Sonya 
           join their friends in the audience. 

                                 JERALD
                             (to Mr. Jefferies)
                        I don’t know if this is necessary.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        It’s completely necessary. 
                        Students, please welcome Mayor 
                        William Kensington and 
                        Superintendent Tracy Powell.

           The students APPLAUD. Jerald plasters a fake smile on his 
           face.

                                 JERALD
                             (through his teeth)
                        What do you know?

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Only what I need to know.

           Mayor Kensington and Superintendent Powell reach the stage. 
           The mayor gives his brother a big bear hug before turning his 
           attention to Jerald, who looks like he may piss himself at 
           any moment. 

           Mayor Kensington shakes Jerald’s hand tightly.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                        Jerald O’Donnell, it’s a pleasure 
                        to meet you. I’m surprised we’ve 
                        never met. Us being neighbors and 
                        all.
                                 JERALD
                        You do stand out like a sore thumb. 
                             (beat)
                        You know, because you’re the mayor.

           The mayor studies him.  

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                        My brother told me about your 
                        illness. I’m so sorry to hear 
                        you’re not doing well.

                                 JERALD
                        Well, we all have our bad days. Who 
                        knows? The cancer could be gone 
                        tomorrow.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                        I bet.

           The mayor’s grip around Jerald’s hand grows tighter. Jerald 
           manages to slip his hand away. He looks over to 
           Superintendent Powell.  

                                 JERALD
                        Tracy, good to see you.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        It’s Superintendent Powell.

                                 JERALD
                        Right. Superintendent Powell.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Superintendent Powell, you look 
                        lovely this evening.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        Oh, Darnell. You can call me Tracy. 
                        Shall we get this started, then?

                                 JERALD 
                        Get what started?

           Mayor Kensington smiles his perfect politician smile and 
           steps up to the microphone. 

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                        We are here tonight to celebrate 
                        the end of your high school career. 
                        For that major accomplishment, I’d 
                        like to congratulate all of you.

           WHOOPS and HOLLERS from the crowd.
                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON (CONT'D)
                        Your principal seems to have quite 
                        the influence on you all. He’s 
                        bright, charismatic, hopeful. He 
                        seems to represent the change we 
                        need in America.

                                 PROM GOER #1 (O.S.)
                        Hell yeah, he does!

                                 PROM GOER #2 (O.S.)
                        Jerald for president! 

           The students start to chant. The mayor takes in their 
           reaction and glances at Superintendent Powell. She motions 
           for him to finish his speech.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                        Alright. Settle down, settle down.

           The chanting ceases.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON (CONT'D)
                        The faith you all have in your 
                        principal is admirable - but also 
                        troubling. Unfortunately, our role 
                        models do not always live up to our 
                        expectations. In fact, my office 
                        received some startling news this 
                        evening.
                             (to Jerald)
                        Would you like to tell them, 
                        Jerald. Or should I?

           Jerald freezes. He looks down at the crowd of students. They 
           stare at him expectantly.

                                 JERALD
                        I, uh-- 

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                        Are you stuttering because you’re 
                        ashamed? Or because you’re not sure 
                        which thing I’m talking about? 
                        After all, you’ve done so many 
                        things.

           Mayor Kensington holds up a FLASH DRIVE, identical to the one 
           Jerald stole earlier.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON (CONT'D)
                        Do you know what I’m talking about 
                        now?
           Jerald’s jaw drops. He frantically reaches into his jacket 
           pocket and pulls out his own flash drive. He looks at it 
           closely. Written in permanent marker are the words: Fuck You.

           He scans the audience, meeting Joy’s gaze. She holds her 
           middle finger up high. Smirk on her face. Mayor Kensington 
           spots Rayne in the audience.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON (CONT'D)
                        Miss Rodriguez, if you would please 
                        join us.

           Holding a PORTABLE SPEAKER, Rayne pushes her way through the 
           crowd and hops on stage. She takes the flash drive from 
           Kensington and inserts it into the speaker. Jerald’s voice 
           booms throughout the ballroom, repeating his words from the 
           night before.

           Jerald glances at the students, whose facial expressions 
           shift from confusion to pure disgust. The recording plays out 
           in full. When it ends, the students remain silent.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, Miss Rodriguez. You’re 
                        one hell of an investigative 
                        reporter.

           Rayne puts a hand over her heart. She jumps off the stage and 
           rejoins her friends. Superintendent Powell steps closer to 
           Jerald.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        Mr. O’Donnell, you are hereby 
                        suspended indefinitely pending a 
                        police investigation.

                                 JERALD
                        Police investigation?

           Superintendent Powell gestures toward the end of the stage 
           where TWO POLICE OFFICERS stand.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        Surely, you didn’t think you’d get 
                        away with stealing scholarship 
                        money.

                                 JERALD
                        I have no involvement with the 
                        Haines Foundation.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        Interesting. I didn’t mention the 
                        Haines Foundation.
           Superintendent Powell crosses her arms.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL (CONT'D)
                        Besides, we have paperwork that 
                        proves otherwise.

                                 JERALD
                             (laughs nervously)
                        This is all one big 
                        misunderstanding.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        Mr. O’Donnell, I’m going to be 
                        honest with you. I don’t give a 
                        flying fuck.

           The audience murmurs. Sonya’s eyes light up and she leans 
           over to Joy.

                                 SONYA
                        I want to be her when I grow up.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                             (to Jerald)
                        You are a grown-ass man who has had 
                        everything handed to him on a 
                        silver platter, and yet, you still 
                        tried to take advantage of the 
                        hardworking people around you. The 
                        world doesn’t owe you shit. You, 
                        Mr. O’Donnell, are what’s wrong 
                        with humanity.
                             (to police officers)
                        Please take him away.

           The police officers storm the stage and begin to read Jerald 
           his Miranda Rights. Mayor Kensington holds a hand up, 
           signaling for the officers to wait. He looks Jerald dead in 
           the eye. His politician smile fading by the second.

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                             (whispers)
                        You ever try to fuck my wife again, 
                        and I will see to it that you die 
                        in prison. It would be incredibly 
                        easy to arrange.

           The police officers cuff Jerald. He resists arrest as they 
           try to drag him off the stage. 

                                 JERALD
                        You can’t do this. I’m Jerald 
                        O’Donnell.
                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        We are very aware of your name, 
                        Jerald. And so are the authorities.

           Jerald looks as if he’s going to scream, but instead, he 
           starts to cry.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        For God’s sake, man. Just leave.

           The police escort Jerald off the stage and through the quiet 
           crowd of teenagers. He keeps his head down as students follow 
           him with wary eyes. 

           Without warning, Jerald halts. Blinking away tears, he looks 
           up and locks eyes with Joy, then with Draya. His eyes 
           pleading for help. Draya puts an arm around Joy in 
           solidarity.

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        Let’s go.

           Jerald doesn’t budge. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)
                        Did you hear me? Let’s go.

           Jerald nods slowly. Then suddenly, using his shoulder, Jerald 
           STRIKES the officer in the jaw. He ELBOWS the other one in 
           the gut causing him to topple over. With his wrists cuffed 
           behind his back, he makes a run for it, sprinting out of the 
           ballroom. While the cops struggle to gather themselves, Joy 
           bolts after Jerald. 

                                 DRAYA
                        Joy, don’t!

           Sonya and Rayne apprehensively approach the police to help 
           them. Sonya holds her hands up, her speech somewhat resembles 
           a robot. 

                                 SONYA
                        We are here to help you. Please do 
                        not pull your weapons.

           As chaos ensues among the students, Mr. Jefferies immediately 
           jumps in front of the microphone.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Don’t anybody else move! And don’t 
                        touch the punch, Joey!

           JOEY, the lanky senior from before, pours himself a glass of 
           Mr. Jefferies ‘special’ punch. He shrugs.
           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Joy emerges from the ballroom. Her eyes dart around the 
           immediate area, searching for Jerald. She catches a glimpse 
           of him bolting into the stairwell. She quickly follows.

           INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Jerald stumbles up the stairwell. Joy enters, clumsily 
           removes her heels, and jets up the steps barefoot.

                                 JOY
                        O’Donnell! Stop!

           Jerald ignores her, continuing to sprint up the never-ending 
           staircase. He frantically glances over the railing, spotting 
           Joy about two floors below. Jerald finally reaches the top of 
           the staircase and barges through the rooftop door, ignoring a 
           sign that reads: CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION.

           EXT. HOTEL ROOF - NIGHT

           The skyline sparkles in the distance. PATIO CHAIRS line the 
           rectangular-shaped SWIMMING POOL. Jerald staggers around 
           looking for a place to hide. His ears perk up at the sound of 
           footsteps in the distance. He immediately ducks behind a 
           patio chair. 

           Joy charges onto the rooftop. It’s quiet, almost serene. She 
           slowly scans the area, searching for Jerald. She hesitantly 
           ventures toward the pool.

           Jerald pops up behind Joy, but she doesn’t notice. His eyes 
           are crazier than before, reminiscent of Jack Torrance from 
           The Shining. He grabs her by the neck, putting her into a 
           CHOKEHOLD. Joy pulls at his arm, gasping for air.

                                 JERALD
                             (whispers harshly)
                        You made my life a living hell and 
                        now you’re going to pay for it.

           With all his force, he shoves Joy into the pool. She lands in 
           the water with a giant SPLASH. Jerald gazes at his reflection 
           as the ripples slowly come to a standstill. A twisted smile 
           appears on his face.

           Joy emerges from the surface, inhaling sharply. She swims 
           toward the edge of the pool and pulls herself out of the 
           water. She nearly keels over, attempting to catch her breath. 
                                 JOY
                             (panting)
                        What the hell is your problem?

                                 JERALD
                        Fuck. Honestly, I assumed you 
                        couldn’t swim.

                                 JOY
                        You were trying to kill me?

                                 JERALD
                        I was just trying to get rid of 
                        you. If death is the only way to do 
                        that, then fine by me.

                                 JOY
                        You are a psycho!

                                 JERALD
                        No, Joy. I’m simply trying to make 
                        the world a better place. 

                                 JOY
                        How exactly? By discriminating 
                        against people? By stealing from 
                        people less fortunate than you?

                                 JERALD
                        You’re the problem here, Joy! 
                        Everything points back to you! 
                        Everything was fine and dandy until 
                        you dug your dirty little nose into 
                        my business! You turned everyone 
                        against me!

                                 JOY
                        You did that all on your own.

                                 JERALD 
                        You really are a pain in the ass, 
                        you know that? I put my entire 
                        being into this school. And for 
                        what? So some little black kid like 
                        you could destroy me? I don’t want 
                        you in my school. I don’t want any 
                        of you in my school. You’re 
                        nothing.

           Joy PUNCHES Jerald square in the face. He collapses to his 
           knees, blood gushing from his nose. She stares down at him 
           angrily.
                                 JOY
                        No. You’re nothing.

           The police burst through the rooftop door, guns drawn. Mr. 
           Jefferies is right behind them. The officers survey the 
           scene, immediately lowering their weapons. 

           Jerald writhes around on the ground in pain. Joy stands next 
           to him with her hands up. Mr. Jefferies smiles at the sight 
           in front of him.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        A nice, swift punch in the face. 
                        Well done, Miss Robinson.

           Joy, drenched and disheveled, massages her hand. She manages 
           a small smile.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Students stir in the audience as Mayor Kensington gives a 
           full CAMPAIGN SPEECH on stage. Superintendent Powell stands 
           to the side, utterly appalled. 

           All eyes shift from the mayor to the entrance as the ballroom 
           doors open. Joy and Mr. Jefferies enter the venue. A TOWEL 
           drapes Joy’s shoulders and she holds an ICE PACK on her hand. 
           Her clothing and hair are still damp. Draya, Frankie, 
           Sabrina, Rayne, and Sonya immediately crowd around Joy, 
           bombarding her with questions.

           Mr. Jefferies steps aside, gives Joy a slight nod of 
           approval, and returns to the stage. He taps his brother on 
           the shoulder, signaling for him to finish up his speech. 

                                 MAYOR KENSINGTON
                        Well, students. Enjoy the rest of 
                        your prom. And remember, vote 
                        Kensington 2020.

           Mayor Kensington moves aside, handing over the spotlight to 
           Mr. Jefferies. He steps up to the mic.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        So, here’s the deal. Principal 
                        O’Donnell has officially been taken 
                        into custody. We understand that 
                        this may have been somewhat 
                        traumatic for all of you. If anyone 
                        is in need of counseling, Ms. 
                        Anderson will be available for 
                        sessions. Good night and good luck.
           Mr. Jefferies suddenly remembers the envelope in his hand. He 
           quickly opens it.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        By the way, your prom king and 
                        queen are Todd Gibson and Cynthia 
                        Miller. See you Monday.
                             (to Mayor Kensington)
                        See you at momma’s birthday.

           Mr. Jefferies tosses the envelope to the ground, struts off 
           the stage, and leaves the ballroom without another word.

           Jake, wearing his LETTERMAN JACKET over his tux, kicks the 
           jukebox. A NEW SONG starts playing — and as if nothing ever 
           happened — students dance and laugh. Rayne, Sonya, Frankie, 
           and Sabrina join them. Joy and Draya move to sit at a nearby 
           table. They watch their classmates from afar.

                                 DRAYA
                        Well shit.

           Joy nods, unable to form a sentence. They sit in comfortable 
           silence while their peers dance the night away.

           INT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Joy waves at her classmates as she walks down the hall.

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        There were some minor changes at 
                        Glen Cove after that. In the wake 
                        of Principal O’Donnell’s departure, 
                        Mr. Jefferies was named interim 
                        principal. 

           Mr. Jefferies carries a SMALL BOX labeled “STUFF” into the 
           now-empty principal’s office. He sets the box onto the desk 
           and looks around the room. He sits in his newly designated 
           chair and sighs happily.

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        Mr. Jefferies was so impressed by 
                        Rayne and Sonya’s investigative 
                        work that he even allowed them to 
                        rejoin the newspaper. Much to the 
                        dismay of the other staff members.

           In the newspaper room, Rayne berates a fellow NEWSPAPER STAFF 
           MEMBER for a poorly written article. She crumples up the 
           paper and tosses it. Sonya takes photographs of the argument. 
           She quickly gets bored and takes photos of herself instead. 
                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        But everything else pretty much 
                        stayed the same. It’s funny how 
                        quickly people can forget the bad 
                        things. Like they never happened.

           Mrs. Reese takes down a framed photo of Jerald hanging in the 
           school’s entryway. She tucks the frame under her arm and 
           walks past Frankie. He leans against the lockers while Joy 
           puts her books away. They share a sweet smile. Draya sprints 
           up to them, waving a piece of paper in the air.

                                 DRAYA
                        I passed! Joy, I passed!

           Joy and Draya jump up and down in celebration. 

                                 DRAYA (CONT'D)
                        Fuck geometry!

                                 JOY
                             (incredulously)
                        Calculus.

                                 DRAYA
                        Whatever. I passed. My parents are 
                        taking me out to dinner to 
                        celebrate.

                                 JOY
                        Really?

                                 DRAYA
                        Well technically, it’s more of a 
                        ‘we’re sorry for letting a 
                        psychopath babysit you for all 
                        those years’ dinner. Either way, 
                        I’m not paying.

           Suddenly, a voice speaks over the INTERCOM.

                                 MRS. REESE (V.O.)
                        Joy Robinson to the principal’s 
                        office. Joy Robinson to the 
                        principal’s office.

           Joy groans and hits her head against her locker. 

                                 FRANKIE
                             (smirks)
                        I thought you’d be spending less 
                        time in the principal’s office.
                                 JOY 
                        Yeah, me too. See you guys later.

           Joy shuts her locker and walks away--

           --but she returns, planting a kiss on Frankie’s lips. 

           Draya can’t help but smile. Joy takes a step back from 
           Frankie, grins, and struts away, leaving Frankie and Draya 
           alone. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Congrats on passing calculus-- 

                                 DRAYA
                        Why are you still here?

           Frankie leaves immediately.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mr. Jefferies and Superintendent Powell engage in small talk. 
           There’s a knock on the door. Joy pokes her head inside.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Joy. Please come in.

           Joy walks into the office.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        I was just telling Tracy about how 
                        you brought the O’Donnell matter to 
                        my attention. To everyone’s 
                        attention.

                                 JOY
                        It was nothing really. 

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        It’s everything, Miss Robinson. 
                        Thank you.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        I was also telling Tracy that you 
                        were prepared to apply for the 
                        Haines Foundation Scholarship. 

                                 JOY
                        Yeah. I guess that doesn’t matter 
                        much anymore. 

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        Maybe not.
           Superintendent Powell moves to stand directly in front of 
           Joy. She crosses her arms.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL (CONT'D)
                        But I’d be more than happy to write 
                        a recommendation letter for any 
                        scholarship you apply for. 

           Joy is taken aback.

                                 JOY
                        Really? But you don’t even know me.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        I know enough. Especially after the 
                        events of the past week. The 
                        recommendation is yours if you want 
                        it.

                                 JOY
                             (smiles wide)
                        Thank you. That means a lot.

           Mr. Jefferies slow claps.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES
                        Lovely. Now if you ladies don’t 
                        mind, I have a lot to do. Turns out 
                        O’Donnell is a racist criminal who 
                        also did the bare minimum at work. 

           He gets settled at his desk and points toward the door.

                                 MR. JEFFERIES (CONT'D)
                        Joy, do you mind escorting the 
                        superintendent out of the building?

                                 JOY
                        Sure.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT POWELL
                        Keep up the good work, Darnell. Who 
                        knows? We might have to knock the 
                        ‘interim’ off your new title.

           Mr. Jefferies adjusts his posture and straightens his tie. 
           Joy leads Superintendent Powell out of the room.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOYER - DAY

           Joy and Superintendent Powell walk toward the exit. They pass 
           a group of a dozen STUDENTS in smocks. With PAINT BUCKETS and 
           BRUSHES in hand, they march toward the school mural.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           An ATTORNEY leads Jerald through a crowd of JOURNALISTS and 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS. 

           The former principal sports a new, shaggier hairdo. With a 
           twinkle in his eye, he grins from ear to ear. As they reach 
           the courthouse doors, he turns and waves to the cameras.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Quiet chatter fills the crowded courtroom. Jerald and his 
           attorney sit up front. Terri sits in the back row wearing 
           sunglasses and an oversized hat. 

           A JUDGE enters and sits in her designated seat behind the 
           bench. She settles in, hovering her GAVEL over the sound 
           block.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOYER - DAY

           Crouched down, a student hovers his PAINT BRUSH over a paint 
           bucket. He dips it repeatedly into the white paint. 

                                 JUDGE (V.O.)
                        All rise.

           Paint drips steadily from the brush as the student RISES to 
           his feet.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Jerald RISES along with the rest of the courtroom occupants. 
           He brushes his hair out of his face. The judge looks him up 
           and down. An unforgiving look on her face.
           The judge reads the sentence, but we don’t hear the 
           punishment. Instead, we hear GASPS and CRIES echo throughout 
           the courtroom. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. GLEN COVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOYER - DAY

           A TEENAGE GIRL GASPS as a TEENAGE BOY brushes paint on her 
           nose. She playfully pushes him away and joins her peers in 
           front of the mural.

           The teens begin covering up the offensive painting with a 
           fresh coat of white paint. Stroke after stroke, Christopher 
           Columbus’s face slowly disappears. Students erupt in CHEERS.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY 

           The courtroom erupts in ANGER. The judge pounds her gavel and 
           the noise eventually subsides. She zeroes in on Jerald.  

                                 JUDGE
                        Mr. O’Donnell, I hope you realize 
                        how fortunate you are. 

           Jerald offers a small smile and RUBS THE BACK OF HIS NECK.

                                 JERALD
                        Yes, ma’am. I do.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
