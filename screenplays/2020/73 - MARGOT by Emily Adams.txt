           Over BRIGHT WHITE, a divine chorus sings like we’re at the 
           gates of heaven. As the voices soar, white dissolves into a 
           poster of Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, 
           clutching his astronaut helmet in his arms like a newborn 
           child.

           For a brief moment, his inanimate face comes alive -- he 
           winks at us with ‘ya, I touched the moon’ cleverness, then 
           returns to poster stoicism.

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           CLOSE ON the same poster of Neil. 

           HEAVY MUFFLED BREATHING (O.S.)

           It belongs to a round, bed-headed ANNIE MILLS (17) wearing 
           her beloved, replica astronaut helmet and staring longingly 
           at Neil. After a beat, Annie pulls off the helmet, revealing 
           her conquer-the-world face.

                                 ANNIE
                        Today’s the day, Neil. Today’s the 
                        day.

           She leans into the poster, gives him a kiss. As we pull out, 
           we see her room in full: an absolute shrine to Neil and the 
           moon. We’re talking Neil biographies on shelves, every book 
           on Apollo 11, collector’s edition Neil Armstrong dolls, and a 
           big moon-shaped carpet.

           As Annie scrambles around, getting ready, we find and push-
           into the only non-Neil, non-moon related item in the room: an 
           impressive SCRAPBOOK on a shelf above Annie’s bed, displayed 
           like the Holy Bible. The book is titled ANNIE & MARGOT BFFS 
           in gigantic, glittery letters.

           On the cover, a photo of two girls on Halloween: Annie 
           dressed as an astronaut, the other, Margot, as a perfect 
           little angel. 

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

           Like a bullet out of a gun, Annie tears down the hall. She 
           wears a t-shirt with a giant PLUTO with a caption that reads, 
           NOT MY PLANET. As she reaches the stairs, she knocks into a 
           handsome, shirtless man. This HOT GUY did not expect to see 
           Annie.
                                 HOT GUY
                             (startled)
                        Wow. So soon. Okay, so technically 
                        I’m not ‘dating’ your mother, but--

           Annie pushes right past him, ignoring his defined sex lines. 

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           Annie bolts down the stairs of the overfilled, rundown 
           apartment she’s known her whole life. 

           A booty-shorts wearing DONNA MILLS (45) holds the front door 
           open in anticipation for Annie to run through it. Donna Mills 
           is a woman that loves three things: her hairspray, her QVC 
           bronzer, and her daughter.

                                 DONNA
                        There’s my baby cakes!

           Annie takes a seat at the bottom of the stairs, hurriedly 
           puts on her ratty tennis shoes. Donna looks up the stairs, as 
           if expecting someone else.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        No Margot this morning?

                                 ANNIE
                             (tying her shoes)
                        She’s with Jesus, probably praying 
                        that I get in -- not that Mormon 
                        Jesus wants to help a woman beat 
                        out all the flubs applying to 
                        physics.

           As Annie stands up, Donna holds out a sack lunch that reads 
           TO THE MOON! Annie swipes it.

                                 DONNA
                        Jesus or no Jesus, today’s the day.

                                 ANNIE
                        Today’s the fucking day!

           With that, Annie runs out the door. This girl’s only speed is 
           sprint. Donna proudly watches her go.

           EXT. HILLSIDE WARD OF THE LDS CHURCH - MORNING

           CLOSE ON Jesus Christ. He’s made of stone, six-feet-tall, and 
           towering over a modest, brick building. 
                                 ASTHMATIC MAN (V.O.)
                             (wheezing throughout)
                        Yea, come unto Christ and be 
                        perfected in him--

           Beside stone Jesus, a brick sign reads: The Church of Jesus 
           Christ of the Latter-Day Saints. AKA The Mormon Church. 

                                 ASTHMATIC MAN (V.O.)
                        --and if ye shall deny yourselves 
                        of all ungodliness and love God 
                        with all your might, mind, and 
                        strength--

           Annie hustles into view, sweating. Her heavy backpack bounces 
           on her back. She stops at Jesus, uses his stone calf to lean 
           on and catch her breath.

           INT. SEMINARY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           A sterile room with wood panelling. Not a room you’d want to 
           be in at seven in the morning. 

                                 ASTHMATIC MAN (O.S.)
                        --then is his grace sufficient for 
                        you--

           At the front of it, gangly asthmatic ELDER STEVENSON (30) 
           struggles to read scripture Moroni 10:32 to his class of high 
           school seminary students.

                                 ELDER STEVENSON (O.S.)
                        --that by his grace, ye may be 
                        perfect in Christ--(wheeze 
                        attack)...

           As he wheezes, we cycle through QUICK CUTS OF: 

           - A mug that reads KEEP CALM AND LDS ON filled with short 
           little pencils 

           - Stacks of The Book of Mormon

           - A table with a few picked-over pink donut boxes

           Landing on the face of MARGOT ELLISON (18), a perfectly 
           poised, genetically blessed girl. She’s staring at something. 
           Fixated. Though we don’t know what it is, it surely isn’t 
           Elder Stevenson.

           Up front, wheezing Elder Stevenson picks up a Dixie cup of 
           water.
                                 ELDER STEVENSON (CONT'D)
                        One moment... 

           He drinks, ensuring he’s poured every drop into his mouth, 
           then releases a quenched sigh.

                                 ELDER STEVENSON (CONT'D)
                        There we go. Nothing beats water,  
                        nothing.

           He scans his scripture. 

                                 ELDER STEVENSON (CONT'D)
                        Where was I?...ah, righty-o: ’--and 
                        if by the grace of God--

           Back on Margot, sandwiched between two strapping Mormon boys 
           following along perfectly in their Book of Mormons. She’s 
           still staring. Now, we see at what: an imposing painting of a 
           crucified and very naked Jesus. Jesus’s holy dick is covered 
           by a single loin cloth and his holy dick is large. 

                                 ELDER STEVENSON (CONT'D)
                        --ye are perfect in Christ, ye can 
                        in nowise deny the power of God.’

           As Elder Stevenson finishes, Margot remains eye-locked on 
           Jesus’ hot bod with an aroused concentration in her gaze.

           EXT. HILLSIDE WARD OF THE LDS CHURCH - MORNING

           Still beside stone Jesus, Annie paces, looking every now and 
           again at the church doors with visible angst. Finally, the 
           doors open. Margot is first to emerge. Her eyes go 
           immediately to Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                        Margot, hurry this shit up. 

           Margot does as she’s told. She runs to Annie with gazelle-
           like fluidity, wearing a long, modest dress that would look 
           shit on anybody but her.

                                 MARGOT
                        Look:

           She unveils a standard pink donut box. She pops it open to 
           display the selection.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I picked out all your favorites:
                           ANNIE
                                                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
                                              Powdered, jelly, chocolate.
           Powdered, jelly, chocolate.

           Annie ogles the sugary array.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        God DAMNIT, you know I can’t have 
                        sugar when I’m anxious!

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - SECONDS LATER

           Annie rips into a powdered sugar donut like a lion into a 
           zebra. She holds the donut box under her arm. She and Margot 
           walk side-by-side to school. While Annie walks with 
           intensity, Margot ambles, enjoying.

                                 ANNIE
                             (in between bites)
                        My heart’s beating like a coked-up 
                        conga line. Do you hear it? You’ve 
                        gotta hear it.

                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t hear--

                                 ANNIE
                        Am I having a heart attack?

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie, it’s going to be okay. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Sure, you think that because you’ve 
                        known you were going to BYU your 
                        whole life; God couldn’t say no to 
                        a perfect Mormon with good grades 
                        who sells lemonade for children 
                        with Leukemia, whose ENTIRE FAMILY 
                        goes there, went there, or will go 
                        there:

           EXT. (POP-TO) BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY PROVO - DAY 

           As Annie lists people, they APPEAR, suddenly populating a 
           snowy landscape one by one, in front of BYU in Provo, Utah. 
           Each smiling, waving at us, and wearing matching BYU 
           sweatshirts.
                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Your grandparents, your parents, 
                        your older sister, your future 
                        brother-in-law, your younger 
                        sisters, your cousins, their 
                        parents, their grandparents--

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        Same grandparents. 

           A newly added pair of grandparents disappears at Margot’s 
           correction.

           EXT. SUBURBIA - CONTINUOUS

           Annie’s working on a jelly donut now. They’re passing a nice, 
           green park. This is an idyllic little suburb.

                                 ANNIE
                        Whatever; it’s a lot of fucking 
                        people. 

           Annie polishes off the donut, chewing throughout:

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Look, I’m not mad. How could you 
                        understand? Your parents give the 
                        Church ten percent of their income 
                        every year; the Church owns BYU; 
                        bribery is built into the system. 
                        But I can’t bribe my way into 
                        Purdue! The best I could offer 
                        admissions is a ham sandwich; and 
                        I’m not talking ‘quality ham.’ 

           Like it’s routine, Margot and Annie stop at a tall shrub. As 
           Annie barrels through thoughts, Margot goes behind it.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve worked my ass off--literally, 
                        I had that butt rash from anxiety 
                        sweat all last year--

                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        That was awful...

                                 ANNIE
                        --but at the end of the day, I’m a 
                        nobody from Butterfield County with 
                        a mom that works at Hooters. 
           INT. (POP-TO) HOOTERS - TOO EARLY TO BE AT A HOOTERS

           Donna, big on the cleavage in her tiny Hooters shirt, serves 
           wings to a table of husky construction workers. When she sets 
           the wings down, she winks into the camera.

           EXT. SUBURBIA - CONTINUOUS

           Annie noshes on a chocolate donut now, talking into the 
           shrub’s leaves. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Without Purdue, it’s no NASA, no 
                        moon, no life. And Margot, no end 
                        of summer road trip! There’d be no 
                        reason to drive to fucking Indiana! 
                        Bye bye Biggest Ear of Corn! 

           Margot emerges from behind the shrub, having just changed 
           clothes. Now, she sports a mini skirt and tighter top. She 
           pulls her weathered sketch book out of her backpack to make 
           room for her long dress which she then stuffs inside.

                                 MARGOT 
                        Annie, I think--

                                 ANNIE
                        If I don’t get in today, I’ll have 
                        to work--

           INT. (POP-TO) 7/11 - NIGHT

           An older, bag-eyed Annie works the cash register.

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        --at some off-brand 7/11 with a 
                        creepy manager named Pitz--

           A creepy PITZ (50) hovers next to a very detached Annie. He 
           smiles a wide smile.

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        --who has like, a tiny Hitler 
                        stash...

           We pop a TINY MOUSTACHE above his lip.

           EXT. SUBURBIA - CONTINUOUS

           Annie stares into space, lost in panic, staring blankly at 
           nothing. Margot looks at her, concerned.
                                 MARGOT
                        Annie...?

           Annie comes-to. She’s confused. She notices worry on Margot’s 
           face.

                                 ANNIE
                             (panicked)
                        What? Did I eat your maple bar? 
                        Fuckkk. I did, didn’t I??? I’m like 
                        a lawn mower with these things, you 
                        know that!

           Annie searches through the donut box. Finds the maple bar.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Oh thank your Jesus.

           She takes it out. Hands it to Margot. Relieved to have solved 
           the mystery, Annie looks over to a standard public high-
           school HILLSIDE HIGH, which comes alive with arriving 
           students. Possibility cresting in the morning rush. Annie 
           soaks it in.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Today determines everything.

           It’s a moment.

                                 MARGOT
                             (interrupting)
                        You have powdered sugar all over 
                        your face.

           CLOSE ON ANNIE her face is covered in powdered sugar. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        And jelly. 

           Indeed, also jelly.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        And chocolate.

           Indeed, also choco--

                                 ANNIE
                        Aw, come on! 

           She wipes her face on her sleeve like a barbarian. Turns to 
           Margot.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Better?
           CLOSE ON ANNIE her face is still a sticky canvas of donut 
           remains. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Well, no--

           EXT. HILLSIDE HIGH - DAY

           Annie furiously scrubs her face in a water fountain basin. 
           Beside Annie, Margot sketches a triceratops’ on her forearm 
           in pen.

                                 TEEN BOY (O.S.)
                        Do you mind if I fill up my water 
                        bottle, like super fast?

           Irritated, Annie picks her head up. She’s momentarily blinded 
           by the water in her eyes, but speaks anyway. 

                                 ANNIE
                        There are twelve semi-functioning 
                        water fountains on this campus--

           Annie stops when she sees who spoke. Water drips down her 
           face as she stares, dumbfounded, at STEW PHINES (17), a sweet 
           mega-nerd clutching his first-edition TURTLE MAN COMIC BOOK, 
           waiting for the water fountain. He holds a matching TURTLE 
           MAN reusable water bottle. 

                                 STEW
                        This one’s close to homeroom...

            Ruffled, Annie steps aside. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Fuck no. I mean, ya. Fuck ya. Use 
                        it. It’s public property. Who 
                        cares?

           She picks up her backpack off the floor. When she looks up, 
           Stew’s smiling earnestly at her. 

                                 STEW
                        Hope you hear good news from Purdue 
                        today, Annie. 

           Margot observes Annie, unable to handle Stew’s nerdy little 
           grin. Annie focuses her eyes on Stew’s bottle. Nervous, she 
           blurts:
                                 ANNIE
                        That bottle’s made of toxic 
                        plastic. So your kidneys are 
                        fucked.

           Stew looks down at the bottle in bewilderment.

                                 STEW
                        Huh.

           Luckily for Annie, the bell rings. So she bolts. And Margot 
           follows.

           INT. PHYSICS CLASSROOM - LUNCH

           Annie leans over a lab table, pointing to a problem set on a 
           test that has already been graded with a 106%. A bookish, 
           kind MR. FRIEDMAN (25) tries to listen, but we can tell he’s 
           done this with Annie before.

                                 MR. FRIEDMAN
                        Annie, I can’t give you extra 
                        credit just because you decided to 
                        do more. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Will you at least consider it?

                                 MR. FRIEDMAN
                             (he won’t)
                        Sure.

           Mr. Friedman looks past Annie to Margot in the back at a lab 
           table. Though her sketch book is open, she’s busy playing 
           with Newton’s Cradle Ball Toy. She clangs the metal balls 
           together, fascinated.

                                 MR. FRIEDMAN (CONT'D)
                        You’ve been coming in all year; 
                        Margot doesn’t have to sit in the 
                        way, way back.

                                 ANNIE
                             (a secret)
                        Well physics isn’t her thing -- 
                        ‘World was created in 7 days,’ know 
                        what I’m saying?

           EXT. DOORWAY OF MR. FRIEDMAN'S CLASS - MINUTES LATER

           Annie and Margot stand in the doorway, ready to go on their 
           way. Mr. Friedman bids them goodbye.
                                 ANNIE
                             (to Mr. Friedman)
                        So to be clear: if I don’t get in, 
                        it’s your rec letter.

                                 MR. FRIEDMAN
                        But if you do, which you will, it’s 
                        my rec letter.
                             (with particular interest)
                        What about you Margot? Any college 
                        plans?

                                 MARGOT
                        BYU Provo. Nothing special.

                                 MR. FRIEDMAN
                             (smitten)
                        But Utah! Great state. A lot of red 
                        rocks out there...

           Annie clocks Mr. Friedman studying the perfect symmetry of 
           Margot’s young, dewy face. Annie doesn’t like any of it.

                                 ANNIE
                        I need a tampon!

                                 MR. FRIEDMAN
                        Tampon--I mean, sure--okay!

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Annie leads Margot through double doors into a hallway full 
           of lunching students. As they walk, Margot pulls a tampon out 
           of her backpack.

                                 MARGOT
                        Here.

           She hands the tampon to Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                        What?

                                 MARGOT
                        You said you needed a tampon. Just 
                        a second ago.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, no, I’m all souped up with a 
                        pad.

           Margot examines Annie, befuddled.
                                 PEPPY STUDENT (V.O.)
                             (on intercom)
                        Hello Hillside Mountain Goats! 
                        Class of 2021 yearbook superlatives 
                        are being announced in the multi-
                        purpose room right now!

           Immediately, senior students rush past Annie and Margot, 
           towards the room where social hierarchy will be declared.

                                 ANNIE
                             (watching students go)
                        Barf. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Do you mind going? Just to see?

           Annie laughs but Margot’s face doesn’t change. Margot just 
           looks at her. Pleading. 

                                 ANNIE
                        What the fuck? You’re serious...?

           Margot nods, quite serious. 

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - DAY

           All Hillside seniors gather to hear MS. GATES (40s), a 
           depressed school administrator, read off the senior 
           superlatives. Bored Annie and eager Margot stand in a crowd 
           of bloodthirsty high schoolers, anxious to know who ranks 
           where.

                                 MS. GATES
                             (would rather die)
                        The moment you’ve all been waiting 
                        for: Senior Superlatives. Here we 
                        go...I’m on the edge of my seat...

           Students cheer. Ms. Gates lifts a paper close to her 
           squinting eyes.

                                 MS. GATES (CONT'D)
                        Most Athletic: Linda Dawson and 
                        Garett Sanchez.

           A swimmer girl and a football quarterback make their way to 
           the podium. On Annie and Margot in the crowd:

                                 ANNIE
                        Garett Sanchez is suchhhh a dick. 
                        We’re rewarding him for throwing 
                        things far? 
                                 MARGOT
                        His little sister has Down 
                        Syndrome, so he’s always wanted to 
                        get a football scholarship to save 
                        his parents’ money for her summer 
                        enrichment programs.  

                                 ANNIE
                             (trying to recover)
                        Ohhhhkkkaaayyy. My bad...

                                 MS. GATES
                        Best Hair: Emma Acampora and Eric 
                        Derrick.

           Following a pretty brunette, a classic hot boy with quaffed 
           hair, ERIC DERRICK, makes his way to Ms. Gates. He shoots 
           peace signs to his classmates. Annie whispers to Margot:

                                 ANNIE
                        Eric Derrick: two dumb dude first 
                        names. Very. Original.

                                 MARGOT
                        Well, his dad Eric died in a car 
                        accident when Derrick was eight, so 
                        he asked his mom to change his name 
                        to Eric Derrick in his late 
                        father’s honor. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Major loss there. Jesus.
                             (turning to Margot)
                        How do you know this??

           Before Margot can answer:

                                 MS. GATES
                        Dream Date: Margot Ellison and Sam 
                        Stanton.

           Everyone cheers.

                                 ANNIE
                             (stunned)
                        Margot as in YOU?!

                                 MARGOT
                             (suppressing excitement)
                        Um, I guess!

           CLOSE ON Annie as she implodes.
                                 ANNIE
                        But nobody dates us! And that’s 
                        fine because we are fulfilled, 
                        independent women; you and God, me 
                        and astronautics. 

           WE GO WIDE and Margot’s gone. A dumb DUDE stands in her 
           place. Margot’s already pushing her way to the front of the 
           room, accepting high-fives as she goes.

                                 DUMB DUDE
                             (to no one in particular)
                        Margot Ellison is so beautiful. I 
                        voted for her 100 times.

           He turns to Annie.

                                 DUDE
                        I wish I knew her.

                                 ANNIE
                        I know her! I know her better than 
                        anyone in this room because she’s 
                        my best friend!

                                 DUDE
                        No way, really?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes, way. Fucking way!

           ON MARGOT grabbing her certificate from Ms. Gates as the room 
           of senior Hillside students celebrates her. She’s glowing.

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. HALLWAY - DAY

           Annie has her head stuffed in her open locker. We see her 
           headless body standing. She’s limp, pathetic. 

           Margot approaches, giddy, holding her certificate for 
           Hillside High’s DREAM DATE. The joy fades when she sees 
           Annie. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie? Are you having a panic 
                        attack?

           Annie lifts her head out of the locker. Indents on her 
           forehead from resting it on the locker metal.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m invisible.
                                 MARGOT
                        That’s not true.

                                 ANNIE
                        But how is this going to look? In 
                        our Best Friends Forever book? Am I 
                        supposed to dedicate a whole page 
                        to the day you won ‘Dream Whatever 
                        The Fuck’--

                                 MARGOT
                        --Dream Date--

                                 ANNIE
                        And I was rejected from Purdue?

                                 MARGOT
                        You haven’t been rejected yet.

                                 ANNIE
                        See! You think I will be.

                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t. I actually think you’re 
                        the smartest person I know. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Well in the annals of history, 
                        according to a jury of dip shit 
                        peers--

                                 MARGOT
                        Don’t say...anals...

                                 ANNIE
                        --you’re the fucking coolest and 
                        I’m dog shit on the side of the 
                        road. 

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s just a silly certificate.

           Just then, slick golf captain TOBIN (18) saunters by. Steals 
           Margot’s attention.

                                 TOBIN
                        I voted for you, Margot.

                                 MARGOT
                             (touched)
                        Thank you, Tobin.

           Tobin smoulders at Margot. It kind of works. Annie rubs the 
           dent in her forehead.
                                 ANNIE
                        Hello, Tobin. I am also here.

                                 TOBIN
                             (without looking away from 
                              Margot)
                        Hi April.

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s Annie. 

           Annoyed, Tobin finally looks at her.

                                 TOBIN
                        That’s what I said.

                                 ANNIE
                        Eat a dick.

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie!

           Just then, a PHONE ALARM BLARES from Annie’s pocket. She 
           pulls out a CRAPPY FLIP PHONE. Realizes what time it is. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I gotta--

           Immediately, she takes off sprinting to the exit, because 
           this is a girl who never walks. Margot looks to Tobin.

                                 MARGOT
                        Sorry. She’s um, stressed. So, I 
                        gotta--

           Margot breaks out in a sprint, following in Annie’s 
           footsteps.

           EXT. MILLS’ APARTMENT - DAY

           A crumbling apartment building with a prominent fire-escape. 
           Annie runs up along a shabby pathway to a first-floor 
           apartment door. It’s impressively unathletic. Margot trails 
           after her, struggling to keep up, still in a mini skirt. 
           They’re both winded. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie, can you just--for a second--

                                 ANNIE
                        No! DESTINY AWAITS!
           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The room is littered with infomercial exercise equipment: a 
           shake weight, a pink inflatable exercise ball, an ab wheel, a 
           thigh master, many, many booty bands.

           In the mess of equipment, Annie sits on a mini trampoline 
           with a monstrous, old laptop balanced on her knees. Margot 
           sits beside her, playing with a booty band.

           Annie tries to turn on the computer. Nothing happens.

                                 ANNIE
                        Fucking hell.

                                 MARGOT
                        Maybe if you hold down the power 
                        button--

                                 ANNIE
                        Ya! Thanks! I tried that first!

           Margot shrinks a bit as Annie furiously clicks the power 
           button on and off and on and off -- still nothing.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Dear God, are we in the Republic of 
                        China, what the FUCK is going on? 
                        MOM!

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Brain fuel, girls! 

           Donna sways her way into the room with a plate of bagel bites 
           and a Diet Pepsi with a bendy straw. She wears a tiny pink, 
           lacy tank top and tinier shorts, spilling out of both, but 
           wonderfully proud of her figure. 

           Margot turns with excitement. Watches Donna kick dumbbells 
           and ab-rollers out of the way to make it to them. Donna holds 
           the plate out to Margot.

                                 MARGOT
                             (taking a bite)
                        Thank you, Ms. Donna.

                                 DONNA
                        Anything to drink, love?

                                 MARGOT
                        I’d take a Pepsi.

                                 ANNIE
                        But Pepsi’s got caffeine.
                                 MARGOT
                        My Uncle Phil drinks it. Espresso 
                        too.

                                 ANNIE
                        I thought your Uncle Phil was 
                        excommunicated from the Church for 
                        inappropriate relations with his 
                        secretary in a Wall Street bathroom 
                        and now sells vests out of a rented 
                        garage in Queens?

                                 MARGOT
                        He was.

                                 ANNIE
                        So you wanna be like him?

                                 MARGOT
                        It wasn’t the caffeine that got him 
                        excommunicated.

           But Annie’s proven her point. She returns to struggling with 
           the computer.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                             (to Donna)
                        Water’s fine, Ms. Donna, thank you. 
                             (studying Donna)
                        I like your top.

                                 DONNA
                        QVC, baby.

           Donna does a twirl.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        I’ve got five of these if you want 
                        one!

           Margot delights in this possibility. Meanwhile, Annie gives 
           the computer a swat. Donna clocks the aggression.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        Hun, hun, you’re giving me PTSD 
                        with the slaps. Give it a minute. 
                        Good things take time. 
                             (reflecting, then)
                        And bad things: hangovers, aging, 
                        cancer by abestos. Just eat a bagel 
                        bite--
           Donna shoves a bagel bite in her daughter’s mouth. Annie 
           spits it out immediately. It lands a few feet away, rolls 
           under a couch. Just then, the computer turns ON. 

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        There we go!

           After some pounding on the keyboard, some waiting, and some 
           silent reading:

                                 ANNIE
                        OH MY GOD, I’M IN ON FULL 
                        SCHOLARSHIP!

           Annie jumps up, carelessly tosses the laptop aside. Margot 
           darts to catch it. 

                                 DONNA
                        My baby’s going to the moon!!!

           Donna throws her Brighton-bracelet covered arms into the air. 
           The bagel bites go flying. Her soda sloshes around as she 
           celebrates. Ecstatic, Annie jumps on the trampoline like a 
           mad woman. Donna climbs on the trampoline with her. She tries 
           hugging Annie, smothering her with her big, Hooters breasts.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’M GOING TO THE MOON!

                                 DONNA
                             (an aside)
                        My daddy would kill himself if he 
                        heard a woman was doing a job like 
                        that.
                             (to herself)
                        RIP Daddy.

                                 ANNIE
                             (between boobs)
                        Can’t. Breathe.

           Still gleefully jumping with Donna, Annie looks to Margot.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Margot, now we gotta solidify the 
                        road trip. Mom said we’ll be 
                        driving right by Hodgenville where 
                        Abraham Lincoln was born. 
                        Apparently there’s a gift shop that 
                        sells Abe’s big hats. Sounds 
                        fucking sick. Let’s get one.

           Margot only nods. And just then, the trampoline RIPS, 
           dropping Donna and Annie straight through it.
           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 

           On their hands and knees, Margot and Annie search for bagel 
           bites scattered around the floor. The trampoline rests 
           against a wall. It’s visibly torn down the center. Faint 
           sounds from the kitchen.

           After a beat, Margot looks over to Annie as Annie finds the 
           last bagel bite under the thigh master. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Bingo. Today really is my day.

           Margot watches her pop it into her mouth. They both stand. 
           Margot grabs her backpack off the couch. Pulls out a folded 
           sweatshirt.

                                 MARGOT
                        I made you something.

           She hands it to Annie. Annie unfolds it. Gasps. The 
           sweatshirt reads NASA in red and blue stitching and features 
           a felt, very penis-shaped space ship. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Now that you’re that much closer to 
                        the moon and all, I thought you 
                        could use the gear.

           Immediately, Annie puts it on.

                                 ANNIE
                        I love it, I love it, I love it!

           Annie hugs Margot with all her might. The affection is 
           unencumbered and honest. Like sisters.

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Girls, your song is on!

           In the kitchen, Donna turns up the radio as loud as it can 
           go, the intro to Frank Sinatra’s FLY ME TO THE MOON. Annie 
           looks to Margot as if the music awakens a wonderful secret. 

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s so silly that we used to...

                                 ANNIE
                        Ya, so fucking embarrassing, it’s 
                        like...

           Despite their words, both girls have become VERY serious. 
           Margot steps toward Annie like a gentlemen, Annie curtsies. 
           They conjoin hands like ballroom dance partners and begin a 
           waltz. As the music builds, the living room melts away and 
           the girls dance through...

           EXT. GALAXY (FANTASY DANCE SEQUENCE) 

           ...the star-specked galaxy. Margot leads Annie through space 
           as Frank serenades. The moon glows behind them like a great, 
           theatrical set piece. Their dancing is young, beautiful and 
           carefree. Moonlight gives Broadway bravado to the girls’ 
           galactic routine. 

           The girls smile ear-to-ear, imbued by the sheer euphoria of 
           dancing in space with your best friend in the entire 
           universe. As the music reaches climatic perfection, Margot 
           spins Annie faster and faster and faster until--

           EXT. MILLS' APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           The music stops and we’re back to reality. The girls wait for 
           Margot’s ride. Margot looks down at her phone, a tad anxious. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Sorry I can’t stay; Jess and her 
                        engagement ring are home for her 
                        shower. Future Mrs. Eugine Cobb.

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s really his name...?

                                 MARGOT
                        Eugine Cobb Jr.--

           EUGINE COBB JR. POP-TO SEQUENCE:

           An average white male, EUGINE COBB (21), wears a standard 
           missionary uniform: short white button-down, skinny black 
           tie, black slacks. He stands in the middle of the African 
           Savanna with a big smile on his face and his Book of Mormon, 
           unaware that a lion watches him from afar.

                        --the Sub-Saharan Missionary--

           Now in a business suit, Eugine stands behind a big corporate 
           desk. He signs a contract. Then looks up at the camera. Grins 
           a stupid grin.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        --the soon to be CEO--
           Skinny Eugine shovels Alfredo sauce out of a jar with a 
           spoon. Suddenly, jar after jar after jar of Alfredo sauce 
           appears around him. He’s happy as a clam.

           Pajama-wearing Eugine cuddles with ten puppies, all licking 
           and tail-wagging, as he laughs into the camera with too much 
           joy.

           END EUGINE POP-TO SEQUENCE

           EXT. MILLS’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 MARGOT
                             (summarizing the sequence)
                        --the perfect Mormon man. 

                                 ANNIE
                        What a dream: Eugine. 
                             (reflecting)
                        It’s crazy they’re only twenty-one.
                        Do you think it’s the sex? 

                                 MARGOT
                        What do you mean...?

                                 ANNIE
                        Like because Mormons can’t have sex 
                        before marriage, they shack up 
                        young to shag it out?

                                 MARGOT
                        Shag? 

                                 ANNIE
                        You know, rub genitals.

                                 MARGOT
                        Gross Annie.

           Just then, a PING. Margot reads a text.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Looks like I’m walking home. 
                             (stepping away)
                        I’ll see you later.

           Margot begins her trek. Annie takes a beat, then shouts.
                                 ANNIE
                        Hey!
                             (Margot turns)
                        I’m sorry. You had a big day too -- 
                        I mean, the whole system of 
                        superlatives is dumb in and of 
                        itself -- but I’m happy that you 
                        won because you’re my best friend 
                        and now everybody knows what I’ve 
                        known forever: that Margot Ellison 
                        is mother fucking perfect.

           On Margot, absorbing the compliment, we jump to:

           INT. PIZZA PALACE - NIGHT

           Annie stares up at a menu board. Donna stands beside her.

                                 DONNA
                        Get anything you like; we’re queens 
                        tonight.

           Boldly, Annie steps up to the cashier. A handsome kid with 
           the careless cool of a seventeen-year-old. Annie notes his 
           name tag: GARY.

                                 ANNIE
                        Extra-large barbecue chicken pizza, 
                        no chicken, no bbq sauce.

                                 GARY
                        So...a cheese pizza?

                                 ANNIE
                        Damn straight, Gary. I’m 
                        celebrating.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - NIGHT

           The facade of a two-story home fit for a suburban fairy tale. 
           A BMW pulls up in the driveway.

                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        Not in the driveway!

           Promptly, it pulls out. 

           EXT. / INT. BMW - MINUTES LATER

           From outside the car, Margot looks into the open driver’s 
           side window. 
           She’s changed back into the long dress she wore to seminary 
           but the buttons on her dress aren’t fully buttoned. REVEAL 
           Tobin behind the wheel, feeling pretty good about himself.

                                 TOBIN
                        I prayed to God for this. And I’m 
                        not religious.

           She leans in, her lips an inch from his.

                                 MARGOT
                        You don’t have to be religious to 
                        pray. It can just be nice to think 
                        someone’s listening.

           With flirtatious zest, she pulls away. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Goodnight, Tobin.

           INT. ELLISON HOME. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A proud ROASTED CHICKEN on a stately dining room table. At 
           the head of the table, MR. ELLISON (40s), a no nonsense man 
           with an exquisitely bald head. Beside him, his wife of 25 
           years, Mrs. Ellison, as perfect as suburban mothers come.

           Three out of his four daughters sit at the table, all Russian 
           doll like copies of MRS. ELLISON. Next to her mother, JESS 
           (21, the bride-to-be). Beside Jess, GRETA, a tattling goodie-
           two-shoes (13), and FRANNY (10), the wide-eyed baby of the 
           family. One seat remains empty as Mr. Ellison finishes the 
           pre-dinner prayer.

                                 MR. ELLISON
                        --and Heavenly Father, thank you 
                        for bringing our lovely, engaged 
                        Jess home safe and sound. In the 
                        name of Jesus Christ, amen.

                                 ELLISON FAMILY
                        Amen.

                                 JESS
                        Thank you Daddy. I wish Eugine 
                        heard that. Ugh, I miss him. 

           She admires the modest engagement ring on her finger.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        You have all eternity, sweet heart. 

           Somewhere in the house, the front door opens and closes. 
                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        Sorry!

           Margot scurries in, grabs her seat at the table. She sits up 
           nice and straight.

                                 GRETA
                             (with little sis attitude)
                        You’re late.

                                 JESS
                        You’re very late.

           Jess stares at Margot with judgement. Franny, oblivious, is 
           delighted to see her older sister.

                                 FRANNY
                             (adorable as hell)
                        Hi, Margot!

                                 MARGOT
                        Hi, Franny--

           Margot looks to her father, then her mother.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Ms. Donna took us to pizza because 
                        Annie got into Purdue. Full 
                        scholarship.

           Neither respond until Mrs. Ellison looks to her husband.

                                 MR. ELLISON
                        You made a choice, Margot. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Like I said, I’m sorry.

           In a loaded silence, Mrs. Ellison eyes the elaborate dinosaur 
           drawing on Margot’s forearm -- it looks like a tattoo. Margot 
           clocks her mother eyeing it. She looks down to it self-
           consciously, then moves it out of view.

           With her other arm, she reaches to the chicken, but Mrs. 
           Ellison pulls the plate away from her. Another long, painful 
           silence.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        May I be excused to read scriptures 
                        and think about my actions?

                                 MR. ELLISON
                             (pleased)
                        There’s my daughter.
           Margot stands up. Jess studies her. 

                                 JESS
                        I always liked that dress.  

           Margot looks down. Realizes her dress is unbuttoned.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        But when I wore it, I never wore 
                        the buttons undone.

           Jess makes pointed eye-contact with her sister. Margot averts 
           it.

           INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A bedroom fit for a little girl: floral wallpaper, a twin-
           sized bed. Art supplies litter the floor -- ink pens, water 
           color palettes, and drawings in progress. 

           On the walls, Margot’s hung her sketches and paintings of 
           dinosaur skeletons, landscapes and human bones. They’re 
           skillfully done and everywhere. 

           Margot stares at herself in a mirror. She wears the lacy pink 
           tank top Donna had. She examines her reflection with curious 
           pride. Her mid-driff shows just a little, featuring a 
           birthmark, shaped oddly like Jesus (think Jesus toast) on her 
           hip.

           As if her reflection speaks to her, Margot turns from it. 
           Kneels down beside her bed. Searches for something underneath 
           it. She pulls out a box of tampons, turns it on its side. A 
           STACK OF LETTERS fall out. Comforted to see them still there, 
           she hugs the letters close.

                                 JESS (O.S.)
                        What’s that?

           Panicked, Margot turns. Finds Jess looming in the doorway. 
           Slowly, Margot stands up with the letters behind her back:

                                 MARGOT
                        ...What?

                                 JESS
                        That trashy tank top.

                                 MARGOT
                             (relieved)
                        Oh. It’s um, Annie’s mom’s.
                                 JESS
                        She works at Hooters, Margot.

           Jess takes one sweeping look around the room. Notices 
           Margot’s backpack; the mini skirt and a push up bra hang out 
           of it -- the clothes Margot wore at school.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        And that?

           As Jess focuses on the backpack, Margot drops the letters and 
           kicks them under her bed. Then scurries over to her backpack.

                                 MARGOT
                             (re: clothes)
                        Just a sewing project for art. 

           She picks up the backpack, stuffs the clothes inside as Jess 
           watches with discerning eyes. 

                                 JESS
                        I really think you should consider 
                        a mission; a mission would give you 
                        direction in the Church. My 
                        roommate Molly had a crisis of 
                        faith her first year at BYU and God 
                        called her to Portland when she 
                        needed it most. Those eighteen 
                        months in the Pacific Northwest 
                        changed her life. She fell in love 
                        with one of her converts and now 
                        she’s getting married this summer 
                        at the Portland Temple. All the 
                        bridesmaids are wearing beanies; 
                        it’s very progressive. And 
                        thankfully, Molly’s better than 
                        she’s ever been.

           This severely displeases Margot.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        It’d be good for you: a year and a 
                        half to get closer to God. Alone. 
                        Serving. Cleansing your doubts.

           Margot gulps. 

           INT. ANNIE’S ROOM - MIDNIGHT

           Annie sleeps snug as a bug. She snores loudly. Outside her 
           window, a FIGURE fiddles with the glass, opens it, then 
           climbs in. Shuts the window behind them. A moon-shaped night-
           light shines on the intruder as they enter -- it’s Margot. 
           She tiptoes to Annie’s bed, gets in, slides under the covers 
           with ease. Accustomed to Margot’s late night visits, Annie 
           wakes enough to pass Margot a pillow. 

                                 MARGOT
                             (whispering)
                        Annie?

           Margot rolls over to face her, ready to say something. But 
           Annie’s eyes are closed.

                                 ANNIE
                             (sleep talking)
                        Fuck you, Buzz, this is my moon.

           Margot accepts that Annie’s out. She sits up, unable to 
           sleep. Next to her head, the shelf with the ANNIE & MARGOT 
           best friends book. She sees it. Pulls it off the shelf. 

           Lit by a stream of moonlight, Margot holds it, contemplating 
           the precious, smiling girls on the cover -- their former 
           selves. The slightest tear drops from her eye. She wipes it, 
           then looks back to sleeping Annie, who resembles a slumbering 
           bore. Snores like it too.

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. HALLWAY - DAY

           Annie strolls proudly through a cramped hall with Margot at 
           her side. NASA spelled across her chest. The phallic space 
           ship very visible. A sleepless Margot, the most haggard we’ve 
           ever seen her, clutches a sizable canvas close to her. As the 
           girls approach a split in the hallways, Margot takes a right 
           when Annie expects a left.

                                 ANNIE
                        What are you doing? We take the A 
                        hall to the C hall to the D hall; 
                        it’s Thursday.

                                 MARGOT
                        I told you: I’ve gotta turn in my 
                        Venus of Urbino.

                                 ANNIE
                        Fuck me, your what?

           Margot holds up her painting: a large, impeccably rendered 
           canvas of a plushy woman on a fainting couch.

           VENUS OF URBINO FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:
           EXT. (FLASHBACK) PARK - DAY

           POV Margot: her hand sketches on a blank canvas, propped up 
           against her knees as a makeshift easel. We maintain this POV 
           for the full sequence.

           Beyond Margot’s canvas, Annie walks about with a cassette 
           player and headphones. As Margot sketches, Annie moves around 
           the yard, repeating:

                                 ANNIE
                        Guet Nacht.

           Annie stops the cassette. She turns towards Margot (us).

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (not able to hear herself)
                        I’M TELLING YOU, SWISS GERMAN IS MY 
                        BITCH!

           She takes off her headphones.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        What is that?

                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        My Venus of Urbino.

           INT. (FLASHBACK) ANNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Now sitting on Annie’s bed, Margot’s hand delicately paints 
           the curvaceous lines of the lady’s mid-section. In front of 
           the canvas, Annie stands, wearing her space helmet. 

                                 ANNIE
                             (muffled)
                        God, this thing smells.

           She pulls it off.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Do you think I can wash it?
                             (looking at us)
                        What is that?

                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        My Venus of Urbino.

           EXT. (FLASHBACK) COMMUNITY POOL CENTER - DAY

           Margot’s hand paints the finishing touches on her Venus of 
           Urbino. Beyond Margot’s painting, Annie floats on a moon-
           shaped raft in the pool, wearing a tankini and big diva 
           sunglasses, reading a NEIL ARMSTRONG BIOGRAPHY. 
                                 ANNIE
                        I feel like Neil and I would have 
                        fallen in love. Of course, it would 
                        have been a marriage of ego, but, 
                        that’s just what you get with a 
                        power couple.

           No response from Margot. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (turning to Margot)
                        What do you think?

           She looks up. Pulls off her sunglasses.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        What is that?

                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        My Venus of Urbino!

           END OF FLASHBACK SEQUENCE

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 MARGOT
                        My final for AP Art! I’ve been 
                        working on it all semester!

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re always painting! I’m sorry I 
                        didn’t realize it was a chubby sexy 
                        lady!

                                 MARGOT
                        I know I’m not the moon, but it’d 
                        be cool if you cared about me too 
                        sometime.

           Flustered, Annie scrambles for a response, but Margot’s 
           already hurried off. All alone, Annie shrinks into herself.

           INT. UNITED STATES HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           A photo projected on a screen behind Annie -- Richard Nixon 
           awards Neil Armstrong the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
           Nixon’s head has a BIG OLE X through it. A lackluster Annie 
           concludes her presentation. 

                                 ANNIE
                        And while yes, Buzz was also there, 
                        Neil touched it first.
           In the front row, Turtle Man Stew raises a hand. Annie gives 
           him a nod to ask.

                                 STEW
                        Is Neil Armstrong related to Lance 
                        Armstrong? The guy with one ball?

                                 ANNIE
                        No, Stew.

           Annie looks around hoping to validate the idiocy of her 
           interaction with Stew. Quickly, she looks back to him, then 
           rapidly away again. Privately, she’s very glad he was paying 
           attention.

           Just then, a swarm of phone notifications roll in, pinging 
           and blaring, one after the other. Everyone -- literally 
           everyone -- picks up their phones.

           A final notification blares: a radio-obscured voice says: THE 
           EAGLE HAS LANDED. It comes from Annie’s pocket. Annie pulls 
           out her flip phone. It displays a text notification from a 
           BLOCKED NUMBER. She opens it, but before we can see what she 
           sees:

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (seeing the screen)
                        Oh, mother fu--

           EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

           Margot and Annie sit outside the public library (Annie’s 
           favorite place) on the grass with a bag of Mexican fast-food. 
           Annie’s lip quivers as she studies her best friend’s face. A 
           very reserved Margot holds a taquito out to Annie.

                                 MARGOT
                        Want them? I’m not hungry.

           Annie bats it out of her hand. 

                                 ANNIE
                             (blurts)
                        It’s you.

                                 MARGOT
                        ...What?

           Annie takes out her phone. Holds it up to face Margot. For 
           the first time, we see what’s haunted everybody’s phone 
           screens: a mirror selfie of a slim, teen girl in a red thong, 
           covering her boobs with one arm, posing in a mall dressing 
           room. Her face is cropped out.
                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        It’s not.

           Furious, Annie zooms into the photo, a grainy Jesus birthmark 
           on full display.

                                 ANNIE
                        It isn’t?!

           Margot stares at the birthmark. Her birthmark.

                                 MARGOT
                        Okay, fine, yes, it’s me!

           Annie turns beet red with Margot’s confirmation, as if she 
           didn’t believe her own accusations when she was making them. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Are you sure you don’t want the 
                        rest of my taquitos--

                                 ANNIE
                        NO! I eat when I want to eat, not 
                        just ‘cause you wave a burrito in 
                        my face hoping to throw me off your 
                        trail. 

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s a taquito.

                                 ANNIE
                        Which is a fried, skinny burrito!!
                             (beat)
                        What the fuck is going on!? Why did 
                        you lie to me!?

           A moment. Then Margot quietly begins.

                                 MARGOT
                        Well...

           INT. (FLASHBACK) PIZZA PALACE - NIGHT

           Margot and her sisters stare up at the menu board. Margot 
           notices she’s being noticed by Gary, who worked the cash 
           register for Annie. This time, he’s in the back flipping 
           dough. Like a mating display, he tosses the dough impossibly 
           high and catches it. Wow.
           INT. (FLASHBACK) PIZZA PALACE. STOCKROOM - NIGHT

           In a room with shelves full of tomato sauce, Margot rides 
           Gary to pleasure town. He looks up to Margot and mouths the 
           words that present-day Margot narrates:

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I love you Margot Mary Ellison.

           Margot stops riding him cold.

           END OF FLASHBACK

           EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

                                 MARGOT
                        So I ghosted him and this is, um, 
                        maybe him getting me back...?

           Annie is stunned.

                                 ANNIE
                        You, Margot Ellison, sent Pizza 
                        Gary a nude and then had sex with 
                        him!? Like his penis in your 
                        vagina?!?

           Margot just nods.

                                 MARGOT
                        Sex doesn’t have to be vaginal 
                        penetration, but if we’re being 
                        technical, yes Pizza Gary and I 
                        did...uh, put his...in...um, you 
                        get it.

                                 ANNIE
                        I DON’T! Why didn’t you tell me! We 
                        tell each other everything! 
                        ESPECIALLY that you’d been dicked 
                        in the vagisteer! 

                                 MARGOT
                        Well, now you know.

                                 ANNIE
                        Okay, I’m so fucking pissed that 
                        I’m sweating behind my knees. But 
                        right now, that’s not important.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Pizza Gary sent your naked body to 
                        the whole school like some kind of 
                        Ted Bundy -- and yes, obviously 
                        Bundy was VERY HOT but mostly a 
                        fucking murderer! We have to report 
                        him!

           On a bender, Annie pulls out her phone. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        What is the cops’ number? 911?

                                 MARGOT
                        No!

           Margot snags Annie’s phone. Holding it, she realizes she 
           acted on impulse. She looks up to Annie, who’s shocked at 
           Margot having done so.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        We can’t report him. 

           Margot looks down at Annie’s crappy flip phone.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I’ll give this back if you promise 
                        not to report him.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jesus Christ. I’m trying to help. 
                        If you recall: your NAKED BODY’S ON 
                        EVERY SCREEN IN HILLSIDE.

           A new, steely Margot hands the phone back. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie, my dad’s the bishop of our 
                        ward. If he found out about this...

           EXT. (POP-TO) BARREN FIELD - TWILIGHT

           Mr. Ellison digs a deep grave. A wheelbarrow next to him. In 
           the wheelbarrow, Margot’s dead, bruised body lays like a rag 
           doll. Her limbs askew. Church members stand in the distance, 
           watching approvingly. 

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        And if my mom found out...
           INT. (POP-TO) HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Mrs. Ellison lies in a hospital bed, unconscious. She wears 
           an oxygen mask. Her heart is monitored.

           EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

                                 ANNIE
                        He would murder you, yes.

           Margot hands the phone back. 

                                 MARGOT
                             (as if it helps)
                        I mean, you can’t really tell it’s 
                        me in the photo...right?

           Annie pulls up the photo again. Examines.

                                 ANNIE
                        How many people have literal Jesus 
                        waving hello on their abdomen?

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s a low quality photo.

                                 ANNIE
                        But I noticed it!

           Margot reflects on this fact. Annie noticing surprises her.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        I really wish I didn’t find out 
                        this way. That my best friend lost 
                        her virginity to Pizza Gary, the 
                        turd who can’t count change.

           Margot swallows a bit of air, preparing to add fuel to the 
           fire.

                                 MARGOT
                        Um...Elliot Jacobs.

                                 ANNIE
                        What in the sweet hell does that 
                        mean?

                                 MARGOT
                        I lost my virginity to Elliot 
                        Jacobs. Sophomore year.

                                 ANNIE
                        WHAT THE FUCK?!
           INT. (FLASHBACK) SMALL HOME - NIGHT

           Two beagles stare at Margot and a handsome Elliott who have 
           sex very slowly on a couch, well aware they’re being watched.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I was dog sitting for Sister 
                        Garrison; I invited you over but 
                        you said no --

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Well ya, cause I don’t trust 
                        beagles!

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        Elliot lived next door, so...

           Elliott’s eyes bulge.

           END OF FLASHBACK

           EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

                                 MARGOT
                        And I liked how it felt so I just 
                        kept having it. I love kissing, 
                        lips, touching; it’s nice, being 
                        close to someone.

                                 ANNIE
                        But you’re not supposed to have sex 
                        until marriage! That’s the Mormon 
                        golden rule! You wait, then pledge 
                        yourself to your husband for 
                        eternity and once you’re sealed by 
                        God, you deflower each other in a 
                        very vanilla, wholesome, beautiful 
                        way!

                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t want that.

                                 ANNIE
                        What do you want?!

                                 MARGOT
                        I want you to ask me things. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I ask you things! 

                                 MARGOT
                        Do you?
           Suddenly doubtful, Annie nods hesitantly.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        When’s the last time you asked ‘How 
                        are you, Margot?’ or ‘What do you 
                        think, Margot?’ or, ’Why do you cry 
                        before you go to sleep, Margot?’ 
                        or, ‘How come you’re so gosh darn 
                        alone, Margot?!’ 

           Annie is the smallest we’ve ever seen her. She barely squeaks 
           out the words:

                                 ANNIE
                        But you’re not alone...

           Margot looks at Annie. Considers. Then speaks with intention.

                                 MARGOT
                        I’ve been holding everything in, 
                        trying to be this perfect person 
                        but I don’t like her. 
                             (a painstaking pause)
                        Annie, I don’t wanna be Mormon 
                        anymore.
                             (realizing)
                        I’ve never said that out loud.

           Annie doesn’t speak. So Margot continues.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        The God I believe in changes his 
                        mind, he makes mistakes, and he 
                        wouldn’t punish me for liking sex.
                             (her thesis)
                        For wanting more out of life.

           After a beat, Annie puts herself together.

                                 ANNIE
                        Um, okay, clearly you’re going 
                        through a lot here -- and ya, it 
                        would have been nice to know you 
                        were riding dicks across town...
                        But I’m your best friend and I’m 
                        here for you always, no matter how 
                        hard it feels to tell the truth. So 
                        here’s a truth: one of my nipples 
                        goes inward.

                                 MARGOT
                        I know that.
                                 ANNIE
                        And I’m ashamed of it but I told 
                        you because you’re my best friend 
                        in the entire universe!

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie, I love you, I really do, and 
                        I know I’m your best friend, but I, 
                        um, I don’t know if you’re mine...
                             (thinking hard)
                        I don’t know if anybody is.

           Annie gapes at Margot in disbelief. 

                                 ANNIE
                        But what -- what about -- what 
                        about moving to Florida together 
                        when I work at NASA, and naming my 
                        daughter after you, and -- and 
                        bringing our families to the 
                        Kennedy Space Center for my first 
                        launch? Our road trip to Purdue! 
                        What - what - what about our Best 
                        Friends Book?!

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s just a book Annie and I’m not 
                        even in it that much.

                                 ANNIE
                             (gasping tears, salvaging)
                        What? No! You’re on the cover and 
                        you have the whole section 
                        dedicated to your Baptism, and the 
                        one for Homecoming when you lost 
                        your shoe trying to find me at the 
                        snack table, kinda like Cinderella 
                        minus the dickhole prince, oh and 
                        also that time we went to Youth 
                        Conference together and Emma Robins 
                        wrote Sinner on my forehead and you 
                        rubbed it off and told me Christ 
                        loves me too, even if I don’t 
                        believe in him! Of course you’re in 
                        it; It’s our book! It doesn’t exist 
                        without you! I don’t exist without 
                        you!

           Margot doesn’t speak. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Margot?!
           Confirming everything Annie doesn’t want to believe, Margot 
           looks away, piercing Annie’s desperate heart. A long sobby 
           silence as Annie’s hope dissolves. Annie can’t bare it. She 
           stands up. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Um. Okay, um...uh goob--good--
                        goodby--

           Annie turns away, realizing she can’t undo anything. Cough-
           crying overwhelms her as she runs off, far away from a Margot 
           she doesn’t know any more.

           Behind her, Margot still sits outside the library, unmoving, 
           looking at her hands. A perfect tear spills down her cheek.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Annie, out of breath, red-faced, swollen from crying, lumbers 
           past happy families and couples and dogs and she can’t stand 
           any of it. 

           INT. MILLS' APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - LATER DAY

           A destroyed Annie enters. 

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        There’s my soon-to-be astronaut!

           She looks to the kitchen nook, where Donna is lighting 
           candles on an ice cream cake that reads PURDUE! Donna looks 
           past Annie.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        Where’s Margot? Should we wait? We 
                        can wait!

                                 ANNIE
                             (walks to the cake)
                        Is this a chocolate turtle, salted-
                        malted cookie-dough ice cream cake?

                                 DONNA
                        Your favorite!

                                 ANNIE
                        Just because this was my favorite 
                        yesterday and every day before 
                        that, doesn’t mean it’s my favorite 
                        today!

           Annie picks up the cake. Tears forming again.
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        What’s so special about an ice 
                        cream cake anyway? It melts into 
                        ice cream soup as soon as you take 
                        it out of the freezer. 

           With tears pouring out, she opens the trash.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        And who the SHIT wants to eat a 
                        bowl of chocolate turtle, salted-
                        malted cookie-dough ice cream 
                        soup?! 

           She dumps the cake, candles and all, into the garbage. Donna 
           just looks at Annie, stunned at the tears and the trashed 
           cake.

                                 DONNA
                        Well, what the hell do you wanna 
                        eat?!

                                 ANNIE
                        Something boring and safe that 
                        nobody will touch.
                             (thinking)
                        Fruitcake.

           Annie’s nose crinkles. So does Donna’s. They look down -- the 
           garbage is on fire. 

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Annie mopes down the hall to her room. She passes pictures of 
           Annie and Donna, and Annie and Margot. Snapshots of a life 
           intertwined litter the walls, haphazardly arranged, smiling 
           down at heart-splintered Annie.

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                             (shouting up the stairs)
                        You are in time out, young lady! 
                        For a whole--a whole--a whole--for 
                        tonight! And if you think I’m 
                        restocking your Nesquik when I go 
                        to the store next, you are sorely 
                        mistaken!

           PRE-LAP: Mechanical churning of a dryer.
           INT. ELLISON HOME. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

           Margot leans against the dryer, crying. We can’t hear her and 
           she prefers it this way. The door opens. In walks Franny, 
           holding her hamper. Margot stiffens, sniffling. Wipes snot 
           off the small sliver between her nose and upper-lip.

                                 FRANNY
                        I’ve gotta do my whites.
                             (studies Margot)
                        Are you crying?

           Margot shakes her head ‘no.’ Franny sets down her hamper. 

                                 FRANNY (CONT'D)
                             (the cutest in the world)
                        Everyone cries. When I think about 
                        all the good I should be doing in 
                        the world, all the good Jesus was 
                        doing, I cry real hard. I know I 
                        gotta do more for others, but I 
                        don’t know who needs it the most 
                        and that’s what makes me cry the 
                        hardest. 

           This melts Margot’s heart. She hugs Franny. Pulls her close.

                                 FRANNY (CONT'D)
                             (startled)
                        Oh!

           Franny nestles into Margot’s chest.

                                 FRANNY (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna miss you when you’re 
                        gone.

           They separate.

                                 MARGOT
                        Gone?

                                 FRANNY
                        You know, when you’re at BYU.

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh--of course. 

           The dryer beeps. Done with its load. Franny leans down into 
           her hamper.
                                 FRANNY
                        I dropped spaghetti on my church 
                        dress -- a whole meatball! Wanna 
                        see?

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - LATER NIGHT

           Annie plays Mario on GameBoy. She lays on a moon shaped 
           carpet, hair sprawled, furiously pounding at the A and the B 
           buttons. Mario dives off a cliff. Game over.

           Annie slams her GameBoy shut -- rolls over to look out the 
           window. It’s a full moon. She stares at the big, white orb; 
           what usually brings such joy leaves a somber glint in her 
           eyes. 

           She picks up her phone. Checks her messages. Nothing from 
           Margot. Just an empty phone-screen of the moon, a digital 
           copy of what she can see through her window.

           She looks to a clipping of Neil from an old Life Magazine she 
           has pinned to the wall (among many others.)

                                 ANNIE
                        Is it lonely, Neil? 
                             (as if it helps)
                        Up there?

           Neil doesn’t respond because he’s a poster. Too sad to 
           remain, she gets up. Standing in the middle of her room, she 
           looks right at the Best Friends Book as if she was looking at 
           Margot herself.

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. KITCHEN NOOK - MIDNIGHT

           Annie flips on a single light. She stares at the trash can 
           which is blackened from the cake fire. An abandoned fire 
           extinguisher lays beside it. We see she’s holding the Best 
           Friends Book.

           Annie takes a seat on the ground next to the trash can, wraps 
           her arms around the book, and leans her head against the 
           trash -- her cheek presses against the trash’s charred 
           plastic side.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m so sorry.

           Behind an unknowing Annie, at the foot of the stairs, Donna 
           watches her daughter grieve. Annie, alone, rocking ever so 
           slightly with the Best Friends Book rested against her heart. 
           EXT. HILLSIDE WARD OF THE LDS CHURCH - EARLY MORNING 

           Like clockwork, Margot exits seminary, dressed in a long, 
           appropriate skirt. She immediately looks to tall, stone 
           Jesus, where Annie’s normally waiting.

           For the first time ever, Annie’s not there.

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. GYM - DAY

           The whole school is gathered for an address from PRINCIPAL 
           BLEEKER (50s), a man that couldn’t even relate to teenagers 
           as a teenager. He stands behind a podium in the middle of the 
           gym floor, flanked by frumpy, annoyed teachers.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        Good morning, Mountain Goats.

           We find Annie in the last row of the bleachers, alone. She 
           stares three rows down at the back of Margot’s head. Margot 
           sits in the middle of the crowd. As if sensing Annie’s gaze, 
           Margot turns around. Quickly, Annie averts her eyes.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER (CONT'D)
                        It has come to our attention that 
                        an inappropriate photo has been 
                        spread digitally throughout the 
                        entire school. At this age, you’re 
                        all very hormonal and clearly, very 
                        good with computers and technology 
                        and things of internet sorts, so 
                        you’ve made it largely impossible 
                        for any of us, adults, to track 
                        said photo; thus it is with great 
                        disturbance that I can only offer a 
                        reminder: once you send a private 
                        photo into diga-space, the world 
                        owns it. And the Russians. So 
                        please, keep your privates, 
                        private. 

                                 UNKNOWN STUDENT (O.S.)
                        TITTIES!

           Principal Bleeker stutters.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        Please, uh--

           He struggles to identify where the scream came from in the 
           crowd of horny high school students.
                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER (CONT'D)
                        --please refrain from such immature 
                        language--

                                 UNKNOWN STUDENT (O.S.)
                        ASS.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        That’s enough from you! Whoever you 
                        are!

           Margot steals a glance up to Annie. She finds Annie staring 
           at someone else. Margot follows Annie’s gaze down to Stew, 
           the sweet face from her history class. Margot notes it. 

           Principal Bleeker takes a deep breath. Opens his mouth, 
           baiting the disrupter. But nothing happens.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER (CONT'D)
                        Shout pussy, I dare you.

           A teacher gasps behind him, followed by a collective silence.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER (CONT'D)
                             (clears his throat)
                        If anyone has any information 
                        regarding the incident... 

           We’re on Margot as she struggles with something.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER (CONT'D)
                        ...or any questions--

                                 MARGOT
                        I do.

           As if God raised her himself, Margot stands. Every student 
           turns towards her, craning their neck to see what she has to 
           say. She loses the certainty with which she stood.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I--um...

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        --have a question!

           Beating her to it, Annie scrambles to her feet in the back. 
           Everyone turns away from Margot, to Annie. Including Stew, 
           who looks at Annie with fondness.

           CLOSE ON Tobin rolling his eyes. This is a common reaction to 
           Annie.
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        I have a question...uh...if I share 
                        a photo of my wenus, is that 
                        considered ‘inappropriate.’

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        I don’t know what a ‘wenus’ is...

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s the old man-y tip of your 
                        elbow. Very dry. Crusty sometimes.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        Oh. No. Unless you’re intending for 
                        it to be sexual, I don’t imagine a 
                        wenus -- however dry -- is 
                        inappropriate.

                                 ANNIE
                        Sweet. Okay, thanks. 
                             (to the crowd)
                        No sexual wenuses everybody.

           Students chuckle at Annie’s expense. She’s embarrassed but 
           remains standing. 

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        Anything else? Or can we leave it 
                        at wenus?

           Annie glances toward Margot. Then away again.

                                 ANNIE
                        No, um, no sir.

           Annie sits. Margot doesn’t. Principal Bleeker looks to her.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        And you?

                                 MARGOT
                        That was my question too.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER
                        Then wenus away.

           Margot sits.

                                 PRINCIPAL BLEEKER (CONT'D)
                        To reiterate, the no-go zones 
                        should be--

                                 UNKNOWN STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Pussy!
           Just as Principal Bleeker gears up to shout--

           EXT. HILLSIDE HIGH - DAY

           We follow Annie hurrying as fast as she can into a dingy 
           school bathroom.

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Annie stumbles in, crashing in on two GIRLS making out. Annie 
           lets out a little squeal. She thought she’d be alone. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Sorry, I’ll just--

           She rushes into a stall. Shuts it but struggles with the 
           lock.

           She plops her backpack on the floor. Sits on the toilet seat 
           in her pants. Grabs an old iPod out of a backpack pocket. 
           Shoves earbuds in. Presses play on Mozart. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (shouting)
                        Don’t worry, I can’t hear!

           OUTSIDE OF HER STALL the couple has left. Only a drippy 
           faucet drips. Just then, the motion sensor lights go out. 

           INSIDE ANNIE’S STALL in the dark, lit by the screen of her 
           iPod, Annie hyperventilates to escalating classical mastery.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay--

           Annie’s hyperventilating dissolves into crying. She hardly 
           moves, clutching the perfect little square iPod.

           INT. (FLASHBACK) HILLSIDE HIGH. BATHROOM - DAY

           INSIDE A STALL Annie (14) sits on a toilet seat, pants still 
           on.

                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        It’s gonna be okay.

                                 ANNIE
                        I wet my pants, Margot. On the 
                        first day of high school. Nothing 
                        is okay.
           OUTSIDE THE STALL Margot (14) leans against Annie’s door. She 
           wears very short shorts that reveal her already long, lean 
           legs.

                                 MARGOT
                        I wet my pants once.

                                 ANNIE
                        No you didn’t.

                                 MARGOT
                        I did! In Church. I wanted to 
                        leave. It was taking so long. So, I 
                        wet my pants.

           Annie laughs.

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s disgusting.

                                 MARGOT
                        But it worked. My wet-my-pants plan 
                        worked. I got to leave.

           Annie fiddles with the lock. It opens. The two best friends 
           face one another.

                                 ANNIE
                        Were you wearing bright green 
                        pants??

           REVEAL Annie’s bright green cargo pants. You can very much 
           see the pee stain.

                                 MARGOT
                        Dress. Dripped down my leg.

                                 ANNIE
                             (laughing)
                        EW!

           Margot pulls a pair of jeans out of her backpack.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Why do you have extra pants?

                                 MARGOT
                        You never know when you’re gonna 
                        need them. 
                             (hands pants over)
                        Right?

           END OF FLASHBACK
           EXT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Margot sorts through their mail at the mailbox, not finding 
           what she wants. As she does, she hears a CAR ENGINE TURN OFF. 
           She turns, finds the MAIL MAN at the next house over, putting 
           mail in a neighbor’s mailbox.

                                 MARGOT
                        Are you sure there wasn’t anything 
                        else today?

           He turns.

                                 MAIL MAN
                        Are you saying I’m bad at my job?

           Offended, he climbs into his truck. 

           Margot shoves the coupons and bills back into the Ellison 
           mailbox, then treks up to her house. 

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Home alone, somber Annie sways in silence, holding a NEIL 
           ARMSTRONG KEN DOLL close to her. She’s pantsless.

           Just then, the lock on the front door turns. Donna throws 
           open the front door wearing her Hooters garb. She looks dead 
           at Annie, the Neil doll, the no pants. Donna softens.

                                 DONNA
                        You sure there’s nothing to talk 
                        about?

                                 ANNIE
                        Nope. Nothing.

                                 DONNA
                        Well, whenever I’m a little down, 
                        you know what I like to do?

           INT. MOVIE THEATERS - DAY

           Donna and Annie are PASSED OUT in fully reclined, fancy movie 
           theater seats. Around them, elderly folk smack loudly on 
           snacks. Donna has a bag of popcorn in her lap. Annie’s arm 
           lays across the armrest with her hand in the bag. 

           A CRASH; an OLD LADY has dropped popcorn behind Donna and 
           Annie.
                                 OLD LADY’S FRIEND
                        Damn it Shirley!

           Stirred by elderly shouting, Donna wakes. She turns and finds 
           Annie still sleeping.

                                 ACTRESS (O.S.)
                             (melodramatic)
                        I love you. But you have to give up 
                        the killing. For us. 

                                 ACTOR (O.S.)
                             (even more melodramatic)
                        Don’t make me choose. Just let me 
                        be me.

           Donna lifts Annie’s hand out of the bag, which doesn’t wake 
           her. She sets Annie’s hand in her own. It’s tender.

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. HALLWAY - DAY

           Margot stands at her locker which is decorated with little 
           drawings, dinosaur stickers, and a little mirror. Margot 
           looks into it. She can see Annie passing behind her in the 
           reflection. Annie’s head’s down, like a soldier marching 
           through a battlefield.

           When Annie’s gone, Margot shuts her locker door, then walks 
           in the opposite direction past groups of friends: giggling 
           girls, cozy couples, packs of teen boys etc. 

           Everyone has somebody but Margot.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HIGH. COURTYARD - DAYS ARE PASSING

           Alone -- her new normal -- Annie eats her lunch on the grass 
           with an open book on Black Holes at her feet. Beside her, a 
           stack of more books -- her friends.

           She pulls out items from a sack lunch one by one, starting 
           with a note from Donna. We hear it as Annie reads it.

                                 DONNA (V.O.)
                        You are my star.

           Annie holds the note to her body. It’s a private moment. 
           After a beat, she carefully pockets the note in a special 
           pouch in her backpack. The open pouch is full of similar 
           Donna notes.

           She looks up. Around. Most students eat with real friends. 
           This dismays her. 
           Until she notices Stew across the courtyard, also alone and 
           reading Turtle Man and the Lightening Lizard. The sight of 
           reading Stew turns her cheeks rosy. 

           Just as she blushes, a nearby CAMPUS MAINTENANCE WORKER turns 
           on a leaf blower, blowing her lunch notes out from her pouch, 
           into the sky and all around. Annie struggles to retrieve 
           them. As she grabs one by one, we hear the notes:

                                 DONNA (V.O.)
                        Great ladies have great minds.

                                 DONNA (V.O.)
                        Always eat dessert.

                                 DONNA (V.O.)
                        Let’s get you a new bra.

           One note flutters away. A HOT GIRL sees it, picks it out of 
           the air. Reads it. 

                                 HOT GIRL
                        You’re your own kinda beautiful? 

           Annie scampers to her.

                                 ANNIE
                        Sorry, that’s, um, that’s mine.

           Hot girl scans Annie. Clocks Annie’s shirt. On it, two wolves 
           howl up to the moon, rendered in hideous pastels. 

                                 HOT GIRL
                             (judging)
                        Do you write these to yourself?

                                 ANNIE
                        My mom writes them.

           Hot girl laughs.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Oh. You’re not joking?

                                 ANNIE
                             (squeaks it out)
                        Um, no.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        That’s sad.

           Hot girl crumples it and throws it away. Then goes on her 
           way. Annie runs to the trash. Digs it out. 
           We follow another note as it’s blown farther and farther 
           away, landing at a pair of feet. The feet turn into a person 
           as someone bends down to grab it.

           It’s Margot. She holds the note up to read.

                                 DONNA (V.O.)
                        You’re brave if your heart is 
                        beating.

           Margot looks up to the sky.

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. OUTSIDE THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Margot stares at PRINCIPAL BLEEKER’S door plaque, 
           contemplating. Before she can decide to knock, the door opens 
           just enough for Ms. Gates to escape.

                                 MS. GATES
                             (startled re: Margot)
                        Oh! Hello--

           Margot notices the zipper on the side of her dress undone. 

                                 MS. GATES (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Principal Bleeker is out to 
                        lunch...so, now’s not, well, it’s 
                        not a good time.

           Margot gives a polite nod, then watches Ms. Gates hobble 
           away, adjusting her tights. Margot looks back to Principal 
           Bleeker’s door, then decides to leave.

           EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY / INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - DAY

           Donna, dressed for work, drops Annie off at the public 
           library.  

                                 DONNA
                        Enjoy your kingdom.

                                 ANNIE
                             (as she gets out)
                        Mom.

                                 DONNA
                        You love this place, what’s 
                        shameful about that? Shout it from 
                        the rooftop!

           Donna watches Annie sour through the open passenger door. 
           Annie looks around to make sure no one heard her.
                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        Annie, I’m trying! I’m really 
                        trying! And you’re giving me 
                        nothing!

           Annie stalemates with Donna. Donna pleads. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Fine! I LOVE BOOKS. BOOKS ARE MY 
                        ONLY FRIENDS! BOOKS DON’T HAVE LEGS 
                        SO THEY CAN’T WALK AWAY LIKE PEOPLE 
                        CAN! HAPPY?

           Donna crumbles at her daughter’s admission. Rapidly climbs 
           out of the car. Rushes to Annie. Puts her hands on her 
           shoulders.

                                 DONNA
                        I’m your friend!

                                 ANNIE
                        I guess.

           Donna looks at her watch. Realizes she’s late.

                                 DONNA
                        Shooty, shoot!

           Donna runs to the trunk. Grabs a book out of it. We catch the 
           title: ENHANCING THE FEMALE ORGASM. She pulls cash out of a 
           pocket in her tiny shorts.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        This has a late fee. Please return 
                        it.

           Unfazed, Annie takes the book and the cash. 

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        You’re so loved, Tootsie.

           Donna squeezes Annie’s cheek. Then pops back in the car. 
           Putters off, leaving Annie outside her public literary haven.

           INT. ELLISON SISTERS’ BATHROOM - DAY

           Margot cleans her paint brushes in the sink. Jess comes in. 

                                 JESS
                        We’re practicing decorating 
                        cupcakes downstairs. 
                                 MARGOT
                        No thank you.

                                 JESS
                        For my bridal shower.

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh.
                             (thinking)
                        No thank you.

                                 JESS
                        Margot, I’m getting married and you 
                        couldn’t care less.

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m happy for you.

                                 JESS
                        I’m not getting that.

                                 MARGOT
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 JESS
                        Be grateful! You’re getting a 
                        brother!

           Margot doesn’t respond. Jess lingers. Then picks up Margot’s 
           drying watercolor picture of a T-Rex skeleton off the 
           counter. Margot hates that she does.

                                 MARGOT
                        Can you put that down?

                                 JESS
                        Only if you’re downstairs in ten 
                        minutes to frost.

                                 MARGOT
                        To practice frosting.

                                 JESS
                        I want everything to be perfect. Is 
                        that so bad?

           When Margot doesn’t respond, Jess scans Margot, now patting 
           her brushes on a hand towel. She finally sets the painting 
           down. 
                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        You can think you’re better, 
                        smarter, different, or whatever it 
                        is you’re telling yourself but 
                        we’re your family--

           Pointedly, Jess pulls out a RED THONG, the thong from 
           Margot’s nude, which shocks Margot.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        --and while you seem to be okay 
                        lying to us, just know: you can’t 
                        lie to God.

           Margot absorbs the warning in her sister’s face as Jess 
           dangles the thong in the air.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        It’ll catch up with you.

           Then, Jess re-pockets the thong.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                             (chipper)
                        Cupcake time!

           INT. ELLISON HOME. KITCHEN - DAY

           A perfect kitchen. Pristine white cabinets. Marble counters. 
           Flowers, always. Around a kitchen island, the Ellison women 
           decorate bridal-shower cupcakes with girlish glee.

           A tormented Margot holds a bag of black icing on the 
           outskirts of the cupcake bonanza. She’s busy butchering 
           cupcake tops with haphazardly frosted bow-ties. 

           Jess looks to Margot, reviewing her bow-ties. She hates what 
           she sees. When Margot starts on another cupcake, Jess grabs 
           her wrist.

                                 JESS
                             (too bubbly)
                        Those are terrible. Maybe we have 
                        Greta do those?

           Greta hurries over. Jess takes the icing bag from Margot and 
           hands it to their little sister. Greta surveys the tops and 
           the bow-ties.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                             (to Greta)
                        Just scrape them off and start 
                        again.
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                             (to Margot)
                        You do dishes? 

           Jess gives her best Stepford smile.

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Annie sits in the stacks alone. She intensely reads a book on 
           thermodynamics with true delight in her eyes. A librarian 
           (70s, F) stocks shelves nearby. 

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Where’s Margot?

           The question pierces Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                        Gone, Wanda.

                                 LIBRARIAN / WANDA
                        Hey, better you’re used to it now. 
                        At my age, they all start dying off 
                        anyway and then you realize, you’re 
                        really alone.

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY. STACKS (ANOTHER AISLE) - DAY

           Annie reads more on thermodynamics, leaning against a shelf.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Annie?

                                 ANNIE
                        God damnit, Wanda! Can I get some 
                        silence in this LIBRARY.

           She looks over -- it’s Stew, in the flesh, holding a stack of 
           Turtle Man comic books. Startled, Annie slams the book shut. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Fuck, uh--

           Annie struggles. Stares at him. Realizes she’s staring.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Aisle’s yours.

           She turns, ready to scurry away into a black-hole.

                                 STEW
                        What’cha reading?
           Annie turns back. Her thermodynamics book very on display.

                                 ANNIE
                        Just some extra-curricular stuff. 

                                 STEW
                        Looks intense. 

           Annie blushes.

                                 STEW (CONT'D)
                        Hey congrats. 

           Annie looks at Stew, quizzically.

                                 STEW (CONT'D)
                        On Purdue. I knew you’d get in.
                        I mean, first off: you’re like, the 
                        only person I know that could 
                        survive space besides Gudwag in 
                        Turtle Man Golden Defeat. He has 
                        interstellar gills so he can 
                        breathe in space, no helmet.

                                 ANNIE
                             (so coy)
                        I wish.

                                 STEW
                        I know I don’t read anything as 
                        sophisticated as you, but if you 
                        ever wanna read together, 
                        like...next to each other in the 
                        same room, we could maybe do that. 
                        But if you like to read 
                        thermodynamics alone, I get it.

                                 ANNIE
                        You want me to...to read...with 
                        you...?

                                 STEW
                        It sounds ridiculous out loud...

           There’s a long, pregnant silence of jittery desire and 
           nervousness.

                                 STEW (CONT'D)
                        I guess, um, maybe I could get your 
                        number?

           Annie sucks in air but can’t bring herself to speak due to 
           feelings of surging ecstasy. Stew pulls out his phone.
                                 STEW (CONT'D)
                        Oh and also, I ordered a BPA free 
                        special edition Turtle Man water 
                        bottle. Kinda expensive, but I 
                        guess my kidneys are worth it. 

           This is Annie’s dirty talk. Her eyes flutter. 

           INT. HILLSIDE WARD OF THE LDS CHURCH - DAY

           The Ellison women sit in a pew at Sunday service. They listen 
           to Bishop Ellison, their father, who recites scripture 3 
           Nephi 9:13-14 to the entire ward. We push in on Margot as he 
           speaks.

                                 MR. ELLISON
                             (reading)
                        “Behold, mine arm of mercy is 
                        extended towards you, and whosoever 
                        will come, him will I receive; and 
                        blessed are those who come unto 
                        me.” 

           Mr. Ellison looks out to his holy, Mormon audience. 

                                 MR. ELLISON (CONT'D)
                        To those of us heeding worldly 
                        temptation, acting with ungodly 
                        motivations, let us be reminded: 
                        our Heavenly Father is ready to 
                        receive you in your imperfect 
                        state, so long as you are willing 
                        to receive Him as the one and only.

           For a moment, Mr. Ellison stares straight at Margot. She 
           can’t hold his gaze. She looks down at her lap.

           A tiny hand reaches over to Margot’s; it’s Franny’s. She 
           gives Margot’s hand a squeeze when she needs it most.

           INT. HILSIDE WARD OF THE LDS CHURCH - DAY

           During a post-church potluck, Margot is stuck in a 
           conversation with Mrs. Ellison, SISTER DUNGAREE (40s) and her 
           daughter, SUSAN DUNGAREE (18). They all eat petit bowls of 
           chili.

           Mrs. Ellison spoons the smallest amount into her mouth. 
           Struggles to swallow. Even so, she smiles wide.
                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Sister Dungaree, your chili is 
                        phenomenal. 

           Mrs. Ellison nudges Margot.

                                 MARGOT
                             (trying to compliment)
                        Yes, I can taste the kidney beans 
                        and the other types of beans.

                                 SISTER DUNGAREE
                        Thank you Margot. I hear you’re 
                        going to BYU next year? Just like 
                        my Susan.

                                 MARGOT
                             (mouthful)
                        Uh huh.

                                 SISTER DUNGAREE
                        Susan’s going to study education.

                                 MRS. ELLISON 
                        How lovely!

                                 SUSAN
                        I’d like to be a third grade 
                        teacher. I just love kids. 

           Margot only smiles. An awkward lull.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Well Margot’s very artistic. I’ve 
                        always told her she could paint for 
                        a living if she plays her cards 
                        right. The law school’s right 
                        there; snag one of those and you 
                        can paint all you want!

                                 SISTER DUNGAREE
                        What a life that would be, huh?

                                 MARGOT
                             (blurts)
                        I need a tampon.

           The women look at her, uncomfortable. Margot gestures towards 
           her vagina.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        It’s gushing down there. Vagina 
                        Falls.
           EXT. HILLSIDE WARD OF THE LDS CHURCH - SECONDS LATER

           Mrs. Ellison pulls Margot away from listening ears. She 
           speaks in hushed tones as she finds somewhere private.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        What was that?! Talking about 
                        your...you know...when we’re 
                        eating! Eating chili, of all 
                        things!

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s my period, Mom.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Margot. Dear. I know Jess’s wedding 
                        has been hard for you, not being 
                        the center of attention with her 
                        home, but you’ll have your day and 
                        we will do just as much for you as 
                        we have for her.

           Mrs. Ellison finds a quiet corner. It’s suitable for her and 
           their conversation.

                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t care about weddings.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        You think that now but you’ll meet 
                        your person and you’ll want 
                        everything just the same. It’s how 
                        it goes. Now please go back in 
                        there and apologize to the 
                        Dungarees. What you said was deeply 
                        disturbing.

                                 MARGOT
                        God made periods. We all have them. 
                        I know Dad doesn’t like when we 
                        talk about it, but if I have to 
                        bleed through my pants six days a 
                        month, I’m going to talk about it.

           Mrs. Ellison shivers with discomfort.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Mom, you have a vagina and it 
                        bleeds, among many other things. 
                        It’s normal! Talking about it 
                        should be normal! 

           Mrs. Ellison could light trees on fire with her gaze.
                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                             (running away with it)
                        Do you not have a vagina? Are you a 
                        robot? Are we all robots?!

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        That’s it! You’re grounded!

                                 MARGOT
                        Great! Fucking ground me!

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        MARGOT MARY ELLISON! 

           Church-goers across the way look over. Mrs. Ellison hates 
           drawing attention for the wrong reasons. She stabilizes 
           herself.

                                 MARGOT
                        ...sorry. 

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Saying sorry does not undo things, 
                        Margot.

           Mrs. Ellison examines her daughter with frustration.

                                 MRS. ELLISON (CONT'D)
                        It’s like I don’t even know who my 
                        daughter’s becoming.

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH. HALLWAY - DAY

           It’s yearbook distribution day. Annie bolts down the hall, 
           toward her locker, clutching her yearbook. She shoves her way 
           through groups of friends exchanging their yearbooks, signing 
           away. It seems everyone has plenty to say about each other, 
           but not about Annie.

           She passes Margot, who, to Annie’s displeasure, is busy 
           signing classmate SKATER JAKE’s yearbook. Skater Jake waits 
           as Margot finishes. She hands his yearbook back.

                                 SKATER JAKE
                        Let me sign yours!

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh, I didn’t um -- I didn’t get 
                        one.
                                 SKATER JAKE
                        Shit, dude. But you got Best to 
                        Take Home to Your Parents! Fucking 
                        rad! COME ON!

           Just then, a STUDENT passes, hits SKATER JAKE on the back:

                                 STUDENT
                        Dude, hot Claire from Spanish asked 
                        to sign yours.

                                 SKATER JAKE
                        NOOOO way.

           Skater Jake and friend run off.

           FURTHER DOWN THE HALL, Annie shoves her yearbook inside her 
           locker. She’s got no use for it. Just then, someone clears 
           their throat. Startled, Annie moves her locker door, 
           revealing a braced-face NERDY SOPHOMORE (F) shaking 
           nervously.

                                 NERDY SOPHOMORE
                        Hey Annie. Uh, you don’t know me, 
                        but, like, I saw your legendary 
                        zero-gravity demonstration in Sci-
                        Sisters club last fall and it blew 
                        my mind. I still think about it. Is 
                        there, like anyway I could get you 
                        to sign my yearbook?

           Annie lights up. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Only if you’ll sign mine, Eleanor.

                                 NERDY SOPHOMORE
                        You...know...my...name!?

           The girl offers up her yearbook as Annie grabs hers out of 
           her locker. They exchange.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t um, don’t mind all the free 
                        space...I’m very picky about who I 
                        want to remember for eternity.

           At this second, Annie looks past nerdy Eleanor, and sees 
           Margot, though a fare distance away, standing alone, watching 
           Annie. When she sees Annie looking, Margot doesn’t look away. 
           They hold eye-contact for a beat -- the longest they’ve 
           looked at each other in a while -- until Annie breaks it. She 
           looks back to Eleanor.
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        I sign in sharpie ‘cause I like the 
                        smell, that cool?

           ON MARGOT, alone down the hall, watching Annie sign nerdy 
           Eleanor’s yearbook. 

                                 TOBIN (O.S.)
                        Margot--

           Unbeknownst to her, Tobin has sauntered up. He smolders and 
           holds out his yearbook. 

                                 TOBIN (CONT'D)
                        I’d be honored--

                                 MARGOT
                        Of course.

           She takes it. Flips it open to a page of student life photos. 
           In the sea of smiling faces, there’s one photo that Margot 
           catches -- Annie. Alone. Reading in the school courtyard 
           unaware that her photo’s been taken. Margot admires it while 
           Tobin admires her. 

           Margot looks up, past Tobin’s smouldering face, towards 
           Annie’s locker again. But now students crowd the hall, 
           obscuring Annie from view.

           INT. GROCERY STORE. PRODUCE SECTION - DAY

           Jess pushes a cart past bountiful displays of apples and 
           potatoes. Greta follows in her footsteps. Margot walks behind 
           them, a zombie glaze about her.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Pssttt.

           Margot doesn’t hear.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Margot!

           Margot turns. Notices DONNA HIDING, albeit poorly, behind a 
           banana display tower. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE. BAKING AISLE - SECONDS LATER

           Donna holds a couple containers of Nesquik. She’s elated to 
           see Margot.
                                 DONNA
                        I don’t know what happened, but 
                        honey, we miss you. I feel like 
                        I’ve lost a child. 

           Margot smiles up at Donna. 

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        If you can’t tell me, I get it. But 
                        whatever she said, just know, she 
                        doesn’t mean it. She’s like a 
                        horse. Shits while she walks but 
                        everyone loves the horse because 
                        they know the horse doesn’t know 
                        it’s walking and shitting; that 
                        make sense?

           Margot giggles for the first time in a while. In Donna’s 
           presence, she relaxes. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Um, you know, I--

           Unbeknownst to Margot, Jess and Greta near. Jess is 
           thoroughly unhappy to see her talking to Donna. Both Jess and 
           Greta eye Donna’s scantly clothed body.

                                 DONNA
                             (seeing Jess)
                        Hi, there...

           Margot turns. Realizes it’s her sisters. 

           Self-conscious under Jess’s gaze, Donna tries to pull her 
           shirt over her cleavage; it doesn’t do much.

                                 JESS
                        We’re checking out.

                                 MARGOT
                        Sorry. Ya. Okay. I was just--

           Margot grabs a jar of whatever off a shelf. Throws it in the 
           cart. Jess turns the cart around. Greta follows right behind 
           her. Margot doesn’t move.

                                 JESS
                             (without turning around)
                        Margot.

           Margot relents, but turns once to give Donna the smallest 
           wave goodbye. Donna, saddened to see Margot in such a state, 
           waves right back. 
                                 DONNA
                        Bye, hun.

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. KITCHEN NOOK - DAY

           Annie wears her astronaut helmet. She journals in a moon 
           notebook at the kitchen table. 

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Dear Future Annie, How is Space? 
                        Pretty sweet? I thought so. I hope 
                        the Moon is cool. So big news: Stew 
                        asked for my number. Can you 
                        believe it, journal! Can you?! 
                        Stew! I know. Tell him hi if he is 
                        your husband now. RE: Margot, we’re 
                        still not talking. I don’t think 
                        we’ll ever talk. I’ll probably 
                        never have a friend again until 
                        astronaut training. So future 
                        Annie, remember, you should just 
                        get a dog. People say they love you 
                        unconditionally. Name it Neil. 
                        Hopefully it won’t have sex with 
                        everyone--

           The radio-obscured THE EAGLE HAS LANDED sounds from Annie’s 
           crappy flip phone. Annie stops writing, reaches for it.

                                 STEW (V.O.)
                        What’s Up, Tongue Emoji. It’s Stew. 
                        Exclamation mark, exclamation mark.

           INT. MILLS' APARTMENT. BATHROOM - DAY

           In a small, shared bathroom with the toilet inches from the 
           shower, inches from the sink, and inches from the door, Annie 
           showers.

           On the mirror, MULTIPLE POST-IT NOTES that read STEW PHINES 
           924-322-2858 DON’T LOSE!!!!

           Annie holds her phone out of the shower to keep it dry while 
           she stares at its screen which is open to Stew’s text.

           ‘What’s up? Tongue Emoji It’s Stew!!’ 

           As she looks at it, Annie uses her free hand to explore her 
           parts. Her face grimaces with concentration as she maneuvers. 
           Excitement builds. It’s taking time, as these things do. So 
           she works for it. And works for it. 
           And keeps on working for it. Seconds away from maybe a 
           glorious climax there’s a KNOCK at the door.

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Baby, you’re using all the hot 
                        water! 

           Instinctively, Annie drops her phone. It lands in the toilet 
           with a PLOP.

                                 ANNIE
                        FUCK!

           She lunges for her phone but slips and falls, hitting the lip 
           of the tub with her face. Ouch.

           INT. HOOTERS - DAY

           A pissed Annie holds an ice-pack up to her left eye. She sits 
           in a booth alone. 

           In front of her on the table, her cellphone sits in a bowl of 
           rice. In neighboring booths, tables of OLD MEN down beers and 
           eat wings. She nurses a chocolate milk and a plate full of 
           fries while watching her phone, as if her focus will soak up 
           the water damage faster. 

           She takes off the ice-pack. Her left eye is swollen and black 
           as night. Annie can’t wait any longer. She takes the phone 
           from the bowl, opens it, tries to turn it on, but nothing 
           happens. Annie groans the way only a teenage girl can.

           Donna shimmies over, slides into the booth with her cleavage 
           so generously on display. She snags a fry and chews, examines 
           her stubbornly heartbroken child.

                                 DONNA
                        Sitting at Hooters is no way for a 
                        lady astronaut to celebrate her 
                        big, great life. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I have no life, Mom.
                        Especially now.

           Annie takes a long swig of chocolate milk. Like a drunk but 
           with dairy.

                                 DONNA
                        Don’t say that, Annie; I work real 
                        hard to give you one of those. 
           Donna scoots close. Gives her daughter a tender kiss on the 
           head. 

                                 OLD GEEZER
                        Donna, baby, come give old Joe one 
                        of those.

                                 DONNA
                        Leave a good tip, Joe, and I’ll 
                        think about it.

           The men laugh, hysterically, drunkenly. Donna looks to her 
           daughter. She brushes the unruly hair out of her eyes.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        You’ve been shooting for the moon 
                        since the day you were born, and 
                        one day, you’re gonna get there, 
                        and you’re gonna look back at teeny 
                        tiny Earth, and think of all the 
                        amazing things you have on this 
                        crazy planet that make it home. And 
                        maybe it’s just a hunch, but I 
                        think there’s one particular thing 
                        you can’t get to the moon without. 
                        And if I was you, I’d be doing all 
                        I could to get her back. I don’t 
                        know what that is or how you can do 
                        it, but I do know, you gotta.

           Holding back tears, Annie fixates on her dead phone. One tear 
           persists. It falls from her eye and Donna wipes it.

           Annie turns away from her mom, but the tears don’t stop.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                             (trying to stop the tears)
                        How ‘bout this: 

           Donna pulls her phone out of her cleavage and hands it to her 
           daughter.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        How about I let you use my phone 
                        until I can afford to replace 
                        yours.

                                 ANNIE
                        You sure--OKAY!

           Annie swipes the phone.

                                 DONNA
                        Wait. Let me--
           Donna takes the phone back. Surveys her photos and messages 
           as Annie waits, vibrating with happiness.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                             (scrolling through)
                        Oof. 
                             (scrolling further)
                        Thank god, I cleared that up-- 
                        geez, lordy. That is NOT for your 
                        eyes.

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Annie begins a text on her mom’s phone, addressed to Stew.

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Hi. It’s Annie on my mom’s phone! 
                        LOL CATZ.

           Sends it. Then immediately regrets it. She drafts another 
           message.

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Not LOL CATZ. Just LOL.

           INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - LATER NIGHT

           Annie’s dozing off but fighting it. Every few seconds she 
           checks the phone. Minutes go by, no text from Stew. An hour 
           goes by, nope, nada. 

           Unable to sleep, she tosses and turns. She moves just so, 
           that her eyes land on the BEST FRIENDS BOOK, which lies on 
           the floor by her hamper -- the biblical luminance gone, now 
           surrounded by tossed-aside dirty socks and underwear. 

           For a moment, she gazes at it, then, as if it’s too much, she 
           turns away from it to face the ceiling. 

           As if to alleviate the angst, she picks up the phone again. 
           Still no text from Stew. Rejected, she chucks it across the 
           room. It hits a MOON SHAPED bean bag; she doesn’t give a 
           shit. She only gives a shit about how much everything hurts 
           in the dark abyss of her bedroom.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - NIGHT

           We watch the Ellison home from across the street. A window 
           slides open on the first story. Margot climbs out into the 
           dead of suburban midnight. 
           She runs, putting ample distance between her body and her 
           home.

           INT. TEENAGE DREAMBOAT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margot, fully clothed, stands in the middle TEENAGE 
           DREAMBOAT’s bedroom like she’s just arrived. On the walls, 
           Quentin Tarantino posters and a NEON CORONA sign that he is 
           VERY proud of. They’re lit by a single lava lamp. Teenage 
           Dreamboat studies Margot, quizzically, from his bed where he 
           lounges like a sprawling tiger. 

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT
                        ...You just wanna talk?

           Margot thinks.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yes, like friends.

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT
                        We never do that.

                                 MARGOT
                        I know. But...maybe we could?

           Taking the loss, Teenage Dreamboat grabs a BEER shaped 
           stuffed pillow, ready to be bored to death by lady thoughts. 

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT
                        ...alright.

           Margot considers. Deep in thought. Then she takes a seat on 
           the edge of his bed.

                                 MARGOT
                        Do you ever worry that your whole 
                        life’s going by and the only thing 
                        you’re choosing is what cereal to 
                        have in the morning?

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT
                        I don’t really eat breakfas--

                                 MARGOT
                        But not really because your mom 
                        buys the cereals so you think 
                        you’re making a choice, but 
                        actually your options have already 
                        been chosen for you? So it’s wheat 
                        berries or nutty nuggets every 
                        single day forever.
                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT
                        Nutty nuggets?

                                 MARGOT
                             (explaining)
                        Store brand Grape Nuts. Sugar-free.

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT 
                        You seriously don’t wanna hookup? 

                                 MARGOT
                        You know what I really want? 

           Thinking it’s finally his cue, Dreamboat perks up, leans in, 
           but Margot stands up, ready to make a point. When she moves, 
           he falls forward onto the bed.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I want to see the big dinosaur at 
                        the Natural History Museum in New 
                        York City on a Wednesday. Imagine 
                        it, it’s ten in the morning: 

           INT. (POP-TO) AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

           An older Margot with a bob -- because all older, 
           sophisticated women have them -- stares intently at the jaw 
           of the enormous T-REX SKELETON.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        ...when everyone in New York is at 
                        their desk because they have to be, 
                        but I’m just there, looking that T-
                        Rex right in her big, boney face, 
                        just because I chose to be.

           INT. TEENAGE DREAMBOAT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT
                        You can’t just go to New York.

           The excitement in her eyes fades. She knows this truth.

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT (CONT'D)
                        I mean, it’s only a four hour 
                        drive, but fuck that. The city 
                        smells like pee, man. And honestly, 
                        the T-Rex is fucking overrated.

           Any animation in Margot’s face has fled. Teenage Dreamboat 
           realizes he’s done some damage.
                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT (CONT'D)
                        But like, go if you want. You do 
                        you. You know?

           Margot shoves her feet in her shoes.

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT (CONT'D)
                        Wait, so we’re really not gonna...?

           She walks to the window and Dreamboat follows her.

                                 MARGOT
                        Bye, Eric Derrick.

           He watches Margot climb through the window and descend down a 
           storybook trellis. As she scurries off:

                                 TEENAGE DREAMBOAT
                             (shouts)
                        Why don’t you ever use doors?!

           He gives up with less malice and more fantastical confusion. 
           Like a mystical creature, she has come, and she has gone.

               EXT. SPACE (DREAM) - UNKNOWN TIME BECAUSE IT’S SPACE

           Annie stands on the moon in an astronaut suit, staring at 
           Earth. Tiny green and blue. It begins flashing colors, bright 
           gem-like colors, then turns ghastly white. As white as the 
           moon. Until it becomes a face -- Margot’s face -- smiling at 
           her.

           We push into Planet Margot as she begins to talk to astronaut 
           Annie. Planet Margot relishes every word.

                                 PLANET FACE MARGOT
                        You are a sad little person, Annie. 
                        You’re a sad little person who 
                        tells herself she’s better than 
                        everyone because she knows she’s a 
                        loser. A big, fat loser with no 
                        friends. You thought I was your 
                        friend? I was never your friend. 
                        Because, who could be?

           Annie can’t take it. She clicks a button to release her 
           helmet’s seal. She pulls it off, resulting in immediate space 
           suffocation.

           Her face turns blue as she GASPS for air that’s not there--
           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gasping, real life Annie sits up. Thank god, she’s alive. She 
           looks out the window where often times, Margot is waiting. 
           But nobody’s there. Not even the moon.

           EXT. (FLASHBACK) MILLS' APARTMENT. ROOF - DAY

           Annie (10) and Margot (10) play on the roof. Annie sports the 
           pouchy belly of a well-fed kid and Margot is one of those 
           rare kids that’s never had an awkward phase. 

           Annie steps in big, slow steps. Margot follows her, doing the 
           same.

                                 ANNIE
                             (imitating Neil)
                        That’s one small step for me, and 
                        one giant step for me. I’d like to 
                        thank my Mom, Donna. 
                             (shouting behind her)
                        Margot, do you have any words for 
                        Earth? 

                                 MARGOT
                        The moon is not cheese! You cannot 
                        eat it!

                                 ANNIE
                        You heard it here first, folks. The 
                        moon is not cheese!
                             (breaking from character)
                        Now I’m hungry. 

           Annie traipses back to the door that leads back down to the 
           apartment building. It’s locked. Immediate meltdown ensues.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Oh no! Oh god! We’re gonna starve! 
                        We’re gonna die up here! We’re 
                        gonna--

                                 MARGOT
                        Go through your window. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Huh?

           Margot beckons her to the side of the roof where a fire-
           escape ladder leads down to Annie’s window. 
                                 MARGOT
                        Why would God make windows if we 
                        couldn’t go through them?

           END OF FLASHBACK

           EXT. MILLS' APARTMENT - LATER NIGHT

           From across the street, we watch sleepless Annie looking out 
           her window. After a moment, she retreats. As soon as she 
           does, REVEAL Margot who watches Annie’s window from afar. All 
           parts of her wishing Annie would step back into view. 

           Early morning approaches. Lawn sprinklers ignite, spraying 
           Margot with water. She stays long enough to be soaked. Then 
           solemnly walks off in the direction of home.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - EARLY MORNING

           Margot approaches the window she normally crawls through. She 
           tugs on it. But it doesn’t open. Inside: Jess brushes her 
           teeth, staring directly at her sopping wet sister. A pleased 
           look in her eye.

           INT. ELLISON HOME. KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

           Margot stands in her soaked clothes, defeated. Her parents 
           stand opposite her, both in their robes -- punishment 
           imminent.

           Around a corner, Jess, Greta and Franny watch their sister 
           face their angry parents. 

                                 MR. ELLISON
                        You don’t leave this house without 
                        asking, let alone climb out of 
                        windows like some kind of animal. 
                        My goodness, Margot.

                                 MARGOT
                        I was just...I was seeing Annie.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        That girl is not a good influence. 
                        And her mother...

           Margot stares at the floor tiles. 

                                 MR. ELLISON
                        You know the drill. 
           Mr. Ellison holds out a palm. Margot sets her phone in it. He 
           makes a big ‘to-do’ of placing it on the counter like it’s in 
           phone-time-out.

                                 MR. ELLISON (CONT'D)
                        You’ve disappointed all of us. 
                        Greatly.

           Jess clocks the phone, alone and vulnerable on the kitchen 
           counter.

           INT. MARGOT'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Margot sits up in bed alone. She looks around her room, her 
           childhood bedroom -- the four walls she’s always known. Her 
           drawings. Her paintings. The things that make it hers. Though 
           stoic, her pain is visible.

           She gets up. Climbs down onto her hands and knees, hunting 
           for something under her bed: for the tampon box. She grows 
           frantic as she searches and searches. Finally, she finds it. 
           She grabs it. But it’s light. Too light.

           She flips the box on its side but nothing comes out. The 
           letters are GONE. If she was frantic before, she’s panicked 
           now. Pure terror in her face.

           INT. MILLS' APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Annie sits on the couch wearing her phallic NASA spaceship 
           sweatshirt, watching an Apollo 11 documentary for the one-
           hundredth time on a crummy television. Her black eye is very 
           visible. She looks at her mother’s phone. No response from 
           Stew, just Annie’s single, sent message. This deeply, deeply 
           saddens her.

           On the T.V, Neil descends down the spacecraft step ladder, 
           until he sets one foot onto the cavernous moon floor.

                                 NEIL 
                        That’s one small step for man, one 
                        giant leap for mankind.

           Buzz Aldrin follows in his footsteps. They both look out to 
           the moon together. 

                                 BUZZ 
                        Beautiful view.

           WE REVERSE BACK TO ANNIE but now she’s 10 and sitting next to 
           10-year-old Margot. The girls watch the same documentary in 
           matching footsie pajamas.
                                 MARGOT
                        I’m grateful God made the moon for 
                        you.

                                 ANNIE
                        There is no God. Except Mr. Clean.
                             (explaining)
                        Mom says he’s as good looking as 
                        God.

                                 MARGOT
                        But who else could have made 
                        something as beautiful?

                                 ANNIE
                        Science?

           Margot mulls this over.

                                 MARGOT
                        How is science special?

                                 ANNIE
                        Because it can do anything.

                                 MARGOT
                        So can God.

           Annie mulls this over. They agree to disagree. Continue to 
           watch Neil and Buzz.

           On the screen, Neil and Buzz stand next to the American flag 
           they’ve stuck into the moon’s surface.

                                 NEIL 
                        Isn’t it something? Magnificent 
                        sight out here.

                                 BUZZ 
                        Magnificent desolation.

           BACK ON ANNIE IN PRESENT DAY as she stares at the paused TV 
           screen: a portrait of two astronauts on the moon. Neil and 
           Buzz, together.

           On the other end of the couch, Donna sits in the lap of a 
           BURLY MAN in a cowboy hat. He’s got a jawline for days.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        I was wondering how many times we 
                        were gonna watch Nelson touch that 
                        moon.

           Annie turns to him slowly, burgeoning rage in her face.
           INT. / EXT. ELLISON HOME. BACKYARD - DAY

           Through a glass door, Margot watches the bridal shower. She 
           can’t bring herself to join the beautiful MORMON GUESTS in 
           conservative dresses outside. She watches the guests dote on 
           Jess, who sports a massive flower crown. 

           Mrs. Ellison hovers beside her, bursting with mother-of-the-
           bride joy. Franny and Greta float about, chatting with 
           guests, eating cupcakes.

           Margot looks down at herself, wearing a potato sack of a 
           dress that matches Greta and Franny’s. She also wears a 
           matching flower crown.

           An older woman passes Margot. She nudges her.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        What fun is it staying inside? Get 
                        on, get out there! It’s your 
                        sister’s party for goodness’ sake! 

           EXT. MILLS’ APARTMENT - DAY

           Donna stands on the doorstep with burly man.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        You’re telling me I’m kicked out 
                        cause I didn’t know the moon guy’s 
                        name?

                                 DONNA
                        I am.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        That’s crazy. You’re letting a 
                        deranged 17-year-old boss you 
                        around!

                                 DONNA
                        So what are you suggesting? I let 
                        you boss me around?

           He takes this flirtatiously.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        Maybe.

           Donna slaps his encroaching hand away.

                                 DONNA
                        No. You don’t insult my child and 
                        lean in for a tit squeeze.
           Just as she says this, Annie emerges, holding the Best 
           Friends Book. Burly man notices Annie’s black eye because 
           it’s eye-catching. 

                                 ANNIE
                             (on a mission)
                        I gotta go get her.

                                 DONNA
                        Damn straight, baby.
                             (realizing)
                        Are those my keys?

           Too focused to talk, Annie barges onward, car keys in hand.

                                 DONNA (CONT'D)
                        Hun, until you make the payments, 
                        you gotta ask to borrow the car! 
                             (relenting)
                        Fine! Watch out for the red light! 
                        They mean stop! Yellow means gun 
                        it! Green means, well, the whole 
                        world knows what green means!

           EXT. GOLDEN VIEW GATED COMMUNITY HOMES - DAY

           A nice neighborhood. The doctors and lawyers of suburbia live 
           here. Two car garages. Oak trees on well-watered lawns. Not a 
           bluebird out of place, until:

           Donna’s beat up 1996 Honda Civic enters view. Puttering, 
           smoking. 

           Suddenly, the car brakes hard, then U-TURNS like a maniac.

           EXT. DONUT SHOP - DAY

           The Honda Civic pulls into the lot. Parks like the parking 
           spot lines are mere suggestions.

           INT. DONUT SHOP - DAY

           The large glass case filled with donuts of all kinds. Annie 
           studies it intensely.

                                 ANNIE
                             (to herself)
                        Hello my friends.
                             (to Cashier, not looking)
                        I’ll take a baker’s dozen, all 
                        maple bars. 
           She looks up to the cashier. It’s Stew. Annie freezes.

                                 STEW
                        Annie! What happened to your eye?

                                 ANNIE
                             (gulp)
                        Um...

           INT. (FLASHBACK) SHOWER - DAY

           Quick flash on Annie falling on her face.

           INT. DONUT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

                                 ANNIE
                        Which is why I started krav maga...

                                 STEW
                        That’s crazy cool. In Turtle Man 
                        The Comeback of The Hamdroids, he 
                        learns krav maga.

                                 ANNIE
                        ...ya, I heard about the 
                        uh...hamdroids doing it...too...

           Stew begins selecting donuts from the case, putting them in a 
           pink box:

                                 STEW
                        Sorry we haven’t talked; I left my 
                        phone at my Dad’s and he’s away for 
                        a bowling championship this 
                        weekend. But if you still wanna 
                        read, we’ll have to do it the old 
                        fashion way and just run into each 
                        other like how old people used to 
                        do it before phones.
                             (finalizing the donuts)
                        I always like running into you, 
                        Annie Mills.

                                 ANNIE
                             (not quietly enough)
                        ...Have I died?

           Stew takes the question very seriously.
                                 STEW
                        You look alive; you’ve got the cute 
                        rosy cheek stuff, which means 
                        there’s fresh blood in your face. 
                        So that’s a good sign. But I’m not 
                        a doctor. 

           Annie inhales the tiniest bit of air, while reaching up to 
           her rosy cheek, love-struck.

           Stew slides the box of donuts across the counter. Before 
           Annie can reach for her wallet, Stew pulls a ten dollar bill 
           from his own pocket and sets it in the cash register.

                                 STEW (CONT'D)
                        On the house.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Annie holds the donut box and the Best Friends Book, standing 
           at the wide-open Ellison front door. Beside it, a Pinterest-
           ish chalkboard that reads: Jess Goes Cobb! with a dumb 
           illustration of a cobb salad.

           Annie peers into the open doorway like it’s full of spiders.

           INT. ELLISON HOME. FOYER - DAY

           Annie hasn’t made it far. She’s standing in front of an entry-
           way table, gawking at a MASSIVE PORTRAIT of MR. ELLISON and 
           Mr. Ellison’s SIX BROTHERS who all stand around one OLD MAN 
           (their father). 

           It’s a lot of Mormon men wearing cable-knit in the desert. We 
           push into the photo until it comes to life...

           INT. (POP-TO) PHOTO OF ELLISON MEN - DAY

           A nice textured desert landscape: Ocotillo trees sway, cactus 
           wren flit about. The row of strapping Mormon brothers smile 
           at us, gathered around their blue-eyed patriarch. Their shoes 
           are spotless, despite the dusty Earth floor. 

                                 ELLISON PATRIARCH
                        I’m Joseph and these are my sons:

                                 MRS. ELLISON (O.S.)
                        Annie?

           INT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Annie turns, startled out of her vision. She sees Mrs. 
           Ellison, standing a sizable distance away from her, wearing 
           an enormous flower crown, staring at her and unhappy to be 
           doing so.

           She notes Annie’s black eye. Annie notes that she notes it.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, hi, Mrs. Ellison. Sorry to--I 
                        was just...admiring the uh--

           She looks back to the painting, haunted by the eight pairs of 
           Mormon eyes staring back.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        ...sweaters.

           Annie looks down at her clothes. Unfit for a party. Sweats 
           and her NASA penis-rocket sweatshirt.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Is Margot around?

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        No, Annie. 

           Annie looks behind Mrs. Ellison where the sounds and sights 
           of the party can be heard and seen.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ll be fast. I promise.

           Annie takes a step forward. Mrs. Ellison blocks her.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        I just -- I gotta see her. I gotta 
                        see Margot.
           Mrs. Ellison narrows her eyes at this girl in her Walmart T-
           shirt. The donut box. The crappy scrapbook. Her sinking face. 
           The black-eye.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Honey, I feel for you, I do. You 
                        and Margot have been friends for so 
                        long. But your situation with your 
                        mother and your mother’s job, and 
                        that deteriorating apartment on 
                        Wickenden and the men, all those 
                        men...(she reflects, then) -- it’s 
                        God’s miracle you turned out as 
                        wonderful as you have.

                                 ANNIE
                        Um, thanks...

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        But it’s not the kind of situation 
                        I want for my daughter any longer.

           Mrs. Ellison begins walking, guiding Annie (albeit 
           backwards), to the door. Annie doesn’t fight it because Mrs. 
           Ellison has a way of doing that to Annie.

                                 MRS. ELLISON (CONT'D)
                        You and Margot are very different 
                        girls who will lead very different 
                        lives.

                                 ANNIE
                             (broken)
                        But--

           Mrs. Ellison grabs the grand doorknob, ready to close it on 
           this sad sack of a teenage girl.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        I think it’d be best if you left, 
                        Annie. For everybody.

           Off Annie’s big, watering eyes, Mrs. Ellison shuts the door 
           for good. 

           EXT. ELLISON HOME. BACKYARD - DAY

           START ON a three-tier cake topped with a MRS. COBB banner. As 
           we pull out, we see cupcakes galore. This dessert spread is 
           an event planner’s wet dream. Margot stands by it, alone.

           She watches Jess, in a circle of patio chairs, waiting with a 
           wrapped bridal gift in her lap.
           Mrs. Ellison returns from inside the house, holding a 
           decorated clipboard to write down gift givers’ names.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Gift time, Mrs. Cobb To Be!

           Jess squeals. Pats the open seat next to her. Mrs. Ellison 
           takes it, then shifts in her seat like a happy cat getting 
           situated in the sun. She looks up, clocks Margot.

                                 MRS. ELLISON (CONT'D)
                        Margot, take a seat!

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m good right here.

           Mrs. Ellison simply tightens her lips, then returns her 
           attention to her beautiful young bride.

                                 JESS
                        I can’t wait any longer!

           Jess tears into a present. Victoriously holds up a pair of 
           granny panties. All ladies ooo and ahhhh.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                             (re: granny panties)
                        My golly, they’re so fun! I love 
                        them!

                                 GRANDMA
                             (sly)
                        Maybe Eugene will like them too.

           The ladies erupt in bashful laughter. Margot watches a 
           pleased Mrs. Ellison scribble the name of the gift-giver on 
           her stupid, doily-covered clipboard, hating every second of 
           everything.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Annie tosses the Best Friends Book in the passenger seat. She  
           wipes snot from her nose and tears from her cheeks. Stares at 
           little Margot’s face on the cover.

           Suddenly, she hears the burst of lady laughter. She pauses, 
           then turns to where she presumes it’s coming from. She sees 
           the Ellisons’ closed side yard gate. But next to it: their 
           neighbor’s OPEN gate. 
           EXT. (POP-TO) BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY

           In a dreamy field of lavender, Margot, elegant as ever, 
           smiles directly at us -- glowing, happy, holding freshly 
           picked lavender. 

           Behind her, one by one, hot naked men appear -- all 
           shirtless. They smile at us with kind assurance and kickass 
           bone structure. 

           Then, directly beside Margot, hot Jesus appears, wearing just 
           his loin cloth. He wraps one arm around Margot’s shoulders, 
           casually, then addresses the camera directly.

                                 JESUS
                        Go get her, girl. 

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Now, Annie’s face is bright, her conquer-the-worldness has 
           returned, and she’s staring down that motherfucking gate. 

           EXT. ELLISON HOME. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Keeping up the gift-opening, Greta hands Jess the next gift. 
           Jess opens it. Holds up an oatmeal, plain-Jane bra. 

                                 JESS
                        Eugine will love this.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                             (playful)
                        Honey! What goes on between man and 
                        wife is private!

           Jess teases her mother with the bra as if it’s risqué. Still 
           standing near the dessert table, Margot can’t hide her 
           disgust. Jess clocks it.

                                 JESS
                        Margot? Something wrong?

           Margot steels. The sisters hold eye-contact. They hold it for 
           so long that the entire party turns to face Margot.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        I know it’s my day, but gosh, I 
                        have to share something very 
                        special.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Mom, I don’t think she’s told you, 
                        but at Church this weekend, Margot 
                        told me--goodness I could cry just 
                        thinking about it-- you see, she 
                        told me that she’s interested in 
                        serving a mission. She told me it 
                        was her wedding present to me. She 
                        even--look at me, tearing up like a 
                        fool--she said she’s so convinced 
                        that she’s pushing off her freshman 
                        year at BYU to serve as soon as she 
                        can. I mean, can you believe it? 
                        Margot the missionary!

           Margot’s aghast. She doesn’t know where to look. The party 
           erupts into happy chatter.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                             (delighted)
                        Is that right, Margot?

           We watch Franny look to Margot. She sees Margot squirm.

                                 MARGOT
                        I hadn’t--

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Honey, I have to say, I’m so 
                        relieved.

           Mrs. Ellison looks to her ladies, who all pour out praise. 
           Just then, the side yard fence -- a fair distance from the 
           group, but close enough to see -- creaks.

           INT. ELLISONS’ NEIGHBOR’S YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Annie climbs up on the tall fence, struggling to keep a foot 
           hold. But she’s successful, getting her face over the top of 
           it, to see into the Ellisons’ backyard. 

           She spots Margot, too far to yell to, but close enough to 
           admire while the guests pour over Mrs. Ellison:

                                 GUEST 1
                        Mrs. Ellison, your daughters, each 
                        of them, I must say, perfect.

                                 GUEST 2
                        It’s true. I don’t know what you 
                        do, but it works like a charm.
                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Oh, Eileen, these girls are the 
                        Lord’s work. I have little to do 
                        with it. 

                                 JESS
                        Nonsense! It’s you, Mom. We want to 
                        be just like you. Each and every 
                        one of us.

           A flash of darkness in Margot’s face. Something we’ve never 
           seen before. She undoes her flower crown. She tosses it off 
           in the distance. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Ow!

                                 ANNIE
                             (to herself)
                        Epic.

           Annie watches, enraptured, as a silence lands over the 
           backyard. Margot turns to the cake. 

                                 MARGOT
                        This cake is just perfect. Doesn’t 
                        it look perfect? So perfect that I 
                        want a slice right this second.

                                 JESS
                        Margot, it’s gifts, then cake, you 
                        know that.

                                 MARGOT
                        Do I, Mrs. Cobb?

           Margot shoves her hand into the cake, taking out a chunk. 

                                 JESS
                        What the FRICK do you think you’re 
                        doing?!

           Margot turns around to face the party again. She looks 
           directly at Jess. Shoves the handful of cake into her mouth. 
           Chews like a barbarian. Annie does her best to keep her 
           vantage point, thoroughly enjoying the show.

                                 MARGOT
                             (disgusted, mouthful)
                        Is this fruitcake?!
                                 JESS
                        Of course it’s fruitcake! I love 
                        fruitcake! It’s perfectly plain and 
                        chewy!

                                 ANNIE
                             (to herself)
                        Fruitcake’s for lameos.

           Margot snags a cider flute out of a nearby guest’s hand. She 
           spits the cake into it, then hands the glass back to the 
           guest. She wipes her face with the sleeve of her dress. 

                                 MARGOT
                             (re: dress)
                        I hate this thing.

           She rips open the neckline, revealing her cleavage and rather 
           sexy bra.

                                 JESS
                        MOM!

           Mrs. Ellison is paralyzed. Jess realizes this. 

           Annie still holds her place on the fence, but she’s sweating 
           to keep it.

           An old woman tries to hand Margot a napkin to cover her 
           cleavage.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Dearie.

                                 MARGOT
                        No thank you. I’m proud of my 
                        boobs.

           Mrs. Ellison collects herself as much as she can.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Margot. Go upstairs. Please, go 
                        upstairs.

                                 JESS
                        Do as Mom says!

                                 MARGOT
                        Why? Because you do?

                                 JESS
                        What is WRONG with you!

           Margot bows.
                                 MARGOT
                        So much, apparently.

           Jess, as furiously red as a boiling tomato, gapes at her 
           sister, on the verge of eruption. And so, she erupts.

                                 JESS
                        Margot’s not a virgin! 

           All the ladies GASP. Jess scrambles to pull Margot’s PHONE 
           out of her handbag. 

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        She’s had sex lots, and lots of 
                        times with many, many boys. 

                                 MARGOT
                             (needing to correct)
                        Not that many...boys. I mean, sex, 
                        yes, um, quite a few times.
                             (reading the room)
                        Nevermind.

                                 JESS
                        She sneaks out of windows, her 
                        backpack’s full of condoms and lube 
                        and she sends boys ‘sext’ photos 
                        like these:

           On Margot’s phone, Jess pulls up Margot’s nude picture. Shows 
           it around the party like a teacher reading kindergartners a 
           picture book. Everyone takes a step back or scoots away from 
           Margot like she has the plague. 

           Annie, now redder than humanly possible, tries her best to 
           keep her grip on the fence, but she’s losing it. Fast. And 
           the fence is wobbling under her might.

           As Mrs. Ellison looks at the photo, Franny slips into the 
           house, running away from the chaos. Greta stays to watch, 
           eerily enjoying the scandal. 

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        That is not my daughter. You can’t 
                        see this poor girl’s face.

                                 JESS
                        It is, Mom. It is. Look.

           Jess zooms in on the Jesus birthmark. Mrs. Ellison sees it.

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                             (so small)
                        Oh Jesus.
                                 JESS
                        Yes. Jesus.

           A beat, as Mrs. Ellison stills -- her world shattered. 

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Shiiiiiiittttter.

           Just then, the crickety ripping of breaking wood. Everyone 
           looks to it. The fence separating the Ellisons’ backyard has 
           toppled over, and Annie, lays flat on top of it with the 
           donuts outstretched in her arms, saved.

                                 MARGOT
                             (shocked with delight)
                        Annie!

           Annie struggles to stand up. Wood, grass, rocks everything in 
           her hair, on her shirt. Her black-eye, still hideous. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Goodness gracious, what happened to 
                        your eye?

                                 ANNIE
                        I masturbated and it went badly.

           The entire Mormon audience puts their hands over their 
           mouths. Jess is especially disturbed. She looks to her 
           mother. 

                                 JESS
                        MOM! My party!

           Mrs. Ellison, shaking with fury, takes a step toward Annie. 

                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Get the FUCK out of my house!

                                 MARGOT
                        Mom!

                                 JESS
                             (horrified)
                        Mom!!!? The F-word?!

                                 GRETA
                             (joining in)
                        Mom!!! You can’t say that!

           Mrs. Ellison cowers under her daughters’ judgement. Stifles 
           her anger. 
                                 MRS. ELLISON
                        Annie, you are not welcome. This is 
                        a family-only event.

                                 ANNIE
                        Ya, I can see it’s going...really 
                        well. 

           She takes a beat to survey the disaster that’s become of the 
           party.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Let me say something, then I’ll 
                        fuck off forever.

           Mrs. Ellison reluctantly silences herself, giving Annie the 
           floor. Annie turns to Margot. Annie holds out the donut box.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Here: all maple bars. Your 
                        favorite. 
                             (to everybody)
                        Donuts are happiness.

           Margot accepts them. Annie refocuses.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Originally, I was gonna hand you 
                        those and the Best Friends Book, 
                        and give this whole speech I had 
                        planned; I was going to say that it 
                        takes two, that I can’t go to the 
                        moon if you’re not waiting for me 
                        back home but, I can’t do that. 
                        That’s about me when this is about 
                        you. And um, I get that now. So, 
                        you know, fuck all that. Margot, I 
                        just want to say I’m sorry for not 
                        asking about you. For not being 
                        there how you needed me. I want you 
                        to be happy. And if it takes you 
                        having sex and liking your own god 
                        and not being my best friend, then 
                        you have to do that. You have to be 
                        you. Because you are the most 
                        amazing person exactly as you are. 

           CLOSE ON MARGOT who’s grown teary-eyed.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        It was the greatest honor of my 
                        life, being your best friend. Thank 
                        you, to the moon and back.
           Annie looks to Mrs. Ellison. Gives her a nod. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Alright, I’m out.

           Annie looks to Jess.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, Jess? I hope you name your kids 
                        after things that go in a cobb 
                        salad. That’d make a wicked 
                        Christmas card.

           Annie takes one last look at Margot, who stands, in awe of 
           Annie, holding the donuts. Annie smiles the saddest, most 
           wonderful smile of gratitude. Then retreats, stepping over 
           the broken down fence, where we now see the NEIGHBOR has been 
           watching, horrified.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (passing the neighbor)
                        Sorry about the fence. Honestly it 
                        was already shit.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Annie walks to the car. Sees the BEST FRIENDS BOOK in the 
           passenger seat.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME. BACKYARD - DAY

           In the shambles, Margot takes a sweeping look around. 
           Everyone’s jaw dropped to the floor. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Enjoy the cake.

           She takes off in a sprint, into the house --

           INT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Margot races through her home, past the strapping man sweater 
           portrait, total chaos behind her. But she stops when she sees 
           Franny in the doorway, holding the STACK OF LETTERS in her 
           tiny hand. Margot freezes.

                                 FRANNY
                        Uncle Phil sounds like a real nice 
                        man. His husband sounds nice too. 
                        It’s a shame Dad won’t let him come 
                        to Christmas.
           Franny looks down at the letters, then up to the portrait, 
           directly at Uncle Phil in his matching sweater. 

                                 FRANNY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe one day.

           Margot looks at her little sister in bewilderment.

                                 MARGOT
                        Franny, what are you doing?

                                 FRANNY
                        I figured if I was gonna start 
                        helping anybody, I should start 
                        with the people I love the most.

           Franny steps aside. A packed suitcase beside her.

                                 FRANNY (CONT'D)
                        Go, Margot. I know how much you 
                        want to.

           Franny hands the letters back to Margot. Margot looks behind 
           her, towards the backyard, then back to Franny, who’s as calm 
           as calm can be.

                                 FRANNY (CONT'D)
                        God will take care of the rest. He 
                        always does.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Margot, holding her suitcase like a child, runs towards 
           Annie’s car. She sees Annie standing over their open TRASH 
           CAN at the curb.

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie!

           Annie spins around, revealing that she’s holding the Best 
           Friends Book over the open bin. Shocked to see Margot, she 
           drops it on accident.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        No!

           Annie looks into the bin. It’s landed on a mysteriously icky 
           combo of gunk, old meat, and ... dog poop?

           Now Margot’s made it to her.
                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I guess that means we have to start 
                        a new one.

                                 ANNIE
                             (overcome with joy)
                        We -- we -- we do?!!!
                             (after inhaling)
                        Oh god, that’s rank as fuck. Is 
                        that dog shit?

           After one look into the trash -- little kid Annie and Margot 
           smiling up at us from a heap of dog shit -- Annie runs to 
           Margot, hugging her. Margot lets her for a second, then pulls 
           away.

                                 MARGOT
                        I love you so much, I really do, 
                        but--

           Margot hits the top of the Honda Civic like a city woman, 
           demanding to leave. She looks back up to her house, then to 
           Annie.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        We should go.

           Annie now realizes Margot’s holding a suitcase.

                                 ANNIE
                        Shit okay, yes, BLAST OFF!

           INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - SECONDS LATER

           Both out of breath, but together, Annie takes one look at 
           Margot. Eternally happy to be in her company again.

           A smiling Annie starts the car as Margot melts with 
           exhaustion into the seat. 

           Then the car peels off -- precious cargo obtained -- and 
           heads home.

           INT. MILLS’ APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           In hot pink spandex, Donna puts the booty bands to work. 
           Glutes on fire. Her grunts are the only noises in the empty 
           apartment.

                                 DONNA
                        Feeeeeel the burn, Donna. Feel the 
                        burn.
           The front door opens, revealing Annie and Margot.

                                 DONNA (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                             (scrambling to get up)
                        My stars, look at this!

           She rushes to them. Envelopes both girls in a hug, kissing 
           them repeatedly on the heads. Annie squirms.

                                 ANNIE
                        Mom, your boob sweat.

           Donna doesn’t relent. Hugs tighter.

                                 DONNA
                        Embrace it. 

           INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Annie has everything she’s ever wanted: Margot in her room 
           again. Annie sits on her bed, while Margot sets her suitcase 
           down.

                                 ANNIE
                        So whatd’ya think? A week long 
                        sleepover? Your mom will probably 
                        cool the fuck off with time apart. 
                        Or some narcotics.  

                                 MARGOT
                        No, um, Annie, I gotta tell you 
                        something.

                                 ANNIE
                        Listen, it’s really okay if you’ve 
                        had sex with a hundred dudes. I 
                        know that and I accept that.

                                 MARGOT
                        What?! No. A hundred? That’s -- no, 
                        there’s nothing wrong with that, 
                        but I haven’t--anyway, okay, here 
                        it goes:

           A suddenly concerned Annie sits up like a child ready to be 
           told Santa isn’t real. Margot looks right at her. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                             (deep breath)
                        I sent the photo.

                                 ANNIE
                        Huh?
                                 MARGOT
                        The nude. I sent it. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Ya, to Pizza Gary the horn dog 
                        psycho.

                                 MARGOT
                        No; to our entire school; Gary is 
                        innocent; we had sex once and he 
                        was clingy, but he didn’t send my 
                        photo to the whole school.

                                 ANNIE
                        ...why would you send a nude photo 
                        of yourself...? 

                                 MARGOT
                        Because I wanted a different life.

           THE MARGOT PLAN SEQUENCE BEGINS...

           INT. HILLSIDE HIGH - DAY

           A CUTE GIRL walks down a hall while everyone checks out her 
           glorious butt.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        After slutty Katy was suspended for 
                        her butt nudes, I was inspired. 

           INT. GAP DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Margot examines her body in a red thong. Hmm...

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I was always sneaking into the Gap 
                        to try on the cool underwear; I’d 
                        never buy anything or whatever, and 
                        I certainly never took pictures. 
                        Pictures were too easy to find, to 
                        lose, to spread.

           Margot really studies her reflection.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        But one day:

           She takes a photo.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I did.
           INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margot stares at the nude photo. She holds the thong.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        If the photo got out, I couldn’t 
                        hide. I even bought the red thong 
                        as a commitment -- the first thong 
                        I’d ever owned.

           INT. COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           Margot pays a SUPER NERD some serious cash.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        So I had dark-web Steve Hurly send 
                        it. Bounce the text between a 
                        hundred randomly generated numbers.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

           Students all gawk at their phones. Margot sits in the center, 
           not on her phone, merely taking in the chaos unfolding around 
           her.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I was careful; no one would know 
                        who sent it, or who was in it 
                        unless...

           INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Margot stands before Principal Bleeker. She’s just admitted 
           what she’s done.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I decided to come forward, play 
                        victim. And if I did--

           EXT. HILLSIDE HIGH - DAY

           Mr. and Mrs. Ellison stand frozen next to Margot, who hangs 
           her head in shame beside her parents.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        --I’d have to tell my parents.
           INT. ELLISON HOME. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mr. Ellison and Mrs. Ellison sit at opposite heads of the 
           table. Margot sits in the middle, a satiated glint in her 
           eyes. We slowly push into her.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        As a Mormon, I’d have violated 
                        Honor Code at the highest level. My 
                        dad would have to withdraw my 
                        ecclestial endorsement...

           INT. DORM ROOM. BYU - DAY

           Freshman Margot happily unpacks her things. Her mother makes 
           her bed. Greta stocks her bookshelves. Franny hangs up 
           Margot’s clothes. A BYU poster on the wall.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        And without it, I wouldn’t be 
                        allowed at BYU--

           Margot POOFS -- she’s gone. Her family continues unpacking 
           her room as if she remains.

           EXT. BEAUTIFUL MORMON TEMPLE - DAY

           Margot in a conservative wedding gown exits the glorious 
           temple, hand in hand with her brand new HUSBAND. She holds a 
           bouquet. Her awaiting family and friends cheer.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        --I wouldn’t be allowed to get 
                        married in the Temple.

           The husband turns to her. Leans in for a kiss just as Margot 
           POOFS. The bouquet drops. The husband is left kissing the 
           air.

           INT. RESTAURAUNT - NIGHT

           Margot sits at a table with a CUTE GUY both drinking LEMONADE 
           in a very date-y place. Candle-lit, alluring music.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        No Mormon boy would touch me with a 
                        ten foot pole. 

           The CUTE GUY is replaced by an UGLY GUY.
                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        Not even the desperate ones.

           UGLY GUY poofs. Margot sits at the table alone.

           EXT. HILLSIDE WARD OF THE LDS CHURCH - NIGHT

           Margot sits next to stone Jesus who is now angry, staring 
           down at her. A mini rain cloud over her head. Rain pours onto 
           her. A tiny lightning bolt hits her. Jesus frowns down at 
           her.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I’d be shamed by my family. My 
                        community. Everybody. 
                             (a beat)
                        But I’d be free.

           THE MARGOT PLAN SEQUENCE ENDS

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM  - DAY

           Annie now clutches her Neil doll close for comfort as she 
           listens. Margot sits at the foot of her bed, lost in her 
           retelling. She turns to Annie.

                                 MARGOT
                        Free like Uncle Phil.

                                 ANNIE
                        Uncle Phil who designs vests as a 
                        hobby? Who got caught blowing his 
                        secretary...?

                                 MARGOT
                        Yes, that Uncle Phil. I’ve been 
                        secretly talking to him since sixth 
                        grade.

           Off Annie, wondering where the hell this is going, THE UNCLE 
           PHIL FLASHBACK SEQUENCE BEGINS.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Margot (12) gets the mail. She sorts through it. She finds an 
           envelope addressed to ‘My Brother Joseph’ -- return address, 
           NYC.
                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        The summer you and your Mom went to 
                        the Kennedy Space Center, I was so 
                        bored I started sorting mail. And 
                        one day, I found a letter from 
                        Uncle Phil.

           INT. ELLISON HOME. FOYER - DAY

           Margot hurries in the house, holding the letter. She passes 
           the portrait of the Ellison Men in the desert. We push into 
           it again; this time, we focus on UNCLE PHIL on the farthest 
           edge of the photo. His smile is forced. 

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I knew my dad would never read it; 
                        he couldn’t talk about my uncle 
                        after he was caught, after the 
                        Church disowned him, he pretended 
                        like he didn’t exist...

           Margot sneaks past her family sitting around doing a cat 
           puzzle. Her father agonizes over a missing piece. Mrs. 
           Ellison comforts him.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        Uncle Phil didn’t believe in God 
                        the way we did, he didn’t love the 
                        way we’re supposed to...

           Young Margot races up the stairs to her room.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        He was different and different was 
                        wrong.

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Well he had sex with his 
                        secretary...

           THE UNCLE PHIL SEQUENCE HALTS--

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie, this is the right time to 
                        just--

                                 ANNIE
                        Listen. Yes. Getting better at 
                        that.
           AND THE UNCLE PHIL SEQUENCE CONTINUES AGAIN:

           INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margot (12) reads Phil’s letter.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I read his letter again and again 
                        and again. Hundreds of times.

           Margot grabs paper and a pen. 

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        And then I wrote him back.

           EXT. ELLISON HOME - DAY

           Margot (13) hurries to the mail box. Fishes out another 
           letter. 

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        And we never stopped talking.

           It is addressed to MARGOT but the return address is ARTISTS 
           OF AMERICA with an NYC address. 

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        We used pen names and secret codes. 
                        Getting the mail was the most 
                        exciting part of my day, most days. 
                        Like a pioneer on the Oregon Trail, 
                        without the smallpox.

           Young Margot rips the envelope open.

           INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - AS THE YEARS PASS

           Margot (14-18) ages but doesn’t move. She pores over the 
           letters. Writes new letters back with tenacity.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        I told him everything about 
                        everything. You, what I thought 
                        about God, my art, boys, where I 
                        want to travel. He told me about 
                        all the places in the city he 
                        loves, what it was like: leaving 
                        the Church, how much he’d like to 
                        meet me, and his marriage to his 
                        secretary, Peter.
                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        The secretary he sucked off?

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        They’ve been together ever since!

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        ...I see.

           Still in bed, Margot (18) studies a photo of UNCLE PHIL (30s) 
           and PETER at New York City Hall getting married. Happy, 
           happy, happy.

                                 MARGOT (V.O.)
                        Uncle Phil gave me hope.

           THE UNCLE PHIL SEQUENCE ENDS.

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Margot’s even closer to Annie, concluding.

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie, I never needed a plan. I  
                        never needed to get caught. I know 
                        in my heart there’s a God up there 
                        that loves me as the person I am 
                        right now. I don’t know what kinda 
                        Mormon that makes me or what kinda 
                        life I will have, or what my 
                        parents will think, but I’ve gotta 
                        go. I’ve got to go to New York. And 
                        I want you to come with me.

           This breaks Annie in a beautiful way. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I can’t just drive you to New York, 
                        can I?

                                 MARGOT
                        Think of it as the road trip you 
                        always wanted. Just in a different 
                        direction. 

           Annie just hugs Margot. Hugs her so fucking tightly.

                                 ANNIE
                             (realizing, pulls away)
                        Uh, we can’t tell my Mom. 
                        Obviously.
           Margot gives a little nod. Content, Annie rushes in for 
           another hug, because she can’t get enough.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (over Margot’s shoulder)
                        But that’ll just make it cooler for 
                        when I tell the story to my 
                        inevitably lame freshmen roommate.

           EXT. MILLS' APARTMENT. KITCHEN NOOK - NIGHT

           Annie and Margot wait at the table. A flower in a Pepsi can 
           sits in the center of the table -- this is an occasion. 

           Donna nears with a sheet pan full of chicken nuggets. Annie 
           struggles to conceal their secret, though nobody is 
           pressuring her to talk about it.

           Donna takes a seat. Looks at the girls, emotional.

                                 DONNA
                             (to Margot)
                        I know your mom doesn’t like them, 
                        but we had to go Chicken Dinos. I 
                        picked out all the T-Rexes for you. 
                        Annie gets the triceratops. I’ll 
                        eat the ones shaped like eggs, 
                        which really, when you look at ‘em, 
                        are just plain old chicken nuggets 
                        but of course, twice the price.

                                 ANNIE
                        Mom. Be. Cool.

           A PING. Donna looks at her phone. Then suspiciously up to 
           Annie.

                                 DONNA
                        Is it ‘cool’ to mention that a 
                        ‘Stew’ texted?

           A beat as Annie acts ‘cool,’ then rips the phone out of her 
           mother’s hand.

                                 STEW (V.O.)
                        Dad’s bowling tournament was cut 
                        short ‘cause of a flu breakout. 
                        Barfing Emoji, Wide Smiling Emoji. 
                        So phone’s back. Wanna read 
                        tomorrow?

           Margot watches Annie read the text. 
                                 MARGOT
                        Stew as in, Stew Phines? Why’s he 
                        texting your mom?

                                 ANNIE
                             (concentrating on texting)
                        Uhhhh--

           Annie blushes as she fires off a response.

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Would love to read. Maybe later 
                        this week? Sorry about flu. 
                        Probably got it cuz bowling is a 
                        dirty sport. You touch lots of 
                        holes and balls.

           Annie sends it. Looks to Margot.

                                 ANNIE
                        We’re just like, reading or 
                        whatever, but totally platonic. 
                        Scholastic, really.

           Another PING.

                                 STEW (V.O.)
                        Sweet beans, Annie.

           Content, Annie sheepishly slides the phone back to her mom. 
           She looks to Margot. She puts up a hand to block her mouth 
           from Donna, as if this hides what she’s going to say to 
           Margot.

                                 ANNIE
                        Truthfully, it’s not completely 
                        platonic.

           INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The girls sleep in Annie’s bed as they often do. Closer 
           together than ever before. The moon is bright out the window. 
           White light streams in.

           Annie sleeps hard. But Margot opens one eye.

           INT. MILLS' APARTMENT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Margot knocks on Donna’s door.

                                 MARGOT
                        Ms. Donna.
           Margot pushes it open. Startled, Donna sits up in bed, fully 
           nude, but using a sheet to conceal herself. She pulls off her 
           sleeping mask.

                                 DONNA
                        Oh Jesus Lord, one second Margot.

           INT. MILLS' APARTMENT. KITCHEN NOOK - NIGHT

           Margot sits at the table as Donna, now in a silk robe covered 
           in sheep, finishes making tea. She sets it down for Margot.

                                 DONNA
                        It’s Lipton, I’m sorry.

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s perfect.

           Margot takes a hesitant sip. Then sets the mug down, 
           determined to talk. When she opens her mouth to start, we 
           PULL OUT of a window into the night, still on Margot as she 
           speaks, but unable to hear what she says. Donna listens 
           intently. 

           As we watch them through the window, Donna grabs Margot’s 
           hands across the table. Holds them in her own. Nodding, 
           nodding and nodding. Doing a mother’s work.

           Night fades to early dawn. The kitchen table becomes empty. 
           The early sounds of morning begin...

           EXT. MILLS’ APARTMENT - DAWN

           The apartment is still. Sprinklers on the lawn engage. 

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Go.

           Margot sprints out the front door. She holds her suitcase. 
           Annie emerges behind her, wearing her astronaut helmet. She 
           pulls the apartment door shut, then barrels for the car with 
           her backpack jolting up and down on her back. She misses the 
           curb, trips off it. Falls straight down on her face.

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie!

           Annie springs back up. Takes off her helmet. Her former black 
           eye is now yellowing.

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s why we wear helmets.
           Close by, a WOMAN on her way to work sees the girls getting 
           into the car. Annie sees her watching. Slowly, Annie climbs 
           in, looking directly at the woman:

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                             (to the woman)
                        You...never...saw...us.

           INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - CONTINUOUS

           Annie throws her helmet into the back, beside Margot’s 
           suitcase, then sticks the keys into the ignition. Margot 
           pulls her seat belt on in the passenger seat. Then remembers 
           something:

                                 MARGOT
                        WAIT!
                             (realizing she yelled)
                        I uh, need to make sure I have... 
                        tampons.

           Margot gets out. Walks to the trunk. Opens it. Donna lays on 
           her side, an old iPod in her hand. She gives Margot a thumbs 
           up.

                                 DONNA
                             (whispers)
                        Don’t you worry. I’ve got one of 
                        those murder podcasts downloaded. 
                        Gonna last me the whole ride.

           Relieved, Margot shuts the trunk.

           EXT. MAIN ROAD - DAWN

           The Honda Civic makes its way out of Annie’s neighborhood 
           like a runaway car video game. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Annie and Margot zip along. Margot notes a sign that reads 
           LEAVING BUTTERFIELD COUNTY; she’s finally doing it.

           They drive as dawn fades to day.

           INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - DAY

                                 ANNIE
                        I have a question. 
                                 MARGOT
                        I’m sure you have many.

                                 ANNIE
                        Did you and Mr. Friedman ever...

           Margot silently nods. Annie clocks it.

                                 MARGOT
                        But not sex, sex. Just, other 
                        things.

                                 ANNIE
                        ...As long as it was consensual.

           INT. (FLASHBACK) JANITOR CLOSET - DAY

           Margot takes the lead, making out with Mr. Friedman who is 
           more than enjoying it. He begins to move down, down, and down 
           but before we can see anything, we’re out--

           INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - DAY

                                 MARGOT
                        It was quite consensual.

           Annie can’t bring herself to respond. She merely accepts.

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Margot fills up the gas. Annie emerges from the gas station 
           store with a bag of snacks.

                                 ANNIE
                        Everything in New York is 
                        expensive; five dollars for a bagel 
                        my ass; it better be cream cheesed 
                        by six cows at that price. So, to 
                        keep you from going hungry, I got 
                        you the staples:

           Annie pulls things out.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Beef chonks, Pop-Tarts, Cheddar 
                        Bunnies, Twinkies, and Snoballs.

                                 DONNA IN THE TRUNK
                        Snoballs!

           Annie looks around, confused.
                                 ANNIE
                        Did you hear that?

           Margot feigns hearing nothing. Like she does best, Annie 
           ignores it. Takes out a remaining box from the bag.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        And these. Because you can never be 
                        too safe.

           Margot takes a box from Annie: condoms. Margot clocks the 
           brand name: BIG DICKERS. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           As Annie climbs into the driver’s seat, Margot closes the gas 
           cap, then cracks open the trunk. Donna breathes in the fresh 
           air.

                                 DONNA
                             (inhaling deeply)
                        You never appreciate it ‘til it’s 
                        gone. 

           Margot slips her a pack of Snoballs. 

                                 MARGOT
                        To hold you over.

           Donna takes it appreciatively.

                                 DONNA
                        Oh thank you, hun.

                                 MARGOT
                        Thank you Ms. Donna. For all this.

           Donna salutes her, then pulls the trunk shut.

           INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - DAY

           Annie’s face is solemn, as is Margot’s. They listen intently 
           to the final words of Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar.

                                 VOICE ON TAPE (V.O.)
                        And that concludes, The Bell Jar.

           Margot unplugs her phone from the AUX.

                                 ANNIE
                        I think we can both agree, that 
                        girl was SAD.

                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        And now I feel like punching a 
                        hundred dudes in the face. Why the 
                        fuck did we just listen to that?

                                 MARGOT
                        I saw it on a list of ‘Books you 
                        should read if you’re a girl in New 
                        York,’ and I wanted to finish it 
                        before I got there.

                                 ANNIE
                        Well that list was stupid. And your 
                        life in the city will be nothing 
                        like Edwinina’s.

                                 MARGOT
                             (correcting)
                        Esther.

                                 ANNIE
                        Either way, she was not okay.

           Annie turns on the radio. A funky pop song rises.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        There we GO! Put this on your 
                        little list! New York, MARGOT’S 
                        COMING FOR YOU! And she’s not 
                        sticking her head in any ovens 
                        until she conquers you, ya big 
                        fucking cement jungle!!!

                                 MARGOT
                        Fuck ya!!!

           Annie looks over to Margot, stunned.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                             (playful)
                        What? You say it.

           Margot turns the music up. Annie’s wildly impressed by 
           Margot’s cool, carefree persona. 

           As a chart-topping, sexy song BLASTS, the girls enjoy. Annie 
           thumps her fist to the beat, shouting the wrong lyrics off-
           key while Margot sings along perfectly with a stellar singing 
           voice to boot. 

           They are utterly themselves.

           Minutes pass, songs change.
           Annie turns to look at Margot. For a brief moment, Annie 
           watches her best friend bop her head to the music and hum 
           along, lost in her thoughts. Annie’s overcome by the sight of 
           Margot in the passenger seat for what she knows will be the 
           last time for a long time. 

           As highways change and miles fly by, Margot watches the world 
           turn outside the window. Grass to trees to little cities, 
           only to repeat again as they approach Manhattan. Getting 
           closer, Margot finally spots New York in the distance -- a 
           tiny, grey seed of a city.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        There it is! New York! It’s right 
                        there! 

           Margot presses her face to the window with excitement.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Annie, look!

           Annie can’t bring herself to look. She keeps her eyes glued 
           on the road.

                                 ANNIE
                        Wow, ya! There it is.
                             (more to herself than 
                              aloud)
                        So close. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE / INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - DAY

           The car makes its way over the bridge. Annie looks out at the 
           East River.

                                 ANNIE
                        Welcome to the Big Apple, where all 
                        apples suffer from mad inferiority 
                        complexes.

           She waits for a laugh. Nothing comes.

           Annie turns to Margot. She notices Margot staring at her open 
           sketch book, opened to a drawing of the New York City skyline 
           which she holds up to compare the sketch to the real-life 
           skyline out with window. Margot’s in awe. 

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Annie looks at the parked car, questioning if it’s parked 
           legally. Half its wheels are up on the curb.
                                 ANNIE
                        This is fine, right?

           She looks over to Margot, who stands on a stoop, staring at 
           the building’s front door. Without looking over to Annie:

                                 MARGOT
                        I think so.

           Annie walks to Margot with Margot’s suitcase in tow, like a 
           bellboy. She sets it down. Observes Margot’s vibrating body 
           as her finger hovers over the buzzer for apartment 201 -- 
           Phil and Peter Ellison.

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s gonna be okay.

                                 MARGOT
                             (nerves in her whole body)
                        Okay.

           She presses it.

           INT. UNCLE PHIL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Annie and Margot sit on a love seat, knees touching. They sip 
           black tea.

                                 MARGOT
                        I can’t really taste the caffeine.

           WE REVERSE on two men (40s), handsome, effeminate. UNCLE PHIL 
           (40) and his husband PETER sit in stately leather arm chairs 
           across from the girls. They both wear vests.

                                 UNCLE PHIL
                             (to Margot)
                        Hold out your hand.

           Margot does as he says. Her hand shakes just slightly.

                                 UNCLE PHIL (CONT'D)
                        How ‘bout that, huh?

                                 MARGOT
                        That’s what caffeine does?

                                 PETER
                        If you drink it like a New Yorker.

           Annie watches Margot, fascinated by her jittering hand. Uncle 
           Phil studies Annie, the loving way she looks at Margot.
                                 UNCLE PHIL
                             (re: Annie / to Margot)
                        This is the real deal, this one. 
                        Sitting here watching you sip tea 
                        like it’s the moon landing. 

           Annie’s eyes go wide.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m not even wearing my Neil 
                        shirt!!! Do I give off an astronaut 
                        vibe? Please tell me I give off an 
                        astronaut vibe!

                                 MARGOT
                        Annie I’ve told Uncle Phil 
                        everything since I was twelve. He 
                        knows all about you and the moon.

                                 ANNIE
                        Right.

           Peter reaches out for Phil’s hand. He holds it. 

                                 PETER
                             (to Margot)
                        Phil won’t say this, but he’s 
                        talked about meeting you every day 
                        for six years; this is a big day 
                        for him. A member of his family. 
                        Here. In the flesh.

           Uncle Phil blushes.

                                 UNCLE PHIL
                        Life is wild. One day you’re sewing 
                        vests in your parents’ basement, 
                        the next, you’re in Fifth Avenue 
                        shop windows married to the man of 
                        your dreams.

                                 PETER
                        You’re leaving out the best part of 
                        the story.

                                 UNCLE PHIL
                        Yes, hiring you was the worst best 
                        decision I’ve ever made.

                                 PETER
                        Meeting up in the men’s room might 
                        even top that.
           The husbands giggle. Margot marvels at their connection. The 
           apartment. The whole experience of being there.

           Annie looks from Margot to Phil, from Phil to Peter, from 
           Peter to Margot.

                                 ANNIE
                             (blurts)
                        I need to pee.

                                 UNCLE PHIL
                        Second door down the hall.

           INT. UNCLE PHIL’S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Annie idles in the bathroom. She smells their soap, smells 
           nice. Feels up a washcloth, nothing special.

           She notices herself in the mirror. Her reflection stares 
           back. Frizzy hair. Puffy cheeks. In need of a shower. 

           She saddens, knowing the inevitable goodbye is near. 

           INT. UNCLE PHIL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Annie stands in the hall, peeking in at Margot, who listens 
           intently to Uncle Phil. She gives them their space.

                                 UNCLE PHIL
                        And you know something? On my 
                        birthday every year, Grandpa 
                        Ellison calls, and that call means 
                        everything to me.

           Sensing Annie’s presence, Margot looks up. Sees Annie around 
           the corner. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Did you pee alright, Annie?

           Annie nods.

                                 ANNIE
                        I, uh, should go. There’s probably 
                        an angry mom waiting at home.

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Donna leans against the car, eating a street-cart hot dog. To 
           a pedestrian, she could be a happy tourist.
           INT. UNCLE PHIL’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Margot stands. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Before you go, I want to show you 
                        something.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SUNSET

           The girls climb out a window onto the fire escape, Margot 
           first, Annie behind. They scale the ladder, ascending to the 
           roof.

           EXT. ROOF - SUNSET

           Margot and Annie get their bearings. A stellar view of the 
           New York City skyline awaits. 

           Margot takes in the sight she’s waited so long to see. 

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s just like he described.

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s pretty sweet. 
                             (takes a big sniff)
                        Smells weird.

           Annie looks to Margot who looks who’s as present as she is 
           beautiful. She breathes deeply, like she’s just climbed an 
           impossibly high mountain.

           After a beat...

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        I brought you something:

           Annie pulls a little CERAMIC JESUS out of her pocket.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        My Mom got with a pastor for a 
                        while and he gave me this:

           Annie holds out Jesus for Margot.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        It was weird because I hated him 
                        but uh, I think this little dude’s 
                        better off here.

           Margot takes little Jesus. 
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        To remind you that, you know, 
                        you’re never alone.

                                 MARGOT
                             (truly touched)
                        Annie.

           Margot sets Jesus against her heart, then takes Annie’s hand 
           with her free hand. Together, the best friends look out just 
           as the faded moon appears in the sunset sky.

           INT. UNCLE PHIL’S BUILDING. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Annie lingers in the hall not wanting to leave. Margot 
           remains in the doorway, looking like she already fits into 
           her new backdrop.

                                 MARGOT
                        Soooo, it’s an eleven hour bus ride 
                        from Port Authority to Purdue. I’m 
                        gonna have to get used to it.

                                 ANNIE
                        But you hate buses; you get so 
                        carsick!

                                 MARGOT
                        I have to see you!

                                 ANNIE
                             (emotional)
                        Bring barf bags; you’re gonna vomit 
                        so much. You think you can read 
                        while in motion, but you just 
                        can’t.

           Annie hugs Margot like she’s never letting go.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want to say goodbye.

                                 MARGOT
                        We’ll never say goodbye.

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Annie exits the building as if she’s lost her wallet, keys 
           and heart along the way. So caught up in her feels, she 
           misses Donna, standing beside the car, holding Annie’s 
           astronaut helmet.
                                 DONNA
                        Mission control to Annie. 

           Annie looks up at Donna with wet eyes. Surprised, Annie 
           notices the open trunk of the car.

                                 ANNIE
                        Did you--

                                 DONNA
                        A good momma’s always one step 
                        ahead.

           Annie’s too balmy-eyed to dig deeper.

                                 ANNIE
                        The Eagle--the Eagle has landed.

                                 DONNA
                        I know honey, I know.

           Careful not to cry in front of her mother, Annie grabs her 
           helmet and puts it on. Sadly, her sobbing is still audible.

           EXT. UNCLE PHIL’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Through the window, Margot watches Donna open the passenger 
           side door and guide Annie into the car. When Donna shuts the 
           door, she looks up. Right at Margot. They hold eye-contact. A 
           knowing comfort between them. 

           Donna winks. 

           And Margot winks back.

           EXT. HIGHWAY / INT. 1996 HONDA CIVIC - NIGHT

           Donna drives with one hand on Annie’s shoulder as Annie 
           sleeps, snoring like a boar, still wearing her helmet. 

           Highway flies by.

           INT. UNCLE PHIL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Margot, holding tiny Jesus, stands in a small office, 
           converted to a bedroom for her. She watches Phil prepare the 
           pullout couch. Once he’s tucked the sheets, he takes a seat 
           on the bed and pats the spot beside him. She takes a seat. 
           Tears in her face.
                                 PHIL
                        Hey, hey, hey, aw. 

           Phil holds her.

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to hurt. A lot of 
                        people are going to hurt. But 
                        Margot, that’s how you know you’re 
                        on the verge of something great. 

           Phil touches little ceramic Jesus.

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Just ask him.

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAYS LATER

           Annie runs through aisles of books at top speed. She stops. 
           Smells her pits. Eh, not her best. 

           She runs on. Then stops again when she sees Stew from afar. 
           Waits. Watches. Then, walks to him like she’s cool as hell.

                                 ANNIE
                             (out of breath)
                        Hey.

           Stew is so happy to see her. Despite the stack of comic books 
           on the table, he’s leafing through the thermodynamics book 
           Annie was reading before. She notes it.

                                 STEW
                             (off Annie noticing)
                        I’m branching out.

           Annie takes a seat. Pulls out a thick book: the biography of 
           Buzz Aldrin.

                                 ANNIE
                        Me too.

           She opens the front cover, but before she can read a word, 
           she leans into Stew. Plants a big kiss on his lips. He kisses 
           Annie right back.

           INT. SOMEWHERE IN PUBLIC - DAY

           Margot, wearing a backpack, stands at a help desk. Little 
           ceramic Jesus is now a key chain, dangling off her bag.
                                 MARGOT
                        Excuse me?

           A VOLUNTEER turns around. Her name tag cues us in -- we’re at 
           The American Museum of Natural History.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I’m looking for the big T-Rex 
                        skeleton? I thought it was in the 
                        front there. That’s what it looks 
                        like in the movies.

                        Museum’s almost always empty on 
                        Wednesdays.

           She hands the map to Margot, who takes it eagerly.

           As Margot turns, we catch tiny Jesus once more. For a brief 
           moment, his thoughtful, ceramic face livens. He smiles at us 
           with ‘I know I’m your Savior’ ease. And the smile remains as 
           key chain Jesus bounces up and down, while Margot heads off 
           into the museum, ready to explore.
