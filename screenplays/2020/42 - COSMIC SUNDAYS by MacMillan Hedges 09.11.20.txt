                       COSMIC SUNDAY

                                     MacMillan Hedges
           THE SOUND OF TIRES MELTING ON CONCRETE -- THEN THE ROAR OF 
           660 TORQUE DIESEL ENGINE BREAKIN’ THE REDLINE.

           FADE IN: 

           We are gunnin’ a SCHOOLBUS towards the dead end of a half 
           built freeway. The wind rushes through the broken glass. Kids 
           howl as we bank off the incline n’ launch into the sky -- 

           -- The SCHOOLBUS hangs in the air but then drops out of 
           view... We scoot to the edge and peer over -- BAM! 

           A hellfire rips upwards -- Engulfing the entire screen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - SUBURBS - MORNING

           We open on dirty plates and empty beer bottles. Then we move 
           up to a stained chair placed in front of a TV; which is 
           paused on a video game -- The scattershot remnants of a 
           nightly ritual.

           An alarm goes off. A scruffy man with long unruly hair stirs 
           from his bed. His name is BILL BUTTON, 29. We just saw him 
           die... He is wearing a stale T-Shirt and sweat pants. He 
           appears unemployed, but moves with the urgency of a man late 
           for work.

           He walks past wall-to-wall movie posters of the 2000s -- 
           snapshots of his adolescence and now totems of his stagnant 
           adulthood. He grabs his iPhone and HOLDS down both switches:

           CU: WIPE & RESET TO FACTORY SETTINGS.

           Bill exits into--

           --His parents’ bedroom. He opens his father’s closet. Without 
           looking -- he reaches in and pulls out dry cleaning. He rips 
           open the plastic seal in one motion --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           -- Bill walks down the steps dressed in his father’s suit. He 
           is buzzing his face with an electric shaver -- The charging 
           cord is dangling. His Mother is prepping a massive meal in 
           the kitchen. She looks up at Bill in shock --

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        Honey... Why are you wearing your 
                        father’s suit on Thanksgiving?
                                 BILL
                        It’s mandatory for work.

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        When did you get a job?

                                 BILL
                             (ignoring the question)
                        Don’t take him to the hospital. 
                        Just a cold compress and get on 
                        with the meal.

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        ...Take who to the hospital?

           Bill opens the front door exactly as the bell rings. 
           Revealing his UNCLE FRED and AUNT EMMA -- Both holding PIES. 

                                 UNCLE FRED
                        Hey numnuts what’s with the suit? 
                        You don’t have--

           Bill whips the Electric Shaver with numchuck-velocity not 
           seen since Bruce Lee in Game of Death and smashes UNCLE FRED 
           in the face -- Uncle Fred drops like a ton of bricks as Bill 
           delicately catches THE PUMPKIN PIE in his palm.

           Bill hands The Pumpkin Pie to his stunned mother as he grabs 
           an UMBRELLA from a rack and walks to his SHITBOX CAR--

           -- His family snap into the realization of what just happened 
           and erupt in chaos as he pulls out of the driveway.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FANCY DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           Bill steps out of his car and into a brand new Range Rover. 

           The Rover is conveniently unlocked. Bill flips the sun visor -
           - The keys fall into his hands. He connects his iPHONE to the 
           audio system. He keeps hitting refresh in his empty PODCAST 
           library until -- DING! -- a podcast appears BUT it is oddly 
           labeled --

           “THE CALENDAR” North America -- EPISODE 11757: MONDAY

                        Bless The Calender Maker for this 
                        day.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN STREET - SARATOGA SPRINGS - MORNING

           Bill drives through Saratoga Springs: A summer vacation town 
           in upstate New York known for horse races and hot springs.

           --Except it’s November. So if your planning on any of that 
           you’re shit out of luck.

           Bill turns onto Main Street, it’s cold, overcast and near 
           deserted except for some locals getting last minute 
           ingredients.

                                 PODCAST VOICE
                        Section C7 will be working from the 
                        Mansion on Oak Street this week as 
                        a reward for recent productivity.

           EXT. SECURITY GATE - MORNING

           The GATE is raised and the GUARD SHED is empty --

           Bill drives through. He passes a sign: 

           “CLOSED: HAPPY THANSKGIVING!”

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Bill parks in the furthest spot from the entrance of a TEN 
           STORY GLASS OFFICE... He’s the last one in.

           Bill turns off the engine and takes a deep breathe. “Monday 
           Blues” He clicks open the door -- and grabs his umbrella.

           Bill walks towards the building and pops his umbrella. On 
           cue, it begins to pour. He reaches the entrance. The rain 
           stops. He tosses his umbrella like a soft drink into the 
           garbage.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LOBBY - CORPORATE OFFICES - MORNING

           Bill walks into the corporate offices of ANHEUSER-BUSCH. He 
           passes several people dressed somewhere between a Janitor and 
           a Police Officer. They are systemically disabling the 
           security systems for the building. 

           They are called “Security Pickers”. One of them waves 
           enthusiastically at Bill.

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        Saw what you did on the nightly 
                        news, Button. You’re a real animal. 

           Without stopping. 

                                 BILL
                        That’s what Cosmic Sundays are for.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - CORPORATE OFFICES - MORNING 

           A makeshift BARBER SHOP. It’s a two man operation. One 
           sweeps, the other cuts. Bill walks in and takes a seat.

                                 THE BARBER
                        What can I do ‘ya for? 

                                 BILL
                        The usual.

                                 THE BARBER
                        You’re the only person in this 
                        whole place who never changes it 
                        up.

           The Barber takes Bill’s shoulder length hair in his hand and 
           chops it off. Bill barely notices.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 1ST FLOOR - CORPORATE OFFICE - MORNING

           Bill walks through the maze of cubicles with a fresh generic 
           worker bee cut. Everything we see is beige -- Devoid of 
           flavor, soul and especially color. 

           Welcome to the suck that is Corporate America.

           Bill passes employees binning personal items while pulling 
           fresh ones from their backpacks and purses. 
           The communal TVS are set to a Youtube Station and DWAYNE “THE 
           ROCK” JOHNSON is giving an emotional speech about no longer 
           needing to work-out but finding purpose learning “The Romance 
           Languages.” No one thinks this is odd.

           Bill turns into his tiny cubicle. He boots up the desktop. An 
           Asian family appears as his background. Bill types in a 
           username that is not his and a password he shouldn’t know. 

           This was/is someone else’s desk.

           The computer screen opens. He creates a new email account and 
           then instantly PING -- 

           An email with thousands of people cc’d appears. There is one 
           attachment file: CU: JEWISH FARMERS APP BUILD PACKAGE 1433 

           Bill CLICKS on it.

                                 BOSS GREEN (O.S.)
                        Hey. I couldn’t help but notice... 

           Bill turns to his Boss. Boss Green. 40s. She is very tall. 
           Last year she let slip at the Christmas Party that she was 
           bullied for it as a kid. Every nightamre has an origin story.

                                 BILL
                        Sorry the traffic today was --

           Boss Green lets out a forced high pitched laugh. 

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Funny. That’s actually not why I’ve 
                        came by... I saw you on the news 
                        yesterday... It was... Wild.

                                 BILL
                        Isn’t that what Cosmic Sunday is 
                        for?

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Not that wild. We want you to see 
                        the company therapist.

                                 BILL
                        I’m fine.

           Awkward beat.

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        That’s why you’ll see her.

           Boss Green begins to walk away and then turns back. She scans 
           Bill’s desk. Cluttered with someone else’s memories.
                                 BOSS GREEN (CONT'D)
                        You should really take down the 
                        life of the person whose desk this 
                        used to be.

                                 BILL
                        I thought it was optional?

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Yes but...

                                 BILL
                        I’ll bring some stuff in.

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Great. Remember. This is your desk.

           An awkward beat. Bill realizes he’s meant to...

                                 BILL
                        This is my desk.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CORNER OFFICE - CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           Bill is seated across from a THERAPIST. She is BLACK WOMAN 
           and this room is the fever dream of a MIDDLE AGED WHITE MAN. 
           Golf Clubs litter the landscape like garden gnomes. 

                                 BILL
                        I’m confused. I’m -- We are all 
                        allowed to do what we want on 
                        Cosmic Sunday...

                                 THERAPIST
                        Yes. BUT we’ve noticed a level of 
                        nihilism in your recent CS’s that 
                        has upper management... Well, 
                        concerned.

                                 BILL
                        I heard the freeway sequence in 
                        Speed was impossible. I wanted to 
                        test it out for myself.

                                 THERAPIST
                             (looking up from her 
                              notepad)
                        With a school bus full of children?
                                 BILL
                        What does it matter what it was 
                        full of? It could have been full of 
                        babies or Fulbright scholars. It’s--

                                 THERAPIST
                        Meaningless? That’s exactly what 
                        the six day work week is for. To 
                        give you THAT meaning. Cosmic 
                        Sunday is FOR blowing off steam.  
                        NOT spreading nothingness.

           Bill leans back and realizes it’s easier to accept the 
           hypocrisy than fight it.

                                 BILL
                        I’ll tone it down.

                                 THERAPIST
                        Would you like to talk about why 
                        you spend your Cosmic Sundays 
                        recreating violent scenes from 
                        popular films?

                                 BILL
                        What else are you supposed to with 
                        a BA in film studies?

           The Therapist hits a button on her chair and the wall goes 
           from translucent to dark grey. No one can see in.

                                 THERAPIST
                        You may have been told to come here 
                        by corporate, but I’m here to 
                        listen. Not report. Everything you 
                        say here is private.

           Bill debates if he should trust her. But he takes a leap.

                                 BILL
                        We build sand castles and every 
                        night the tides come and wash them 
                        away. Everyday we start from 
                        scratch. Why am I at work? I don’t 
                        need money. A pension. Food. Who 
                        cares if we build the dating app by 
                        2pm or we build it by 4:00pm--

                                 THERAPIST
                        There ARE carrots n’ sticks in this 
                        new world. 

                                 BILL
                        Are you... threatening me?
                                 THERAPIST
                        No. I’m just reminding you of 
                        facts. Our old society was built on 
                        incentives and so is our new one.

                             (taking off her glasses)
                        Do you remember how things use to 
                        be before we bound together? Before 
                        The Calendar Maker helped us create 
                        a collective on top of a paused 
                        world? Chaos. Depression. Anarchy. 
                        Existential limbo. Isolated 
                        confinement. That is why you work.

                        People need structure. We are awake 
                        and we need to exist in forward 
                        motion. 

           Bill ponders this. Then he flips it back on her --

                                 BILL
                        Do you feel like your life exists 
                        in forward motion?

                                 THERAPIST
                        Yes.

                                 BILL
                        How so?

                                 THERAPIST
                        I wake up in my bed. I drive to 
                        work. I work with people who need 
                        my help. Some days we make 
                        progress. Some days it feels like 
                        nothing I say makes a difference. 
                        My life is...

                                 BILL
                        What?

                                 THERAPIST
                        I was lucky. My daughter is Awake.

                                 BILL
                        But your husband?

                                 THERAPIST
                        Is Stuck.
                                 BILL
                        How do you deal with that?

                                 THERAPIST
                        We still talk. Sometimes I ignore 
                        him. Sometimes he ignores me. 
                        Sometimes we fight. I just remember 
                        everything and he doesn't remember 
                        a thing.
                             (beat)
                        Which, come to think of it, isn’t 
                        that different than before the 
                        freeze.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAIN FLOOR - 1ST FLOOR - DAY

           Bill passes a conference room. Boss Green has a mike in her 
           hand and is speaking to a group of employees.

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        The site was built from scratch and 
                        up and running by a new record of 
                        2:57PM!

           The Employees cheer!

                                 BOSS GREEN (CONT'D)
                        That means we can spend the extra 
                        two hours and three minutes 
                        building additional features for 
                        the Awake community!

           Everyone cheers louder! Bill shakes his head. He finds no 
           meaning in this.

           INT. CUBICLE - 1ST FLOOR - DAY

           Bill enters his cubicle. Opens up “Jewish Farmers Dating” 
           connects it to his profile on FACEBOOK (His profile picture 
           is of him and PRETTY WOMAN).

           Bill snags a few pictures of himself at lightning speed and 
           completes his profile. He starts swiping through profile 
           pictures of women aged 18-35. 

           He stops on a WOMAN with a soft smile and Princess Leia bun 
           hairstyle. He scrolls down to her COSMIC EXPERIENCES SECTION.

           He see’s “PULP FICTION” and double taps. Creating a smiley 
           face. Then he types. “Double Feature? BONNIE & CLYDE?”
                                 BOSS GREEN (O.S.)
                        It’s great to see you on the app.

           Boss Green is hovering by the entrance to his cubicle.

                                 BOSS GREEN (CONT'D)
                        I saw your proposal. Platonic 
                        friendships for Awakes to Awakes?

           Bill has no idea what she’s talking about.

                                 BOSS GREEN (CONT'D)
                        You and Jackie sent it to me a few 
                        minutes ago.

           Bill looks down. A note has been slid below his cublicle from 
           the next one over.

           CU: This is what we’ve been working on!

                                 BILL
                        Of course. Jackie and I have been 
                        working on it...

           Another note slides through. 

           CU: For months!

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        For a really long--

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        It’s brilliant! Married Awakes who 
                        don’t want to cheat on their Stucks 
                        but need someone to emotionally 
                        confide in.

                                 BILL
                        It’s really Jackie’s idea--

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Corporate is coming in on Saturday. 
                        I already told them about YOUR idea 
                        and they can’t wait to see a tech 
                        demo.

                                 BILL
                        There isn’t a tech demo. We just 
                        told you about the idea.

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Sorry. I wasn’t clear. You’re going 
                        to build the tech demo and present 
                        it to the board.

                             (something catches her 
                              eye)
                        Is that Peter Lumbergh? Whats he 
                        doing on the first floor?!

           Boss Green takes off. Bill stands up and leans over his 
           cubicle at -- JACKIE. 30s. Beautiful, a little too selfless 
           and heavily overworked. She’s the first person you would 
           think to call if shit hit the fan. 

           Her hair is cut short like --

                                 BILL
                        Demi Moore. Ghost.

                                 JACKIE
                             (looking up)
                        Well it’s an easy one.

                                 BILL
                        In less than a second?

           Jackie reluctantly hands over a GRAFFITIED DOLLAR BILL that 
           makes Thomas Jefferson look like Sylvester Stallone. (Its 
           oddly easy to do and highly accurate)

           We notice that unlike Bill’s desk, the photos on Jackie’s 
           desk match up with her life. Our eyes are drawn to a good 
           looking preppy man, shirtless, on a boat. His name is JUSTIN. 

                                 JACKIE
                        You are sooooo fucked.

                                 BILL
                        They wouldn’t demote me to the 
                        Wilderness Dawn Cycle?

                                 JACKIE
                        Sam Lowry fucked up a tech demo 
                        last fall and... Have you seen ‘em?

                                                         JACKIE (CONT'D)
                           BILL
           But I’m not a morning person--
                                              Well you’d have eternity to 
                                              change that.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                             (stressed)
                        Lunch?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HIPSTER COFFEE SHOP - DAY 

           Jackie and Bill are munching on some food. It’s an odd crowd. 
           People who have nowhere to be on Thanksgiving but still want 
           free wifi and a seven dollar vanilla latte. 

           Jackie looks down at her uninspired half eaten sandwich.

                                 JACKIE
                        Why did we have to be stuck in a 
                        loop on Thanksgiving? 70% of 
                        businesses are closed. We have like 
                        no food options.

           Bill isn’t listening, giving his attention to the BARISTA.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        And the special is always turkey.
                             (beat)
                        Why don’t you just talk to her? 

                                 BILL
                        She won’t remember me.

           Bill is looking around at the table next to them. We hear 
           them intensively discussing The Rock’s “Breakdown”. 

                                 PATRON 1
                        They found him talking to something 
                        called “Awakes” on a new YOUTUBE 
                        channel.

                         PATRON 2
           Must be some new celebrity 
           cult--
                                                        PATRON 3
                                              It’s a shame. He could have 
                                              been president.

                                 BILL
                             (Looking at the table)
                        You think the Stucks have it 
                        better?

                                 JACKIE
                        No. Why would you say that?

           A STRESSED WOMAN pulls up to the curb and runs in. Bill 
           notices the car engine is still running.

                                 BILL
                        Wanna go for a joy ride?

           Jackie looks down at her watch.
                                 JACKIE
                        We should get back. You have the 
                        new project and my inbox is already 
                        slammed.

                                 BILL
                        Come on. It’ll be fun.

           Jackie stands and bins her leftover lunch.

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s what Cosmic Sundays are for.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - 1ST FLOOR - DAY

           Jackie and Bill walk down the hall.

                                 BILL
                        ...Is it better to be Awake?

           Jackie nervously looks up at the camera in the corner.

                                 JACKIE
                        The reason they flagged you for 
                        therapy is talk like this.

                                 BILL
                        Well they also gave me a big 
                        assignment.

                                 JACKIE
                        ...Because I do all your work.

           Jackie sits at her desk. Bill hangs by the entrance.

                           BILL
                                                         JACKIE (CONT'D)
           Yeah. It’s weird--
                                              Someone gets all the credit.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        Normally said person has balls the 
                        size of raisinettes.

                                 BILL
                        Hey!

           Bill exits and turns into his cublicle BUT then he pops his 
           head over. Looking down at Jackie.

                                 JACKIE
                             (trying to ignore him)
                        I’m working. You should try it.

                        ...So you’re happy?

           Jackie drops her pen. Exacerbated by him.

                                 JACKIE
                             (looking up)
                        Everyday my boyfriend wakes up next 
                        to his beautiful and extremely 
                        naked wife. So no. Life isn’t 
                        perfect. But I make progress.

           Bill laughs and sits down at his desk.

                                 BILL
                             (typing)
                        I didn’t know she slept in the 
                        nude.

                                 JACKIE (O.S.)
                        Apparently she finds panties 
                        “restrictive”.

                                 BILL
                        Ouch.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CUBICLE - 1ST FLOOR - EVENING

           Bill is pretending to work. An alarm goes off. Everyone 
           stands up from their desks and...just walks away. No one logs 
           out or turns off the lights. Snacks are left half eaten on 
           work stations. 

           Bill walks to the elevator. Everyone is enthusiastically 
           chatting about ways to build the website from scratch quicker 
           tomorrow. He just looks straight ahead. Drowning inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Bill gets into the car. He doesn’t wear a seat belt. He pulls 
           out his IPHONE. 

           CU: 4 NEW PODCASTS:  NEWS / COMEDY / DEBATE / BUSINESS
           Bill clicks COMEDY. It’s observational. Basically what if 
           Seinfeld was in a Time Loop.

                                 COMEDIAN
                        So the night before the freeze. My 
                        ex comes over. It’s just one last 
                        goodby fuck she tells me.

           EXT. SUBURBS - EVENING

           Bill drives past families leaving Thanksgiving dinner. He is 
           smoking a cigarette. Ashing it on the plush leather.

                                 COMEDIAN
                        Little did I know I’d be seeing her 
                        for the rest of eternity.
                             (beat)
                        And do you wanna know why we broke 
                        up? Cus I had commitment issues.

           Bill doesn’t laugh. The joke hit a little close to home.

           EXT. SUBRUBAN HOUSE - EVENING 

           Bill is parked across the street and melancholy starring 
           through the window at a family wrapping up Thanksgiving 
           diner. 

           WE PUSH on A YOUNG WOMAN we may recognize from Bill’s 
           Facebook Profile. Her name is MARRISA. She laughs at a joke 
           and blasts a Julia Roberts wattage smile. 

           Bill starts the engine. He’s tortured himself enough. He 
           takes a swig from a beer and drives off --

           EXT. BILLS HOME - NIGHT

           Bill smashes the RANGE ROVER onto his lawn. He flicks a 
           cigarette out the window. 

           He opens the door and beer cans fall out. The NEIGHBHOOD KID 
           and his Pet Dog are starring at him.

           Bill tosses the car keys to THE NEIGHBORHOOD KID.

                                 BILL
                        Treat ‘yo self.

                        box if things gets hairy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BILL’S HOME - NIGHT

           Bill walks in and as we hear the Rover PEEL OUT. 

           Bill’s Dad, FRANK, is sitting in his favorite chair. Sipping 
           his favorite drink. Watching his favorite football team. A 
           real creature of habit.

           The dining room table has not been cleared and we see the 
           remnants of a Thanksgiving meal.

                                 FRANK
                             (looking at the TV)
                        There are leftovers if you wanna 
                        ‘em.

           Bill stares at the turkey. Like a shipwrecked man would look 
           at ocean water. Its fair to say, he’s eaten enough turkey for 
           several life times.

                                 BILL
                        I’m good.

           Bill sits and both men watch the game. An awkward lull. 

           Finally --

                                 FRANK
                        You really hurt your mother’s 
                        feelings today. Why’d you just run 
                        out?

           Bill looks at his dad. Wishing he could explain. But he can’t 
           so --

                                 BILL
                        I had somewhere I needed to be.

                                 FRANK
                        That doesn’t explain knocking Fred 
                        out.

                                 BILL
                        He’s an asshole.

                                 FRANK
                        A lot of people are assholes. But 
                        you can’t go around lighting em up. 
           Tension rising.

                                 BILL
                        I need to get some sleep. I have a 
                        big project at work this week.

           Bill stands.

                                 FRANK
                        When did you get a job?

                                 BILL
                        Seventy four years ago.

           Awkward beat.

                                 FRANK
                        If you don’t want to talk about 
                        your life, that’s fine. Just don’t 
                        be an asshole about it.

           Bill walks upstairs. Opens his bedroom. Shuts the door.

           INT. BILLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bill looks at the still paused video game. He kicks it over 
           in frustration. Cracking the screen. Then --

           Bill’s cellphone rings. A photo of Marissa lights up the 
           screen. He lets it go to voicemail. Bill looks at his watch, 
           11:57pm 

                                 BILL
                        Don’t do it. Don’t fuckin’ listen. 
                        Delete it. Delete it.

           Bill looks at his watch. It’s 11:58pm.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                         Your a prime fuckin’ idiot.

           Bill clicks the voicemail.

                                 MARISSA
                        Hey. So my family were asking about 
                        you. I know we said we should take 
                        a break but you not being at 
                        Thanksgiving didn’t feel right...I 
                        want to....Maybe reconsider? God, 
                        maybe I’m just drunk...Meet and 
                        talk tomorrow?...I...I love you.
           Bill throws the iPhone out the window as THE CLOCK HITS 
           MIDNIGHT -- THE SCREEN RIPPLES WITH WHITE LIGHT.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BILLS ROOM - MORNING

           We open on dirty plates and empty beer bottles. Then we move 
           up to a chair placed in front of TV; which is paused on a 
           video game -- The scattershot remnants of a nightly ritual.

           An alarm goes off. A scruffy man with long unruly hair stirs 
           from his bed. His name is BILL BUTTON, 29. He is wearing a 
           stale T-Shirt, and sweat pants. He appears unemployed but 
           moves with the urgency of a man late for work.

           He walks past wall-to-wall movie posters of the 2000s -- 
           snapshots of his adolescence and now totems of his stagnant 
           adulthood. He grabs his iPhone and holds down both switches:

           CU: WIPE & RESET TO FACTORY SETTINGS.

           Bill exits into--

           --His parents bedroom. He opens his father’s closet. Without 
           looking -- he reaches in and pulls out what he needs -- He 
           rips open the plastic dry-cleaning seal in one motion --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Bill walks down the steps in the suit cleaning his face with 
           the electric shaver. His mother is preparing a meal in the 
           kitchen. She looks up at Bill in shock. 

                                 MS. BUTTONS
                        Honey... Why are you wearing a suit 
                        on Thanksgiving?

           Bill walks to the oven and lowers the temperature.

                                 BILL
                        It’s mandatory for work.
                             (beat)
                        You don’t want to overcook it.

           Ms. Button’s surprise is only growing. It’s fair to say she’s 
           never seen him touch that oven dial in her life.

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        That’s wonderful.
                             (confused)
                        When did you get a job?
           Bill opens the door exactly as the bell rings. 

                                 UNCLE FRED
                        Hey dipshit what’s with the suit? 
                        You don’t have a--

           Bill headbutts Uncle Fred -- breaking his nose. Uncle Fred 
           goes down like a ton of bricks.

                                 BILL
                             (looking down at Fred)
                        It’s a dating app offering each 
                        Awake user love and connection.

           Bill grabs an umbrella from a rack and walks to his Car--

           -- His family snaps into the reality of what just happened 
           and erupts in chaos as he pulls out of the driveway.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DOWN THE STREET - MORNING

           Bill walks out of his Car. Gets into the Rover. He somehow 
           knows where the keys are and turns it on. He connects his 
           iPhone to the audio. He keeps hitting refresh in his empty 
           PODCAST library until -- DING --

           Bill drives through Saratoga Springs: A summer vacation town 
           in upstate New York known for horse races and hot spring.

           --Except it’s November. So if your planning on any of that 
           you’re shit out of luck.

           Bill turns onto Main Street, it’s cold, overcast and nearly 
           empty except for some locals getting last minute ingredients.

           The GATE is raised and the GUARD SHED is empty.

           Bill drives through.passing a sign: “CLOSED: HAPPY

                        forward momentum in The Loop. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Bill parks in the furthest spot from the entrance of a TEN 
           STORY GLASS OFFICE. He’s the last one in.

           Bill turns off the engine -- clicks open the door -- and 
           grabs his umbrella.

           Bill walks towards the building and pops his umbrella. On cue 
           it begins to pour.

           He reaches the entrance. The rain stops. He tosses his 
           umbrella like a soft drink into the garbage.

           INT. LOBBY - CORPORATE OFFICES - MORNING

           Bill walks in as Security Pickers disable the security 
           systems for the building. The Enthusiastic Security Picker 
           turns to Bill.

           Without stopping.

                                 BILL
                        Great set.

           A makeshift barber shop. It’s a two man operation. One 
           Sweeps. One Cuts. Bill walks in and takes a seat.

                                 THE BARBER
                        What do you want?

                        One of these days your going to 
                        surprise me.

           The Barber takes Bill’s shoulder length hair in his hand and 
           chops it off. Bill barely notices.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Bill walks through the maze of cubicles with his fresh worker 
           bee cut. He notices a crowd of people gathered around a TV. 
           One of them is Jackie. Bill walks up next to her.

                                 BILL
                        What’s going on?

           INT. BILL’S CUBLICLE - 1ST FLOOR - MORNING

           Bill is starring at his screen. He has no idea what he’s 
           doing. It’s just lines and lines of code. 

           He shoots his head over --

                           BILL
                                                         JACKIE
           Hey quick question --
                                                (in Marilyn Monroe 
                                                voice)
                                              Haven’t you bothered me 
                                              enough, you big banana head?

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Asphalt Jungle. 1950. 

           Jackie bitterly hands over a graffitied five dollar bill. 
           This one has been augmented so that Abraham Lincoln looks 
           like...CHER. (Again... strangely easy to do)

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                             (collecting it)
                        How would someone target Awakes in 
                        a multiple Stuck home?

           Jackie throws a scrunched up post-it at Bill’s head.

                                 JACKIE
                        We learned this in orientation.

                                 BILL
                        What if I’m a bit crap at my job? 
                        And the only way I graduated the 
                        program is because my much smarter 
                        classmate took pity on me?

           Jackie laughs and walks over to Bill’s desk. She begins 
           feverishly typing --

                          JACKIE
                                                          BILL (CONT'D)
           This isn’t even the right 
           program --
                                              Why do you smell like 
                                              lavender?

           Jackie self-consciously reaches for her neck.
                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        I stopped at Macy’s to try on some 
                        perfumes.

                        I’m worried Justin thinks I’m 
                        getting a little...

                                 BILL
                        What?

                                 JACKIE
                        Stale.

                                 BILL

                        Look at you little flirts.

           Bill and Jackie awkwardly turn to Boss Green standing outside 
           Bill’s cublicle.

                                 BOSS GREEN (CONT'D)
                        Button. Walk with me.

           Bill and Boss Green walk down the hallway. They pass the HIGH 
           SPEED CHASE on TV -- The MAD MAN is being dragged into a cop 
           car --

                                 MAD MAN (ON TV)
                             (Maniacally)
                        You can get out of the loop. The 
                        authorities are hiding it from us! 
                        Wake the flock!!!

           ZIP! Boss Green is holding the remote and the TV is turned 
           off.

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Just another nut. Pay it no mind.

           Boss Green and Bill reach the elevator.

                                 BOSS GREEN (PRELAP) (CONT'D)
                        The Awake friendship idea is huge! 
                        I mean it just came to me AND the 
                        top floor is all over it.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ELEAVTOR - CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           Boss Green and Bill stand side-by-side. She can barely 
           contain her excitement.

                                 BILL
                        You mean what we proposed --

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        This could get US the deluxe 
                        package.

                                 BILL
                        The deluxe package?

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Corporate is juicing up the 
                        incentives. Don’t want people 
                        slacking on productivity. 

                                 BILL
                        So it’s--

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        They sleep gas your home at the 
                        crack of dawn. Grab your belongings 
                        and then rotate you around the most 
                        luxurious vacant properties in the 
                        territory... I hear --
                             (looking around the empty 
                              eleavtor)
                        Leo’s vacation home is on the list.

           PING! The elevator door opens.

                                 BOSS GREEN (CONT'D)
                        Could you imagine. Variety.
                             (beat)
                        The ultimate luxury.

                                 BILL
                        Do they wash the sheets?

           Boss Green thinks about this. 

                                 BOSS GREEN
                             (undeterred)
                        They must.

           She walks out. Bill thinks about “Variety”. It does sound 
           appealing. He follows --
           INT. 2ND FLOOR - CORPORATE OFFICES - MORNING

           -- Boss Green looks around. It looks EXACTLY like the 1st 
           floor. Bland CUBICLES and CONFERENCE ROOMS.

                                 BILL
                        Me?

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        Enforcement needs to vet you. 
                        You’re going to need a higher 
                        clearance. You’ll have access to 
                        sensitive documents and you’ll be 
                        working on the project up here.

                                 BILL
                        But I’ve worked next to Jackie 
                        since we both started here--

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        That’s what lunch is for.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - 2ND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           INSPECTOR RIDGEMONT sits at the table. He looks like he’s in 
           his 20s but has the intensity of a drug addict who became a 
           fitness guru.

           Bill walks in.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Mr. Button, take a seat.

           Bill awkwardly complies.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (CONT'D)
                        Do you know why you’re here?

                                 BILL
                        To be vetted?

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Exactly.
                                 BILL
                        About?

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Your Awake friendship program could 
                        really add value to our loop 
                        society. And as a community the one 
                        thing that doesn’t reset every 
                        night is our relationships. So in a 
                        way you are in charge of the most 
                        valuable part of our civilization.

                                 BILL
                        It’s just a dating --

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        And I’m just an enforcement 
                        specialist. If we think only about 
                        what we do and not it’s effects 
                        we’ll go insane. No?

           Bill awkwardly nods. Detective Ridgemont takes out a file 
           labeled B. BUTTON.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (CONT'D)
                        I want to talk to you about Cosmic

                                 BILL
                        I’d seen Man on Fire and wondered 
                        what would really happen if you 
                        placed C-4 inside an intestinal 
                        tract.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Nothing wrong with a little 
                        curiosity. 
                             (beat)
                        But why your own?

           FLASHBACK - BATHROOM - PLAYLAND PARK - DAY

           Bill is squirting Vaseline on a LOT of C-4. We hang on Bill’s 
           face as he stuffs it deeper and deeper up his ass.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Didn’t feel comfortable putting my 
                        hand in a stranger. 
                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (V.O.)
                        Certainly left an impression...

                                                                CUT TO:

           FLASHBACK - PHOTO SHOP - PLAYLAND PARK - DAY

           BAM! We hear an explosion -- Then we look up from the booth 
           to the screen showing snaps of PARK GUESTS descending on a 
           rollercoaster. 

           Bill exploded right as the photo was taken. He is half-liquid 
           half-man and is colliding into the most terrified park guests 
           in the history of PLAYLAND and most likely any and all lands.

                                                               BACK TO:

                                 BILL
                        They’ll get over it.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                             (not laughing)
                        Your stats said you were funny. We 
                        need you to tone down the CS 
                        pranks. They’re going viral within 
                        the Awake community and we don’t 
                        want to encourage... nothingness.

                                 BILL
                        I’ll stick to politically correct 
                        objects... up my ass.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Thats the ticket.
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna report up to the top that 
                        you have a bright future.

           Detective Ridgemont extends his hand to shake Bill’s. He 
           holds onto it a little too long.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (CONT'D)
                        If you can get out of your own way.

           CU: Bill’s face being stamped with APPROVED for LEVEL 2.

           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

           Bill walks into his new office. It’s MUCH bigger than his 
           depressing dingy cublicle. He spreads his arms out. 
           Embracing the space. Then he sits down behind his new desk. 
           Ponders doing some actual work and then decides to rummage 
           through the drawers --

           Bill finds a TIFFANY BOX. He opens the box and stares at an 
           engagement ring. An idea percolates-- He googles ‘Pawn Shops’

           INT. JACKIE’S CUBLICLE - CORPORATE OFFICE - AFTERNOON 

           Jackie is hard at work. A CHUCKIE CHEESE mascot walks up to 
           her cubicle.

                                 JESTER
                             (projecting)
                        Since the beginning of time mankind 
                        has wondered who can cover Prince’s 
                        “The Most Beautiful Girl in the 
                        World” better. The Mariachi band 
                        from the chain cantina across the 
                        street or the house band from the 
                        dive bar down the road.
                             (beat)
                        Today we will settle for good and 
                        all, who holds musical harmony over 
                        the three block radius from the 
                        Stop-Sign on Robertson Blvd to 
                        Jungle Jims in Grammarly Park. 

           THE MARIACHI band starts aggressively playing.

           Jackie is shaking her head. She’s trying not to smile but she 
           can’t help it.

           Then the OLD TIMERS rock in. Jackie keeps nervously laughing. 
           Both bands keep playing LOUDER! -- LOUDER!! -- LOUDER!!! 
           Hoping to drown the other out -- 

           -- Jackie is scanning the room and then she catches Bill 
           standing outside the building. Poorly hidden by a bush.

           Her phone rings. Jackie picks it up.

                                 BILL
                        I have--

                                 JACKIE
                             (trying not to laugh)
                        Shut the fuck up I have work to do!
                             (pleading)
                        Stop this.
                                 BILL
                        Yeahhh. I don’t see that happening. 
                        I paid each of them ten grand NOT 
                        to stop -- For any reason. And an 
                        additional forty grand bonus for 
                        whoever plays “better” and I 
                        heavily implied better is louder 
                        and faster.

           Jackie peaks out from her cublicle and sees Boss Green 
           storming towards her --

                                 JACKIE
                        YOU’RE GONNA GET ME IN TROUBLE!

                                 BILL
                        I doubt that.

           Boss Green rounds into Jackie’s cubicle.

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        This is completely unprofessional! 
                        Jackie!? Seriously?! The higher 
                        floors already think we are a joke--

                                 CHUCKEE CHEESE
                        Look lady, for fifty grand, Tori 
                        Green is gonna hear a Prince 
                        ballad.

                                 BOSS GREEN
                        But I’m Tori Green!

           The BANDS SNAP TURN -- like sharks for chum. Boss Green 
           slowly backs out and then --- hauls ass. The Bands give 
           chase. The faster she moves the louder they play. She breaks 
           into a full sprint and they are right on her tail blasting 
           Prince as she runs off screen.

                                 JACKIE
                        You are SUCH a jackass.

                                 BILL
                        That’s why they promoted me.
                             (beat)
                        You’re not stale. This world is. 

           CLICK. Jackie thinks about it for a second and shakes off a 
           stupid grin and goes back to her work.
           EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Bill steps into the ROVER. Takes out his IPHONE and opens the 
           PODCAST section. Hits ‘DEBATE’ and starts driving.

                                 PODCAST HOST
                        Today we are onto our ongoing 
                        series about how The Loop started 
                        and why some people are Awake and 
                        some are Stuck.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DUSK

           Ghost town. Almost everyone is at home enjoying the day.

                                 RELIGIOUS GUEST
                        It is clearly a sign from God -- 

                                 SCIENTIFIC GUEST
                        We think it may have been an 
                        electrical storm that passed 
                        through earth. Making the entire 
                        planet and every one residing on it 
                        stuck in a Time Loop.

                                 RELIGIOUS GUEST
                        And why are a twelfth of the 
                        population aware they are in the 
                        loop while the rest are oblivious?

           EXT. DINER - DUSK

           Bill parks and walks into the diner.

                                 SCIENTIFIC GUEST (V.O)
                        We think it has something to do 
                        with the intersection of pre-
                        existing conditions and what you 
                        ate for breakfast --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           The diner is packed with people. Everyone is eating the 
           “Thanksgiving Special.”

           Bill is wearing a Hawaiian shirt. A woman sits down. She has 
           a bob hair cut. We will call her BUNNY.
                           BUNNY
                                                          BILL
           Nice shirt.
                                              Nice bob.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                        I did it in the Uber. You should 
                        have seen the Stuck driver’s face. 

                                 BILL
                        So do you want to eat or just get 
                        into it?

                                 BUNNY
                        Let me get a glass of water. I feel 
                        like if I started screaming I’d rip 
                        my vocal cords.

                                 BILL
                        So what do you do?

                                 BUNNY
                        I was enrolled at Skidmore when it 
                        happened...

                                 BILL
                        Do you still--

                                 BUNNY
                        Take the same classes every day?
                             (Beat)
                        No. I accepted The Calendar after 
                        eight years wandering and was 
                        placed in hairdressing by the 
                        wisdom of The Calender Maker.

           Bill nods. Makes sense.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                        People love bangs... for a day.

                                 BILL
                        Makes you wonder what the excuse 
                        was before.

           Bunny laughs.

                                 BUNNY
                        You’re funny. Do you make content?

                                 BILL
                        No. I work on the dating app.
                                 BUNNY
                        Really? Your profile is so unique, 
                        all those different ways to kill 
                        yourself. 

                                 BILL
                        That’s just a bit of fun.

                                 BUNNY
                        Well the dating app is HUGE. I 
                        can’t tell you how nice it is to be 
                        able to find like-minded Awakes. 
                        Stucks are always so morose on 
                        Thanksgiving.

                                 BILL
                        People with no families having sex 
                        with a stranger they just met...

                                 BUNNY
                        Exactly. But why is it called 
                        Jewish Farmers?

                                 BILL
                        We don’t want Stucks to 
                        accidentally access the app --

                                 BUNNY
                             (not getting it)

                                 BILL
                        How many Jewish Farmers do you 
                        know?

                                 BUNNY
                        Fair.

           Bunny reaches in her purse. She looks up --

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                        You sure this won’t be a problem. 
                             (leaning in nervously)
                        ...It’s not Cosmic Sunday.

                                 BILL
                        It’s fine. Just don’t post about it 
                        and Enforcement will never find 
                        out. I do this a lot.

           Bunny nods. It’s game-time.

                           BUNNY
                                                          BILL (CONT'D)
           I love you, Pumpkin --
                                              I love you, Honey Bunny
           Bunny pulls out a massive REVOLVER. And stands up.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        All right, everybody be cool, this 
                        is a robbery!

                                 BUNNY
                        Any of you fucking pricks move, and 
                        I’ll execute every motherfuckin’ 
                        last one of ‘ya!

           Bill moves through the customers. Glock out and pillow case 
           extended. 

           Everyone is terrified. They quickly throw their wallets in 
           without debate. Except for CALM MAN. Who is seated with his 
           Wife and Two Children. Bill aims his gun on Calm Man.

                                 BILL
                        Money! Now!

           The rest of Calm Man’s family throw their phones and 
           valuables into the pillow case.

           But Calm Man doesn’t budge.

                                 WIFE
                             (hysterically)
                        JUST GIVE HIM THE MONEY HAROLD!

                                 CALM MAN
                        Why? He can’t spend it.
                             (turning to Bill)
                        It’s not Cosmic Sunday. You 
                        shouldn’t be doing this.

           Bunny is stalking the other side of the diner.

                                 BUNNY
                             (yelling across the room)
                        We got a hero? Execute him!

                                 CALM MAN
                        I’m gonna report you.

                                 WIFE
                        Stop threatening the man with the 
                        gun! We didn't see anything.

                                                        CALM MAN
                           WIFE (CONT'D)
           We didn’t we see your face
                                              --I never forget a face.

           Bill panics. BAM! 
           Bill shoots Calm Man in the head. The Wife screams!

                                 BILL
                             (sincerely)
                        He’s gonna be fine.

           His family are splattered with his blood -- He does not look 
           like he is going to be “fine”.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Trust me.

           The Calm Man’s head SMASHES into his Thanksgiving meal. His 
           brains SPILL OUT onto the table. 

                                 BUNNY
                             (yelling to Bill)
                        Pumpkin!? We cool?

                                 BILL
                             (yelling back to Bunny)
                        This redneck went for his gun. I 
                        crucified him!
                             (back to the family)
                        Right as rain tomorrow. 
                             (calling back)
                        And he won’t be the last closed 
                        casket!

           Bunny runs over. Look down at the massacre and see’s a french 
           fry JUST untouched by brains. She picks it up and chews. The 
           Wife passes out in horror.

           They run out -- Bunny shoots the window of a parked car and 
           they break in.

           INT. STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

           We hear SIRENS. Bunny is taking off her pants. 

                                 BUNNY
                        We’re gonna have to be quick.

           Bunny jumps on top of Bill and wildly starts riding him. 

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           The people in the diner are just completely stunned -- 
           horrified -- perplexed. 

           THE MANAGER is on the phone with the police.
                                 MANAGER 
                        They’re not heading in any 
                        direction. They are parked...Well 
                        they’re... Making love?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

           SEVERAL COP CARS SKID into frame. The lead car pulls out a 
           microphone.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        GET OUT OF THE CAR! NOW!

           Bunny is still riding Bill. Her breathing is quickening.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        You have FIVE SECONDS BEFORE WE 
                        OPEN FIRE!

            Bunny pops her head out of the stolen car.

                                 BUNNY
                        We’re almost done!
                             (sticking her head back 
                              in)
                        I’m about to cum. Ram these pigs.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Three, two, one!

                                 BUNNY
                        DRIVE-DRIVE-DRIVE.

           Bill punches the accelerator and they hurtle towards the 
           Police.

           THE COPS OPEN FIRE! A wave of hot lead embraces The Stolen 
           Car -- 

           Ripping Bill and Bunny’s bodies to absolute shreds.

           The Stolen Car smashes into WOODEN POLE as the COPS keep 
           firing -- At this point, the Stolen Car looks like a 
           slaughterhouse.

           Finally the Stolen Car has come to a full stop.

           A POLICE OFFICER opens the door. Bill and Bunny spill out. 
           Covered in gore. 
           The Police Officer turns Bunny over with his boot. We look 
           down at her chunk blown face. Which is holding a crooked 
           smile with the remnants of her jaw.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        This is some twisted-mlliennial-
                        shitttt. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           We open on dirty plates and empty beer bottles. Then we move 
           up to a chair placed in front of TV; which is paused on a 
           video game -- The scattershot remnants of a nightly ritual.

           An alarm goes off. A scruffy man with long unruly hair stirs 
           from his bed. His name is BILL BUTTON, 29. We just saw him 
           die... He is wearing a stale T-Shirt, and sweat pants. He 
           appears unemployed but moves with the urgency of a man late 
           for work.

           He walks past wall-to-wall movie posters of the 2000s -- 
           snapshots of his adolescence and now totems of his stagnant 
           adulthood. He grabs his iPhone and holds down both switches:

           CU: WIPE & RESET TO FACTORY SETTINGS.

           Bill exits into--

           --His parents bedroom. He opens his father’s closet. Without 
           looking -- he reaches in and pulls out dry cleaning -- He 
           rips open the plastic seal in one motion --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           -- Bill walks down the steps dressed in his father’s suit. He 
           is buzzing his face with a electric shaver -- The charging 
           cord is dangling. His Mother is prepping a massive meal in 
           the kitchen. She looks up at Bill in shock --

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        Honey... Why are you wearing your 
                        father’s suit on Thanksgiving?

                                 BILL
                        It’s mandatory for work.

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        Thanks...
                             (beat)
                        When did you get a job?
                                 BILL
                        Forget the hospital. His balls will 
                        drop on their own accord. Then you 
                        can get on with the meal.

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        ...Whose balls?

           Bill opens the door exactly as the bell rings. Revealing his 
           UNCLE FRED and AUNT EMMA -- Both holding PIES.

                                 UNCLE FRED
                        Hey dipshit what’s with the suit? 
                        You don’t have a--

           Bill drops the Electric Shaver and kicks Uncle Fred right in 
           the nuts. 

           His family snap into the realization of what just happened 
           and erupt in chaos as he pulls out of the driveway --

           EXT. DOWN THE STREET - MORNING

           -- Bill parks and steps out of his car and into the Rover. He 
           somehow knows the car is unlocked and where the keys are 
           hidden inside. He connects his iPHONE. He keeps hitting 
           refresh in his PODCAST library until -- DING -- a first time 
           podcast appears --

           “THE CALENDAR” NORTH AMERICA EPISODE 11757: WEDNESDAY 

                                 PODCAST VOICE
                        Hello fellow travelers. It’s a 
                        wonderful day to be connected. 
                        Bless The Calender Maker for this 
                        day.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Bill drives down the street. It’s nearly empty except for 
           some people getting last minute ingredients.

                                 PODCAST VOICE
                        This Year. Halloween falls on 
                        Cosmic Sunday, which has only 
                        happened once before and it was the 
                        wildest day in the history of 
                        mankind... so no pressure kids.

           Bill notices THE MAD MAN from the news drive past.
           Bill looks at his watch. He’s gonna be late but... Fuck it. 
           He makes a U and follows The Mad Man.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - MORNING

           Bill watches MAD MAN walk out of a HOME DEPOT. He is loading 
           a large metal tube into his truck.

           PING! CU: JACKIE: WHERE ARE YOU?!

           Bill looks up. The Mad Man is gone. But his truck is still 
           there. Where did he go?

           SMASH!

           Bill looks down at a GRENADE in his lap. It emits a HISSING 
           sound and then -- POOF -- Smoke shoots out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           Bill wakes up. The Mad Man is at the top of the steps. He is 
           talking to someone --

                                 MAD MAN
                        Thanks honey. I’m just gonna tinker 
                        with my train set.

           He closes the door and walks down to Bill with a STUN GUN.

                                 MAD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Why were you following me?

           Mad Man zaps Bill.

                                 MAD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Answer me!

                                 BILL
                        I... I saw you on the news. You 
                        said you can get out of The Loop!

           Mad Man is going through Bill’s wallet -- He doesn’t find 
           what he thought he would --

                                 MAD MAN
                        You’re not Enforcement?!
                                 BILL
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        Online Dating!

           Hmmmm.

                                 MAD MAN
                        No one would lie about that, it’s 
                        just too --

                                 BILL
                        It wasn’t my first choice. I wanted 
                        to be a fireman.

                                 MAD MAN
                        But they said no! Because fire 
                        fighters were formed to safeguard 
                        property -- human beings are just a 
                        auxiliary concern AND with property 
                        having no value --

                                 BILL
                        They said we didn’t need 
                        firefighters.

                                 MAD MAN
                        But we NEED online dating.

           Mad Man cuts him down.

                                 MAD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry about the theatrics. 
                        Enforcement would love to catch me -
                        - Gotta keep my eyes open and my 
                        sack tight, ey compadre?

                                 BILL
                        It’s fine.
                             (rubbing his wrist)
                        I’d be careful too.

           Bill is looking around the room. Searching for an 
           explanation. When none comes, he just asks --

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Why do you exist outside of The 
                        Calendar? 

           Mad Man smiles. Isn’t it obvious?
                                 MAD MAN
                        We weren’t meant to build a society 
                        on top of a Time Loop. We are meant 
                        to break OUT of the Time Loop.

                                 BILL
                        You can’t get out of the loop--

                                 MAD MAN
                        Says who?

                                 BILL
                        I... I wasted decades trying to get 
                        out. The Loop cannot be broken. It 
                        affects everyone and everything.

                                 MAD MAN
                        Your mistake was believing that 
                        your body was the thing being 
                        imprisoned. So you ran, you run so 
                        hard and for so long that the 
                        lactic acid burned the need for 
                        change clean out of your mouth. The 
                        prison cell IS your mind. The Loop 
                        is a test. BUT “Corporate” found a 
                        way to turn it into a way of life. 
                        They have you chasing Benjamins 
                        when there are no Benjamins to 
                        chase.

                                 BILL
                        Can you prove any of this? This 
                        sounds like a conspiracy theory--

           Mad Man rips off a bed sheet and we see TWO PARROTS.

                                 MAD MAN
                        Of course I can! Rufus is blue and 
                        Awake. Walter is yellow and Stuck.

                                 BILL
                        ...How could you tell if a parrot 
                        is Awake or Stuck?

                                 MAD MAN
                        I taught them both fifty seven 
                        words and Rufus remembers but 
                        Walter doesn’t.

           Bill doesn’t get it.
                                 MAD MAN (CONT'D)
                        I took a sixteen hour flight to 
                        their birthplace -- The Amazon 
                        jungle -- released ‘em both. Walter 
                        stayed in his cage BUT Rufus soared 
                        into the heavens. It was 
                        triumphant. He was free and made 
                        his peace with whatever God parrots 
                        pray to.

           Mad Man snaps his fingers together.

                                 MAD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Woke up the next day and Rufus 
                        can’t speak a lick of ‘fuckin 
                        English!
                             (beat)
                        Rufus who was the President after 
                        Jefferson?

           Rufus is dumbfounded.

                                 MAD MAN (CONT'D)
                        And that! Was a soft toss before 
                        the reset.

           Bill’s phone goes off.

                                 BILL
                        You’re saying I can get out? Like 
                        vanish?

                                 MAD MAN
                        I’m saying when you get out, you’ll 
                        look like a Stuck to the rest of us 
                        BUT you’ll be back in normal 
                        forward moving time.

           Bill looks down at whose calling --

                                 BILL
                         Be quiet. It’s corporate.

           Bill answers the call.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)

                        you ARE is a worker bee.

                        ending corporate fuckin’ rat race.

           Bill is pushing him away. 

                                 BILL
                        Oh that? It’s just a crazy person 
                        on the street.
                             (cuffing the phone)
                        SHUT THE FUCK....UP.
                             (removing his hand)
                        I’ll be in my office in twenty.

                                 MAD MAN
                        YOU CAN GET OUT -- You just need to 
                        find your Amazon Jungle n’ take 
                        flight.

           Bill ends the call.

                                 BILL
                        I’m sorry but you’re batshit crazy. 

           Bill climbs the steps.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           Bill guns it through the neighborhood.

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           Bill speeds past the “CLOSED: HAPPY THANKSGIVING!” sign.

           INT. LOBBY - CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           Bill walks in. The Security Pickers have already dismantled 
           all the security systems. 

           The Enthusiastic Security Picker is packing up his toolbox 
           for his next assignment. He waves to Bill.

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - 1ST FLOOR - DAY

           Bill walks through the maze of cubicles. We notice people are 
           binning personal items and placing news ones on their desk. 

           Bill frantically turns into Jackie’s cublicle. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Where have you been!? Green has 
                        been circling your old desk every 
                        fifteen minutes. Upstairs is asking 
                        where you are.
                             (beat)
                        Also need to cut your hair.

           Bill picks up her scissors and pulls his hair together -- 
           SNIP -- It falls to the ground. His looks kinda like he’s in 
           a 90s boy band.

                                 BILL
                        Happy?! I need your help --

           Bill notices Jackie’s eyes are a bit puffy and there are some 
           scrunched tissues in her waste basket.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                             (refocusing)
                        Are you okay?

                                 JACKIE
                        Yeah. You’re late. You need to get--

           She’s clearly not okay.

                                 BILL
                        It can wait. 

           Beat.
                                 JACKIE
                        Justin and I had a fight last 
                        night.

                                 BILL
                        What about--

                                 JACKIE
                        Justin doesn‘t want to get married 
                        he says the lack of 
                        responsibilities are the best part 
                        of The Loop.

           Jackie takes a deep breathe.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        But I will make things work.

                                 BILL
                        I mean --

                                 JACKIE
                        Have you seen the people on this 
                        app? All they want to do is fuck 
                        and blow shit up on CS. I-Will-Make-

                        Get going.

           Bill looks at her sheepishly.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        You want me to help you build the 
                        new feature?

           Bill nods.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        You do realize I have my own work 
                        to do right? 

           Bill nods.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        God. You’re absurd. 

           Bill smiles.

                                 BILL
                        You’re the best.
                             (beat)
                        I gotta get upstairs. Apparently 
                        this feature is a big deal.
           Bill walks away.

                                 JACKIE

           Bill looks over. It’s the BARISTA. She is struggling to hold 
           dozens of coffees-- 

                                 BILL
                        Can I help you with that?

                                 BARISTA
                        Would you?

           Bill collects a few Lattes. 

                                 BILL
                        Tough day?

                        You ever wonder if you’re just 
                        stuck doing the same thing again 
                        and again?

           Bill smiles. He does.

                                 BILL
                        How about we change that?

                                              Just to break the monotony.

           The Barista debates this strange offer but --

                                 BARISTA (CONT'D)
                        Okay.

           PING. The door opens. It’s Bill floor. He steps out.

           The Barista smiles. A sliver of hope in her eyes. This hits 
           Bill. He feels guilty...

                                 BILL
                             (to himself)
                        It’s a prison of your mind.

                                 BARISTA
                        What was that?

                                 BILL
                        To be honest and upfront, I’m still 
                        in love with my ex. We’re on a 
                        break but she’s a Stuck and I’m an 
                        Awake so we can’t get back 
                        together. Although she does get 
                        drunk every night and call me, and 
                        considers getting back together. I 
                        can’t really say why BUT I’ve 
                        fixated on you as a rebound and you 
                        don’t deserve to be Stuck as a 
                        rebound for eternity. I’ve been a 
                        selfish prick. I... I’m sorry.

                                 MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D)
                             (to himself)
                        Doesn’t know who Kate “The Butcher 
                        of Canary Wharf” is... HA!

           The Man In the Suit walks out. Bill is panicked. He calls 
           Jackie.

                                 BILL (ON THE PHONE)
                        They want me to go to the next 
                        floor.

                                 JACKIE (ON THE PHONE)
                        YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!
                        This is just insane. I’ve never 
                        known anybody whose made it to the 
                        third floor.

                                 BILL (ON THE PHONE)
                        What do I do?!

                                 JACKIE (ON PHONE)
                        Go and don’t fuck this up. Grab me 
                        some food. I hear they have access 
                        to the exec commissary.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Bill is riding the elevator. Trying not to panic. 
           INT. MAIN FLOOR - THIRD FLOOR - MORNING

           Bill walks onto the main floor. Everyone is looking at a 
           woman in a power suit on a raised stage. Her name is KATE 
           STONEHILL. A South African Jew who was raised in London and 
           came to the States for a wedding and now is Stuck crushing it 
           every day, all day, forever.

                                 STONEHILL
                             (into mic)
                        Every single man, woman and gender 
                        fluid person standing before me is 
                        an absolute monster and was hand 
                        selected by me! There is a fuckin 
                        fortune at the other end of that 
                        dial tone. Are you strong enough to 
                        take it?! Of course you fuckin’ 
                        are! Remember! WE ARE LIONS OF THE 
                        MOTHAFUCKIN’ PLAIN! 

           The crowd are making roaring sounds. Stonehill spots Bill. 
           She turns to her Assistant RONNY.

                                 STONEHILL (CONT'D)
                             (microphone cupped)
                        Ronny. Finish frothin’ these bitch 
                        boys. I want their fingers bangin’ 
                        the phone lines like a fat kid 
                        ordering a cake, AND I want chalk 
                        lines waiting in my office so thick 
                        you could bread a chicken cutlet 
                        with ‘em.

           Stonehill steps down from the stage. Her team splits as she 
           walks through them. They all nod in respect and awe. Like 
           Kirk Douglas in Paths of Glory (Or Russel Crowe in Gladiator, 
           which is where Ridley ripped it from) 

                                 RONNY (IN THE BACKGROUND)
                        WHO WANTS TO NUT THEIR SHEET!

                                 STONEHILL
                        Are you Bill Button?

                                 BILL
                        Yeah.

                                 STONEHILL
                        Love the hair...Very --

                                 BILL
                        --Sorry I was running late.
                                 STONEHILL
                        Never apologize. It’s a sign of 
                        weakness.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EXEC COMMISSARY - THIRD FLOOR - MORNING

           Stonehill is sitting across from Bill. She is staring at him 
           intensely. Bill is trying to look confident.

           A waiter walks over. 

                                 STONEHILL
                        Two steaks, an onion soup and a 
                        chocolate milkshake.
                             (to Bill)
                        Order whatever you want.

                                 BILL
                        Whatever you wouldn’t serve at 
                        Thanksgiving.

           The Waiter nods. Very good sir.

                                 STONEHILL
                        That’s my favorite part. Not having 
                        to count calories.

                                 BILL
                        And the worst?

                                 STONEHILL
                        That I spent 170,000 dollars 
                        freezing my eggs two weeks before 
                        the world froze.

            She offers him a B47 pill.

                                 STONEHILL (CONT'D)
                        For after. It kills the food coma 
                        and you’re ready to storm the 
                        beaches of Normandy.

                                 BILL
                        What is it?

                                 STONEHILL
                        B47 -- It’s what we gave allied 
                        pilots in WW2. So they could 
                        traverse the Pacific Ocean -- Head 
                        inland and after 22 hours without 
                        sleep... Drop a bomb on a haystack.

                        And by haystack I mean a building 
                        full of Nazis.

           Bill is on the fence. Is this some sort of test?

                                 STONEHILL (CONT'D)
                        So you’re a Puritan? So was I. 
                        Clean. Replaced talk chalk with 
                        5Ks.
                             (exposing her stomach)
                        And fuck me was it good timing. Now 
                        I eat like a tween after a breakup 
                        and I have permanent abs.
                             (beat)
                        Touch ‘em.

           Bill is reluctant.

                                 STONEHILL (CONT'D)
                        They aren’t going to cut you.
                             (beat)
                        Badly.

           Bill touches them.

                                 BILL
                        That’s rock hard.

                                 STONEHILL
                        You better believe it.
                             (beat)
                        Fuck it.

           Stonehill pops a pill. Then another. Then takes out a 
           different prescription and takes one from that...

           --Of Bill shocked face.

                                 STONEHILL (CONT'D)
                        Anyone who does drugs is a moron. 
                        To much to lose. Not enough in 
                        return.

                                 BILL
                        But you--

                                 STONEHILL
                        Anyone who doesn't do drugs in a 
                        Time Loop is an even bigger ‘fuckin 
                        idiot than someone who does drugs 
                        outside a Time Loop.

           Bill takes a pill.
                                 BILL
                        And why--

                                 STONEHILL
                        I heard about your idea and thought 
                        that’s the kinda brain I need in my 
                        department.

                                 BILL
                        I didn’t actually come up with it.

                                 STONEHILL
                        Even better. The idea seemed a 
                        little played out. I mean Awake to

                                 BILL
                        What exactly do you sell?

                                 BILL
                        But they can’t spend the gains?

                        They never could spend it.

                                 BILL

           INT. BILLS OFFICE - 3RD FLOOR - DUSK 

           Bill is in a even bigger office. With a better view and a 
           SECRETARY outside.

           KNOCK KNOCK

           Detective Ridgemont walks in.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Mr. Button, do you have a sec?

           Bill’s SECRETARY runs in after.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Sorry I tried to stop him.

                                 BILL
                        It’s alright. Come in.

           Detective Ridgemont takes a seat and smiles. It’s unsettling.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Upper management really suits you.

                        Yeah I guess it’s a lot.

           An awkward pause. A tension hangs in the air. How much does 
           Detective Ridgemont know?

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        It’s a friend’s birthday downstairs 
                        and I said I would stop by her 
                        party. I need to get going or I’ll 
                        be late.

                        you.

           Bill starts to stand up.

                        Just one thing.

           Bill awkwardly sits back down.

                                 BILL
                        Shoot.

                        outside of Cosmic Sunday.

                                 BILL
                        I mean... come on, it’s a Time 
                        Loop. Does it really matter --

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        So you don’t believe our top 
                        scientists who say that if every 
                        Awake went full time deranged every 
                        day --  It would create a stress on 
                        the universe that would split time 
                        itself and cease all forms of life 
                        instantaneously? That one day a 
                        week is the only safe dosage of 
                        calorie free anarchy society can 
                        tolerate?

                                 BILL
                        I mean -- I’ve obviously heard 
                        that. I’m just saying --

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Were you one of those global 
                        warming deniers before --
                                 BILL
                        God no. I...

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Did you vaccinate your kids?

                                 BILL
                        I don’t have kids.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Policing our citizens INTO daily 
                        actions THAT is best for the 
                        collective is not something I take 
                        lightly Mr. Button.

           Bill begins to sweat.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (CONT'D)
                        Which brings me to the real reason 
                        I stopped by.
                             (beat)
                        I heard this real peculiar police 
                        scanner last night. Couple robbed a 
                        diner but instead of fleeing the 
                        scene they had sex in a parked car 
                        right outside...

                                 BILL
                        That is strange. What did the 
                        police report say?

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Well, obviously the toxicology and 
                        prints doesn’t come until tomorrow, 
                        so unluckily for me, that means its 
                        never coming.
                             (beat)
                        But I did manage to break into the 
                        morgue just before midnight and 
                        look at the bodies.

                                 BILL
                        Is that --

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Legal? Nothing wrong with being 
                        thorough. After forty years on the 
                        force you pick up a trick or two. I 
                        took a few photos --

           Bill takes a deep breath. But then he realizes -- 

                                 BILL
                        ...But they wiped.
           Detective Ridgemont doesn’t have shit and is fishing.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                             (standing up)
                        Next time you come into my office. 
                        Try having some evidence.

           Bill walks out of the office. The door shuts.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        You can count on it Mr. Button.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOP FLOOR - CORPORATE OFFICE - NIGHT

           It’s very darkly lit. A man bathed in darkness sits by his 
           desk. Detective Ridgemont enters.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        I think we have a problem.

                                 MAN IN SHADOWS
                        The most dangerous threat our 
                        society faces is a calendar 
                        compliance.

           The Man in The Shadows leans forward and light hits his face. 
           It’s “The Calm Man” from the diner.

                                 MAN IN THE SHADOWS
                        Educate Mr. Button on the carrot 
                        and stick. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Bill drives down a posh driveway flanked by trees.

           EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

           Jackie is standing outside with the Enthusiastic Security 
           Picker from the office.

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        The security system is down and the 
                        closest neighbors are half a mile 
                        away. So as long as no one sets up 
                        a massive explosion, you should be 
                        all set.
                                 JACKIE
                        Thanks so much.

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        No, thank you. Helping you 
                        celebrate your birthday gave my day 
                        purpose.

           The Enthusiastic Security Picker passes by Bill and gets into 
           his Porsche and guns it.

                                 JACKIE
                        You’re late! So how was food?

                                 BILL
                        Great -- Hey there’s something I 
                        wanted to talk to you about. That I 
                        didn't feel comfortable discussing 
                        at the office.

                                 JACKIE
                        It’ll have to wait. It’s about to 
                        rain.

           Jackie enters the mansion. Bill shakes his head and follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           JUSTIN, Jackie’s boyfriend holds up a champagne glass and is 
           addressing a large group. Jackie is standing next to him.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Thank you for all coming to 
                        Jackie’s 75th birthday. Even if she 
                        doesn’t look a day over 35...

           Everyone politely laughs. Then everyone raises an umbrella. 
           Rain falls and Justin continues --

                                 JUSTIN (CONT'D)
                        I remember meeting Jackie like it 
                        wasn’t half a century ago. I fled 
                        onto a roof. Classic Cosmic Sunday 
                        bank robbery. Jackie was installing 
                        a bungee cord. Right before the 
                        police helicopter gunned me down, I 
                        got her number, and nine years 
                        later. Here we are!

           Everyone claps.
                                 JUSTIN (CONT'D)
                        And I’m glad you’re all here so we 
                        can share our next step in our 
                        relationship.

           Jackie looks at him with love. He’s finally gonna propose.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT'D)
                        We’re getting a cat!

           Jackie deflates. But puts on a brave face and smiles. 

           The rain stops and everyone tosses the umbrellas on the 
           floor.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Bill is waiting to take a leak. He hears Justin talking on 
           the phone as he opens it --

                                 JUSTIN
                        Baby, I’m working late --

           He stops cold when he see’s Bill.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, my boss just walked in. I’ll 
                        call you right back.

           Justin hangs up the phone.

                                 BILL
                        Was that--

                                 JUSTIN
                        My wife? Why make her unhappy. I 
                        say I’m working late and it resets 
                        before she knows I’m lying. It’s a 
                        victimless crime.

           Justin walks past Bill --

                                 BILL
                        But why call her baby?

           Justin turns and gets right in Bill’s face.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Look, I know you have this weird 
                        work flirt thing but do --
                                 BILL
                        What are you gonna fuckin’ do?

                                 JUSTIN
                        You spend too much time with 
                        Stucks. Practicing your quippy 
                        comebacks and acting tough to 
                        people who think the rules still 
                        apply. I’ll cut your dick off with 
                        a rusty shear and force it down 
                        your throat so far you’ll swear you 
                        can still feel it tickle your 
                        throat every time you reset and 
                        take a gulp. How about that?

           Justin walks away. Bill is left there. Rather stunned.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - MANSION - NIGHT

           Jackie pours champagne in a glass. Bill walks in.

                                 JACKIE
                        A cat. After nine years.

           She smashes the glass against the ground.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        Huzzah! 

           Jackie pours another glass. She is very drunk.

                                 BILL
                        ...Are you sure Justin is the

                                 JACKIE
                        I could never have gotten a guy 
                        like Justin before the freeze --

                        He’s successful. Career driven. 
                        Comes from a good family --

                        He just threatened to cut my dick 
                        off with a shear and stuff it down 
                        my throat --
                                 JACKIE
                        What did you do? Don’t mess this up 
                        for me!

                        Well it is...

           A BATHTUB RIPS DOWN THE STAIRS AND SMASHES THROUGH THE FRONT

           -- CRASHING OUT INTO THE LAWN. 

           A group of FRAT STARS dressed in boxers cheer.

           Bill is standing next to Bunny, whose hair is back to elbow 
           length.

                                 BILL
                        Cheers for the invite.

                                 BUNNY
                        ‘course. I had a lot of fun at the 
                        diner.

           Bill stares at all the beautiful young people.

                                 BILL
                        ... I feel a little old for this.

                                 BUNNY
                        I’m in my 60s. I’m too old to be 
                        here as well. Fuck ‘em.

           Bunny takes Bill’s hand and they walks in.
           INT. FRAT HOUSE - SKIDMORE

           College kids are ingesting narcotics, guzzling alcohol and 
           screaming the lyrics to TOTO’S “AFRICA”.

           A group of K-HOLE ZOMBIES are STRUNG out on the sofa. The 
           Ketamine (Horse Tranquilizer) packet is flopped on a lad 
           wearing a Union Jack speedo. 

           Bunny goes over and picks it up and does a cheeky bump --

                                 BUNNY
                             (off Bill’s surprise)
                        Just some Ket. 

            She offers it to Bill.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                        First time?

           Bill nods but --

                                 BILL
                        Anyone who doesn't do drugs in a 
                        Time Loop is a even bigger fuckin 
                        idiot than someone who does drugs 
                        outside a Time Loop.

           Bill does a bump. It hits him hard. His face feels like 
           Jello. Bunny throws the packet back on the Union Jack Speedo.

           Bill is absolutely shattered. Swaying in his own world. But 
           then -- A LAX PLAYER charges up.

                                 BUNNY
                        Ow fuck. I forgot to break up with 
                        him today.

                                 LAX PLAYER
                        What are you doing with my girl?!

           Bill tries and speaks but he just slurs some unknowable 
           words.

                                 LAX PLAYER (CONT'D)
                        I’m fuckin’ talkin’ to you!

                                 BILL
                        AJAJAAHAHAAHAHAH...?

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. FRAT HOUSE - SKIDMORE - NIGHT

           The FRAT STARS are whooping Bill’s ass. They get bored and 
           leave him bloodied on the wet grass. Bunny steps over.

                                 BUNNY
                        Sorry about that.

           She takes a KNIFE out of her purse.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                             (innocently)
                        You want me to slit your throat?

           Bill shakes his head. Bunny helps him stand.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                        My roommate’s alone in our sorority 
                        house. Wanna Scream 2 her?

                                 BILL
                        You wanna terrorize n’ throw your 
                        friend off a roof?

                                 BUNNY
                             (applying lip gloss)
                        She’s gonna wake up perfectly fine.

                                 BILL
                        I don’t know. Feels a little 
                        twisted.

                                 BUNNY
                        Didn’t you crash a school bus full 
                        of children.

                                 BILL
                        You have a point.

           EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - SKIDMORE

           Bunny pulls out two SCREAM MASKS from her purse and hands one 
           to Bill. She hands him a kitchen knife.

           MATILDA, a Stuck sorority girl walks by the front door and 
           sees two strangers brandishing knives and Scream masks --

           -- She drops her WhiteClaw and screams! 

           Bunny throws a BRICK through the front door. Matilda runs 
           upstairs. Bunny opens the front door. Bill hesitates.
                                 BUNNY
                        ...She’s getting away.

                                 BILL
                        This isn’t too far?

                                 BUNNY
                        How is this different than what you 
                        do? 

                                 BILL
                        I... It isn’t.  But I’m trying to 
                        be a better person in The Loop.

                                 BUNNY
                        I don’t understand a word you just 
                        said.

           Bunny charges in.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                             (calling back)
                        Stop being a Debbie Downer.

           Bill reluctantly follows.

           INT. STARWAY - NIGHT

           Bunny is charging up the stairs. Bill follows.

                                 BUNNY
                        We’re coming to get you.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Matilda smashes through the window as Bill and Bunny chase 
           after --

                                 BILL
                        You sure you don’t want to just go 
                        grab a beer?

                                 BUNNY
                        Seriously? Whaaaat is up with you?

           Bunny climbs out onto the roof.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ROOF - NIGHT

           Matilda is inching towards the edge of the roof. Begging for 
           her life. She is bloodied and bruised. Bunny slashes towards 
           her with the knife --

                                 BILL
                        That’s enough.

                                 BUNNY
                        IT-DOESN’T-MATTER.

           Bunny pulls out her phone and dials 911.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                        I’d like to report a murder. Yeah -- 
                        the Kappa Gamma House.
                             (beat)
                        No. We are 68 Greek Row. 72 are a 
                        bunch of sluts.
                             (perkily)

                             (crying - begging)
                        I don’t wanna die.

                                 BUNNY
                             (to Bill)
                        The cops will be here soon. Take 
                        off your pants. I’ll throw her off.

                                 BILL
                             (excited)
                        Then after we fuck we can Butch 
                        Cassidy the front door.

           Bill starts unbuckling his pants and then --

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Fuck this.

           He buttons them back up.

                                 BUNNY
                        SERIOUSLY?!

                                 MATILDA
                        ...Whatever Is going on between you 
                        two. I won’t say anything.

           Bunny takes off her mask.
                                 BUNNY
                        Shut up Matilda. Not everything is 
                        about you!

           Bill turns back into the window.

                                 BUNNY (CONT'D)
                        Only thing interesting about you 
                        was the carnage Button!

                                 MATILDA
                        Abby?

                                 BUNNY
                        Matilda.

                                 MATILDA
                        Why?

                                 BUNNY
                        What are you wearing?

                                 MATILDA
                        ...Your sweater

                                 BUNNY
                        That’s right bitch. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bill walks out the front door. Matilda lands in front of him 
           and SPLATTERS -- Bill nonchalantly steps over her body and 
           walks down the street as COP CARS descend in the background.

                                 BUNNY
                             (calling out to Bill)
                        You’re a fuckin’ pussy!

           The COPS open fire -- Bunny takes the bullets with the 
           entitlement only a self proclaimed princess who has never 
           heard the words “No” could summon.

                                 BILL
                             (shaking his head)
                        God I hate online dating.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

           Bill is in a new luxury stolen car. He takes a sip from a 
           flask. He’s hammered. His left eye is swollen shut from the 
           beating and there is dried blood around his nose. He stares 
           at Marissa having diner with her family. But this time he 
           gets out of the car --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

           Bill walks into a family of six having a Thanksgiving dinner. 
           MARISSA, stands up.

                                 MARISSA
                        What are you doing here? What 
                        happened to your face.

                                 MARISSA’S DAD
                        I thought you broke up with him?
                             (beat)
                        Bill get outta here!

           Bill is not surprised by this interaction. We can deduce he 
           has done this before.

                                 BILL
                        How many times am I going to come 
                        over n’ bleed my heart out to you 
                        and... you just tell me to leave 
                        and never call you ever again?

           Bill picks up a TURKEY LEG and takes a large bite.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        BUT If I don’t come by, you call me 
                        saying you want to get back 
                        together. Why can’t you just decide 
                        you love me when we could actually 
                        have time. Stop playing these 
                        fuckin games!

                                 MARISSA’S MOM
                        He’s back on drugs.

           Bill takes a chug from a bottle of wine on the table.

                                 BILL
                        I smoked pot one time in the house 
                        Helen. One time. I was sixteen and 
                        it was HER weed.
                                 MARISSA
                        This isn’t the time or place to 
                        talk about our relationship. 

                                 BILL
                        Talk tomorrow? Great idea!

                                 MARISSA
                        You’re scaring my parents --

                                 BILL
                        Always pushing the tin can down the 
                        cosmic road, hey Marissa?! We break 
                        up. We get back together. We break 
                        up. We get back together. And you 
                        had to pick the exact moment before 
                        a fuckin never ending Time Loop!

                                 MARISSA
                        Leave. Now.

           Bill retreats and walks to the door. He opens it but stops --

                                 BILL
                             (holding the door)
                        ...I stayed in this town for you.

                                 MARISSA
                        And you hated me for it. I never 
                        wanted you to pause your life for 
                        me.

                                 BILL
                        I was Stuck? That’s REAL funny.

           Bill slams the door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

           It’s a late night crowd. A CAR SMASHES through the front 
           door. Bill pokes his head out.

                                 BILL
                        Bill Button. I ordered the Hawaiian 
                        Pizza.

           Everyone looks at Bill with shock n’ terror.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        It’s just ham and pineapple. Get

                        hot wings and a eight year old boy.

           Bill waves a gun. A scared-shitless owner brings it to him.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        I would tip you. If any of this 
                        mattered. I’m not that kinda guy. 
                        Really.

           Bill reverses the car out while eating a slice. One of the 
           customers, who isn’t scared shitless, pulls out his phone.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        We got a non-Cosmic Sunday full 
                        throttle heading east on Mulberry 
                        Lane.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STOLEN CAR - NIGHT

           Bill looks behind him. Sees Inspector Remington --

                                 BILL
                        Ohhh Enforcement. However will I 
                        get away.

           Bill revs the engine and blasts onto A BRIDGE -- He pulls a 
           gun to his head --

           -- Squeezes the trigger, BAM! His brains EXPLODE and SPLATTER 
           like someone forget to put a lid on a blender.

           The car flies off THE BRIDGE and into the water below --

           -- Inspector Remington SLAMS the brakes and gets out. He 
           looks down at Button’s car as it disappears into the icy cold 
           water.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           An alarm goes off. A scruffy man rises. His name is Bill. He 
           is 29 years old. He is dressed in a stale T-Shirt, which is 
           sprayed with fresh stains. He walks out of his room into --
           INT. PARENTS BEDROOM - MORNING

           His parents’ bedroom. He opens his father’s closet. Takes out 
           a suit -- Rips open the plastic laundry seal --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Bill walks down the steps in the suit. His mother is 
           preparing a feast in the kitchen. She looks up at Bill in 
           shock. 

                                 MS. BUTTONS
                        Honey... Why are you wearing a suit 
                        on Thanksgiving?

           AN ARMORED VAN SMASHES through the front door --

           -- EXPLODING the contents of the dinning room and PRESSING 
           Bill into the LIVING ROOM WALL.

                                 OFFICER RIDGEMONT
                             (from the driver’s seat.)
                        You little shit.

           MS. Button is screaming hysterically. Uncle Fred runs in.

           Detective Ridgemont jumps out of THE VAN. Gun in one hand. 
           Buzzer in the other. He shoots Uncle Fred in the chest and 
           then --

           -- He grabs Bill’s head and turns on the buzzer.

                        every morning and come to in an ice 
                        cold tundra. So you better get it 
                        the fuck together. Easy street is 
                        over.

           Bill grits his teeth and nods his shaved head. He goes for a 
           knife on the floor.

                                 OFFICER RIDGEMONT
                        Fuck no. You’re gonna spend the 
                        whole day with a fractured leg.

           Officer Ridgemont gets in the car and starts reversing out. 
           Ms. Button is still holding the bowl of mashed potatoes.

           Bill stumbles through the parking lot with a handful of 
           medical supplies.
           INT. BILL’S CAR - MORNING

           Bill stumbles in and throws the supplies on the driver’s 
           side. He left his iPhone in the car and it’s playing 
           “BUSINESS”

           Bill looks at his leg. Blood is oozing out. Then the scissors 
           he just bought. He thinks about cutting his throat but -- He 
           grunts and sterilizes the wound. He hears Stonehill’s voice 
           and turns up the audio --

           Bill walks through the maze of cubicles. Bill turns into

           INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Bill is leaning against the wall. His leg is throbbing. A

           JOSE ALTUVE walks up to the plate. The New York fans are 
           booing him.

           Note: The Houston Astros were caught cheating and never 
           apologized. I’m not over it. Nor should I be.

                                 JOSE ALTUVE
                        Too bad I got a ring bitches.

           The UMPIRE pulls out a gun and shoots both of JOSE ALTUVE’S 
           knee caps. The Umpire takes off his mask... It’s Bill. 

                                 BILL
                        Why did you pull your shirt down 
                        when you hit the walk off homer in 
                        the ACLS?

           Jose Altuve is squealing on the ground.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Answer me.

           Bill shoots him in the thigh.

                                 JOSE ALTUVE
                        CUS I WAS WIRED! I CHEATED!

                                 BILL
                        Apologize.

           Bill points the gun at Altuve’s balls.

                                 JOSE ALTUVE
                        I’m sorry! They told me everyone 
                        does it. Mercy!

                                 BILL
                        It’s too late for that.

           BAM! BAM! BAM!

           Bill tosses the gun on the ground and drags Jose Altuve’s 
           corpse off home plate. Bill flips his mask down and crouches.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        LETS PLAY BALL!

           Then a DOZEN SECURITY GUARDS tackle him.

                        For me it’s a gift. Uncle Fred was

                        Thanksgiving to be a funeral 
                        procession -- He wanted to spend it 
                        with his family. Like nothing was 
                        wrong. He always gets a little sad 
                        when you leave.

                                 BILL
                        But he hates me.

                                 AUNT EMMA
                        Only because he always saw a lot of 
                        potential in you. He was frustrated 
                        you never moved out of this house 
                        and made a go of it. He was hard on 
                        you because he believed in you.

                        I will miss your imagination around 
                        here. 

           She kisses Bill on the cheek.

                        Safe travels.

           Aunt Emma nudges Uncle Fred. He wakes up.

                                 UNCLE FRED
                             (groggily)
                        Oh looks who’s back. 
                             (seeing the books)
                        Why are you pretending you can 
                        read?
                                 BILL
                        I’m gonna miss you Fred.

           Bill walks upstairs.

           INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bill looks at his watch. He only has twenty minutes ‘til 
           everything resets and he wakes up.

                                 BILL
                        Fuck-fuck-fuck.

           The WHITE LIGHTS RIPPLES THE SCREEN --

           An alarm goes off. A scruffy man rises. His name is BILL 
           BUTTON, 29. He is dressed in a stale T-Shirt, and sweat 
           pants. Bill leaps out of bed with an energy we have never 
           seen before. He is fully awake

           He exits into-

           INT. PARENTS BEDROOM - MORNING

           --His parents bedroom. He opens his fathers closet. He rips 
           open the plastic dry-cleaning seal in one motion --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           -- Bill walks down the steps dressed in his father’s suit. He 
           is buzzing his face with an Electric Shaver. His mother is 
           prepping a massive meal in the kitchen. She looks up at Bill 
           in shock. 

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        Honey... Why are you wearing your 
                        father’s suit on Thanksgiving?

                                 BILL
                        I wanna look sharp for the biggest 
                        presentation of my life!

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        That’s wonderful!
                             (beat)
                        ...What presentation?
           Bill opens the front door exactly as the bell rings. 
           Revealing his UNCLE FRED and AUNT EMMA. 

                                 UNCLE FRED
                        Hey numnuts what’s with the suit? 
                        You don’t have--

           Bill kisses Uncle Fred on the mouth. In shock he drops A PIE 
           and Bill delicately catches it. He hands the pie to his 
           stunned mother.

           Bill pulls out of his driveway as his perplexed family 
           watches on --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FANCY STREET - MORNING

           Bill steps out of his car into a tricked out Range Rover. He 
           knows the car is unlocked and where the keys are hidden. He 
           connects his IPHONE. He keeps hitting refresh on his PODCAST 
           library until -- DING -- a first time podcast appears BUT 
           it’s oddly labelled --

                                 PODCAST VOICE
                        Hello fellow travelers. It’s a 
                        wonderful day to be connected. 
                        Bless The Calender Maker for this 
                        day.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - SARATOGA SPRINGS - MORNING

           Bill drives through Saratoga Springs: A summer vacation town 
           in upstate New York known for horse races and hot springs.

           Bill turns onto Main Street, it’s cold, overcast and nearly 
           empty except for some locals getting last minute ingredients.

                        to cure a cosmic hangover.

           EXT. SECURITY GATE - MORNING

           The GATE is raised and the GUARD SHED is empty...

           Bill drives through.
           He passes a sign: “CLOSED: HAPPY THANSKGIVING!”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - CORPORATE OFFICES - MORNING 

           A makeshift BARBER SHOP. It’s a two man operation. One 
           SWEEPS. The other CUTS. Bill walks in and takes a seat.

                                 THE BARBER
                        What can I do ‘ya for? 

                                 BILL
                        The Executive.

                                 THE BARBER
                        Sweet Mother Mary.

           The Barber takes Bill’s shoulder length hair in his hand and 
           chops it off. Bill smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - MORNING

           Bill has a preppy haircut. This is the most put together 
           we’ve ever seen him. He looks like the lead in a rom-com.

           He walks to Jackie’s desk -- She’s not there.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CORPORATE OFFICE - MORNING

           Bill stands in the elevator. He is going to the top floor.

           PING!

           INT. TOP FLOOR - CORPORATE OFFICE - MORNING

           Bill walks towards a large oak door. Stonehill is waiting 
           outside.

                                 STONEHILL
                        There he is!

           Stonehill claps Bill on the back. We see a HELICOPTER shoot 
           into frame and then bank upwards.
                                 STONEHILL (CONT'D)

                        And this is a big day for you.

                                 BILL
                        You have no idea.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TOP FLOOR - MORNING

           Bill walks into a board room packed with the most powerful 
           Awakes on the East Coast.

           At the end of the table is The Big Boy, MR. DIAMOND. The CEO 
           of all Awake business in the territory.

                                 MR. DIAMOND
                        Mr. Button, I believe you have a 
                        tech demo planned for us?

                                 BILL
                        I don’t.

           The whole room GOES SILENT. Anticipating the bloodbath to 
           come --

                                 STONEHILL
                        Bill...

                                 BILL
                        You came here because you were 
                        promised a new feature on the 
                        Jewish Farmer dating app that would 
                        help strengthen the Awake 
                        community.

                                 MR. DIAMOND
                        Are you saying that we wasted our 
                        time?

                                 BILL
                        No, I’m offering something better. 

                                 MR. DIAMOND
                        What.
                             (furrowing his brow)
                        Exactly?

                                 BILL
                        Preferences...

           Bill clicks on the laptop already set up on the table. 
           CU: SCREEN. He clicks EDIT SETTINGS -- LOOKING FOR --

           Then he types “Friendship”

           And clicks SAVE. Then Bill steps back. 

                                 MR. DIAMOND
                        And what exactly does this mean?

           Bill takes a deep breath.

                                 BILL
                        There will always be smarter, 
                        prettier, wealthier options. But 
                        when it comes to who you want to 
                        spend eternity with, what can’t be 
                        bought, upgraded or exchanged is 
                        friendship. That is why Jewish 
                        Farmers will no longer solely be 
                        about “Dating” but offer the 
                        bedrock of all true relationships. 
                        Friendship. 

           The room is silent. Everyone just stares back at him.

           Finally --

                                 MR. DIAMOND
                        This is incredible.

           Stonehill nods.

                                 STONEHILL
                        This is BIGGER than a new feature. 
                        This opens up the app in a 360 
                        degree way.

           Everyone starts clapping.

                                 MR. DIAMOND
                        You’re gonna have your own 
                        department, Button. You are a 
                        genius. I wouldn’t be surprised if 
                        one day you were in my chair. 
                        Running the whole East Coast.

           Stonehill claps him on the back. Bill moves to the door and 
           stops.

                                 BILL
                        There is just one thing. This 
                        wasn’t my idea. Nor my work. It was 
                        Jackie Hinton’s.

                        promoted three times this week and 
                        she’s the smartest person in the 
                        building. If you really want to 
                        help the Awake community you should 
                        give her a department and let her 
                        cook.

                        I promise you won’t regret it.

           Bill walks outside.

           EXT. MARRISA’S HOUSE - MORNING

           BILL FLIES INTO FRAME. JUMPS OUT OF THE CAR AND RUNS INTO THE 
           HOUSE.
           INT. MARISSA HOUSE - MORNING

           Bill runs in. He’s wearing a dress shirt with the sleeves 
           rolled up and holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

           Marissa and her Dad are watching football.

                                 BILL
                        Marissa, I need to talk to you!

                        We’re watching the game.

           Bill stands next to the TV. Closes his eyes and starts 
           verbatim repeating the lines from THE BROADCAST --

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Can we talk upstairs? If you don’t 
                        like what I have to say. I will 
                        never bother you again.

                        3, 2, 1.

           Rain starts pouring outside. Marissa is starting to believe 
           him.

                                 MARISSA
                        Thanksgiving every day...

                                 BILL
                        Yeah.
                                 MARISSA
                        I guess there are worse days.

                                 BILL
                        Yeah.

                                 MARISSA
                        And if--

                                 BILL
                        You love me and we jump off a 
                        building together --

                                 MARISSA
                        You break out of The Loop?

                                 BILL
                        Yeah. Look I’ve realized over the 
                        last 74 years that you are my 
                        destiny and I can’t live without 
                        you, if you could --

                                 MARISSA
                        Okay. I’m in.

                           BILL
                                                         MARISSA (CONT'D)
           Really?
                                              Really.

           That was a little too easy... Fuck it he’ll take it.

           INT. BILL’S CAR - DAY

           Bill turns to Marissa --

                                 BILL
                        There’s someone from work I need to 
                        say goodbye too.

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           Bill drives in --

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           -- Bill walks to Jackie’s cubicle but she’s gone. He looks at 
           her desk. There’s a photo of them smiling at lunch.

           He reluctantly turns and walks away --
           EXT. LOBBY - CORPORATE OFFICE

           -- Bill walks through and sees The Enthusiastic Security 
           Picker.

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        Safe travels Button!

           Bill stops. How does he know? But he walks out.

           INT. BILL’S CAR - DAY

           Bill steps in.

                                 MARISSA
                        How’d it go?

                                 BILL
                        She wasn’t there. She must have 
                        gone to lunch with someone else.

                                 MARISSA
                        She?!

                                 BILL
                        We’re just friends--

                                 MARISSA
                        AND how many friends did you have 
                        in this time loop?

           Bill thinks about this --

                                 BILL
                        Just her. 

           He starts the engine and drives off.

           INT. ROOF - TALL BUILDING - DAY

           Bill and Marissa walk onto the roof.

                                 MARISSA
                        You can move into my parent’s 
                        house. Then we can save up for our 
                        own apartment while you look for 
                        another delivery job --

                                 BILL
                        I have a half a century of 
                        corporate work experience.
                                 MARISSA
                        Not after you wake up... You’re 
                        gonna be back to an unemployed 29 
                        year old with no job prospects and 
                        an incomplete BA in film studies.

           Bill and Marissa hold hands and walk to the ledge.

                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        Once we have our own place--

           Bill looks down at the drop. Then over to the woman he’s 
           about to take the leap with --

           -- A realization dawns on Bill.

                                 BILL
                             (to himself)
                        Friendship is the only thing that 
                        doesn’t reset.

                                 MARISSA
                        What?

                                 BILL
                        You and I were stuck long before 
                        the freeze. We’ll fight. Break up. 
                        Then I’ll move back into my 
                        parent’s place. Then move out. Then 
                        we’ll break up. Get back together -- 
                        break up -- Get back --

                                 MARISSA
                        Yeah like you said. We are meant to 
                        be together. 

                                 BILL
                        I would just be exchanging one loop 
                        for another.
                             (beat)
                        And I’d be losing my best friend.

                                 MARISSA
                        What the actual fuck? You drag me 
                        to this roof and are now having 
                        second thoughts?!

           Bill stands back from the ledge.

                                 BILL
                        I’m sorry. I’m in love with someone 
                        else and I don’t care if it’s the 
                        same day when I’m with her.
                                 MARISSA
                        Are you fuckin serious!?

           MARISSA PUSHES BILL OFF THE LEDGE -- HE HURTLES DOWN TO THE 
           CONCRETE AND --

           INT. BILL’S ROOM - MORNING

           An alarm goes off. A scruffy man rises from his bed. His name 
           is BILL BUTTON, 29. We just saw him die... He is wearing a 
           stale T-Shirt, and sweat pants. 

           His aesthetic is unemployed slacker, but he moves to the door 
           with the urgency of someone who just figured out the meaning 
           of his life.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Bill walks down and see’s Detective Ridgemont having coffee 
           with his mum.

                                 MS. BUTTON
                        Bill, your old college buddy 
                        stopped by.

           DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT pulls out a gun.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        We need to talk Button.

                                 BILL
                        Not today ‘mothafucka.

           Bill runs back into his room.

           EXT. ROOF - MORNING

           Bill slides down and leaps into a bank of dry leaves.

           INT. BILLS CAR - MORNING

           Bill gets in his car. For the first time he clicks his 
           seatbelt. His life has meaning in The Loop.

           Detective Ridgemont comes spilling out of his front door. He 
           gets in his car and blocks the driveway. Stopping Bill from 
           pulling out. Then --

           AN ICE CREAM VAN ON FIRE collides into Detective Ridgemont. 
           Spinning him and his car down the street like a bowling ball.
                                 BILL
                        Fuckin’ Cosmic Sunday.

           Bill tears off.

           EXT. BILL’S STREET - MORNING

           Detective Ridgemont crawls out of his totaled car.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        I want an APB on Bill Button. I 
                        want him shot on sight and I need 
                        approval to start a 3 month side 
                        prison sentence.

           EXT. JACKIE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Bill drives his car through the front door and jumps out --

                        JACKIE!

           Bill frantically runs upstairs -- 

           INT. JACKIES BEDROOM - MORNING

           -- She’s not there.

           Bill opens his phone and calls her. It goes straight to 
           voicemail.

                                 JACKIE’S VOICE
                        Hi. If your trying to reach me. I’m

                                 BILL
                        ...The fuck.

           He opens Alecs’s insta account. CLICKS his “Live Story”.

           CU: Alec is dressed as Jack Sparrow. Driving in a truck.

           A SUV smashes into the REC ROOM. The OLD TIMERS look up with

           INT. LOUNGE - MANSION - MORNING

           Stonehill is drinking a bottle of champagne and is dressed as 
           Cruella De Ville.

                        I thought you were crossing over?

                                 BILL
                        I made a HUGE mistake. I need to 
                        get to Manhattan.

                                 STONEHILL
                        It’s Cosmic Sunday. The whole 
                        world’s a bloody war zone. You 
                        should have gone first thing before 
                        it got primal.

                        I know. That’s why I came to you.

                                 STONEHILL
                        AND it’s a Halloween Cosmic Sunday. 
                        That’s the craziest one of them 
                        all. 

           Stonehill clicks on the TV NEWS. We see an anchor with bedlam 
           behind him --

           COSMIC SUNDAY is like if every cursed sports franchise won a

                        What’s the plan?

           Stonehill tilts her head up to the helipad -- 

           -- WE SEE A PROPELLER EXTENDED OVER THE ROOF.

                        We have company.

           Bill turns and he see’s a HELICOPTER pursuing them -- We hear 
           a crackle on the radio.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (RADIO)
                        Button land the helicopter 
                        immediately. You’re only making 
                        your sentence worse.

           Bill looks over at Stonehill. Is she gonna comply?

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        If you don’t. We will shoot you --

           Stonehill SWITCHES off the radio --

                        Middle management doesn’t threaten

                        done.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! -- Bullets rip into the cockpit --

           Ridgemont is hanging outside his helicopter firing on them.

           THE HELICOPTER STARTS CORK BARRELLING. Bill is tossed around.

                        I have an idea.

           Bill pulls out his phone.

           Alec is holding a machine gun as people around him either run 
           for cover or fire off rounds. 

                                 ALEC

                        I’m above you and I need your help. 

           Alec looks up to the sky. We see Helicopter high above in the 
           distance. 

                                 ALEC
                        Well tough titties.

                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        It’s a starring role in one of my

                        Defoes.

           Alec takes a deep breathe. He’s been waiting for this for a 
           long time.
                                 ALEC
                        I always wanted to be in one of 
                        your film reenactments Button.

           Alec pulls out a SWORD --

                        I’M A FUCKIN’ ACTOR. MOVE!

           -- Alec cuts his way to the back of the NATIONAL GUARD truck 
           and rummages for A CASE. 

           He grabs THE CASE and fights his way to a TV VAN. He climbs 
           the TV VAN while holding THE CASE. 

           He puts THE CASE DOWN and -- LIGHTS TWO GREEN FLARES --

                        My darling... He got us.

                        Not yet --

           Bill see’s the GREEN SMOKE.

                        Dive! dive! dive!

           And they do. And the ground is coming up at them way too fast 
           --

                        WATCH THE HARD DECK!

           --At the last second Stonehill banks the chopper and they are 
           few feet of the ground --

           --Bill opens the window and climbs out onto the ledge.

           CRASH!

           The window shatters and Bill looks behind them. Detective 
           Ridgemont is right on their ass --

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        He really takes this shit 
                        seriously.
           DOWN THE STREET

           Alec drops the flairs and lifts THE CASE in the sky for Bill 
           to collect BUT --

           A man dressed like Richie Tenenbaum walks by carrying an 
           AK47... And turns to Alec and starts firing --

           Alec’s body is torn to pieces, he convulses at each bullet 
           entry, it’s operatic, bombastic and kinda beautiful. 

           Even as his body becomes Swiss Cheese Alec keeps THE CASE 
           raised towards the heavens --

                                 ALEC
                        AHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA!

           Bill is hanging from the HELICOPTER as it barrels towards 
           Alec -- 

           BILL REACHES OUT AND GRABS THE CASE --

                                 BILL
                             (to Alec)
                        Now that’s a Willy fuckin’ Defoe!

           Alec smiles and then slumps over dead.

           Bill brings THE CASE back into the chopper -- A bullet knicks 
           his shoulder -- Bill yells through the pain.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        I WILL NOT DIE!

           The HELICOPTER banks upwards.

                                 STONEHILL
                        I told you, you could find meaning 
                        in a Time Loop. It’s the people in 
                        your life. It’s always --

           THE DASHBOARD EXPLODES. The HELICOPTER lurches down --

                                 STONEHILL (CONT'D)
                        If you’re going to do something, do 
                        it now.

           Bill flips open THE CASE and its a BAZOOKA.

           Bill pulls it out and props it on his shoulder.

                                 BILL
                        Hold. Don’t bank.
           Remington is right behind them gaining. He’s seconds from a 
           kill shot --

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Make him commit to his line.

           Remington is right on their ass --

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                             (pause)
                        Enforce this.

           BOOOOF! The rocket launches -- Remington dives out as the 
           helicopter explodes.

           Stonehill is trying to control THE HELICOPTER but it’s taken 
           too much damage. They are underneath a skyscraper.

                                 STONEHILL
                        Jump.

                                 BILL
                        Are you sure?

                                 STONEHILL
                        Be brave my prince. Love is all we 
                        have. 

                                 BILL
                        You’re the best boss I ever had.

           Bill jumps out of the HELICOPTER. He lands and time slows 
           down as Stonehill raises her fist in solidarity and descends 
           out of the frame --

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                             (fist raised)
                        VAYA CON DIOS!

           Then Bill KICKS open the Emergency Door --

           She is surrounded by Awake friends and family. Justin is

                                 BILL
                        I almost left the loop

           Gasps! This has everyone’s attention.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        And when I was standing over that 
                        building ledge. I realized that 
                        life regardless of what cosmic 
                        event you are currently 
                        experiencing is really always just 
                        one big loop. You wake up. You go 
                        to work. You watch some TV. You go 
                        to bed. What makes life worthwhile 
                        is who you spend it with and for 
                        the last 50 years the best part of 
                        my day is when I see you in the 
                        morning and the worst part is when 
                        I say goodbye when the bell rings.
                             (beat)
                        You’re what I have to look forward

                        Everything else is just noise.

           Justin charges at Bill. He’s gonna whoop his ass.

                        I don’t wanna fight.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Well you’re shit out of luck.
           Justin is tapped on the shoulder.

           BAM! Jackie decks him in the face and he goes down hard.

                                 JACKIE
                             (looking down at a dazed 
                              Justin)
                        The best part of a Time Loop is not 
                        treating relationships like they 
                        don’t matter.

           Jackie steps over Justin’s knocked-out body.

                                 BILL
                        You’re the best part of my day. 
                        Everyday.

                                 JACKIE
                        And you’re my cosmic fuckboy.
                             (beat)
                        You never appreciate me.

                                 BILL
                        Not nearly enough.

                                 JACKIE
                        But you make me feel like we have 
                        this secret language. A hidden 
                        world. Like no one could touch us. 
                        And you do it out of nothing but 
                        your imagination.

           Bill smiles. Maybe a little too cockily.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        BUT you are so self absorbed.

           Bill leans closer. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        And you are not as charming as you 
                        think you are.

                                 BILL
                        No one’s perfect.

                                 JACKIE
                        Some Like it Hot. 59

           Bill hands over the Abraham Lincoln/Cher bill.

                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        Haircut. Patrick Swayze. Road 
                        House.
                                 BILL
                        Well that’s easy.

           Bill hands over the Thomas Jefferson/Sylvester Stallone Bill.

           They kiss and it’s the kinda kiss people talk about for the 
           rest of time, which is what everyone has left.

           Detective Ridgemont busts in -- Interrupting some Princess 
           Bride level romance.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        You are SOOOO busted Button!

           Detective Ridgemont pulls out his gun.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT (CONT'D)
                        You have broken fifteen rules --

           The Enthuststic Security Picker walks into frame. 

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        Not so fast detective!
                             (beat)
                        Mr. Button is one of the biggest 
                        Awake influencers in the loop. With 
                        the content of his MovieDeath 
                        series being viewed by over 
                        seventeen million Awake users.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        BUT--

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        And as a CONTENT MAKER.
                        He is exempt from the work week 
                        rulebook and is given artistic 
                        license to stunt as he sees fit. As 
                        he did today.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Says who?

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        The Calendar Maker.

           Everyone gasps.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        My God--

           Everyone bows. 
                                 SECUIRTY PICKER
                        I’ve been tracking Ms. Hinton for 
                        some time. I heard a rumor this 
                        region wasn’t promoting their best 
                        and brightest -- I couldn’t help 
                        but notice Button as he is tied to 
                        the hip -- His free thinking rebel 
                        spirit is exactly what The Loop 
                        needs and has been missing.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        BUT--

                                 SECURITY PICKER
                        I didn’t make The Calendar to 
                        enslave people. I made it so that 
                        people could find what I found in 
                        The Loop. Meaning.

           The CALENDAR MAKER walks up to Detective Ridgemont and puts 
           his hand on his shoulder.

                                 THE CALENDER MAKER
                        You are the best enforcer we have 
                        but you must learn when we have no 
                        need of enforcement, yes?

           Detective Ridgemont holsters his gun and nods. He looks 
           guiltily at Bill.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        It was never personal.

                                 BILL
                        It’s okay.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        I’m sorry I shot your Uncle.

                                 BILL
                        He’ll get over it.

                                 DETECTIVE RIDGEMONT
                        Your stats said you were funny.

           Detective Ridgemont shuffles to an open seat.

           Bill and Jackie walk over to THE CALENDER MAKER.

                                 BILL
                        Why did you pretend to be a 
                        Security Picker?
                                 THE CALENDER MAKER
                        I am a Security Picker. I was an 
                        electrician before the Freeze. So I 
                        do what I love to do everyday.

                                 BILL
                        I don’t know how to thank you.

                                 THE CALENDER MAKER
                        Just keep doing what your doing. 
                        Building relationships. That’s all 
                        any of us can do.

           The Calender Maker turns to Jackie.

                                 THE CALENDER MAKER (CONT'D)
                        And take care of this young woman. 
                        She’s a star on the rise.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Everyone crowds onto the sidewalk.

                                 JACKIE
                        So what do you want to do?

                                 BILL
                        It is Cosmic Sunday...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BANK VAULT - DAY

           Jackie gets in a BLACK DODGE CHARGER. Bill is across from her 
           in ORANGE TOYOTA SUPRA.

                                 JACKIE
                        Are you sure about this?

                                 BILL
                        It’s a very grounded franchise.

           They pound their engines and shoot out of frame. Then we see 
           metal chains start to spin and --

           A VAULT RIPS OUT OF THE WALL AND FLYS OUT OF FRAME.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BILL’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           INSERT: 6 MONTHS LATER

           Smoke pours into the room. MEN IN HAZMAT suits enter. One of 
           them is holding a clipboard.

                                 CLIPBOARD MAN
                        This is a deluxe honeymoon package.

                                 GAS MAN
                        This slob has top exec perks?

                                 CLIPBOARD MAN
                        No. His wife does. He’s a listed 
                        dependent.

           They start packing up belongings. Then they break out a 
           stretcher and place Bill on top.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PENTHOUSE - MANHATTAN - MORNING

           Bill wakes and looks over at Jackie. Sleeping peacefully in 
           the bed. He smiles and gets up.

           This is the first time he’s woken up in a different room in 
           74 years.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PATIO - MANHATTAN - MORNING

           Bill is having a coffee overlooking the city. It’s still the 
           same overcast day as always... But to him, its paradise.

                                 BILL
                             (into microphone)
                        Well fellow travelers that about 
                        wraps it up for this week’s 
                        MovieDeath Podcast. Remember to 
                        never let them bring you in alive 
                        and Bless The Calender Maker for 
                        this day.

           Bill places his headphones down and presses stop. Jackie 
           walks out. She smiles and takes a seat.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        This is really nice. How long do we 
                        have it for?
                                 JACKIE
                        Rest of the week. Content bitch 
                        looks good on you.

                                 BILL
                        Power bitch looks good on you.

           DING. Jackie checks her email.

                                 JACKIE
                        Alec just invited us to his 
                        birthday next weekend.

                                 BILL
                        I don’t want to spend a Cosmic 
                        Sunday doing karaoke with people 
                        from work.

                                 JACKIE
                        It’d be rude if we didn’t show.

                                 BILL
                        I really wanted to try and land a 
                        helicopter with Stonehill.

                                 JACKIE
                        We can steal a helicopter after 
                        karaoke.

                                 BILL
                        Promise?

                                 JACKIE
                        Depending on when they shoot us 
                        down, we could even try that new 
                        place I read about in Watermill.

                                 BILL
                        Deal.

           Bill is content and happy in his loop. 

           We pull back from the patio and see all the different stories 
           and people in the apartment building. All waking up and 
           getting ready for the day. Some Awake and some Stuck but all 
           spinning in the hamster wheel we call life. 

                                                          FADE TO BLACK

           THE END -- THE END --- THE END -- THE END --
