           INT. SMALL COLORADO GYM - DAY - 2006

           A BLACK SCREEN.

           PANTING. WEIGHTS CLATTER to the floor. Some GRUNTS from 
           strained athletes. SHOES HITTING the TREADMILL. BIKE MACHINES 
           WHIR.

        M
           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. 

           Someone is increasing the speed of a treadmill. 

           A FLUSHED RED face of MARGARITA, 26, with an atrocious 
           underbite and fluffy red hair flying madly about as she runs, 
           fills the screen. 
                 e

           We begin to slowly PULL OUT. 

                       y
           She continues to increase her speed on the treadmill. All of 
           a sudden her LOUD THUDDING SNEAKERS begin to rhythmically 
           GALLOP. 

           The further we pull out we reveal her HORSE GRAPHIC Tee and 
           unflattering bike shorts pulled up around her middle, 
           creating a picturesque camel toe. 
                             e

           As she continues to GALLOP the POUNDING of her feet on the 
           treadmill has caused many other gym-goers to stare at the 
           chaos occurring on the treadmill. 

           She keeps increasing her speed, galloping faster and faster. 
           Her breathing is labored. Her cheeks are as red as her hair. 

           She GALLOPS faster and faster and faster.
                                   r
                                       i

                                          n
           All of a sudden, she TRIPS on her own feet, falling to her 
           hands and knees. She slides off the treadmill onto the floor 
           with a SONIC BOOM that causes every person in the gym to 
           look. Some gasp. 

           She has disappeared out of frame.

           SUPERIMPOSE: HORSEGIRL

           Margarita slowly sits up from the floor. Hot tears drip down 
           her face. She forces her underbite of a mouth into a smile, 
           shouting loudly. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        I’m fine!
           EXT. SMALL TOWN STREETS - COLORADO, DUSK

           A PLUSH HORSE HEAD

           Is mounted to a purple bicycle. 

           MARGARITA rides her bicycle down the streets. Her fluffy 
           hair, slicked to her forehead with sweat, flies madly behind 
           her. She balances her horse tote bag on her arm.

        M
            As she rides, she sings to herself at the top of her lungs, 
           a song she has written about herself. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Fast...she’s fast...the fastest 
                        girl in the world...she’s good and 
                        she’s great and she’s fast...
                 e
           As she rides, she shuts her eyes, beginning to coast down the 
           hill. At the last second she opens her eyes, she dodges a 
           GRUFF MAN on the sidewalk, practically smashing into 
           him...but she clears it.
                       y
                                 GRUFF MAN
                        Use the bike lane- fuck!

           Margarita doesn’t even notice, she’s entirely in HER OWN 
           WORLD. She continues on riding. 
                             e

           Suddenly a HEAVENLY CHOIR begins to break into SONG, the 
           exact lyrics she was singing before. The SOUNDTRACK fills her 
           mind, it’s ethereal and epic. 

                                 CHOIR
                        Fast...she’s fast...the fastest 
                        girl in the world...she’s good and 
                        she’s great and she’s fast...

           EXT. SMALL TOWN STREETS - MARGARITA’S WORLD.

           In MARGARITA’S WORLD, sounds are AMPLIFIED. Colors are 
           SATURATED. The leaves seem to LIFT off the ground as she 
           rides. The CHOIR continues to SING.
                                                 g
           Margarita begins to FLOAT while riding her bike. The bike 
           begins to move as if it’s galloping. Her hair floats upwards, 
           the blood drips from her knees begin to float off her knees.

           Margarita hangs on tight as the wind blows her hair back. 
           She’s free. 

           She SEES: 
           Leaves, faces, shadows, reflections, birds.

           She HEARS:

           Her tires, the wind, the leaves crunch, people’s voices, and 
           horse hooves.

           Her bike touches back down to earth again. She coasts down 
           the hill in complete bliss. 

           She pedals on.

           PEPPERMINT PINK WALLS and paintings of FLOWER GARDENS. 

           The rhythmic BEEPS of machines.

                       y
           SANDY, mid 50’s with curly brown hair and a face filled with 
           freckles, sits in a chair receiving chemo. Sandy is in the 
           middle of telling an animated story as a couple other cancer 
           patients listen. 

           All patients seem to be middle-aged women. Many don’t have 
           hair and some wear masks.
                             e

           Sandy is one of the few who still has hair and life left in 
           her. 

                                 SANDY

                        So of course, he lifts me up and, 
                        he deadman carries-- no he fireman 
                        carries, what’s the word? I don’t 
                        know what it is, you know where 
                        they throw you over their shoulder- 
                        you know, you know... Anyways he 
                        has me over his shoulder because I 
                        am so piss drunk off G&T’s and 
                        tequila shots and whatever else 
                        they served us that night...So, 
                        he’s still carrying me, I manage to 
                        convince him we should sleep out on 
                        the trampoline...because it...I 
                        don’t know why I thought it- but I 
                        thought we wouldn’t wake up our 
                        kid...so we, we go sleep on the 
                        trampoline. 

           DEBBIE, the woman sitting next to her, also still with hair 
           and looking livelier than some of the other women, chimes in. 
                                 DEBBIE
                        And how was it? 

                                 SANDY
                        Fucking freezing. 

           The ladies burst out in laughter. Sandy’s stories always 
           lighten up the room. KIM calls out from across the room.

                        Your husband’s a keeper. Better 
                        hang on to that one.

           Sandy fakes a smile, shaking her head. She’s hiding 
           something.

           BANG. 
                 e
           The door to the chemo room is THROWN open.

           In comes the TORNADO that is MARGARITA. She has blood 
           dripping down her knees. Sandy’s face drops. 
                       y
                                 MARGARITA 
                           (too loudly)
                        Hey ladies how’s it going. 
                             e
           Margarita walks straight towards Sandy. Sandy’s mood has 
           changed as the attention of the room switches to Margarita.

                                 SANDY
                        Hands-

           Margarita stops abruptly. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Ahhh...

           She gives herself a “I’m so stupid” clonk on the head. She 
           walks to the sink to wash her hands. 

           Margarita begins talking over the sink. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        So I was practicing my gallop-
                                                 g

                                 SANDY
                        -Face me when you’re talking-

           Margarita turns off the faucet. She wipes her hands on her 
           bike shorts, turning around to face Sandy. The other women 
           try to turn back to their reading.
                                 MARGARITA
                        So I was practicing-

                                 SANDY
                        -Practicing what?

                                 MARGARITA
                        -My galloping. I was on the 
                        treadmill and--

                           down)
                 e
                        I was on the treadmill going super 
                        fast which was good but I think my 
                        shoelace got caught in the thingy, 
                        I tripped and I fell and then blah!

           She points to her knees. She starts laughing.

                             e
                        But I didn’t even cry. You would 
                        have been proud...I just stood up I 
                        was like I’m good! I’m okay! And 
                        the guy at the gym came to check on 
                        me and I was like I’m good! 

           She keeps laughing. 

                                 SANDY
                        Did you say thank you?

           Margarita walks up to one of the framed paintings on the 
           wall. It’s a Thomas Kincaid style over-the-top flower-y 
           garden painting. She taps it.

                                 MARGARITA

                                 SANDY
                        Say thank you?

                                 MARGARITA
                        Yeah I think I said thank you. I 
                        liked the beach painting better. 
                        This one doesn’t fit right.

                                 DEBBIE
                           (smiling)
                        My mother painted that painting, 
                        Margarita. 
                                 MARGARITA
                        I don’t like it. I liked the beach 
                        painting more. Mom, after this can 
                        we get taquitos? 

           She scratches at her crotch. Most of the women can’t help but 
           watch at this point. Sandy motions at Margarita to stop.

           Margarita doesn’t catch the hint. She TROTS over to her mom.

                        So taquitos or no?

                        Sit down...your hair is in your 
                        face.
                 e
           Margarita sits down in front of Sandy as she begins to pull 
           Margarita’s hair into sections to braid. Margarita begins to 
           HUM under her breath. Her long red hair is pulled into a 
           braid.

           MARGARITA’s BRAID is complete. As we CIRCLE around her head, 
           we see NEON PINK AND BLUE LIGHTS reflecting on her face.

           Margarita chews with her mouth open. Her gaze is focused 
           intently forward.

           REVEAL a shitty karaoke stage in front of her. 

           Sandy and Margarita sit in a booth together at a hole-in-the-
           wall Mexican Restaurant.

           Margarita dips her taquito into sour cream, shoving the rest 
           of it in her mouth. Sour cream drips off the side of her 
           mouth. She wipes it with the back of her hand, dragging some 
           of it into her hair. 

           Sandy works on a plate of enchiladas next to her, not paying 
                                                 g
           any attention to the singer on stage. 

           All of a sudden, the SOUND of the ROOM floods in.

                        singing-
           Margarita abruptly stands up, walking straight for the stage. 
           She reaches the microphone, talking with her mouth up against 
           it. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        My name is Margarita and tonight I 
                        will be singing American Pie by the 
                        late great Don McLean. HIT IT. 

           She looks over at Sandy, giving a thumbs up. She hides her 
           nerves with overconfidence. 
        M

           Margarita closes her eyes, exhaling loudly. The crappy 
           KARAOKE TRACK crackles on. 

           Sandy takes a deep breath. Here we go. 
                 e
           Margarita’s voice comes in TOO LOUDLY and a beat too late. 
           She grips the mic, white knuckling it. She begins to do small 
           hand motions along with the song. 

           She knows it by heart. As the chorus begins to come in, she 
           eases up. 
                       y

           She takes the microphone off the stand and begins to strut 
           the stage, still nervous, but f e e l i n g it more. 
                             e
           A waiter walks to the table directly in front of the stage, 
           delivering tequila shots. About ten people at the large table 
           raise their shot glasses laughing loudly. 

           Margarita watches them, forgetting to keep singing.

           She looks over at Sandy, who motions for her to keep going. 
           Margarita’s face grows red. She’s overstimulated. She looks 
           back to the table of ten tequila takers. 
                                   r
                                       i
           She bonks a GIRL sitting at the table on the back of the head 
           with the microphone. 
                                          n
           THWUMP

           The girl turns around angrily. 
                                                 g
                                 GIRL
                        What the hell?

           Margarita throws her hands up in annoyance. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        I’m singing right now! You’re being 
                        rude, you don’t think you’re being 
                        rude right now? Cuz I think you 
                        are.
           Sandy drops her face into her hands.

                                                          CUT TO: 

           INT. MARGARITA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           HANDS DANCING, WRISTS ROLLING.

        M
           We follow the hands down to find Margarita. She’s fresh out 
           of the shower, hair wet, and in a horse night gown. She 
           interpretive dances as she watches the TV. Her interpretive 
           dancing includes galloping, contemporary, hip-hop, and ninja 
           movements. 

           A HORSE DOCUMENTARY from ANIMAL PLANET plays on the 
           television. Margarita talks along with it, almost word for 
           word.

                       NARRATOR
           Once the foal comes out, the 
           mare will chew on the 
           membranes and placenta to 
           prevent the foal from 
           suffocating and lick the 
           newborn foal to help blood 
           circulation.
                             e
           Sandy groans. She’s laying behind Margarita with a trash can 
           on the floor next to her. She looks nauseous. She breathes 
           in. 

                                 SANDY
                        Margs, can we watch something 
                        different? Please?

           Margarita continues to interpretive dance in front of the TV.

                        I don’t wanna watch horses giving 
                        birth...I can’t look at that right 
                        now. 
                                                 g

           She swallows hard. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        It’s not gross it’s the circle of 
                        life. 

           She does a slow spin as she sings. 
                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Circle of liiiiifeeee.

           Margarita spins FASTER. FASTER. FASTER.

           Her world SPINS.

                                 SANDY
                        Can I have the remote?

                        right now...woah woahwoahwoah- 

           Sandy squints, looking nauseous. She shuts her eyes.

                                 SANDY
                        Christ.
                 e

           Sandy rolls on her back shutting her eyes. A HORSE NEIGHS 
           loudly as SQUELCHES of FLUID FALL LOUDLY. Sandy puts her hand 
           over her mouth, suppressing vomit.
                       y
                                 MARGARITA
                        WOAHWOAHHHHHH

           Sandy puts her hands over her ears as the SQUELCHING NOISE 
           from the television plays as a horse gives birth. 
                             e

                                 SANDY
                        Will you change the fucKING CHANNEL-

           Margarita stops spinning all at once. The room continues to 
           SPIN in her VISION. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Why are you being such a bitch?

           Margarita is gearing up for a meltdown. She stomps, heading 
           straight for the front door.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        UGHHHHH!
                                                 g
           She THROWS the front door open and SLAMS it shut. The 
           NARRATOR’s VOICE continues on. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And just shortly after birth...the 
                        young horse is able to run.

           Sandy rolls over with a heave, grabbing the trash can.
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

           Margarita rides her bike out of town towards the stables. She 
           pedals fast. She listens to AMERICAN PIE in her headphones. 

           She sings really loudly and angrily off key. She cuts in and 
           out of singing between her panting.

        M
                                 MARGARITA

                        his...croooowwwnnn...

           She races past street lamps, her face flushed from the cold 
           night, her hair still wet from the shower.

           Finally, she brings herself to a stop with her feet on the 
           dirt path. She begins to walk her bike down a steep hill. 
                 e

           EXT. STABLES - NIGHT
                       y
           Margarita wades through the tall grass, dragging her bike 
           along through it. 

           She drops her bike, approaching a large wooden fence 
           surrounding some stables.
                             e
           She leans on to the fence. She WHISTLES out into the 
           darkness. Nothing. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Pssst. Hey! Hey! 

           She CLICKS her mouth. Finally, some HORSE HOOVES are heard 
           approaching from the distance. Margarita smiles. 
                                   r
                                       i
           She keeps her voice soft.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)

                        been a while...too long...I missed 
                        you. 
                                                 g
           A large brown horse approaches gently. Margarita reaches the 
           back of her hand out to the horse. It sniffs, then pushes 
           into her hand. She begins petting it.

           We’re back in HER WORLD.

           EXT. STABLES - NIGHT - MARGARITA'S WORLD.

           She feels the SOFT MUZZLE. The WARM BREATH of the HORSE. 
           She SEES the GLASSY EYES that stare back at her.

           FIREFLIES glow around her, swirling in little bulbs of light.

           She strokes the horse’s muzzle over and over again. She 
           slowly leans her head onto the horse, connecting her face 
           with the muzzle. 

           She takes in a deep breath, closing her eyes. Holding for a 
           moment longer. Her world feels peaceful and still. 

        M
           She puts her hands up, curling her wrists, beginning to dance 
           again. Her movements are soft and contemporary. The music in 
           her head CRESCENDOS.

           Her world is full of beautiful LIGHT and SOUND.
                 e
           Suddenly, a mans VOICE SHOUTS out in the darkness from the 
           stables, breaking out of MARGARITA’S WORLD.

                                 VOICE
                        Hey! You can’t be petting the 
                        horses...This is private property!
                       y

           Margarita, startled, yells back defensively. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Oh my goddd I’m going, I’m going...
                             e

           She turns to go then yells back. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        It’s a free country though!

           A SHOTGUN RINGS out into the sky. Margarita SCREAMS and 
           laughs, toppling over the fence.
                                          n
           She grabs her bike from the grass, awkwardly running it back 
           up the hill she came down.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)

           EXT. SMALL TOWN STREETS - NIGHT

           Margarita pedals back, BREATHING hard. She passes closed 
           shops, her silhouette illuminated under the street lamps. A 
           few cars pass by as she rides. 
           Suddenly, Margarita brings her feet to a stop on the pavement 
           with a loud SKID. 

           She stops outside of a DANCE STUDIO. The lights are still on. 
           A large front facing window illuminates the street with it’s 
           bright tungsten lights. 

           Many awkward and lanky bodies move inside of the dance 
           studio, bouncing shadows off the street from where Margarita 
           watches.

        M
           Her eyes are wide with curiosity as she watches the girls 
           inside.

           INT. DANCE STUDIO - NIGHT

           IN SLOW MOTION:
                 e

           Pre-pubescent girls ages thirteen to fifteen-ish gallop 
           around the dance studio. Each girl has her own horse head 
           attached to a wooden stick between her legs. 
                       y
           They mimic the horse movements as they gallop back and forth 
           across the studio. 

           It’s an epic display of awkward as the girls practice 
           galloping, leaping, and sprinting across the studio.

           MARG POV: CLOSE on details of:

           Tiny cami tank tops, booty shorts with tights, and leotards. 
           Wide smiles filled with braces. 

           COACH, a large 50-something year old man with a beer belly 
           and white-gray beard, stands at the front of the room as the 
           girls gallop about.

           He CALLS out commands to them as they move in synchronism 
           across the floor, clapping his hands in time to the music. 

           COACH, after a moment, notices Margarita’s face peering into 
           the window. He catches her gaze. 
                                                 g
           Margarita, once entranced, realizes that she’s been spotted. 
           As quickly as she can she mounts her bike, pushing off, and 
           takes off into the night.

           INT. MARGARITAS HOME - NIGHT

           Margarita comes to a stop on her bike. 
                                 MARGARITA
                        Woahhh...

           She talks like it’s a real horse. She sets it down on the 
           dirt in the front yard. She walks up to the porch.

           From the window she sees Sandy at the kitchen table, deep in 
           thought. She runs a hand back and forth through her hair. 

           Margarita watches her mother. She’s never seen her look 
           fragile like this. She opens the front door.

           Margarita walks in loudly, kicking off her shoes into the 
           shoe closet. Sandy looks up quickly, snapping out of her 
           daze. She gathers some receipts and coupons into a pile that 
           she was looking at.

                                 SANDY

                        Are you mad at me? I don’t want 
                        another job. People are always mean 
                        to me.

           She sits down at the table.

                        It’s zero. There’s zero things in 
                        it. That’s why it’s Coke Zero. Why 
                        are you mad at me?

                        I didn’t say I was mad at you.

                        I can just tell.

           Margarita stands up and starts playing with Sandy’s hair. 
           Sandy shuts her eyes.

                        You should get bangs. 

           She holds up a chunk of hair to shape bangs around her face.

                             e
                        That would be something. I think 
                        you need to get back out there. Get 
                        a job. Be independent. It will 
                        really help us right now Margs.

                        Maybe I can work at the stables.

                        If I get a job can I take riding 
                        lessons?

           As Margarita plays with her hair, she notices a large bit of 
           hair stays behind in her fingers. She stares at it.
                                 SANDY

                        here. At home. With me. 

           Margarita is fixated on the loose hair in her hands. She 
           thinks for a moment, then, gently places it back on her mom’s 
           head.

           Margarita brushes her teeth. Sandy sits on the toilet reading 
           a magazine. Margarita spits. A large glob of spit lands in 
           her hair. 

                                 MARGARITA

           Margarita’s bedroom is lined with HORSE POSTERS, HORSE 
           CALENDARS, her bed is filled with PLUSH HORSES. 

           Margarita gets into bed, carefully maneuvering around each 
           horse as to not knock any off the bed.  

           Sandy stands by the door, hand hovering over the light 
           switch.

           Margarita lies awake, staring at the ceiling. Car headlights 
           from the streets below bounce across her wall.

           Margarita watches the lights go past and disappear into the 
           darkness. Slowly, the plush horses around her bed begin to 
           float, as if the whole room has lost gravity. 

           Margarita begins to lift out of her bed. She closes her eyes, 
           smiling as she drifts off into sleep, floating above her bed.

           Margarita’s face. 

           Margarita stands outside the dance studio she spied on the 
           night before. She’s straddling her bike, gripping the handles 
                                                 g
           tightly. 

           Inside the studio, the same girls are stretching in 
           synchronized movements. COACH, the large man from last night, 
           is at the front of the room calling out movements yet again.  

           She musters all her courage as she grabs the door handle and-

           YANKS. 
           The door doesn’t budge. It makes a CLATTER as she tries again 
           to open it. Every head turns to look at her. 

           Margarita, flustered, notices a sign above the door. “PUSH”.

           INT. DANCE STUDIO - CONTINUOUS 

           She pushes, walking straight into the dance room. Every pair 
           of eyes is now on her. Her confidence has entirely left her. 
           She looks around the room uncomfortably. 
        M

                                 COACH
                        Can I help you? 

           He calls out over the music. Margarita, terrified, just looks 
           around, taking in the room.
                 e
           A couple of the girls snicker while the rest continue to 
           stare. Margarita looks around at them. Their laughter feels 
           amplified. She yells out over the music.

           and direct.
                             e
                                 COACH

           Margarita points out to the girls. She starts to get 
           frustrated by Coach. 

                                 MARGARITA

                        know. 

           The girls all laugh. Most of them are ass-kissers. Margaritas 
           eyes are beginning to fill with embarrassed tears. She 
           fidgets slightly.

                        it? Next time no swearing.
           Coach turns to look back at the girls, not paying any 
           attention to Margarita. Margarita is annoyed.

           She stands a foot above the girls, sticking out like a sore 
           thumb. 

           Coach calls out over to the girls, snapping them back to 
           attention.

           back harshly, yanking it back into a bun.

           The girls heads turn as they all stare at Margarita. 

           Margarita looks down at her legs, for the first time noticing 
           the thick, dark hair on her legs.

                                 COACH
                        Ladies, get your horses.
           All the girls stand up running to the back of the room.  
           Their horses hang on the racks on the wall. Margarita 
           follows. She grabs a horse off the rack.

           She gives the horse to Jean Marie who yanks it from her hand. 
           All the horses are gone. The girls continue to stare at her.

           The girls run to a corner of the room, forming a line.

           He continues to watch Margarita as she pedals away down the 
           street.

           EXT. MARGARITA’S HOME - FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

           Margarita chucks her bike down. She storms in the house. 
           INT. MARGARITA'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           She walks straight past the bathroom door where Sandy stands 
           at the counter.  Both barely notice each other. 

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sandy stares at herself in the mirror. Margarita RUSTLES 
           through drawers in the kitchen.

           Margarita begins to pull Cheeseburger’s head off the bike. 
           She yanks and saws at it with the scissors. She GRUNTS loudly 
           as she does it, taking out all her frustrations.

           She finally RIPS the head off. She holds it in her hands.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sandy opens a drawer in the bathroom. Men’s deodorant, nail 
           clippers, hair gel, and an electric razor. 
                             e
           Sandy takes the cap off the deodorant, smelling it. She 
           instantly smells her husband. 

           She opens her eyes, looking at herself in the mirror. Stupid. 
           She caps it and places it back in the drawer. She takes out 
           the electric razor. It BUZZES to life as she turns it on.

           Sandy takes a large swipe across the center of her head. She 
           stares at herself, trying to feel any emotion. Nothing. She 
           swipes again. Still nothing. 

           She rubs her freshly shaved patches, rubbing her hands over 
           the loose bits of hair that fall off. 

           SLAM.
           Margarita storms in holding the new and improved Cheeseburger 
           in her hand. Sandy turns to see her standing in the doorway. 

                                 SANDY
                        What did you do to Cheeseburger? 

           Margarita doesn’t answer, she’s stopped dead in her tracks. 
           She furrows her eyebrows at her mom. 

                                 MARGARITA

           Sandy looks back at herself in the mirror. She laughs a

           She raises the razor above her head. Margarita drops 
           Cheeseburger. She charges forward trying to knock the razor 
           out of her hands.

                                 MARGARITA

           Margarita wrestles the razor out of Sandy’s hands. Sandy 
           fights back.

                        You look ugly- you look ugly! I 
                        HATE it.

           Sandy turns off the BUZZING razor. She looks Margarita 
           directly in the eyes.
                                 SANDY
                        You really think I look ugly? 

           Margarita is breathing hard, shaking. Her fists are balled 
           up. Her eyebrows are furrowed. She tries not to cry.

                                 MARGARITA
                        I don’t like you without hair.

           She looks up at herself in the mirror. She still has large 
           chunks of hair on her head. 

           She breathes out of her nose, laughing a little. 

           A beat.

           Margarita looks up. She looks at her mom in the mirror.

           Sandy laughs harder. She runs her hand through a chunk of her 
           hair.

                             e
                        Should I keep it like this? 

           She laughs again. It feels good. She snorts. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        No...

           She laughs again, leaning on the counter. Margarita cracks a 
           smile. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        You look like one of those ugly 
                        dogs that win the ugly dog contest.

           Sandy bursts into a deep, deep laugh. Margarita laughs with 
           her. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Can I try? 

           Sandy hands over the razor.
                                 SANDY
                        Just be careful, don’t put your 
                        fingers near the blades. 

           It BUZZES to life again. Margarita jumps a little. She 
           nervously reaches towards her moms head. She gently runs the 
           razor over one of the patches with hair. 

        M
                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        That’s good. Yeah, just like that. 
                        You can press down a little more it 
                        doesn’t hurt. 

           Margarita swipes another large chunk of hair off Sandy’s 
           head. Very quietly, she talks. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        I’ll get a job.

           To the two figures in the bathroom. Sandy puts her hand on

           leaks through the crack of the door and spills across the 
           living room. 

           The BUZZ of the RAZOR is heard. Margarita HUMS from inside 
           the bathroom. 
           EXT. THE BEST HALLOWEEN STORE - NEXT DAY 

           Margarita stands outside a janky-looking Halloween store. 
           Just a large NEON BANNER stands as a sign above the door. 

           “BEST HALLOWEEN STORE...NOW OPEN!!!”

           A “NOW HIRING” sign is hung up directly below it.

           Margarita wears a turtleneck underneath a denim dress, and 
           striped leggings. Her fluffy hair is pulled back in a 
           headband.

           She clutches a piece of paper in her hand. She turns around 
           nervously to look at Sandy who sits in the minivan parked out 
           front. Sandy has a scarf around her head.

           Sandy gives her a thumbs up. Margarita nods, giving her a 
           shaky “rock on” sign. Sandy motions to her cheeks to smile. 
           Margarita forces a smile. Not her best smile.

           costumes, masks, boxes, and accessories. Every aisle is 
           overflowing with unorganized Halloween paraphernalia. 

           Margarita timidly walks through the store. She sees SUMMER, a 
           girl with heavy eye makeup and straightened side bangs, 
           hanging up costumes on racks.

                        that.

           Summer is putting in headphones.

                                 SUMMER
                        Okay.

           Summer turns back to hanging clothes as if Margarita isn’t 
           there. Margarita nods, giving a slight wave, then waddles her 
           way down the store aisles. 
                 e

           She looks down an aisle- an animatronic ghoul lights up, 
           giving a robotic CACKLE. 
                       y
           Margarita JUMPS, then laughs. She points at it, laughing. She 
           looks around to see if anyone else saw. She laughs again, 
           amused by the moving ghoul with light up eyes. 

                             e
           She continues on down the aisle, looking at the different 
           halloween decor. She spots a small Indian man in a vest, 
           HANK, walking quickly past an aisle looking at a clipboard. 

           Margarita follows after him. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Excuse me...excuse me...

           He’s distracted, looking at his clipboard. His walkie RINGS. 
           He takes it off his hip.

                        inventory. 

                                 MARGARITA

                                                 g
           He turns around, confused how she knows his name. He looks at 
           her, still holding his walkie. 

                                 HANK
                        Can I help you?

                                 MARGARITA
                        Oh hey, I was wondering if I could 
                        work here? 
                                 HANK
                        What? 

           She holds up her resume to him. He looks down at it then back 
           up at her. He takes it from her hands. 

                                 HANK (CONT'D)
                        I...Sorry...Did you...email me an

                        No. 

           He looks at her again.

                 e
                        Normally, I need applicants to fill 
                        out an online application first 
                        then we can set up an interview.  

           His walkie RINGS again. He answers.

                        Yeah, sorry I’m on my way. 

           He begins to walk.

           Margarita follows after him, trotting to keep up. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Well I’m already here so I figured 
                        we could just interview now.

           He keeps walking. He tries to shake her off as he walks 
           faster.

                        Yeah, like the drink. My mom and 
                        dad named me after it because they 
                        were super drunk on margaritas the 
                        night they conceived me.

                        Wait, look at this!

           Hank turns to look and sees that Margarita is walking back 
           down the aisle they came from. 

           She heads straight towards a MOTHER and SON looking down the 
           aisles of the HALLOWEEN DECOR.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Wait, did you guys see this one? 
                        Look, look. 

                 e
           She walks up to the ANIMATRONIC GHOUL. She walks in front of 
           the GHOUL. It LIGHTS UP and CACKLES. She JUMPS, grabbing at 
           her chest in genuine fear.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                       y
                        Ah! See isn’t that great? You could 
                        put it by your door and it could 
                        scare trick-or-treaters. It’s so 
                        awesome. I think I’m gonna buy it 
                        for my house. Look at it’s eyes! 
                        Did you see the eyes?
                             e
           The Mother, LISA, is laughing. DANNY (6, small with huge 
           glasses), excitedly looks up at her. 

                                 DANNY
                        Can we buy it?

           Margarita is walking past it again as it LIGHTS UP and 
           CACKLES. Margarita jumps with excitement yet again.

           Hank watches with his jaw dropped. Danny is trying to lift 
           the animatronic ghoul. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Here, got it? I can help. 
           Margarita lifts up the ghoul, it’s still moving and CACKLING 
           in her arms. She walks straight up to Hank.

           She turns to start, then turns back to Hank with another 
           idea.

           She walks towards the front of the store. As Danny and Lisa 
           pass, Lisa jokes to Hank.

           Hank watches as the three of them parade to the front of the 
           store. He jogs after them, calling out.

           street. Sandy watches her, slightly embarrassed.

           A couple walking down the street holding hands lets go as she 
           gallops right through them.

                        Excuse me...Are you the manager?

           Hank turns around to see Sandy. His eyes dart to the scarf 
           wrapped on her head. He looks back to her.  

                                 HANK
                        I am. Hank-
           He reaches his hand out to shake her hand. Sandy doesn’t 
           shake. 

                                 SANDY
                        It’s okay, I...my daughter was just 
                        in here. Her name is Margarita.

                                 HANK
                        Yes, she’s quite the saleswoman.

           Sandy nods, giving a polite fake laugh.
        M

                                 SANDY
                        Yes. She...I think you need to know 
                        she is a very capable young woman.

                                 HANK
                           (genuinely)
                 e
                        Yes, that’s why I hired her.

           Hank begins to move down the aisle, continuing to hang up 
           masks as Sandy talks. Sandy moves with him.
                       y
                                 SANDY
                        She’s very smart...she actually has 
                        a college degree.

                                 HANK
                             e
                        That’s wonderful.

           Sandy continues to shuffle down the aisle as Hank organizes.

                        Just, make sure you’re clear with 
                        instructions...and she doesn’t 
                        really pick up on sarcasm...She 
                        also may need to have things 
                        explained a couple of times and if 
                        you give her a chance she can do 
                        the register. She can talk back but 
                        she’s not being disrespectful, she 
                        just speaks her mind. 

                                 HANK

                        Ma’am, I have no doubt your 
                        daughter is a hard worker. You 
                        shouldn’t worry about her. She’ll 
                        be fine.

                                 SANDY
                        I’m not worried.

           Her face says otherwise. Folding her arms. Hank turns back to 
           her once more. 
                                 HANK
                        You should be very proud of her. 

           Sandy nods with a polite smile.

                        Have a good day. 

        M
           He walks back down the aisle and turns the corner, 
           disappearing from sight. Sandy adjusts her scarf self-
           consciously. Deep in thought, she looks down at the GHOUL on 
           the floor. It sits unmoving.

           EXT. SMALL TOWN STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Margarita, still GALLOPING on Cheeseburger, begins to slow as 
           she sees the dance studio. She takes a deep breath. 
                 e

           She YANKS the door. CLATTER. She remembers. She PUSHES.

           INT. DANCE STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
                       y

           Inside, most of the girls are huddled up talking. Margarita 
           places Cheeseburger onto the back rack holding the horses. 
                             e
           It rolls off, hitting the floor with a CLACK. All the girls 
           turn to stare at Margarita. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        It’s fine! I’m fine!

           She reaches up to place Cheeseburger on the highest rack.
                                   r
                                       i
           She takes off her ankle-length dress, still leaving the 
           turtleneck on. She pulls her leggings off, struggling to get 
           them over her large sneakers. The girls all watch.
                                          n
           From beneath the dress and leggings, she reveals a pair of 
           tiny short-shorts underneath. Her legs are covered in band-
           aids and scabs from shaving. 

           She shoves the dress and leggings into her horse tote. She 
           yanks a wedgie out of her butt. 
                                                 g

           Her short shorts say “BOOTYLICIOUS” on the back of them. 

           She pulls her hair back into a messy pony with a scrunchie.

           All the girls continue to stare. Margarita walks towards 
           them. 
                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        So what are your guys’ names? 

           No one answers. She points at one of the girls, PINKY. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        What’s your name? 

           Pinky looks at the girls, laughing a little. 

                                 PINKY
        M
                        My name is Pinky. It’s not my real 
                        name but Coach gave me a nickname 
                        because I have pink streaks in my 
                        hair, see? 

           She points to her clip in streaks. 
                 e
                                 MARGARITA
                        Those are awesome. Are they real?

                                 PINKY
                           (lying confidently)
                       y
                        Yeah. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Oh...they look 
                        like...they’re...not.
                             e

           Margarita reaches out for her head. Pinky quickly throws her 
           hands onto her hair.

                                 PINKY
                        Don’t touch them! 

           She looks at Margarita, confused by her forwardness.

                                       i

                                          n
           Margarita laughs uncomfortably. Pinky folds her arms.

                                 PINKY
                                                 g
                        Yeah...Coach only gave me a 
                        nickname though. Everyone else just 
                        goes by their real names. 

           Pinky begins to go down the line, pointing at each of the 
           girls as she says their names. 
                                 PINKY (CONT'D)

                        Kristina, Paige, Jess, Melissa,

                        Madeline is here but she threw up 
                        at Best Buy yesterday so I don’t 
                        think she’s coming.

        M
           Margarita nods, awkwardly smiling and waving at each of them 
           as they’re introduced. She waits for them to ask her name. 
           They don’t. 

           Silence.

                                 MARGARITA

                        the drink...you know... 
                        margaritas...because they were 
                        drinking them the night they 
                        conceived me.

           Some of the girls giggle, others gasp. Pinky is eating it up. 
           She puts her hand over her mouth dramatically. Her eyes widen 
           as she looks back at the other girls who all mimic her 
           reaction in some form.

           She looks around giggling, amping up the other girls. She 
           looks down at Margarita’s legs.

                        Oh...I just...fell down...like a

           Pinky sees right through it.

                        Ohhh...I thought you just didn’t

           The girls laugh again. Margarita joins in with the laughing, 
           going along with it. She laughs extra loud.

                        Why is that funny?

           All the girls look, waiting for an answer. Sarah M. Stares at 
           her looking hurt.

           Suddenly, the door PUSHES open. Coach walks in, immediately 
           changing the tone of the room. His HEAVY BOOTS THUD across 
           the wooden floor.

           All the girls turn, facing the mirror, spreading out quickly.

           Margarita watches him. 

                                 COACH
                        Don’t waste my time...I let you 
                        come in early to stretch, I wanna 
                        see you stretching not chatting, 
                        girls. 
           He heads straight to the front of the room where the CD 
           player connected to a speaker sits. He pulls a CD out of his 
           book bag, setting it into the player. 

           MUSIC BURSTS through the SPEAKERS. All the girls immediately 
           begin to stretch in synchronism. Margarita covers her ears in 
           reaction. She looks around, slowly lowering her hands. 

           Coach looks at her, shouting over the music.

        M
                        Welcome back, Red. 

           Pinky immediately looks up, throwing her an angry look. 
           Margarita smiles, she nods, giving a small wave. He motions 
           to her.

                 e
                        Come here.

           Margarita walks over to him. He pulls out a coffee stained 
           folder filled with loose papers. He finds the paper he’s 
           looking for, flipping it to the top. 
                       y

           CLOSE UP ON:

           Margarita begins to scribble her name on the line. She pauses 
           at the column AGE(12-18)

           She scratches 18. 

           She hands the folder back to him. He looks down at it, then 
           looks back at her. He looks back to the sheet and begins to

                        competition next month. I need more 
                        in my upper division. Sound good?

           Margarita, completely zoned out and not catching a word.

                                 MARGARITA
                        Okay.

           He motions to the rest of the girls warming up.

           Margarita looks around. All the girls are running in place. 
           She holds her boobs as she runs in place. Coach looks away.

           Coach nods. They bend down to touch their toes. Margarita 
           catches on (slightly) quicker this time.

           All the girls run to the back of the room, grabbing their 
           horses off the rack. Margarita runs too, pulling down 
           Cheeseburger. She reaches over half the girls to the top 
           shelf. 

           The girls split in half, lining up at opposite diagonals of 
           the room. Margarita tries to mesh in line.

           She heads to the back of the line. Coach places a wooden 
           crate in the middle of the room.

           One after the other, alternating from opposite sides of the 
           room, the girls trot on their horses and hurdle over the box.

           Each girl lands it. 

           Margarita watches intently. Her turn approaches quickly. She 
           awkwardly run-trots and stops at the box. She disrupts the 
           flow. She looks at Coach.

                                 COACH (CONT'D)

                        Hang on...I’m gonna try again.

           She runs backwards back to the line. She gears up again. 

                                 RACHAEL
                        Hurry up!

           She turns back, furrowing her brows. She runs straight at the 
           box. She jumps too early, her feet hit the box. It slides. 
           She falls to the floor.

           BOOM.

           Margarita looks up at him, slightly shell shocked from the 
           fall. She looks at her hands that are stinging. She slowly 
           gets back up. Cheeseburger’s head hangs loosely off the pole.

           Margarita limps to the back of the line, trying to hide her 
           pain. One of the scabs on her legs has opened back up.

           She smears the blood off with her hands, then wipes it on her 
           shorts.

           She looks down at Cheeseburger, assessing the damage. She 
           attempts to re-tape it. Pinky leans into her ear.

                           (defensive)
                        Yeah okay I will, hop off.
           Margarita’s face is red with embarrassment and frustration. 
           She puts her hands over the tape, trying to hide it. She 
           turns back to the room as it SLOWS DOWN.

           in her horse tote bag. 

           She reaches the fences to the stables. She takes Cheeseburger 
           out of her bag, chucking her on the ground. 

           She crumples to her knees. She begins to hit herself in the 
           head with her fists.

           She looks up to see her large brown horse staring at her with 
           it’s gigantic glassy eyes. It’s warm breath is visible in the 
           cool air.

           She looks up at it. The horse is unmoving. It stares at her. 

           Margarita stands to her feet. She walks towards the horse 
           slowly. She wipes the snot on the back of her sleeve.

           She gently walks towards the horse, stretching her hand out 
           to pet it. She brings her head right up to it’s muzzle. She 
           leans in, closing her eyes.

           She looks over at a crate near the fence. She drags it out 
           from under the wooden fence. Taking a deep breath, she backs 
           up, running straight for the box. 

           She LEAPS over it. She lands. She turns back to go again.

           beanie and her husbands sweatshirt. She’s bundled in a

           Margarita cautiously walks forward, trudging up the steps to 
           the porch. She opens up the front door, speaking quickly.
                                 MARGARITA
                        I told you I was riding around.

           Sandy stands up, following after her. Margarita doesn’t hold 
           the screen door, it SLAMS shut in Sandy’s face.

           Sandy moves into the fridge, shoving Margarita out of the 
           way. She pulls out a large glass Tupperware.

           She SLAMS a plate onto the counter. She rips off a sticky 
           note from the Tupperware. It reads “The Rigoli’s are praying 
           for you”.
           She rips open the foil, taking a giant wad of cold lasagna 
           with her bare hands and chucks it on to the plate in a messy 
           heap.

           Margarita, eyes on her mom, lifts the plate up, carrying it 
           over to the microwave. She places the plate inside, shutting 
           the door. She feels Sandy’s eyes on her back.

           She types in a number and hits ENTER. The microwave BEEPS 
           back.

           She stares at Margarita. Margarita stares back. The MICROWAVE 
           still WHIRS as the lasagna spins inside. 

           Neither move.

           Finally, Margarita turns around. She gets her tote bag from 
           the kitchen table. She pulls out a plastic bag from it, 
           dropping it on the table.

                                 MARGARITA
                        I got you a present. 

           Margarita walks out of the kitchen. A moment later, her 
           bedroom door SLAMS shut.
           A beat.

           Sandy walks over to the plastic bag on the floor. Inside is a 
           blue bobbed wig. Sandy holds it up in her hands.

           BEEEEEP. The microwave dings.

           Sandy wears the blue wig. She looks straight ahead at the 
           road.

           Margarita is nodding off in the car, her mouth hanging open. 
           Her head hits the window with a CLUNK-

           arms are folded. She kicks her feet forcefully.

           She faces away from her mom, still mad at her. A friendly 
           looking nurse comes out to the waiting room in bright scrubs.

                        It’s fucking Margarita GOD.

           She storms past the nurse down the hall. Sandy follows 
           behind, too tired to care about Margarita’s behavior.

           Margarita sits on the paper-covered table. She shifts 
           uncomfortably. She stares at the wall of mediocre paintings 
           of butterflies and trees. She imagines them FLYING AWAY, 
           LIFTING off the wall.

           DR. LELAND, a thin man with a long hook nose is writing down 
           things on a clipboard.

           Sandy pulls out her pocket calendar from her purse. She puts 
           on her reading glasses. Margarita stares at the wall.

                        Maybe the fifth. But if it was it 
                        was probably light.

           Dr. Leland writes it down.

                        that?

           wall.

           Margarita shakes her head no. Her arms are folded across her 
           chest.
                             e

                        stools isn’t uncommon for her. 

           Dr. Leland gives a nod. He finishes up scribbling on his 
           clipboard. He stands up, heading towards Margarita.

           As he approaches her with the tool, Margarita shoves him 
           away. Dr. Leland stumbles backwards.

                        you. 

           He laughs again politely. Margarita breathes hard. Her fists 
           ball up tightly. She squirms on the table. She looks back to 
           the butterflies. They’re stagnant on the wall.
                                 DR. LELAND (CONT'D)

                        the hard part over with first,

                        No. 

           The doctor laughs a bit. He turns to a drawer, opening it. He 
           pulls out a needle and extracts medicine from a small vile.

           Margarita crawls backward on to the table, shrinking into a 
           ball in the corner.

           The doctor suddenly becomes stern. Sandy is livid and stands 
           to her feet.

                                 DR. LELAND

           stretches out the skin on her forearm. Margarita flails an 
           arm loose. It whacks Sandy in the face.

                        Oh thank you, I love yours. 

           Sandy gives a coy smile and shrug at Margarita. Margarita is

           so incredibly fast, and so free. Her smile overtakes her 
           face.

           EXT. DANCE STUDIO - DUSK

           Margarita arrives outside the dance studio, SCREECHING to a

           with their bags and horses. Coach is locking up the studio.

           Lacey struggles to put mascara on Sandy’s non-existent 
           eyelashes. Lacey is a bit of an air-head in an endearing way.

           All the girls nervously gather on the side of the arena. It’s 
           large and empty. Their sneakers SQUEAK on the gym floor. 
           Coach stands in the center of the arena.

           His voice ECHOES through the vast arena. Margarita whispers 
           to Jean Marie.

           The girls line up. Pinky is first. (Of course). Margarita 
           takes her place in the back. She steps in a wad of gum.

           She stretches her shoe up as the gum string out from the 
           floor. She’s distracted by the gum.

                        standing between you and winning, 
                        is yourself.

                        She was our old coach. She’s 
                        Coach’s wife.

           Margarita looks at Coach. She never thought about him as a 
           person with an outside life. 

           Pinky SHUSHES Jean Marie and Margarita. Margarita furrows her 
           brow, looking at Coach.

           Silence.

           Coach begins to PROJECT, taking up the stadium with his 
           BOOMING voice.

                        space, you can’t win your 
                        competition. Who’s first?

           The girls laugh, embarrassed. Pinky steps up bravely. She 
           stands in the center of the gym. She looks around. 
                                                 g

           Pinky gives a girly shriek. She immediately covers her face 
           laughing. All the girls giggle nervously. Coach presses on.
                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        That’s not a scream. Come on! 
                        Scream. Scream.

           Rachael, next in line, shuts her eyes and lets out a tiny 
           YELP. Rachael bursts into giggles. Coach turns towards them.

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        Come on now...Red. Come here.

           Margarita emerges from the line nervously. She drags her shoe 
           on the floor, still trying to get the gum off.

           gymnasium. The lights in the gym FLICKER and CHANGE COLORS.

           All the girls jaws are dropped. Coach watches Margarita 
           intently. 
           Margarita finishes screaming. The last bits of her voice ECHO 
           throughout the gym. The lights return to their normal 
           tungsten.

           She opens her eyes, coming back into the room. She blinks a 
           couple of times. Coach smiles, looking to the rest of the

           Margarita stands up, running over to Sandy’s face. She tries 
           to yank her hands off her face. Sandy tries with all her 
           might to hide her face.

           Sandy stares at Margarita for a long time, taking her in. She 
           smiles. Margarita gently runs her fingers along Sandy’s smile

                        She’s not here today! 

                                 SANDY
                        Yes she is. I dropped her off this 
                        morning. Is...Hank around? 
           Summer appears from one of the aisles, holding a large box. 

                                 SUMMER
                        Who are you looking for? 

                                 SANDY
                        Margarita. I’m her mom. I-

                                 SUMMER
                        -Ohhhh right. She said you had 
                        cancer. 
        M

           Sandy is caught off guard. Summer takes a headphone out of 
           her ear. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT'D)

                        Yeah, Margarita doesn’t work on 
                        Thursdays because of her horse 
                        thing. 

                                 SANDY
                        Her what?

                        You know...her thing at the dance 
                        studio with the girls and the 
                        horses on sticks. 
                             e
           Sandy is silent. She stares at Summer. 

                                 SUMMER (CONT'D)
                           (realizing)
                        Oh shit you don’t know.

                                       i
           Margarita stands in the line as each of the girls gallop and 
           jump over a real rod-obstacle.
                                          n
           This time, Margarita clears the jump perfectly, and doesn’t 
           disrupt the flow. She smiles to herself. 

           Jean Marie holds up her hand for Margarita to high five it. 
                                                 g
           Margarita, confused by the gesture, takes a second, then goes 
           to high five her. 

           Jean Marie pulls her hand away.

                                 JEAN MARIE
                        Too slow!

           A couple of the girls laugh. Margarita laughs along with them 
           innocently.
           Coach CLAPS his hands together to get the girls to spread out 
           and face the mirror. 

                                 COACH
                        Performance piece, let’s go. 

           All the girls line up in formation. As the music begins, the 
           girls start their contemporary dances with their horses.

           Margarita is in the zone.

        M
           From outside the studio window a minivan SCREECHES up to the 
           sidewalk. Sandy storms up to the studio, looking into the 
           window. She presses her face against the glass. She watches 
           as the girls all raise the horses up. 

                                 SANDY
                           (muffled from outside the

                           window)
                        SHIT!

           Sandy storms up to the door, pushing it open. 
                       y

                             e
           All of the girls heads turn to see SANDY standing at the back 
           of the studio, stunned. Margarita turns around, her face 
           drops. 

                                 COACH
                        Can I help yo-

           Sandy stomps straight towards Margarita. The girls part from 
           her path like the Red Sea. 

                                 SANDY

                        in two weeks. Two.Weeks. What is 
                        this? Why have you been lying to 
                        me?

                                 MARGARITA
                        No, mom, it was a surprise because 
                        I was gonna compete in the 
                        competition and you would be really 
                        proud of me!

                        You said I could ride a fake horse.

           Sandy looks around at the girls. She looks up at Coach. Coach 
           hits pause on the speaker system as the room drops to 
           uncomfortable silence.

                                 SANDY
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 MARGARITA
                        That’s Coach, mom. 

           Sandy marches right up to him. He towers over her. 

                                 SANDY
                        What on earth have you been doing 
                        with my daughter? 
                 e

           Coach calmly explains in the same level voice.

                        We’re just practicing for our 
                        hobbyhorsing competition. Your 
                        daughter is a great addition to our 
                        team. You should watch her, I think 
                        you’d be quite impressed with-

                        tell me that. I don’t need another 
                        man pretending to see the potential 
                        in my retarded daughter.

                        BE.QUIET. 

           Sandy whirls back around to face Coach. Her voice is low and 
           shaky. She jabs a boney finger into his large chest.

                        say anything to me about how 
                        inspiring my daughter is. You wanna 
                        play horsie for an hour with her? 
                        That’s fine. But don’t act like you 
                        know her better than me.

                        you don’t say anything.

           Margarita has begun to cry into her hands. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Mom. Mom please. 

           Coach nods his head solemnly.

                        Okay. I hear you. Thank you. 

           Sandy wasn’t expecting his response. She studies him. She 
           turns back around to all the girls watching with wide eyes. 
           Margarita stands a foot over them, crying into her hands. 
                 e
           Sandy turns back around to look at Coach. She sighs.

                                 SANDY
                        She...She’s twenty-six. 
                       y
           She drops her arms at her side, shaking her head. She turns 
           to Margarita. Some of the girls are looking at Margarita. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)

                        No please. Mom please. I wanna stay 
                        and I wanna compete. I have to 
                        compete. I paid the money to

                        realize...you can’t compete if 
                        you’re that old.

           Margarita’s face drops into a bigger upset.
                                                 g

                        Please.Please.Please.Please.

           Some of the girls are whispering as Sandy grabs Margarita by 
           the arm, firmly. Margarita continues to beg like a child. 
                                 SANDY
                        You don’t say a WORD. Don’t ever 
                        give ANYONE your money-

           Sandy is already yanking her out the door. Coach watches the 
           two. He calls out to her.

           Sandy looks up at him with a “How dare you?” Look. She just 
           shakes her head in disgust, and pulls Margarita out the door.

           Margarita is slapping herself in the head repeatedly as she 
           cries. Her sobs are guttural. Sandy starts the car, throwing 
           it into drive.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Margarita is getting her arm wrapped in a cast. She sits 
           motionless, staring ahead at the television. ANIMAL PLANET 
           plays on the old television hanging on the wall.

                        Horses' anatomy enables them to 
                        make use of speed to escape 
                        predators and they have a well-
                        developed sense of balance and a 
                        strong fight-or-flight response.

           NURSE ROSE, 30-something with a round face, smiles as she 
           continues wrapping. 
                 e

                        before. 

           Margarita looks at her, annoyed for interrupting.

           Margarita looks down at her cast. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Do I get to pick a color for this

           Margarita picks up a plastic juice cup, throwing it back.

           From two curtains down, Sandy receives stitches on a deep 
           gash above her eyebrow. She looks absent. Some yellow bruises 
                                                 g
           have already begun to form around her eye. 

           A gentle KNOCK from the doorway. 

           Sandy turns to see Dr. Pacek in the doorway. She’s smiling 
           warmly. 

                                 DR. PACEK
                        You just couldn’t stay away could 
                        you? 
           Sandy closes her eyes. A small smile lifts on the corners of 
           her mouth. 

                                 SANDY
                        Apparently not.

           Dr. Pacek walks into the room, taking a seat on the bed next 
           to Sandy. The Nurse stitching her up cuts the stitch, tying 
           it off. 

           Dr. Pacek inspects Sandy’s cut. 
        M

                                 DR. PACEK 
                        You really did some work didn’t 
                        you? Think she’s gonna make it?

           Dr. Pacek nods over to the nurse who finished her stitches. 
           The nurse nods, cleaning her hands.

                        famous daughter with you on your 
                        little E.R. Trip.

                        not on speaking terms.

                        I see. Not taking the news well.

           Sandy is silent. She looks down at her hands, twisting her 
           mouth. Dr. Pacek watches her. 
                                                 g
                                 DR. PACEK (CONT'D)
                        Does she know? 

           Sandy slowly shakes her head no. Dr. Pacek figures it out. 

                                 DR. PACEK (CONT'D)
                        Why does she think you stopped 
                        treatment? 
                                 SANDY
                           (avoiding eye contact)
                        She thinks I stopped 
                        because...I...didn’t need it 
                        anymore.

           Dr. Pacek inhales deeply. Her shoulders drop slightly as she 
           nods her head slowly. 

                                 DR. PACEK

                        I think both of us know 
                        that...that’s not going to work.

                                 SANDY
                        -No, I know. I know. I just...can’t 
                        find a good time-

                        I don’t think there will ever be a 
                        good time. 

           They both sit in silence. From down the way, Margarita can be 
           heard talking along with the television. Dr. Pacek smiles.

                        abandoning her.

                        she’ll come around. It’s ultimately 
                        your decision.

                                 DR. PACEK
                        I don’t think any parent wants to 
                        leave their child. 

           A beat. Sandy nods.

                        It’s funny...I kinda thought I 
                        would look back on my life at the 
                        end and think, like, “Wow. My 
                        life...was important”. Like it was 
                        meaningful, you know? But this...I 
                        don’t know.

                        Who decides what a meaningful life 
                        is?

           Sandy finally looks up at Dr. Pacek. 

                                 DR. PACEK (CONT'D)
                        I better get going. Let me know if

           Sandy nods. Dr. Pacek puts her hand on Sandy’s knee. She 
           gives it a squeeze, then stands and exits the room.

           INT. LOS AMIGOS - NIGHT

           Margarita awkwardly tries to feed herself a taquito with her 
           right hand fully casted. Some thin band aids line Sandy’s 
           cheek and eyebrow. Both have hospital wristbands on.
                             e

           Margarita is completely closed off to Sandy. She chomps 
           angrily on her food. She doesn’t look at Sandy.

           The Karaoke M.C. From before grabs the microphone as the 
           lights change to a swirling colorful disco ball.

           Sandy leans forward, talking loudly over the M.C.

           Sandy grabs Margarita’s chin, trying to turn her face towards 
           her. Margarita swats her hand away, annoyed.

                        Alright, let’s get this show on the 
                        road, shall we?

           Margarita looks over to the M.C. She turns back to Sandy. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Last time Uncle Patrick came over 
                        was when Dad died.

                        --No it is true. He came over and 
                        you wouldn’t tell me why he was 
                        here and then you told me Dad was 
                        in a car accident. Why is he 
                        coming? What’s happening?

                        I stopped treatment because the 
                        cancer spread. Not because I was 
                        better.

                        Starting us off tonight we have our 
                        favorite performer singing her 
                        classic “American Pie” ladies and 
                        gentleman help me in welcoming up 
                        Miss Margarita to the stage. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        You lied.
                 e
           Sandy looks at Margarita with pleading eyes. It’s all falling 
           into place. Margarita’s face drops. 

                                 KARAOKE M.C.
                        Come on up here Margarita! 
                       y

           Margarita, eyes still locked on Sandy, shakily stands to her 
           feet. She approaches the stage, grabbing the mic with her 
           casted-hand. Her eyes watch Sandy.
                             e
           She doesn’t say anything. No intro. She just grips the mic.

           The CHEAP instrumental of AMERICAN PIE BLARES through the 
           speakers. Margarita begins to sing. Her voice is caught in 
           the back of her throat.

                                 MARGARITA
                        A long, long time ago...I can still 
                        remember...
                                   r
                                       i

                                          n
           She stops singing. She continues to stare at Sandy. Sandy 
           motions for her to come back to the booth. Margarita shakes 
           her head no.

                        And I knew if I had my chance
                        That I could make those people 
                        dance...And maybe they'd be happy 
                        for a while-

           Margarita blinks as a tear falls down her cheek.
                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        I can't remember if I cried
                        When I read about his widowed bride
                        Something touched me deep inside
                        The day the music died. 

           She barely squeaks out the last word. The chorus hits as the 
           bar continues to sing. Margarita stands motionless, staring 
           at Sandy. Sandy looks back, wiping tears from her own cheeks.

           EXT. HALLOWEEN STORE - 3 WEEKS LATER - AFTERNOON
                       y
           A large sign on the front of the store reads: 

           “AFTER HALLOWEEN SALE! EVERYTHING MUST GO!”
                             e
           INT. HALLOWEEN STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Margarita is sweeping the store. Many of the shelves are 
           bare. HUGE discount signs saying “75% OFF” are taped 
           everywhere.

           Felix is holding the dustpan that Margarita sweeps into. She 
           tries her best to sweep with her cast. 
                                   r

                        Maybe after this we can go to my 
                        house and I can show you my guitar. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Maybe. 
                                                 g
           SUDDENLY, the front door of the store opens. In comes Pinky, 
           the Sarahs, Rachael, and Jean Marie. 

           Margarita drops the broom, ecstatic to see her friends.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Hey! Oh my gosh you guys!

            She excitedly calls out to them, a huge smile on her face. 
                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Pinky! Pinky! Jean Marie! Hey guys!

           Margarita starts walking towards them. Pinky whispers to the 
           other girls. 

                                 PINKY
                        Go, go, go!

           The girls run down an aisle to hide from Margarita. Margarita 
           chases after them. 
        M

                                 MARGARITA
                        Guys! Guys, hey! What are you-

           As she rounds the corner of the aisle they ducked behind, she 
           sees the last bit of Sarah M. disappearing into the next 
           aisle after the girls. 
                 e

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                           (smiling)
                        I totally saw you guys!
                       y
           Margarita runs to the next aisle. They’re not there. 

           She runs to the next aisle. Just missed them. 
                             e
           Next aisle. She jumps out in front of them, making the 
           animatronic ghoul CACKLE and move.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Gotcha! 

           Margarita is laughing. All the girls are awkwardly huddled, 
           pretending to be looking at a costume. Pinky turns around 
           with a fake smile. 
                                   r

                        Oh my god...hey Margarita...we 
                        didn’t even see you! 

                                 MARGARITA
                        What are you guys doing here? 
                                                 g
           Pinky looks back at the girls. Jean Marie pipes in with a 
           lie. 

                                 JEAN MARIE
                        We were just...looking for stuff 
                        for our costumes for the 
                        competition. Like, glitter and 
                        false eyelashes and stuff.
                                 MARGARITA
                        Did you guys already try CVS? 
                        They...normally sell makeup there 
                        I’m pretty sure. My mom got her 
                        makeup done there a couple weeks 
                        ago and she looked awesome...they 
                        have good makeup there I think. 

           The girls are starring at her as she talks. Margarita 
           awkwardly fidgets with her hands. Suddenly, Felix appears 
           with the broom. 
        M

                                 FELIX
                        Hey, we aren’t done sweeping-

           He sees the girls. Jokingly, he wiggles his glasses. 

                                 FELIX (CONT'D)
                 e
                        Well helloooo ladies. 

           Margarita laughs. Pinky looks offended, folding her arms. The 
           rest of the girls notice and re-act similarly. 
                       y
                                 MARGARITA
                        Felix, these are my friends from 
                        hobbyhorse. That’s Pinky, that’s 
                        Jean Marie, that’s Sarah M., Sarah 
                        B. that’s-

                        -Margarita...you quit hobbyhorse.

           Margarita stops. She thinks for a second. 

                                 MARGARITA
                                   r

                        mom...I mean, actually...I meant to 
                        tell you guys that I was gonna come 
                        back-

                        -I don’t think that’s a good idea. 
                        Coach was pretty mad about you 
                        quitting...plus it’s so close to 
                        competition...and you’re not 
                        competing...

                                 MARGARITA
                        Yes I am. 

           Pinky raises her eyebrows in surprise. 

                                 SARAH M.
                        Since when? 
                                 MARGARITA
                        I never said I wasn’t. 

                                 PINKY
                        Yeah...except you’re twenty-six 
                        so...Not sure how you’re gonna fit 
                        into an age bracket.

           Margarita’s face drops. She furrows her eyebrows, trying to 
           think. Jean Marie is the only one who looks a little sorry 
           for her. 
        M

                                 FELIX
                        I’m twenty-nine! 

           The girls look at him. Pinky talks to him like he’s a three 
           year old. 
                 e
                                 PINKY
                        Wow...that’s so cool...I love your 
                        shoes.

           He’s wearing sneakers with superheroes on the side. 
                       y

                                 FELIX
                        Thanks! I love superheroes. My 
                        favorite is Spiderman.
                             e
           Pinky looks back to Margarita. 

                                 PINKY
                        Well I’m really glad you found 
                        people your own age to hang out

           annoyed.

                        one job without getting distracted.

                        Don’t worry...we were just going. 

                                 SARAH B.
                        Yeah, my mom’s outside we gotta to 
                        practice.
           Margarita opens her mouth to say something.

                                 PINKY
                        Also...we’re not your friends, so 
                        maybe don’t tell people that next 
                        time.

           Summer shoos the girls off. She eyes Margarita, giving the 
           “I’m watching you” signal with her fingers. 

        M
           The girls follow behind Pinky towards the door. Margarita 
           turns to watch them go. She’s boiling. She watches the girls 
           climb into the minivan outside.

                                 FELIX
                        Your friends are so awesome.

           EXT. THE BEST HALLOWEEN STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Hank is washing paint off the window. He reaches one of his 
           many fliers taped up.
                       y
           Someone scribbled underneath the “NOW HIRING” sign in 
           sharpie. The sign reads:

           “NOW HIRING! RETARDS”
                             e
           He RIPS it down. As he crumples it, Margarita throws the door 
           open. She’s taking off her work vest, chucking it to the 
           ground. Hank watches her. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        I’m leaving early. You can fire me 
                        if you want.

           He watches her SPRINT down the street.

           Margarita SPRINTS through the streets, attempting to run from 
           every single thought in her mind. She dodges a biker. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Use the bike lane-- fuck!

           She runs, and runs, and runs. 

           She stops outside of the dance studio. The girls are inside 
           practicing. Margarita heads straight for the door.
           She pulls. Pushes.

           INT. DANCE STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Coach stops talking as soon as he sees Margarita. All the 
           girls turn around. 

           Margarita, panting, tear-streaked cheeks, stands with her 
           fists balled up at her sides.

                        I know you don’t like me. I know 
                        you all don’t like me. You didn’t 
                        like me the day I came in. I know 
                        it’s because I’m different. But 
                        that doesn’t mean I’m stupid or 
                        that I don’t notice when you guys 
                        make fun of me...or...you don’t 
                        talk to me...and...You didn’t even 
                        give me a chance. None of you. You 
                        didn’t even let me carpool with 
                        you. Melissa we live two houses 
                        away from each other...like...come 
                        on.
                             e
           She looks around at the wide eyes. Coach is watching her, his 
           expression still stoic. She takes a couple more labored 
           breaths, wiping some sweat from her forehead.

                        me. Not once...You didn’t even try 
                        to be my friend...So I hope...I

                        nicer to people in the

           The girls GASP. Coach’s eyebrows raise. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Especially you Pinky. You’re the 
                        biggest cunt-

                                 COACH
                        -OUT.

           Margarita throws her hands up.

                                 MARGARITA
                        I know...I’m going. 
           Margarita turns for the door. As she leaves she chucks up a 
           “rock on” sign behind her. 

           EXT. DANCE STUDIO - NIGHT

           Margarita walks away without looking back.

           She notices every stare she gets as she walks by. Every pair 
           of eyes that pretend not to be looking at her when she 
           catches their glance. 
        M

           Children, teenagers, adults. Every single person she passes 
           can’t help but stare at her. Just like they always do. Like 
           they always do.

           Margarita lifts up her chin. She holds her head high, for the 
           first time, not giving a fuck about the staring eyes. 
                 e

           EXT. SMALL TOWN STREETS - NIGHT - MARGARITA'S WORLD
                       y
           Margarita continues to walk quickly. Her red hair flaps 
           behind her. She wipes her nose. She pulls her shoulders back.

           She looks different from the girl we first met. She closes 
           her eyes as she walks. She feels at home in her body.
                             e
                                 COACH (O.S.)
                        Red! 

           Back to reality. 

           Margarita turns around to see Coach in his beat up car 
           driving slowly beside her, his window rolled down. 
                                   r
                                       i
           Margarita continues to march down the street as Coach creeps 
           alongside her in his car.

                                 COACH
                        You don’t need to be. Just get in 
                        the car.

                                 MARGARITA
                        No. 

           He continues to drive alongside her as she marches down the 
           sidewalk. After about ten seconds of this, 

                                 COACH
                        Please, Margarita.
           Margarita stops. She turns to look at him. She’s never heard 
           him say her name.

           EXT. STABLES - NIGHT

           Margarita and Coach stand in the tall grass side by side. 
           Each of them hold small rocks in their hands. They take turns 
           tossing the small rocks at a metal can that sits on a tree 
           branch high above them. 

        M
           Margarita grunts as she tosses one. Misses. 

                                 COACH
                        You were right. About everything 
                        you said. 

           He tosses one. Misses. 
                 e

                                 MARGARITA

                        what I said. I kinda...blacked out 
                        I think. 
                       y

           Coach laughs a little. Margarita smiles. She tosses. Misses.

                        I’m sorry about your wife. 
                             e

           Coach tosses. 

                                 COACH
                        Thank you. Who told you?

                        wanted them to keep going. 

           Margarita tosses.

                        I can’t. 

           Margarita tosses. She hits it. The can CLINKS. Both Coach and 
           Margarita celebrate. 
                        MARGARITA (CONT'D)

                        Why isn’t it falling? How did that-

                                 MARGARITA
                        -My dad nailed it up to the branch 
                        so we wouldn’t have to climb back 
                        up and re-set it when we hit it.

           Coach turns to look at her. 

                                 COACH
                        Oh.

           They gather up more rocks. They continue to throw.

                       y
                                 MARGARITA
                        She lied to me. She said she 
                        stopped chemotherapy because she 
                        didn’t have cancer anymore. She 
                        just stopped chemotherapy. She 
                        still has cancer. She’s just gonna 
                        die.

           Coach looks at Margarita as she takes another toss. 
                             e
                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)

                        fucking stupid.

           Coach slowly sits down to the ground. Margarita continues to 
           toss her rocks. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)

           Coach shakes his head.

                        Good. Cuz I’m not. 

           She scoops up some more pebbles, still tossing them, with a 
           bit more aggression. 

           Coach picks up a piece of grass. He blows on it. It WHISTLES. 

           Margarita stops, turning to look at him. 
                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        How’d you do that?

           Coach waves her to sit down. She sits beside him, setting 
           down her pebbles. He picks her a piece of grass, handing it 
           to her. 

                                 COACH
                        Now hold it between your thumbs.

           He reaches for her hands to correct them, she flinches away. 
        M

           She gently puts her hands back out. He takes them, folding 
           them around the grass. 

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        And you hold it firmly.

           He brings his blade back up to his mouth. 

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        And blow on it.

           His whistles. She tries. A lot of spit comes out. She keeps 
           trying. He talks over her as she keeps blowing on the grass.

                                 COACH (CONT'D)

                        Maggie did the same thing. She

                        best decision-

                        brave as fighting. 

           Margarita keeps SPITTING and BLOWING on the grass blade.

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        You should keep going with her.

           PHVVWWWWWWW
           The grass blade WHISTLES. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        I got it! Did you hear that?

           Margarita smiles. She blows again. It doesn’t work.

                        Aw man, I had it. 

           She keeps trying.

           Margarita looks at him, her fingers still pursed at her lips.

           INT. MARGARITA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Margarita opens the front door. All the lights in the house 
           are off. She gently tip toes to her mom’s bedroom. She creaks 
                                                 g
           the door open. 

           INT. SANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Her mom is laying in a hospice bed, surrounded by meds. The 
           bed is tiled upright. She’s sleeping, her mouth hanging open 
           slightly. Her hair has grown back in a bit more.
           Margarita gently tip toes over to her. She kicks off her 
           shoes, sliding into bed beside her mom. 

           Sandy stirs softly. She rolls over, opening up her arms. 

           Margarita wriggles in, resting her head on Sandy’s neck.

           PATRICK, Margarita’s UNCLE, (Sandy’s brother) is making toast 
           and eggs in the kitchen. Simultaneously, he’s scrubbing the 
           cabinets clean of finger prints. 

                       y
           Sandy is sitting at the kitchen table. She looks out the 
           window. Her movements are slow. Patrick notices Margarita 
           padding in to the kitchen. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Good morning Margarita, how did you 
                        sleep?
                             e

           He talks to her as if she is a baby. Margarita walks straight 
           past him. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Hi Uncle Patrick. 

           She sits down next to Sandy at the table.

                        Mom, I was thinking today we could 
                        go see a movie.

           Sandy smiles, her eyes wrinkle up. She nods her head. 

                                 PATRICK
                                                 g
                        Today we are getting the new remote 
                        for the bed installment. We have 
                        the hospice worker coming at noon.

           The toast POPS up out of the toaster. Patrick grabs it and 
           begins to layer scrambled eggs on top of it. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Mom, do you wanna go to the movies 
                        with me? 
           Sandy gives her a soft smile. She lays her hand on top of 
           Margarita’s. She gives it a small squeeze.

                                 PATRICK
                        She needs to rest, Margarita. 
                        Remember, she doesn’t have the same 
                        energy she used to. 

           Margarita rolls her eyes. Sandy winks at her. She crosses her 
           eyes, sticking out her tongue at Patricks back. Margarita 
           laughs.
        M

           As Patrick turns back around Sandy drops the face.

                                 PATRICK (CONT'D)
                        So what are your plans for the day, 
                        Margs? 
                 e
           Margarita, eyes still on her mom, gives a shrug. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        I dunno. Probably just gonna hang 
                        out here.

                        that horse documentary you were 
                        telling me about.
                             e

           Margarita rolls her eyes.

                                 MARGARITA

           DOCUMENTARY plays on the television. Margarita tip toes from 
           the couch into Sandy’s bedroom. 

           She creaks the door open to see Sandy is wide awake, starring 
           ahead at the television. A home decor show is playing 
           quietly.

           Sandy wears her blue wig. She’s putting eyeshadow on 
           Margarita’s eyelids. Sandy’s hands shake horribly.
                                 SANDY

           is captivated. Sandy wears her glasses, dissecting the film 
           like a critic.

           Some MOANING comes from the TV. Margaritas eyes widen. The 
           MOANING increases louder and louder.

                        real, and there’s faking it...these 
                        girls are always faking it. No one 
                        sounds like that in real life. You 
                        tell them what works for you.

           Sandy, caught up in watching her daughter, shakily stands 
           from her wheel chair. Sandy extends a hand. The horse takes a 
           moment, then very gently leans into her hand.

                        Mom, I’m gonna go tomorrow. I’m not

                        I was scared to have you. I was 
                        scared to raise you. I was scared 
                        to raise you alone. Death’s got

           Sandy rolls over to face Margarita.

                                 SANDY

                        one can determine what a meaningful 
                        life is. I think only we can...but 
                        I had one. We have one.

           Sandy takes in another breath, much slower. Margarita watches 
           her carefully. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        We have one. We have one.

           Sandy’s eyes are shut. Margarita begins to drift off, closing 
           her eyes. The still night begins to take over her thoughts.
           EXT. TRAMPOLINE - SUNRISE

           Margarita rolls over. Her nose is pink from the cold. She 
           sees a bird land on the tree branch overhead. The sun is just 
           barely peaking over the horizon. 

           Everything is quiet. Only the wind and the leaves and the 
           birds are heard. Margarita closes her eyes again, putting her 
           head against Sandy’s. 

        M
           She pulls away realizing how cold her mom’s face is. She puts 
           her hand on her mom’s cheek. 

           She looks at her moms face for a long time. She traces her 
           fingers along the smile lines of Sandys mouth. She touches 
           her moms lips. She rubs her hand across her bald head. She 
           lays her head on Sandy’s chest. Silence. 
                 e
           From high above the trampoline, we see two figures, lying 
           side by side.

           Patrick sleeps on the guest bed, his mouth hangs open. 
           Margarita walks straight up to the bed. He stirs slightly. 

                                 MARGARITA

           He startles awake, yanking the covers over his torso.

                        Jesus...Margarita...is everything

           He sits straight up, practically leaping out of bed.

           He yanks a sweatshirt over his head, still in his boxers. He 
           beelines for the door. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        It’s okay...she died in her sleep, 
                        just like she wanted to. Hey, I 
                        gotta go to my to my 
                        competition...do you think you 
                        could give me a ride?
           Patrick runs straight out the backdoor. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                           (calling after him)
                        Why are you running? She’s already 
                        dead.

           He sprints out the backdoor, leaving it open. Hysterical 
           screams come from outside.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING

           Margarita stands, leaning against the back porch wall. She 
           watches as EMT workers rush out of the ambulance with a 
           stretcher and bags. 
                 e

           Patrick stands by the trampoline, helping them on to the 
           trampoline.

           An EMT worker approaches Margarita with a blanket.
                       y

           They begin to wrap her in the blanket. She pays no mind to 
           them. She watches as EMTs begin to try and lift her off the 
           trampoline. 
                             e
           Patrick talks with one of the workers near the ambulance.

           Margarita notices as a butterfly flies past her. She watches 
           it disappear into the sky.

           The EMT and PARAMEDICS pull Sandy’s body off the trampoline 
           and onto the stretcher. They cover her up. Margarita calls 
           out to them.

           An EMT responder standing next to Margarita turns around. 

                                 EMT RESPONDER

                        Her wig. 

           Margarita points to the blue wig, still lying on the 
           trampoline. The responder looks at the wig. She calls out to 
           the EMT members by the stretcher. 
                                 EMT RESPONDER
                        Hey guys...She uh...Can you get her 
                        wig?

           A couple of them give a “what the?” Look. One of the 
           responders reaches through the net, grabbing the wig. He 
           calls back. 

                                 EMT RESPONDER 2
                        Got it.

           The EMT Responder by Margarita turns back to her.

                        They got it.

           Another responder tries to get Margarita to walk along with 
           them to the ambulance.

           standing next to Margarita. The female responder shrugs.

                        maybe?

           The responder is dumbstruck. Suddenly- 

           HONK.

           HONK.HONK.HONK.HOOOOOOONK.
           A Responder round the side yard.

           Hank has his window rolled down, the car still running. He’s

                        to some horse riding thing today.  

           Margarita looks at him in disbelief. She looks to the 
           backseat. She notices Felix sitting in the backseat. Felix

           INT. HOBBY HORSE COMPETITION - DRESSING ROOMS - EVENING 

           Pinky’s mom, a classic stage mom, powders makeup on to 
           Pinky’s face. Other moms help their daughters get into 
           costume and curl their hair. The room is alive with nervous 
           energy. 
           No one notices the backdoor of the dressing room opening. 
           Margarita enters. No hobby horse, no costume, no makeup bag. 
           Just a camel toe. 

           She finds an empty chair near one of the makeup mirrors. She 
           looks at herself in the mirror. Her hair is a rats nest, her 
           face is bare. She looks around the room.

           She catches Pinky’s eye mid glance. Pinky, a flash of fear on 
           her normally cocky face, looks away quickly.

        M
           Margarita turns to BERNADETTE, the girl sitting next to her. 
           She’s chubby, probably the chubbiest one in the room. She has 
           a terribly short bob, flushed cheeks, and the biggest smile 
           of anyone there.

                                          n
                                 BERNADETTE
                        Yeah. I think red hair is the 
                        coolest hair of any of the colors. 
                        I’m Bernadette. 
                                                 g
                                 MARGARITA
                        I’m Margarita. 

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Wait...your name is Margarita? 

           Margarita slumps a little, ready for the jokes. 
                                 MARGARITA
                        Yeah.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        That’s so freaking cool! 

           Margarita perks up. Bernadette hands her an orange-colored 
           lipstick. 

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT'D)

        M
                        Do this one. It matches your hair. 
                        It’s gonna look so pretty on you.

           Margarita puts it on her lips. She smacks her lips together, 
           looking at herself in the mirror.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT'D)
                 e
                        Oh my god...I knew it would look 
                        amazing. Do you want some blush? 

           Margarita shrugs, overwhelmed by the kindness. 

                                 MARGARITA
                       y
                        Okay, ya sure. 

           Bernadette spreads bright pink blush on to her cheeks. 
           Margarita, looking slightly crazy with the colors on her 
           face, stares at herself in the mirror.
                             e

                                 BERNADETTE
                        You look incredible. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        Yeah...I look really good. I just 
                        gotta...

                                       i
           Margarita begins to attempt to braid her own hair with her 
           cast. She rips it apart, trying to separate it and twist it 
           amidst the knots. 
                                          n
                                 BERNADETTE
                        Ooh I love braids. That’s cool you 
                        can braid your own hair. My mom 
                        always does it for me.
                                                 g
           Margarita, stretching her hands behind her head, struggles.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT'D)
                        What are you wearing for your 
                        costume? 

           Just then Margarita hears a VOICE BOOM over the sound 
           speaker.
                                 HOBBYHORSE MC (O.S.)
                        And in just a short moment we have 
                        our fifteen to eighteen age 
                        division.

           Margarita’s eyes jolt open.

                                 MARGARITA
                        Fuck! 

        M
           Bernadette jumps. Heads turn. Margarita drops her hands from 
           her hair and begins to sprint out of the dressing room. She 
           turns back to Bernadette. 

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Where’s backstage? 

           Bernadette, stressed, shrugs her shoulders. 
                 e

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)

                       y
           Margarita sprints out of the dressing room, SLAMMING the door 
           on her way out. All the girls and their moms stare.

           INT. HALLWAY OF THE ARENA - CONTINUOUS
                             e
           Margarita is overwhelmed by the senses. LOUD SOUNDS. GYM 
           SMELLS. GIRLS and STAGEHANDS crowd the hallways, pushing past 
           each other.

           Margarita, mumbling under her breath, practically slams into 
           a Tiny Blonde.

                                 TINY BLONDE
                        Watch it!

                                          n
           Margarita stumbles towards some curtains that block off 
           backstage from the arena. Margarita is beginning to melt 
           down. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
                                                 g
           She’s trying to hold back tears. She paces around backstage. 
           Her hands keep flying up to her hair. She continually tries 
           to braid.

           The STAGE MANAGER, a flamboyant and way-too stressed man, 
           keeps interrupting her thoughts with questions. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Are you in this category?
                                 MARGARITA
                        Yes my name is Margarita spelled 
                        just like the drink.

           He begins to scan his list.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        I’m not seeing your name...you said 
                        Marguerite? 

                                 MARGARITA
        M
                        It’s Margarita, oh my fuck!

           Margarita is getting agitated. She ties a scrunchie around 
           her shitty braid. The Stage Manager stares at her.

                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Do you know where Coach is? 
                 e

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Which Coach? 

                                 MARGARITA
                       y
                        My Coach...I think he’s supposed to 
                        be back here...

                                 STAGE MANAGER

                        Honey it’s not my job to keep track 
                        of everyones’ coaches...

           Margarita growls in the back of her throat. She sits down, 
           putting her head between her knees, trying to block out the 
           world. She begins repeatedly hitting herself in the head.

           Suddenly, a pair of large hands gently place themselves on 
           the back of her shoulders. 
                                   r
                                       i
                                 COACH
                        Need a horse? 
                                          n
           Margarita turns around to see Coach. Same sweatshirt, same 
           faded jeans, same demeanor. 

                                                 g
           He pulls Cheeseburger out from a golf club bag full of 
           horses. It has a blue bow in it’s hair and is taped back 
           together quite professionally.

           Margarita nods at him, her eyes filled with tears. 

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        Why you crying?
                                 MARGARITA
                        I can’t braid my fucking hair. I 
                        can’t do it. I can’t do it. 

           Margarita begins to hyperventilate.

                                 COACH
                        Turn around.

           Margarita turns around, showing her wonky braid, its a twist 
           with a scrunchie barely hanging on to the end. 
        M

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        What are you talking about, Red? 
                        That’s a great braid. Suits you. 
                        Did you do that by yourself? 

           Margarita, through sniffles, nods. 
                 e

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        I’m very impressed. You’ll have to 
                        show me how to do it sometime. 
                       y
           Margarita laughs, wiping her snot on her sleeve. 

                                 MARGARITA
                        I don’t have a costume.

                        You don’t need one. All that’s just 
                        for show. You’ll stand out just 
                        fine--

           Some CHEERING. Coach gives Margarita a pat on the back. 
                                          n
                                 COACH

                        they gonna say my name?

           Coach has disappeared to the wings. Margarita takes a deep 
           breath.

           Margarita walks out on stage. She opens the curtain herself 
           and heads straight for the HOBBYHORSE M.C.
           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A CLOSE UP ON A PURPLE CAST.

           In shaky permanent marker is written “FUCK EVERYONE. LOVE, 
           MOM”. A butterfly is drawn next to it. 

           She wears a striped turtleneck, ill-fitting jeans, a messy 
           braid, and too much colorful makeup.

        M
           She awkwardly walks straight up to the HOBBYHORSE MC, a “MISS 
           AMERICA” host of a man with fake white teeth and hair plugs.

                                 HOBBYHORSE MC
                        Oh, and it looks like one of our 
                        competitors doesn’t wait for 
                        anyone! 
                 e
           Margarita stands right next to him. She taps him on the 
           shoulder. He tries to brush her off until finally he can’t 
           ignore her anymore. 
                       y
           He laughs awkwardly. She battles to grab the mic. He tries to 
           keep it away.

                                 HOBBYHORSE MC (CONT'D)
                             e

                        heard, ladies and gentleman here 
                        is...

           Margarita grabs the mic forcefully from his hands. She speaks 
           too close to the microphone.

                                 MARGARITA

                        died about two hours ago on my 
                        trampoline in my backyard. I’d like 
                        to thank Hank and Felix for taking 
                        me here, my new friend Bernadette 
                        for her lipstick, Coach for fixing 
                        Cheeseburger but most of all I’d 
                        like to thank my mom for teaching 
                        me to fuck everyone- hit it!
                                                 g

           The judges are completely horrified. Audience members GASP. 
           Coach hits play on the speaker system.

           AMERICAN PIE BLASTS through the arena. Coach gives her a rock 
           on. She throws him a “rock on” back.

           Margarita picks Cheeseburger dramatically raising her over 
           her head.
           Margarita takes her stance at the beginning of the race head. 
           She takes a deep breath in. She begins to interpretive dance 
           with her horse for the beginning of the song. 

           As the song amps up to the first “So bye bye Miss American 
           Pie”

           Margarita begins to TROT around the ring. She receives a 
           couple HOOTS and HOLLERS, mainly from Felix and Hank. 

        M
           Her scrunchie falls out, her fluffy hair falls over her 
           shoulders.

           She gallops past the first few obstacles. She turns back 
           around. She leaps over one, two, three...she knocks over the 
           third. Her big shoes catch on the pole. 
                 e
           She stands up, dusting off her knees. She step claps from 
           side to side, trying to get the audience to clap along too. 

           Doesn’t work. Except Felix and Hank, they’re clapping with 
           her.
                       y
           Margarita mounts her horse again. As she builds back up into 
           a gallop, she notices a couple of audience members standing 
           up to leave. 
                             e
           She gets distracted watching them. Coach, from the sides of 
           the arena calls out to her. 

                                 COACH
                        Margarita! 

                                 MARGARITA
                           (yelling back to him)
                        They’re leaving!

                                       i
           She points to the people sneaking out. She looks at Coach for 
           help. She starts to back up, taking the horse out from

           between her legs. A couple audience members BOO. 

           She mouths the words “I CAN’T” to Coach. Coach stares back. 
           She looks to the judges who are extremely uncomfortable. 
           Every face in the audience is uncomfortable. No one knows 
           what to do. 
                                                 g

           Coach looks down at the iPod, he stops the song. Margarita 
           looks back out at the audience. The arena goes SILENT.

           Margarita lets out a couple GASPING BREATHS. She wipes her 
           nose. She clears her throat. 

           She turns to Coach, then back to the crowd. She closes her 
           eyes, taking in a deep breath.
                                 MARGARITA (CONT'D)
                        Wait- no I can do it. I’m okay. I’m 
                        fine. I’m fast. I’m fast...the 
                        fastest girl in the world...I’m the 
                        fastest girl and the world...and 
                        fuck everybody else.

                                 CHOIR
                        FUCK EVERYBODY ELSE...SHE’S 
                        FAST...SHE’S FAST...THE FASTEST 
                        GIRL IN THE WORLD...

           AN EPIC AND ETHEREAL CHOIR FILLS THE STADIUM.

           IN SLOW MOTION:

           She raises Cheeseburger to the sky.
                 e
           All of a sudden, COACH, BERNADETTE, HANK, FELIX-

           AND SANDY
                       y
           Are next to her on stage. Margarita looks at them. They all 
           lift her into a carry as the choir BUILDS.

           They support her. She rolls her wrists as she reaches to the 
           sky. 
                             e
           She gently is set back down by her friends. 

           As she does her same routine that she has done every night in 
           front of the TV, Coach, Bernadette, Hank, Felix, and Sandy 
           all do it with her. Each is in perfect synchronization.

           Sandy gives Margarita Cheeseburger. Margarita takes 
           Cheeseburger, smiling. She looks forward at the audience. Her 
           friends have disappeared.
                                   r
                                       i

                                          n
           Hank and Felix are back in the audience. Coach is on the 
           sideline. Margarita preps.

           She gears up taking off in a final gallop. As she runs, her 
           feet begin to lift off the floor. She’s floating above the 
           hurdle, then she floats above the audience, the judges, the 
           arena. 
                                                 g

           A long PUSH IN on her face as she continues to float above 
           the crowd. She gives a huge smile. She takes a deep breath 
           in, closing her eyes. 

           Finally, she opens her eyes.

                                                         FADE OUT.
