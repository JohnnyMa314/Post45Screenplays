           EXT. WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

           A crowded Sunday morning on M Street NW. It’s 2024: density 
           is finally back to normal. Politicos, families, college 
           students -- all with uncovered faces -- stroll past red brick 
           townhomes, old-timey lamp posts, and American flags mounted 
           out windows. It’s like an Epcot version of where the Founding 
           Fathers went to brunch.

           It’s the first Sunday of spring, a regional holiday where 
           East Coasters wear insufficient clothing to celebrate the 
           slightest increase in temperature.

           SARA JANE (21, white), wearing a quarter-zip sweatshirt, 
           shorts, and sneakers, walks with a small knot of FRIENDS. One 
           is her best friend MAGGIE (22). Maggie has gone full Pagan 
           Celebration: cropped floral bustier, raw-edge short-shorts, 
           espadrilles, ribbons in her hair. It’s 62 degrees.

           The group passes a grassy area where a big, ancient tree 
           shades a picturesque park bench.

           A BOY (7 or 8, white) stands on the bench, looking up at the 
           tree and crying. He’s a Norman Rockwell archetype from rosy 
           cheeks to button nose.

           Sara Jane notices his distress and stops. As she heads toward 
           him, Maggie calls back:

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sara Jane?

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’ll catch up with you guys.

           Maggie and the rest continue on, and we stay with Sara Jane. 
           Sara Jane approaches the boy.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Where’s your grownup?

           The boy sniffles.

                                 BOY
                        There.

           He points down the road to a harried NANNY arguing with a 
           METER MAID about a ticket. So he’s not lost.

                                 SARA JANE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 BOY
                        I threw my hat and it stuck.
           He points at the tree and Sara Jane looks up, following the 
           line of his finger. Up pretty high, half hidden by leaves and 
           branches but still visible, is a bright red baseball cap.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (confirming)
                        Your hat is stuck in a tree.

           The boy sniffles and nods.

                                 BOY
                        It’s my favorite.

           Sara Jane scopes the topography of the tree. The lowest 
           branch is too high for the boy, but not for a grown woman.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Well, we can’t have that. You wait 
                        right here.

           Sara Jane steps up onto the bench and grabs the tree’s lowest 
           branch. She swings herself up onto it and starts climbing.

           Her sense of mission makes her unwittingly graceful as she 
           ascends, branch by branch, always safe and considered. 
           There’s not a reckless bone in her body.

           On Sara Jane’s face as she pops her head up eye-level with 
           the hat: we watch her expression morph into one of pure 
           horror, then utter disgust.

           Flipping around, we see the half-obscured writing on the hat, 
           just enough to recognize: 

           MAKE AME---
           GREAT AG---

           Oh. 

           Sara Jane moves into a position where she can safely grab the 
           hat. She removes it from its perch, then stashes it down her 
           shirt, where it becomes invisible under her sweatshirt. Her 
           expression of distaste lingers as she descends empty-handed.

           The little boy looks up at her hopefully. He can no longer 
           see his hat in the tree, so she must have it.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Your hat was really badly stuck.

           The boy looks up at her expectantly.
                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        And the words on it were hurtful, 
                        so the tree wouldn’t let it go.

           Sara Jane demonstrates how empty her hands are. The boy takes 
           in the lack of hat, whimpers, and bursts into a renewed bout 
           of tears.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        That hat is gone. But you can get a 
                        new hat. A better hat.

                                 BOY
                             (in-between sobs)
                        But-- I want-- MY-- hat.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Your hat is lost forever.

                                 BOY
                        You said-- you’d-- get it-- for me.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Well, don’t believe everything 
                        you’re told. And maybe don’t throw 
                        hats into trees. That was a stupid 
                        thing to do.

           And with that, Sara Jane turns on her heel and walks after 
           her friends, leaving the crying little boy behind.

           INT. FARMERS FISHERS BAKERS

           Maggie is seated for brunch with the rest of the friend group 
           when Sara Jane finally arrives. They’ve saved her a chair.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Thanks, guys. I’m gonna go wash my 
                        hands.

           Sara Jane looks pointedly at Maggie, silently communicating. 
           Maggie resists. Sara Jane persists. Maggie breaks.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I guess I’ll wash mine too. Again.

           INT. FARMERS FISHERS BAKERS - RESTROOM

           Sara Jane has beat Maggie to the privacy of the restroom, and 
           is waiting when Maggie bursts in.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I appreciate your enthusiasm, but 
                        coke is not for First Brunch. 
                        Brunch is for eating--

                                 SARA JANE
                        No! It’s not coke. When have I 
                        brought you coke?

           Sara Jane zips down her quarter-zip and, surreptitiously like 
           a dealer, shows Maggie that she has something in her shirt.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You stole something.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Just look.

           Maggie has to get all up in there to see it properly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        OHHH my god. Why do you have this?

                                 SARA JANE
                        I couldn’t let him keep it!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Does he know that it’s gone?!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah, but he’s little. Like a 
                        little kid.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (in wonder/appalled)
                        What did you do?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Can we focus? What do I do with it?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You keep it there! Until it’s safe 
                        to dispose of!

                                 SARA JANE
                        But it feels icky! I think I need 
                        to go home and like burn it or cut 
                        it up or take all the stitches out 
                        with one of those little...

           She gestures to indicate a seam ripper.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Nooo! It’s First Brunch! The 
                        restaurant is packed, the people 
                        are smiling, the birds are singing. 
                        Everything’s back to normal right 
                        before college is about to end. 
                        These are the-- 

                                 SARA JANE
                        --last best days of our lives. I 
                        know. But it’s gonna throw off my 
                        whole vibe.

           Maggie can see this is true. She pulls the hat out of Sara 
           Jane’s shirt and sticks the bill into her bustier. There is 
           no room. Practically all of it protrudes.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Gimme your sweatshirt.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It won’t ruin First Brunch?

           But Sara Jane is already taking off her sweatshirt. Maggie 
           wriggles it on, covering the hat. Somehow, it looks amazing.

           INT. FARMERS FISHERS BAKERS

           The girls sit at the table exchanging eyes over their secret, 
           laughing like nothing’s wrong.

           INT. “OFF CAMPUS” HOUSE, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

           The girls sit in the same positions, only this time around a 
           janky coffee table that has never seen a coffee in its life. 
           Above the couch, a satirical fraternity grid portrait shows 
           the CLASS OF 2024. The same seniors populate the party.

           Sara Jane gets up. We follow her into the kitchen of the 
           house, where two HIPSTERS (male) lean against the counter. 
           One breaks off his conversation when he sees Sara Jane.

                                 HIPSTER BRO
                        That’s what I-- Saint Jude! Speak 
                        of the angel. Tell him what you 
                        told me.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That if more men were born with 
                        uteri, abortion would be in the 
                        Constitution?
                                 HIPSTER BRO
                        No, about how sure you are how 
                        they’re gonna rule.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Oh. One hundred percent certain 
                        they’ll overturn.

                                 HIPSTER BRO
                             (to his friend)
                        See? It’s a done thing. She follows 
                        this shit more than anybody.

                                 HIPSTER FRIEND
                        Whoa. So it’s just like... gone?

                                 SARA JANE
                        It becomes a state thing. In some 
                        states it’ll be illegal 
                        immediately. In others, nothing 
                        will cha--

           Maggie appears over Sara Jane’s shoulder with two drinks.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re talking to boys about 
                        abortion.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It’s tomorrow!

           Maggie steers Sara Jane back to the living room.

                                 BOY ON COUCH
                        SAINT JUUUUUUUDE! She returns!

           You can tell Sara Jane doesn’t hate being called a saint. The 
           boy makes room on the couch and the girls squish in.

                                 BOY ON COUCH (CONT’D)
                        Saint Jude’s coming to Myrtle. SHE 
                        wants to be at Breakers.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I am hotel-agnostic. I go where 
                        Maggie goes.

                                 MAGGIE
                        There are better hotels in Myrtle! 
                        We finally get a real Spring Break 
                        our last year in college and you 
                        want to spend it at Breakers?
                                 BOY ON COUCH
                        BREAKERS. BREAKERS. BREAKERS.

           INT. “OFF CAMPUS” HOUSE - LATER

           Sara Jane finds Maggie on the staircase, drunkenly engaged in 
           “conversation.” Sara Jane wears a triumphant expression.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m gonna head out. You good?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (drunk)
                        Why are you so happy? You’re never 
                        so happy this late.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You know that urinal they installed 
                        upstairs? Guess what I put there.

           Sara Jane just smiles. Maggie takes a second, then catches 
           on: the hat has found its final resting place.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You didn’t.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Tell the boys they’re welcome.

           EXT. “OFF CAMPUS HOUSE” - MORNING

           Sara Jane, dressed for a protest, stands below a second-story 
           window. She holds two well-lettered signs, each on a long 
           wooden dowel. She calls up:

                                 SARA JANE
                        MAGGIE.
                             (a beat)
                        MAGGIE!

           A rustling. Maggie comes to the window and sticks her head 
           out. No one pulls off morning-after hair like Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Lemme guess. Last night I told you 
                        to come get me no matter what.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You did.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you bring me clothes?
                                 SARA JANE
                             (no, but)
                        I brought you a sign.

           Sara Jane demonstrates the signs. One says: “MY BODY MY 
           CHOICE”. The other says: “THIS IS VERY BAD.” Maggie smiles.

           EXT. FIRST STREET NE 

           Holding their signs, the girls join a throng approaching a 
           protest area. Maggie is dressed for last night’s party.

           EXT. SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT

           Sara Jane and Maggie stand in a crowd of pro-choice 
           protestors. Sara Jane’s phone buzzes. She shifts her sign to 
           one hand and checks the notification: Roe v. Wade Overturned 
           in Landmark... she doesn’t click through for the rest. It’s 
           enough to know it’s happened. She shows Maggie, who frowns.

           A cheer of celebration erupts from a different group of women 
           and men across the way. Their faces are radiant. They are so 
           happy. They won. Finally. They won.

           Sara Jane looks at their fellow protestors. Some crying. Some 
           frowning. A couple look almost crazed.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How long do we stay?

           A woman PROTESTOR with long gray hair replies:

                                 PROTESTOR
                        As long as we can.

                                 SARA JANE
                        And then what?

                                 PROTESTOR
                        We wait. Alito can’t live forever.

           The girls look at her. She’s serious. Maggie is unfazed. Sara 
           Jane is crushed.

           EXT. WASHINGTON, DC

           Sara Jane and Maggie walk home from the protest. Maggie is 
           chipper and sincere. Sara Jane is trying to convince herself 
           and not spoil Maggie’s mood, but she’s failing.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m really glad we went!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah. I hope it does something.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Even if it doesn’t. We showed up.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah.

           INT. SARA JANE’S DORM ROOM

           In Sara Jane’s clean, organized, and uncluttered room, she 
           has put up one poster, next to her bed: an Art Deco-style 
           print depicting Saint Jude. Whether it preceded or stems from 
           her nickname is unclear, but it’s gotta be the latter.

           On her laptop, Sara Jane googles “volunteer rescue pro-choice 
           abortion access.” Weeds through some pregnancy “crisis 
           center” sites, finds a likely-looking blog post: “The case 
           for transporting at-risk minors to out-of-state clinics.” 

           Sara Jane reads the headline and lights up. That’s the 
           opposite of waiting. As she reads, she gets a call. She 
           absent-mindedly picks it up, focused on the post.

           INTERCUT: Bethany (late 50s) is unloading groceries in her 
           beautifully appointed kitchen.

                                 BETHANY
                        I saw you on CNN.

                                 SARA JANE
                        They covered the protest?

           She clicks on a link in the post: Choice Access Network.

                                 BETHANY
                        Yes, before the announcement. The 
                        talking heads liked your sign.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It’s a good one, right? Really cuts 
                        through the noise.

           The link yields a page with a phone number labeled “Signal.”

                                 BETHANY
                        Mm.
                                 SARA JANE
                        Can you send me the clip?

           Sara Jane opens Signal Private Messenger on her phone and 
           texts the number: Looking to help.

                                 BETHANY
                        What for?

                                 SARA JANE
                        My resume.

                                 BETHANY
                        This is why I called. Let’s talk 
                        through that. If you were an 
                        employer in this economy and you 
                        saw a candidate protesting on TV--

           Sara Jane gets a text back: a jumble of numbers and letters 
           ending in .onion.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Mom. The type of employers I’ll be 
                        looking at consider that a plus.

                                 BETHANY
                        I do think it’s a bit different 
                        when you’re protesting settled law.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Roe was settled law! This is the 
                        opposite--

           Sara Jane pulls up the Tor browser and carefully copies in 
           the URL. The landing page has a warning message: We screen 
           our drivers and are extremely selective. THIS EFFORT IS NOT 
           LEGAL. You run the risk of arrest and prosecution. Then a 
           button: “APPLY TO DRIVE”.

                                 BETHANY
                        Well, now the law has changed, and 
                        I think it’s worth asking what 
                        message you send when you don’t 
                        accept a ruling by the Court, even 
                        if you or I may disagree with it. 
                        We’ve seen how fragile rule of law 
                        is in this--

           Maggie appears at the door. Sara Jane closes her laptop.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Maggie just came in, gotta go she 
                        seems upset, thanks for calling 
                        Mom, love you bye.
           Sara Jane hangs up and looks at Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I think we should try to find a 
                        room in one of the smaller 
                        properties people have bought out. 
                        I think that’s where the good 
                        parties will be.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That makes all the sense.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I want to meet a guy on the beach, 
                        not in a hotel, and I don’t want to 
                        have to tell him I’m staying at 
                        Breakers. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        God forbid.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Does your mom think I’m a crying 
                        mess all the time?

                                 SARA JANE
                        I think her words were “has done 
                        wonders for your emotional 
                        intelligence.”

           Maggie guffaws and leaves to make the change. Sara Jane looks 
           at her protest sign, resting impotently against her dresser. 
           THIS IS VERY BAD. She opens her laptop and clicks the button: 
           “APPLY TO DRIVE”. 

           EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAYS LATER

           Sara Jane walks back from class. She gets a call on Signal.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (surreptitiously)
                        Yes? Yes, I am available now: can 
                        you give me five minutes to get to 
                        a private location? Okay, thanks.

           Sara Jane hangs up and sprints for her dorm.

           INT. SARA JANE'S DORM ROOM

           Sara Jane is video conferencing on her phone with a Choice 
           Access Network REPRESENTATIVE (female), who is on voice-only.
                                 REPRESENTATIVE (O.S.)
                        That just about covers it. The last 
                        thing: we’re having a hard time 
                        staffing volunteers for April 13th 
                        through the 21st. We have a lot of 
                        appointment availability and all--

           Sara Jane’s phone buzzes conspicuously.

                                 REPRESENTATIVE (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        Everything okay there?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Sorry, it’s just my mom. If I don’t 
                        pick up, she texts.

                                 REPRESENTATIVE (O.S.)
                        Okay then. I was saying that 
                        schools are on Spring Break that 
                        week so we’re having a hard time 
                        finding drivers.

           Sara Jane has pulled up her Google Calendar. The week in 
           question is blocked by one nine-day event: !!MYRTLE BEACH!!!

                                 REPRESENTATIVE (O.S.)(CONT’D)
                        You put down in the form that you 
                        are available any time but I see 
                        that it is GW’s Spring Break and I 
                        wanted to confirm--

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m available. This is more 
                        important than Spring Break.

                                 REPRESENTATIVE (O.S.)
                        To confirm: if offered trips during 
                        that week, you do commit to drive.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes. Absolutely.

                                 REPRESENTATIVE (O.S.)
                        Okay then. For obvious reasons, we 
                        are very protective of our 
                        passengers, so we only accept a 
                        small percentage of our applicants 
                        who volunteer to drive. We are 
                        running the background check and, 
                        IF you are selected, we will 
                        contact you. If not selected, you 
                        will not hear back from us or be 
                        able to contact us in any way, for 
                        our safety. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REPRESENTATIVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Same goes for if something goes 
                        wrong on the trip: you get pulled 
                        over, the clinic finds out you’re 
                        not related, whatever. There’s no 
                        safety net; we only schedule 
                        appointments and connect drivers 
                        with passengers. After that you’re 
                        on your own.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Understood.

           Sara Jane hangs up the call. She calls Bethany back.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, sorry, I was on the phone.

                                 BETHANY
                        Oh. Well, I can call another time 
                        if you’re busy.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (conciliatory)
                        No, now’s good, I’m not on the 
                        phone anymore. I was just 
                        explaining... What’s up?

                                 BETHANY
                        Well, your uncle’s coming into town 
                        and I thought it might be a good 
                        chance to talk to him about private-
                        sector opportunities for after 
                        school. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        I am not coming all the way up 
                        there to talk to Randy about jobs.

                                 BETHANY
                        That’s the thing: it’s during your 
                        Spring Break, so you wouldn’t miss 
                        any class.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I am not coming home for Spring 
                        Break.

                                 BETHANY
                        Not the whole time! Just the first 
                        weekend. You could go to Spring 
                        Break for a full week after.
                                 SARA JANE
                        That’s not how it works. You have 
                        to commit to the whole time, 
                        otherwise the rooms don’t work out.

                                 BETHANY
                        You know, since you brought up 
                        money...

                                 SARA JANE
                        I did not.

                                 BETHANY
                        After graduation, you’ll find that 
                        life is much more expensive than 
                        you’d expect.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m going to get a job! I told you 
                        NGOs don’t hire until the summer.

                                 BETHANY
                        Sweetie, NGOs don’t hire at all. 
                        Their budgets have been slashed and 
                        burned. People don’t give in a 
                        recession, and if you think 
                        government funding is going to 
                        causes you care about under this 
                        Congress...

                                 SARA JANE
                        There are still NGOs.

                                 BETHANY
                        It makes what-NGO-hiring-there-is 
                        extremely competitive. They’re not 
                        looking for the right opinions; 
                        they’re looking for the right 
                        people. To be effective.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You’re saying my principles are 
                        ineffective.

                                 BETHANY
                        Sometimes we’re more effective when 
                        we’re willing to bend our 
                        principles.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That sounds unethical.
                                 BETHANY
                        Just think about it. Randy knows a 
                        lot of people who are hiring, even 
                        in this economy.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I will think about it.

           She won’t. Sara Jane hangs up, then crumples onto her bed.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Ineffective.

           Turning her head to the side, she sees her poster of Saint 
           Jude. She focuses in on its subtitle: Patron Saint of 
           Hopeless Cases and Lost Causes.

           Well, shit. Is that what they think of her?

           Her phone buzzes. Sara Jane bats it away. It buzzes again, 
           for the same text. Sara Jane reluctantly checks it. It’s a 
           message on Signal: Thank you for committing to drive. You 
           have 5 matches. First match: You have been matched with a 
           passenger with an appointment on Saturday 13 April 2024.

           Sara Jane jumps up, WHOOPS and spikes her phone onto her bed. 
           She reclaims it to put on the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Hump de 
           Bump” and does a victory dance around her tiny bedroom as the 
           music blasts. The bedroom’s confines become restricting, so 
           she shimmies out into the dorm suite’s common room, dancing 
           on the cheap furniture in pure elation.

           The door opens, and Maggie comes in from class. She drops her 
           backpack and joins in. Maggie takes the dancing up to a whole 
           different level. The girls hump the air and bump the 
           furniture, until Maggie shouts over the music:

                                 MAGGIE
                        GET READY FOR TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN 
                        STRAIGHT HOURS OF THIS IN MYRTLE.

           It takes a moment for that sink in. When it does, Sara Jane 
           stops dancing. Oblivious, Maggie keeps going.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        BY DAY SIX, SOMEONE MIGHT EVEN LET 
                        YOU TOUCH A PLAYLIST.

           Maggie realizes that Sara Jane has stopped dancing. Maggie 
           stops dancing. She looks innocently at Sara Jane. Sara Jane’s 
           face is ashen: she looks very, very guilty.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                             (already heartbroken)
                        What?

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE ROW - DUSK, A WEEK OR SO LATER

           Open-shirted frat bros in Vilebrequin trunks load a Mercedes-
           Benz G-Class with cases of shit vodka as giggling fellow-
           students in bikini tops and jean shorts strap an inflated 
           swan to the roof.

           All along the row, the scene is repeated. Two students 
           hanging out windows write on the side of a townhouse in 
           sidewalk chalk: “C U IN MYRTLE.”

           Sara Jane walks through these last dregs of Spring Break 
           exodus in a short-sleeved blouse, well-cut slacks, and button 
           pearls. This is her “weekend, but take me seriously” look.

           A SORORITY GIRL in a sweatshirt and running shorts calls out:

                                 SORORITY GIRL
                        Sara Jane! Are you staying with 
                        Maggie?

           Sara Jane looks over her shoulder as she gets to her car.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m not coming.

           The sorority girl looks at her blankly.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta do a thing. Solo mission.

           Sara Jane unlocks her Ford Fusion hybrid and, with one last 
           superior look at the Greek scene, gets in. As Sara Jane 
           drives off, the sorority girl looks deeply perplexed. Where 
           the hell else could one possibly be going?

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / I-95 - DARK

           Sara Jane drives through lush green woods. Her Google Maps is 
           in night-mode. Rather than some rockin’ road trip soundtrack, 
           she plays NPR podcasts off her phone:

                        shall we say... human connection.

           Frowning, Sara Jane skips the episode.

           Sara Jane almost smiles. Much better.

           EXT. PARKING LOT OFF I-85 - NIGHT

           Sara Jane pulls a car cover out of the trunk and stretches it 
           over the four corners of the car. Then she manages to crawl 
           under the cover into the car’s back seat. It’s an undignified 
           endeavor -- good thing no one’s watching.

           INT. SARA JANE’S CAR

           Windows whited out by the car cover, Sara Jane is nodding off 
           when her phone rings. Annoyed, she looks at the name of the 
           caller. Her face softens. She picks up.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You know, it’s not normal to call 
                        someone when you’re mad at them.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’s not normal is being blessed 
                        with your first unrestricted Spring 
                        Break your senior year and then 
                        ditching it on principle.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m not--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Whatever. Did it work? Do you know 
                        where you’re going?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Just the county so I could plan. I 
                        get the address and stuff tomorrow.

           She checks the time on her phone. It’s 2:56 AM.
                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Well, today.

                                 MAGGIE
                        But you’ll-- JESUS! I SWEAR TO GOD!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Maggie, are you driving?!

           INTERCUT: BACKSEAT OF A BMW X5

           Maggie is in the back right seat next to two sleeping college 
           students and behind a third. A male college student DRIVER 
           pilots the vehicle through the darkness.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, they wouldn’t fucking let me 
                        and now this maniac is changing 
                        lanes literally every two minutes 
                        and we’re going to sideswipe some--

                                 SARA JANE
                        Why wouldn’t they let you drive?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Patriarchal toxic masculinity 
                        bullshit. It’s the 20s everywhere 
                        but GW, apparently. I stayed dead 
                        sober all day so I’d be the best 
                        option.

                                 DRIVER
                        I’m sober.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You weren’t at noon!

                                 DRIVER
                        I had a nap.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So tell him you’ll take a turn.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I did he said no.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Insist.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Then we get to Myrtle and all 
                        anyone can talk about is what a 
                        psycho feminazi I am. I don’t get 
                        off on that. Unlike some people.

                                 DRIVER
                        It’s my car.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to driver, but really to 
                              Sara Jane)
                        The car I intended to be in is busy 
                        helping the “more deserving.”

                                 SARA JANE
                        How are they not more deserving?!

           The car abruptly changes lanes, cutting off another car.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (at the driver)
                        MOTHERFUCKER!

                                 SARA JANE
                             (a little concerned now)
                        Is there a boy in the car you trust 
                        more to drive? Maybe he’d switch 
                        with someone who’s not you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know who could be driving me? 
                        You. But no, you had to go save 
                        some preggo teenager from no-
                        abortion-land.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, Zack’s good with women 
                        controlling our bodies just not 
                        cars.

                                 DRIVER
                        Just not my car.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Pray for me.

           Maggie hangs up. Sara Jane looks at the phone. Nothing she 
           can do about that. She goes back to sleep.
           EXT. I-85 - PRE-DAWN

           Car cover stowed, Sara Jane is back on the road.

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / FIVE FORKS, SOUTH CAROLINA - DAWN

           Sara Jane pulls up to a nice house in a suburb of Greenville. 
           She consults her phone. A Signal message that looks like it 
           was composed by a computer reads, in part:

           ADDRESS: Laurel Street & North Honey Lane Five Forks SC 29681
           ADD’L DIRECTIONS: turn L on N Honey park under dogwood

           Sara Jane turns left on North Honey Lane and pulls over under 
           the dogwood tree.

           In the shade stands a girl (14, white), who is dressed like 
           Billie Eilish, which is to say: like a goth girl who ate a 
           sneakerhead. Vaguely culturally-appropriative oversized 
           streetwear, dyed green-black hair, layered jewelry with 
           spikes and thorns. 

           Since, for her own safety, we don’t know her name, we’ll call 
           her BILLIE.

           Sara Jane scrolls down on the Signal text:

           AGE: 14 DESCRIPTION: 5’4”, black hair, green hair
           TRIMESTER: 2

           Definitely her. 

           Billie is likewise checking her phone, then looking at Sara 
           Jane’s license plate, like you would for an Uber pickup. 
           Knowing that the plate will match, Sara Jane turns off her 
           podcast and smiles invitingly. Billie avoids eye contact, 
           opens the passenger door, gets in.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Hi!
                             (beat - no hi back)
                        I’m Sara Jane.

                                 BILLIE
                        Cool.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I guess we should head out. You 
                        buckled up?

           Billie is not. She rolls her eyes and starts to fasten her 
           seat belt. Warmth didn’t work, so Sara Jane tries her best 
           “cool older mentor” voice:
                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not just for safety -- you 
                        know, both Carolinas are primary 
                        seat belt states, so they can pull 
                        you over just for that.

                                 BILLIE
                        I know, I live here.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Right. Um, lap belt lower. May I?

                                 BILLIE
                        No.

           As Billie adjusts the lap belt, she pulls her oversized 
           streetwear tunic out over it. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        Okay.

           Sara Jane is clearly bothered by her inability to see whether 
           the lap belt is positioned safely. 

                                 BILLIE
                        It’s fine. “My body my choice.”

           This shibboleth, even spoken in Billie’s bitter, sardonic 
           tone, jolts Sara Jane out of her anxiety.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Okay, let’s get out of here.

           She types the address of a DC Planned Parenthood (1225 4th 
           St. NE) into her car’s GPS navigation system and pulls out 
           from under the dogwood. They begin to drive out of the 
           neighborhood. 

           Buried in her phone, Billie types furiously. Sara Jane looks 
           over, silently asking what’s up. Billie feels her gaze.

                                 BILLIE
                        What?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Nothing.

           They make their way to the highway.

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / I-85 

                                 BILLIE
                        We’re on 85 for a while right?
                                 SARA JANE
                        About seven hours, until Richmond.

                                 BILLIE
                        Will we go through Grover?

                                 SARA JANE
                        I dunno, is it on I-85?

           Billie looks out the window, straining to see the signs, and 
           then appears to look up the exits on her phone.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Why Grover?

           No response.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        What’s in Grover?

                                 BILLIE
                        Nothing, don’t worry about it.

           Sara Jane glances to see Billie zooming in on Google Maps, 
           tracking where they are. Billie clocks her glance and moves 
           her phone to where Sara Jane can’t see it, sending texts from 
           an awkward angle on her right side. Sara Jane takes a deep 
           breath and focuses on the road.

           As they pass the junction with Route 29, Billie perks up. She 
           scans her surroundings, alert. When she sees the Welcome to 
           North Carolina sign, Billie sends one last hidden text, then 
           puts down her phone and stares straight ahead.

           Sara Jane continues to drive. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        Do you have music on your phone 
                        that you like? I can pull the aux 
                        out of my--

           Sara Jane pulls the aux out and offers it to Billie. In the 
           newfound silence, she can hear a lone trill far, far behind 
           them: a police siren.

           Sara Jane looks at Billie. Billie looks smug as hell. It’s 
           the look of someone who knows you lost and is waiting with 
           delicious anticipation to watch you find out. Billie plugs in 
           her phone. Bruce Springsteen’s “State Trooper” swells 
           ominously as the siren approaches. She had it cued up.

           Instinct taking over, Sara Jane pulls sharply onto an exit 
           she nearly passed, taking the off-ramp at screeching full 
           speed, then pulls a hard left to cross over the freeway.
           On the straightaway over the freeway, Sara Jane yanks the aux 
           cord like a leash to grab Billie’s phone. The car swerves 
           dangerously toward the edge of the overpass as Billie 
           struggles in surprise-- 

                                 BILLIE
                        The fu---?

           -- but Sara Jane comes up with the phone, disconnects it, and 
           drops it into the driver’s door pocket, out of reach. 

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Like that’s going to help you!

                                 SARA JANE
                        What the hell did you do?

                                 BILLIE
                        They already have your plates, 
                        fucktard.

           Sara Jane stops the car at the end of the overpass, and 
           Billie starts to undo her seatbelt to jump out of the car.

           Seeing this, Sara Jane accelerates and pulls onto an access 
           road running parallel to the highway going the other 
           direction. Billie holds on tight.

                                 SARA JANE
                        How do they have my plates?

                                 BILLIE
                        I texted them in as soon as you 
                        crossed state lines with a minor.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Why?!

                                 BILLIE
                        So they’d arrest you.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You signed up for a ride!

                                 BILLIE
                        An illegal ride to kill a baby!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Jesus. You’re--

                                 BILLIE
                        An undercover pro-life activist who 
                        just entrapped you into kidnapping.
           Sara Jane floors the gas, kicking up a trail of dust.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Which is a federal crime, for the 
                        record.

           This sinks in. Sara Jane slows down. The dust dies. But 
           they’re still going too fast for Billie to bail.

           The cop car is rapidly approaching, going the other direction 
           on the highway. He doesn’t seem to have spotted them. Yet.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        The safest thing to do is 
                        surrender.

           The cop car whizzes by.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So you don’t need an abortion.

                                 BILLIE
                        NO!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Ok.

                                 BILLIE
                        Do you realize how offensive that 
                        is? You just asked me if I need to 
                        commit baby murder.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So I’ll just take you back home.

                                 BILLIE
                        Great idea.

           Sara Jane turns the car, but instead of merging back onto the 
           highway, she cuts over it again and re-enters the freeway 
           headed north, safely far behind the police car. 

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Home’s the other way.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I think you told the cops where you 
                        live. So there are probably cops 
                        there waiting for me.

                                 BILLIE
                        What? Noooo. That’s craaaazy.
                                 SARA JANE
                        You don’t have to do this, you 
                        know. Whoever put you up to it, we 
                        can find a way to get you out. 

                                 BILLIE
                        Whoever put me up to it?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Even if they’re an adult, someone 
                        you trust, a pastor-- it’s really 
                        not okay to use you like this. I 
                        know it’s a heavy thing to hear--

                                 BILLIE
                        Wow. Fucking listen to yourself.

           Up ahead, a shipping truck merges left from behind another 
           shipping truck and drives alongside it.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        You literally think I’m some sort 
                        of puppet.

           But instead of passing the other truck, the merged truck 
           coasts beside it.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (about the trucks)
                        That’s not normal.

                                 BILLIE
                        No, no fourteen-year-old girl could 
                        possibly hold an ethical 
                        conviction!

                                 SARA JANE
                             (to Billie)
                        I didn’t say that!

                                 BILLIE
                        And, even if she did, planning 
                        political action based on that 
                        conviction is out of the question. 

                                 SARA JANE
                             (to herself)
                        It’s a rolling roadblock. They’re 
                        on the police radio.
                                 BILLIE
                        No way she could have looked around 
                        at where our country is headed, 
                        thought “this is fundamentally not 
                        okay no matter what the law is,” 
                        and decided to DO SOMETHING about 
                        it.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Shut up for a sec.

           There it is: another siren. Behind them.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        That’s bad.

                                 BILLIE
                        You thought there’d be just one 
                        cop? Have you never seen one of 
                        these on YouTube? It’s over.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It’s over when there’s a 
                        helicopter.

           Both girls look out the window at the sky. Comedic timing 
           demands there be a helicopter. But... the skies are clear.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not over.

           As the siren nears, Sara Jane approaches the right-hand 
           shoulder, gauging an attempt to get around the trucks.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Do you think we can make it?

                                 BILLIE
                        The fuck do you mean “we”?

                                 SARA JANE
                        We, the two of us, in this car.

                                 BILLIE
                        No!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Alright.

           Sara Jane pulls off the highway and onto the access road. The 
           police car isn’t far behind.
                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand how this 
                        happened. Did they not vet you? 

                                 BILLIE
                        Oh, they did. But I’m actually a 
                        fourteen-year-old girl.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So you posed as a legitimate 
                        beneficiary.

                                 BILLIE
                        To infiltrate and bring down the 
                        network.

                                 SARA JANE
                        And keep everyone who actually 
                        needs a ride to an abortion from 
                        getting one.

                                 BILLIE
                        Bingo.

           A beat.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Fuck. You.

           For the first time, we see Sara Jane angry. She is balls-to-
           the-wall pissed. The new police car, now close on their tail, 
           ups its siren to a greater level of urgency.

           Sara Jane pulls off the access road and drives through a 
           dusty patch. The dust cakes her car, obscuring her plates. 
           Then she cuts into a field bordered on all sides by roads.

                                 BILLIE
                        They see you. It’s fucking flat.

           Behind her, the cop car makes a call: it’ll be faster to go 
           around the field and cut her off on the other side. Sara Jane 
           rummages in her center console, looking for something. She 
           comes up with a bandana and a lighter. She rolls down her 
           window, lights the bandana on fire, and drops the flaming 
           bandana out the window.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.

           As the field begins to smoke within the firebreaks formed by 
           the roads, Sara Jane guns it. She exits the field under smoke 
           screen, chooses a direction, and drives.
                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        There’s nowhere for you to go. You 
                        are three states away from anywhere 
                        they support baby-killing, and you 
                        can’t go to D.C. ‘cuz I told them 
                        that’s where you’re headed. Look 
                        around. No ivory tower libs, no 
                        coastal elites. You’re trapped.

           Sara Jane looks around, apprehensive. Billie’s right. Sara 
           Jane makes a pinching motion on her maps app, zooming out: 
           pinch... pinch... on the third pinch, she sees something. An 
           epiphany dawns triumphantly over her face.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        What. Where are we going?

           EXT. THE COAST

           On the beach: Maggie, in a perky triangle bikini top and 
           extremely short jean shorts, is piggy-back riding around the 
           beach on the back of the bro whose driving she so abhorred. 
           Her phone, in her back pocket, buzzes for an incoming call.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (laughing)
                        My butt is ringing! Lemme down, 
                        lemme down.

           The driver doesn’t comply, so Maggie wriggles, eventually 
           spilling into the sand. She staggers up, still laughing, and 
           checks who’s calling.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s Sara Jane.

           Suddenly stern, Maggie straights her posture, as if this will 
           help her sound sober on the phone. She accepts the call.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I made it here alive. No thanks to 
                        you. 

           INTERCUT: INT. SARA JANE’S CAR

           Sara Jane is back on a paved road. Billie tries to grab the 
           phone as Sara Jane talks to Maggie.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Great news.
                                 MAGGIE
                        You changed your mind and you’re 
                        coming to Myrtle.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I changed my mind and I’m coming to 
                        Myrtle.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Really???!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Literally driving in your 
                        direction.

           All trace of Maggie’s anger is instantly obliterated. She is 
           beyond thrilled. She hops up and down repeatedly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        EEEEEEeeeeeeeee!!! YAY YAY YAY YAY!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Is it awesome there?

                                 MAGGIE
                        It is so awesome here.

                                 BILLIE
                        FUCK YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who’s that?

                                 SARA JANE
                        What?

                                 BILLIE
                        CALL THE POLICE!

                                 SARA JANE
                        Experimental album. Very weird. 
                        This track is called “Pygmy Aunt 
                        Lydia.” You like it?

                                 BILLIE
                        VERY FUCKING FUNNY.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Send me a pin, okay? Somewhere I 
                        can leave the car. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay. Just to warn you, I’m a tiny 
                        bit drunk, but I will try to be 
                        sober enough to do that.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m four hours away.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I said I’ll TRY.

           INT. SARA JANE’S CAR, I-385

           Sara Jane has moved her phone to her left-hand side, safely 
           out of Billie’s reach from the passenger seat. Billie’s is 
           still in the door.

                                 BILLIE
                        What if you take the SIM out and 
                        then give it to me?

                                 SARA JANE
                        No.

                                 BILLIE
                        But then I literally cannot make 
                        calls. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        No.

                                 BILLIE
                        What if--

                                 SARA JANE
                        No.

                                 BILLIE
                        Are you going to say anything but 
                        “No”?

                                 SARA JANE
                        No.

                                 BILLIE
                        Are you going to say “No” next?

                                 SARA JANE
                        No.

                                 BILLIE
                        HAH.
                                 SARA JANE
                        Ten points for Slytherin.

                                 BILLIE
                        What I want to do is use offline 
                        maps to find a good place for you 
                        to drop me off.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m not dropping you off.

                                 BILLIE
                        What’s the alternative?!

                                 SARA JANE
                        I drop you off, you call the 
                        police, the police know I’m going 
                        to Myrtle.

                                 BILLIE
                        You’re the one who said where 
                        you’re going!

                                 SARA JANE
                        I know. That was a mistake.

                                 BILLIE
                        So now I’m trapped in a speeding 
                        car because YOU are bad at this.

                                 SARA JANE
                        No, you’re in a speeding car 
                        because YOU decided to entrap me in 
                        an attempt to ruin other women’s 
                        lives.

                                 BILLIE
                        A baby doesn’t ruin your life. 
                        Being killed before you’re born 
                        ruins your life.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Not being conceived ruins your 
                        life. Your parents not meeting 
                        ruins your life. Your ethical 
                        argument is based on an arbitrary 
                        point before viability. I’m not 
                        going to debate you.

                                 BILLIE
                        Because you can’t!
                                 SARA JANE
                        Because it’s not worth it. You 
                        literally are not worth the effort.

                                 BILLIE
                        But the person you thought I was 
                        when you picked me up, she was?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes. I preferred her.

                                 BILLIE
                        I have to pee.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Go ahead.

           Bluff called, Billie has no intention of wetting herself.

                                 BILLIE
                        You’ll have to stop for gas.

           Sara Jane looks at her gas meter.

                                 SARA JANE
                        We’ve got a while. It’s a hybrid.

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / I-20 E

           Sara Jane glances at the gas meter. Getting down there. But 
           she’s had time to formulate a plan.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So, would you say you consider 
                        yourself a feminist?

                                 BILLIE
                        UGH.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I realize that, regionally, the 
                        term has come under a smear 
                        campaign.

                                 BILLIE
                        “Regionally?”

                                 SARA JANE
                        Dolly Parton disavows it, which is 
                        a whole pile of bullshit.

                                 BILLIE
                        Get her name out of your mouth.
                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m just curious what it means to 
                        someone like you.

           Billie turns and speaks directly to Sara Jane.

                                 BILLIE
                        No, I’m not a feminist, because I’m 
                        not a victim, and I don’t think 
                        women are victims, and I think 
                        telling everyone that we can’t 
                        protect ourselves and we need 
                        society to change around us is 
                        actually counterproductive to the-- 

           As Billie declaims, Sara Jane very subtly edges the car onto 
           an off ramp without slowing down. Billie is too wrapped up to 
           notice, until they take a sharp turn. As the car swings 
           around, Billie realizes that something is up. Sara Jane blows 
           past the gas station, BREAKS to a sudden stop, throws the car 
           in park as she unclicks her seat belt, and, keys in hand, 
           springs out the door.

           Caught off guard, Billie fumbles manically at her seat belt. 
           Sara Jane runs around the front of the car, opens the back 
           seat door, and catches Billie as she darts out.

           Sara Jane pulls Billie around, fiddles with something on the 
           edge of the door with her key, and shoves Billie into the 
           back seat before she slams the door shut.

           Billie immediately tries to open the door, but by the time 
           she realizes it’s child locked, Sara Jane has darted around 
           the back of the car and child-locked the other back door. 

           Billie screams at Sara Jane through the rear window:

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        You are not a feminist! You know 
                        that?! I bet you think you’re a 
                        feminist but you couldn’t do this 
                        to me if you didn’t hate females!

           Sara Jane pops the trunk, revealing poster board, markers, 
           and a set of sturdy wooden dowels like the one from her 
           protest sign. Sara Jane grabs a dowel, slams the trunk 
           closed, and returns to the open front door of the car.

           Billie pulls on the inside door handles and bangs on the 
           windows to no avail. Just as Billie thinks to climb up front, 
           Sara Jane wedges the dowel between the headrests of the two 
           front seats, barring her way.
                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if it’s because I’m 
                        younger than you or because I’m 
                        cooler than you or because I think 
                        differently than you do--

                                 SARA JANE
                        It’s that one.

           Sara Jane shuts the passenger door, muffling Billie. She 
           surveys her handiwork. She did a good job. She gets back in 
           the car.

           EXT. GAS STATION 

           Sara Jane pumps gas as Billie bangs on the windows. Sara Jane 
           checks her phone: a text on Signal and nine texts from Mom.

           She opens the Signal text: Your pickup has not been 
           confirmed. Please ask your passenger to confirm your pickup.

           Sara Jane calls the number. Nothing. It disconnects 
           immediately. She texts back: My passenger is an anti-choice 
           activist who called the police. They have my plates. Please 
           instruct.

           Sara Jane looks at the texts from Bethany. The first one is 
           about Uncle Randy. She types and sends without reading the 
           rest: Hi. Busy. Talk soon. Immediately, a call from Bethany 
           comes in. Sara Jane picks up, then looks like she regrets it.

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        Did you read my messages?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah, tell Uncle Randy I say hi.

                                 BETHANY
                        He has some very interesting 
                        thoughts on career paths.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Mom, this is not a great time.

                                 BETHANY
                        Well that’s why I called. I thought 
                        we could schedule a FaceTime--

                                 SARA JANE
                        I gotta go.
           Sara Jane hangs up. Bethany immediately calls back. Sara Jane 
           declines the call. She sees a new Signal message: This 
           automated system does not recognize your response. 

           She finishes gassing up the car.

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / I-20 E

           Back on the road. Billie sits sullenly in the back seat. NPR 
           plays very loudly from Sara Jane’s now safely out-of-reach 
           phone. They shout over the program:

                                 BILLIE
                        YOU SAID YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND. 
                        THAT’S A LIE. I LIED TO AN ENEMY. 
                        YOU LIED TO YOUR BEST FRIEND.

                                 SARA JANE
                        YOU’RE MAKING A FALSE EQUIVALENCE.

                                 BILLIE
                        IT’S NOT EQUIVALENT. WHAT YOU DID 
                        WAS WAY WORSE.

                                 SARA JANE
                        YOUR BRAIN IS BROKEN.

                                 BILLIE
                        WHAT?

           Sara Jane turns up NPR even louder.

           EXT. MYRTLE BEACH ALLEY - HOURS LATER

           Maggie teeters in a generous parking spot behind a 
           nondescript building. A jacked-up 4x4 pickup spots the 
           opening and lightly beeps at Maggie, on the assumption that 
           she is drunkenly loitering.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Taken! Move along!

           Maggie isn’t drunkenly loitering. She is drunkenly guarding. 
           Huge difference. Mostly in ferocity. The pickup beeps again. 
           Maggie makes wild shoo-ing motions with her arms.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m saving this spot! 

           The pickup beeps one last time, but Maggie stamps around in a 
           circle, clearly more willing to be run over than to budge. 
           Grudgingly, the pickup moves along. The SUV behind it follows 
           suit. Maggie waves it along.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s right! Plenty more spots 
                        somewhere else.

           As Maggie is yelling after the interlopers, another car beeps 
           at her. She spins to verbally attack it--

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Were you not--!

           -- it’s Sara Jane’s car, with Billie in the back seat.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Finally!

           Sara Jane waves Maggie out of the spot, and this time she 
           steps aside. Sara Jane parallels expertly, then gets out of 
           the car. Maggie barrels at her and hugs her tight. Throughout 
           the girls’ conversation, Billie bangs on and makes faces 
           against the window of the car.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is happening. Who is 
                        that?

                                 SARA JANE
                        That’s the girl I was supposed to 
                        drive.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why is she still here?

                                 SARA JANE
                        She heard me tell you where I was 
                        going.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay. And we’ve imprisoned her 
                        because?

                                 SARA JANE
                        She’s some sort of baby zealot who 
                        signed up just to get me arrested. 
                        She called the cops.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re fucking me.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Not an expression.
           Maggie looks at Billie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No. Uh-uh. This is not part of 
                        Spring Break.

                                 SARA JANE
                        The minute she has access to a 
                        phone, the police will know where 
                        to find me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Imagine a set containing all things 
                        Spring Break. THAT is not an 
                        element of the set.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I just need some time to think 
                        through how this doesn’t completely 
                        blow up my life.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m Sara Jane, I’m down for the 
                        cause. What’s that, Maggie? You 
                        told me I could get arrested?

                                 SARA JANE
                        For helping someone access an 
                        abortion! Not for kidnapping a pint-
                        sized Phyllis Schlafly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, so it’s only okay to get 
                        arrested for something noble.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’s your plan? Is there a plan?

                                 SARA JANE
                        We do Spring Break. I figure this 
                        out. Everybody’s happy.

                                 MAGGIE
                        We do Spring Break. With her.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Babysitting someone with impaired 
                        judgment is an element of Spring 
                        Break.
                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s supposed to be me. I am the 
                        one we babysit during Spring Break.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You have excellent judgment!

                                 MAGGIE
                        I am drunk off my ass, Sara Jane!

                                 SARA JANE
                        And yet look at this parking spot!

           A beat. Maggie looks Sara Jane up and down.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you bring a swimsuit?

                                 SARA JANE
                        For my drive to western South 
                        Carolina? No.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, you can’t wear that here.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m not gonna go in the water.

           Maggie looks at her. Sara Jane takes off her pearls. Good 
           enough? Maggie’s face answers: Nope.

           Maggie gestures Sara Jane toward a nearby tourist shack. It 
           is indistinguishable from the thousands of crappy tourist 
           shacks that populate beachfronts from Venice to Key West. 
           Sara Jane might as well be facing the gallows.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Gimme the keys. I’ll crack the 
                        window.
                             (off Sara Jane’s look)
                        So she can breathe.

           Sara Jane tosses her the keys. Resolutely, she walks toward 
           the shack.

           INT. TOURIST SHACK

           Sara Jane enters the shack and examines the wall behind the 
           checkout counter. It’s hung floor to ceiling with row upon 
           row of clear plastic torso mannequin reliefs boasting a wide 
           variety of garishly colored and cheaply made bikinis, uniform 
           only in their extreme skimpiness. Sara Jane is appalled.
           The SHOPKEEPER follows her gaze to a bikini near the top on 
           the far right. It’s patterned in the Confederate Flag.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        You want that one?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Tell me you don’t still sell any of 
                        those.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        I don’t still sell any of those.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Why do you even have that up?

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        People still buy it sometimes.

           Sara Jane is not amused.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Look, if you don’t like that one I 
                        got others. Look, here.

           He uses a hook to pull down a black bikini printed on each 
           breast with a seven-pronged marijuana leaf.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Everyone likes this one.

           He clocks her reaction.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        No?  

           He stares at her hard.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        I know what you want. I keep this 
                        one special. Or everyone would be 
                        wearing it.

           He pulls from behind the counter a high-waisted thong printed 
           with the words DO NOT GRAB above a downward arrow.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Eh? You hate the flag one, you like 
                        this one.

           Sara Jane takes a long look at the bikinis and scowls.
           INT. DRESSING ROOM

           Montage as Sara Jane tries on bikinis over her sensible, 
           sporty underwear (as is hygienic and the rule):

           - A neon-yellow bottom’s left side is entirely straps.

           Sara Jane looks at herself in the mirror. Concerned.

           - A firetruck red top covers only the top half of her 
           breasts.

           Sara Jane looks at herself in the mirror. Creeped out.

           - A purported one-piece slices from her ribs to her crotch, 
           leaving her sides, hips, and bikini line exposed.

           Sara Jane looks at herself in the mirror. Angry.

           INT. TOURIST SHACK

           Sara Jane returns to the shopkeeper empty-handed, in her 
           original clothing.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Do you have any coverups?

           The shopkeeper comes out from behind the counter and shows 
           her to a rack of giant oversized t-shirts printed with ideal 
           beach bodies.

           EXT. MYRTLE BEACH ALLEY

           Billie screams at Maggie unintelligibly through the barely-
           cracked backseat window.

           Holding her old clothes under her arm, Sara Jane walks out 
           wearing a dress-length t-shirt printed with the ideal beach 
           body... of a man. Maggie once-overs her ‘fit.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well done. Totally inconspicuous.

           Sara Jane heads to put her old clothes in the trunk. Maggie 
           grabs them, stomps over to a trash can, and throws them out.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Hey!

                                 MAGGIE
                        They were suspicious.
                                 SARA JANE
                        Very sophisticated hiding spot. I’m 
                        sure no one will think to search 
                        the trashcan next to my car.

           A drunken spring breaker wanders up to the same trash can and 
           pukes into it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m a genius.

           Sara Jane takes the car cover out of her trunk and starts to 
           fit it over the rear of the Fusion.

                                 SARA JANE
                        She called in my plates, so.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re gonna leave her in there 
                        with it covered?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Serves her right.
                             (beat)
                        Of course I’m not.
                             (beat)
                        Her screams would draw attention to 
                        the car.

           Maggie’s satisfied.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        You hold her while I put the cover 
                        on. She might try to kick you or 
                        something. Be ready.

           Sara Jane opens the door and Maggie catches Billie by the arm 
           as she tries to rush past her.

                                 BILLIE
                        HELP! HELP! POLICE! HELP!

           People driving by see two girls play-fighting. None stop.

           Maggie struggles to hold Billie as Sara Jane finishes pulling 
           on the car cover. By the time Sara Jane is done, Maggie has 
           hold of Billie’s wrists behind Billie’s back. Sara Jane steps 
           out from behind the car, and Billie stops struggling to look 
           at her wardrobe change.

           It’s one thing to kidnap her. It’s another to bite her style.
           EXT. BOARDWALK

           Sara Jane and Maggie each have death-grip hold of one of 
           Billie’s arms, linked in a warped Wizard of Oz silhouette.

           In front of them rushes the boardwalk, thick with tourists 
           and bicycles. Beyond it, obscured by the bustle: a broad 
           stretch of sand and, further, the ocean. 

           Sara Jane and Maggie each take a deep breath and walk forward 
           into the Frogger nightmare before them.

           - A bike almost kills them.

           - A herd of drunken partiers in matching T-shirts move at the 
           pace of a beached whale.

           - A man on rollerblades swivels by at breakneck speed.

           Sara Jane reaches the other side and takes a concerted first 
           step across the threshold. Then she pulls Billie and Maggie 
           forward. They stop and catch their breath.

           Ahead of them is a Hieronymus Bosch dystopian wonderland of 
           Spring Break, stretching as far as the eye can see.

           EXT. BEACH 

           With Myrtle’s titular beach in front of them, Maggie spots 
           her and Sara Jane’s friends: a knot of familiars within the 
           balkanized landscape. Maggie waves her free hand and yells:

                                 MAGGIE
                        LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN!

           Maggie’s driver friend waves at them. He’s playing Edward 
           Forty-Hands, each hand taped to a plastic-bottle forty. 
           Struck with inspiration, Maggie runs toward the group, 
           leaving Sara Jane to double her grip on Billie.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Maggie the Cat’s a literary figure, 
                        so that was very clever.

                                 BILLIE
                        I know.

           Sara Jane does a double-take. 

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I love that movie.
                                 SARA JANE
                        It’s a play.

                                 BILLIE
                        Okay, but the movie’s good.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’d have cast a blonde.
                             (off Billie’s look)
                        We agree the text is amazing.

                                 BILLIE
                        It’s weird watching old stuff where 
                        queerness was this whole problem.

                                  SARA JANE
                        You’re not homophobic?

                                 BILLIE
                        Why would I be homophobic?

           Sara Jane just stares at her.

           Maggie returns, somehow already much drunker. She holds a 
           forty and a roll of tape.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Both of you, hold this.

           She shoves a forty into their hands and tapes Sara Jane’s 
           left and Billie’s right hand to it, effectively handcuffing 
           them together.

           The driver appears behind her with two more forties and helps 
           Maggie tape them to Sara Jane and Billie’s remaining hands. 
           Maggie pulls out her phone and snaps photos of the two girls.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Leverage.

                                 BILLIE
                        I’m not drinking ANY of this. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Then Sara Jane has to drink all 
                        three. Spring Break!!! Wooooooo!!!

           Maggie is led back to the group by the driver.

           Billie jangles her wrists in an attempt to wriggle out of the 
           tape, which proves impossible. 
                                 SARA JANE
                        You’re spilling.

                                 BILLIE
                        You’re an accessory to murder.

                                 SARA JANE
                        If you spill, they won’t undo the 
                        tape. That’s how the game works.
                             (off Billie’s stare)
                        They’re very strict about it.

           Billie SLOSHES malt into Sara Jane’s face.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh!!!

                                 BILLIE
                        I don’t play games with kidnappers.

           Sara Jane stands with her eyes shut, unable to wipe the malt 
           out of her eyes with her fortied hands.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Are we here because 
                        of MY insane deception?

                                 BILLIE
                        Covert action.

           Billie tries to make a break for it, dragging blinded Sara 
           Jane forward. Sara Jane sits down hard in the sand, and 
           Billie can’t make any progress against her anchor.

           Sara Jane blinks the malt out of her eyes and SLOSHES malt at 
           Billie. Billie dodges most of it, then smiles triumphantly. 
           Sarah Jane stands up and slowly pours out all her remaining 
           malt. Then she BOPS Billie on the head with the empty.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

           Unclear if it actually hurt. It is plastic.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Nothing you can do. If you hit me 
                        back it’s a game.

           Billie whacks at Sara Jane, but Sara Jane parries. A beat of 
           tension... then... they laugh. Billie strikes, lands one, but 
           Sara Jane is quick on the response-- the two duel with their 
           empty forties: bop BLOCK bop bop WHIFF! Billie squeals... 
           Sara Jane takes advantage of her longer arms... as they spar:
                                 BILLIE
                        Maggie the Cat would be pro-life.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Absolutely not.

                                 BILLIE
                        Her whole thing is having children 
                        is the source of our power.

                                 SARA JANE
                        In 1950s Mississippi. Which was 
                        fucked.

                                 BILLIE
                        And now’s not fucked?

           Sara Jane does another double take. Billie lands a bop.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It doesn’t have to be.

           Maggie reappears with scissors, speaks to Billie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did she finish them?

                                 BILLIE
                        Yup. All three. Right?

           Sara Jane reacts to this new confederacy, then yes-ands:

                                 SARA JANE
                             (slurring)
                        All by my self. No help from YOU!

                                 MAGGIE
                        OH my gawd did she have to feed you 
                        the last one??

           Billie demonstrates how she put her left-hand forty to Sara 
           Jane’s mouth. Sara Jane is too tall: she has to kneel to make 
           it plausible. Maggie takes a pic.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You have to stop that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s exculpatory!

           Sara Jane stays kneeling and looks at Billie.

                                 BILLIE
                        So?
           Billie holds up her hand taped to Sara Jane’s and the forty.

                                 SARA JANE
                        No way.

                                 BILLIE
                        Where am I gonna go? I don’t have a 
                        car or a phone or know anyone here. 
                        I’m fourteen around piles of 
                        college students there’s probably 
                        predators everywhere. You’re the 
                        devil I know.

           Maggie looks at Sara Jane. Sara Jane gives her the non-verbal 
           OK. Maggie cuts the tape holding the two girls together.

           The moment she’s free, Billie bolts.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Fuuuuuuuuuck.

           Maggie helps Sara Jane to her feet, and they both sprint 
           after Billie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What just happened?

                                 SARA JANE
                        She likes Tennessee Williams.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?

           Sara Jane tears the forty from her remaining hand and 
           blatantly litters.

           Billie’s excessive jewelry thumps against her collarbone. 
           Running on dry sand is hard, and she looks a little off-
           balance. Maggie and Sara Jane give chase.

           Sara Jane gets out ahead of Billie. Sara Jane drives her 
           inland... where Maggie is waiting.

           Maggie catches Billie, and Sara Jane quickly helps to 
           restrain her, both aided by the fact that Billie seems direly 
           unwilling to fall forward. She and Maggie each have Billie by 
           the upper arm. Everyone’s out of breath:

                                 BILLIE
                        FUCK you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Now what?
                                 SARA JANE
                        We have to un-brainwash her. That’s 
                        the only way to neutralize the 
                        threat.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Like talk to her until she sees 
                        reason.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It’s the only path forward. That I 
                        can think of. 

                                 BILLIE
                        You fucking megalomaniacal--

           Billie starts struggling again.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to Sara Jane)
                        You know, for a minute I thought 
                        maybe this could be an adventure, 
                        like a mission we could do 
                        together. Like I was not ready to 
                        drop everything and man the 
                        trenches, but here you were, 
                        pushing me in and maybe it would be 
                        fun.

                                 SARA JANE
                        And you no longer feel that way.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No!

           Sara Jane scans the beach. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        We just need her to hold still.

           Sees a solution thirty feet away.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           Sara Jane leads them to a five-foot hole in the sand being 
           dug by two DRUNK GUYS. Sara Jane shoots Maggie a look: drunk 
           guys are her portfolio.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi. We have an emergency.
           EXT. SAME - MINUTES LATER

           Billie is buried in sand up to her neck. Sara Jane and Maggie 
           stand over her.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You’re full of shit. Every time I 
                        have a period, that’s an egg that 
                        could have become a baby! Whoosh! 
                        Flush! Down the toilet! I’ve been 
                        fertile for six years times twelve 
                        cycles that’s--

                                 BILLIE
                        Your period eggs aren’t fertilized!

                                 SARA JANE
                        So one cell is okay to flush down 
                        the toilet but two cells... no, 
                        that’s a sacred human life.

                                 BILLIE
                        A fertilized egg is still one cell. 
                        But now it has the baby’s DNA.

           The edge of a wave slides up the sand... comes within a foot 
           of Billie’s head... 

                                 SARA JANE
                        So you have one cell that could -- 
                        given some luck and 24 weeks 
                        developing in a womb -- become a 
                        baby.

           ... the wave stops! ... then recedes. Billie can just see it 
           out of the corner of her eye.

                                 BILLIE
                        A cell that’s fixed as to who it 
                        becomes.

                                 SARA JANE
                        No. Identical twins. One cell can 
                        become two babies, so it’s not 
                        fixed. Unless you think identical 
                        twins are the same baby.

                                 BILLIE
                        Maybe they are until they aren’t.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So when does that happen? When 
                        they’re born? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARA JANE (CONT'D)
                        They’re the same person inside but 
                        once they leave the womb they’re 
                        not? What about when only one fetus 
                        survives? Definitely not the same 
                        person then.

           Another wave creeps up... closer... closer... it comes within 
           inches of Billie’s neck...

                                 BILLIE
                        Right after the egg splits!

           ... and recedes.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So it wasn’t a specific baby before 
                        it split.

                                 BILLIE
                        It was! You are totally off topic!

                                 SARA JANE
                        No, it’s your whole argument. You 
                        say that fertilization makes a 
                        specific baby, but I’ve just proved 
                        that it doesn’t. It’s way more 
                        nuanced than that, and when you 
                        decide a fetus is a baby is always 
                        on some level an arbitrary bright 
                        line that reflects your own value 
                        judgments on the effects of that 
                        choice.

           As Sara Jane speaks, a third wave slides towards Billie. Just 
           as Sara Jane finishes, the wave SMACKS Billie’s neck, 
           spraying her with salt water. As Billie SPUTTERS and the wave 
           recedes, a beach ball descends from the heavens and BONKS her 
           on the head.

                                 BILLIE
                        Nothing you say could justify 
                        ending a human life.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I can’t understand how you can be 
                        exposed to valid arguments and 
                        still hold opinions that are so 
                        incredibly wrong!

                                 MAGGIE
                        We are not going to solve abortion 
                        right now.
                                 SARA JANE
                        Were you not listening? I just 
                        solved it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        She wants the law to protect 
                        fertilized eggs, you want the law 
                        to respect people’s control over 
                        their own bodies. We can’t have 
                        both. You disagree on which is more 
                        important.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Okay so you were listening.

                                 MAGGIE
                        And I do not want to be! I want to 
                        be winning an eighth in a 
                        wheelbarrow race!

           Maggie sits down in front of Billie’s head.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Look. I’m not gonna convince you 
                        your beliefs are wrong.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Even though they are.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Even though they are. But can we 
                        come to some sort of cease fire 
                        here? She was literally trying to 
                        help you!

                                 BILLIE
                        And she ended up burying me and my 
                        unborn child under 80 pounds of 
                        sand.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Well, you, anyway.

                                 BILLIE
                        Me and my fetus then! What is it 
                        with you people and your words? You 
                        have buried me and my unborn fetus 
                        under 80 pounds of sand.

           Neither Sara Jane nor Maggie is certain she heard correctly.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You’re actually pregnant?
                                 BILLIE
                        I AM ACTUALLY PREGNANT!

           Sara Jane and Maggie exchange a look. Frantically, they start 
           digging Billie out with their hands. As they dig: 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to Sara Jane)
                        You said she was faking.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (to Billie)
                        You said you didn’t need an 
                        abortion!

                                 BILLIE
                        I don’t need an abortion!

                                 MAGGIE
                        You are a child! Of course you need 
                        an abortion!

                                 SARA JANE
                        How did you become pregnant?

                                 BILLIE
                        Completely none of your business.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Not if you couldn’t consent.

                                 BILLIE
                        Oh, so now the law gets to tell me 
                        what I can do with my body.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m not talking about the law.

                                 BILLIE
                        Seems like a legal question. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        Was the father in a position of 
                        power over you?

                                 BILLIE
                        I did this myself. Like Juno.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You implausibly jumped Michael Cera 
                        before resolving all confusion by 
                        coming out as gay?
                                 BILLIE
                        No, I used a syringe. I don’t think 
                        you watched that movie right.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t think you watched that 
                        movie right.

                                 SARA JANE
                        What you’re saying is you got 
                        pregnant on purpose.

           By this point, Billie is mostly uncovered. She emerges from 
           the sand like a swamp monster to speak her coda:

                                 BILLIE
                        I got pregnant on principle.

           Free of the pit, Billie throws sand in Sara Jane and Maggie’s 
           faces and bolts again. This time, the girls catch her before 
           she can get anywhere. Maggie holds Billie’s arms behind her 
           back as Sara Jane faces her. Sara Jane is furious.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Maggie’s right: I don’t give a shit 
                        what you think or how you got 
                        pregnant or whether or not you end 
                        up okay.

                                 BILLIE
                        You do or else you wouldn’t have 
                        applied to drive. Your mistake was 
                        assuming that everyone thinks like 
                        you.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Wrong. There are literally 
                        thousands of people who have been 
                        placed in a terrible position by 
                        your idiocy. They deserve help. 
                        They deserve to end up okay.

                                 BILLIE
                        And I don’t?

                                 SARA JANE
                        No. I would never have chosen to 
                        help you.

                                 BILLIE
                        Not if I were in mortal danger?

                                 SARA JANE
                        I would watch you drown.
           Billie glares at Sara Jane and hooks her foot back behind 
           Maggie’s ankle and yanks. Thrown off balance, Maggie lets go 
           of Billie so as not to drag her pregnant body down as Maggie 
           falls on her ass. Sara Jane darts to help Maggie and yells 
           after Billie:

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        That’s right! Get outta here! You 
                        deranged fucking coward.

           Sara Jane extends a hand and pulls Maggie up.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah. I’m fine. Thanks. I half 
                        thought you’d chase after her and 
                        leave me here on my ass.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Never.

           Sara Jane’s phone buzzes. A new message reads: Your 
           passenger’s appointment in Washington, DC is in 4 hours. 
           Please drive safely. Only the passenger can update or cancel 
           an appointment.

           Sara Jane looks miserable. Billie is already completely out 
           of sight through the crowds.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What does it say? 

                                 SARA JANE
                        Nothing new.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (realizing)
                        We need to go after her.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah. Unless your idea of the last 
                        best days of our lives involves 
                        visiting me in prison.

           A very HOT GUY walks by. He makes eyes at Maggie. A symbol of 
           everything/one she could be doing. Maggie whines.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        She can’t be far.
           EXT. BOARDWALK

           Billie rushes through the crowd, focused in her frenzy but 
           being careful not to bump her belly against anyone. She sees 
           them up ahead: two large, uniformed BEACH COPS. Billie speed-
           walks and plants herself in front of them.

                                 BILLIE
                        Help! I’ve been kidnapped!

           The beach cops look at her, startled.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I just ran away! I can describe my 
                        abductor--

           One of the beach cops takes out something to make notes on.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        --she’s about five-eight, wearing 
                        an oversized t-shirt--

           The minute she says “she,” the beach cops relax.

                                 BIG BEACH COP
                        Over a swimsuit?

                                 BILLIE
                        No, I don’t think so. Actually I 
                        don’t know. But her name is Sara 
                        Jane and I memorized her license 
                        plate number! It’s 5-N-H-H-9-0--.

                                 TALL BEACH COP
                        You’re saying you’ve been 
                        kidnapped?

                                 BILLIE
                        Yes. In a car probably registered 
                        to the kidnapper.

                                 TALL BEACH COP
                        But you got away.

                                 BILLIE
                        Yes, but my kidnapper is here, at 
                        this beach. Standard procedure in 
                        this kind of a case--

                                 TALL BEACH COP
                        Are you hurt?

                                 BILLIE
                        No.
                                 BIG BEACH COP
                        You raped?

                                 BILLIE
                        I feel like that would go under 
                        “hurt.”

                                 BIG BEACH COP 
                        Not all rapes result in injuries. 
                        They taught us that. No bruises or 
                        cuts or anything and the victim 
                        might still be raped.

                                 BILLIE
                        I’m not raped! Why does everyone 
                        keep asking that?

                                 TALL BEACH COP
                        You don’t seem particularly 
                        distressed.

                                 BILLIE
                        The law doesn’t require me to be 
                        distressed. The law requires me to 
                        be transported across state lines 
                        without the consent of my legal 
                        guardians. Which I was.

                                 TALL BEACH COP
                        You’re a minor?

                                 BIG BEACH COP
                        Are you drunk?

                                 BILLIE
                        No! I’m pregnant.

           She lifts up her shirt to flash her pregnant belly. This 
           alarms the beach cops. They throw their hands up in a “not 
           touching you” motion.

                                 TALL BEACH COP
                        Jesus. Go home!

                                 BILLIE
                        You’re supposed to take me back to 
                        the station!

                                 BIG BEACH COP
                        We’re on duty right now. But if you 
                        sit on that bench right there, when 
                        we go back to the station, we’ll 
                        come and get you and bring you with 
                        us. Okay?
                                 BILLIE
                        She’ll get away.

                                 BIG BEACH COP
                        But you know her plates, right?

                                 BILLIE
                        And where she parked the car.

                                 BIG BEACH COP
                        ‘Atta girl. Sit tight. Any of these 
                        frat boys pick a fight with you, 
                        tell ‘em you’re with us.

           Off Billie.

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BOARDWALK 

           Sara Jane and Maggie prowl the border between the boardwalk 
           and the beach. Maggie is holding a cold water bottle.

           Sara Jane’s phone buzzes. She ignores it. It buzzes again. 
           And again. Then, the long, sustained buzz of a phone call. 
           Sara Jane waits it out. It finally ends. And then rings again-

           Sara Jane picks up the call.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Mom. I know Uncle Randy is there 
                        but I told you I can’t talk today.

                                 BETHANY
                        I got a call from the Grover Police 
                        Department. It’s in North Carolina. 
                        Asking if your car has been stolen.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Because it’s registered to your 
                        address.

                                 BETHANY
                        Well, has it?
                             (off Sara Jane’s silence:)
                        Sara Jane?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Just... don’t call them back.

                                 BETHANY
                        It’s either stolen or it isn’t. I 
                        can stay on while you check.
                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah, I can’t. I’ll call you later.

           Sara Jane hangs up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Have you called the organization?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Can’t. The number I have is a bot.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Shows the importance of human 
                        connection.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Shows the importance of better 
                        screening.

           A COLLEGE GIRL is stumbling drunkenly around in circles as a 
           group of fellow students point and laugh.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Look. No number to text for that.

           The bullying continues. The girl looks really drunk. She 
           trips over a soft cooler. No one helps her.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it.

           Sara Jane grabs Maggie’s water bottle and sprints off. Maggie 
           reacts. Sara Jane approaches the stumbling girl and ducks 
           under her arm to support her, offering her the water bottle.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        There we go. Standing up is not 
                        working so hot. Maybe we sit down. 
                        Do you have a friend to call?

           The girl jolts at her touch and bats the water bottle away.

                                 GIRL
                        Get the fuck off me.

           The girl straightens and backs away smoothly of her own 
           power. She’s not wasted. She was doing a bit.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Oh.
                             (awkward silence)
                        You seemed super drunk.
                                 GIRL
                        And you thought all these people 
                        were just standing there laughing 
                        at me.

           Now, all these people are standing there laughing at Sara 
           Jane. Ironic. Sara Jane slinks back to Maggie.

           Maggie’s phone rings. It’s SJ’S MOM. She shows Sara Jane.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Don’t answer that.

           EXT. BOARDWALK BENCH

           Billie watches the scene. Swimsuit-clad college kids cluster 
           in caste-like bunches. They’re all drunk, and most are openly 
           vaping, but one group seems to be having much more fun than 
           the others. They are louder. They laugh more. The women are 
           more beautiful. The men look richer. One woman doubles over 
           in giggles as she pulls out an “ironically” discordant bottle 
           of Veuve and a handful of red Solo cups. Billie groks it 
           immediately: they’re the POPULAR KIDS. 

           She watches as her beach cops troll the sands, making less-
           popular kids ash out joints and hide handles better. As the 
           cops approach the popular kids, the woman with the Veuve pops 
           the cork, spraying the cops with Yellow-label.

           The tall cop steps in and takes the bottle from her. Other 
           students gather around defensively. From Billie’s vantage 
           point, she can hear snippets of conversation:

                                 TALL BEACH COP
                        ... can’t have glass on the beach.

                                 VEUVE GIRL
                        They don’t sell Veuve in plastic 
                        bottles.

           Billie watches the confrontation escalate. Two cops round up 
           a handful of instigators. As the cops herd their charges back 
           toward the boardwalk, Billie perks up. If they’re taking 
           people to the station, they’ll come and get her.

           Billie watches the cops put the popular ringleaders in a Jeep 
           and drive off. They do not come back for her. Billie lets 
           this sink in. Then she scans the beach for a NEW GROUP of 
           popular kids. There. They’ll do.
           EXT. BEACH 

           Sara Jane and Maggie search for Billie. They see some of the 
           same groups Billie did, from a different angle. Farther down 
           the beach is a boardwalk stage, in front of which has 
           gathered a large crowd. Maggie catches Sara Jane’s eye and 
           gestures toward the stage. Head that way?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Smart. Crowd maximizes her chance 
                        of borrowing a phone.

           That is not why Maggie wanted to go, but she pretends it was:

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah. Exactly.

           EXT. BEACH 

           Billie’s new group is on the move. She tries to fall into 
           step with them. The group morphs amoeba-like to avoid her. 

                                 BILLIE
                        Hey.

           A gangly boy looks at her weird. He continues walking. She 
           singles out the girl in the group who looks most like her.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

                                 EILISHY GIRL
                             (go away)
                        Hey.

           This is not working. Billie keeps awkwardly tagging along as 
           the group approaches the boardwalk stage. There’s Spring 
           Break programming in progress. A bikini’d girl on stage has 
           thrown up her arms in a “victory” sign and screams in 
           triumph. The crowd cheers. 

           At the far edge of the large crowd, Sara Jane and Maggie 
           prowl for Billie. Maggie covertly watches the stage.

           The victor skips toward the edge of the stage and crowd surfs 
           off to the side, where a knot of people forms around her, 
           pumping her up in the air like it’s a Jewish wedding. 

                                 BILLIE
                        The girl with the most friends 
                        wins.
                                 EILISHY GIRL
                        Naw, she goes to our school. She 
                        doesn’t know any of those people. 

           As the new group of popular kids wanders off, Billie focuses 
           on the victor being fêted by her own personal crowd. On 
           stage, an M.C. (male) takes the mic:

                                 M.C.
                        Ladies, it’s time for the event 
                        we’ve all been waiting for. The t-
                        shirts are dress-length but after 
                        what happened last year, we need 
                        you to keep your bottoms on 
                        throughout the contest. 

           Boos from the crowd.

                                 M.C. (CONT’D)
                        I know, I know. Don’t let it deter 
                        you! Marge will check you in to the 
                        right of the stage.

           Billie looks over to where a line of contestants is forming. 
           She gets a rebel gleam in her eye. She approaches MARGE, who 
           looks at Billie’s face approvingly then eyes her pregnancy.

                                 BILLIE
                        What? My body’s not beautiful?

           Marge digs through a pile of t-shirts and pulls out one.

                                 MARGE
                        This should work. Top underneath is 
                        optional.

                                 BILLIE
                        So I’m in?

                                 MARGE
                        Go get ‘em kiddo.

           EXT. STAGE / CROWD

           Billie is on stage left, the last in a line of contestants. 
           She has swapped her streetwear for the white t-shirt, but has 
           kept her bra on. Not so her adult competitors. From Billie’s 
           POV on the stage, we watch as the other contestants compete:

           - A contestant is sprayed with water from a hose nozzle -- 
           she swats at the water while squinching up her face. Soaking 
           wet, her white t-shirt now translucent, she sashays toward 
           the JUDGE: a frat boy sitting on a chair.
           - A different soaking wet contestant pumps her ass backward 
           into the judge’s face.

           - Another contestant slow-vamps burlesque-style, teasingly, 
           then climactically invites the judge to motorboard her 
           through her wet shirt.

           Out in the crowd: Sara Jane taps a spectator on the shoulder 
           and shows her a photo of Billie on her phone. The spectator 
           shakes her head and returns to watching. Nearby, Maggie has 
           her phone out too, but shirks to watch the show.

           On stage: Billie looks determined. It’s her turn. She walks 
           out to center stage. In her giant white t-shirt, she is a 
           notably different shape than the others were. A couple of 
           supportive whoops from the crowd.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ohmygod. SARA JANE! 

           Maggie struggles to get Sara Jane’s attention. 

           Billie faces the hoser like a bull. Just as the spray bursts 
           from the nozzle, she flips around to take the initial impact 
           with her back, protecting her stomach. She arches back to get 
           her face, then rolls so the top of her head takes the impact 
           as she soaks her front.

           Maggie pushes through the crowd toward oblivious Sara Jane.

           Billie steps out of the spray and then slowly, seductively 
           turns to profile. Her now-translucent t-shirt clings to the 
           contour of her belly and she positions her hands in such a 
           way that the crowd realizes: she’s not fat, she’s pregnant. 
           Somehow this is harder to get behind.

           Sara Jane gets a text: Your passenger’s appointment in 
           Washington, DC is in 2 hours. Please drive safely. Only the 
           passenger can update or cancel an appointment. She frowns.

           Billie starts funky-dancing. Lots of elbows and knees and 
           hitchhiker thumbs. There are Olive from Little Miss Sunshine 
           vibes, but inverted. Instead of being inappropriately sexy, 
           she’s being inappropriately... not sexy?

           Behind Billie, the judge motions exasperation at his neglect. 
           The crowd giggles and, sensing that she is not holding her 
           audience, Billie checks behind her to see the judge’s act. 
           Unperturbed, Billie motions to the M.C. to give her the mic. 
           He does. Billie taps the mic, testing it. She turns.

                                 BILLIE
                        Feeling a little neglected?
           Sara Jane’s eyes JERK to the stage, just as Maggie pushes 
           through to her. Immediately, Sara Jane guns for the stage, 
           pushing in vain against the crowd.

           Billie burlesque-walks toward the judge, then abruptly stops.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        So you’re ready to admit you’re the 
                        father...

           The judge throws up his hands and hops out of the chair, 
           pantomiming “Not responsible!” The crowd giggles. Sara Jane 
           keeps trying to push toward the stage, but she’s repulsed. 
           Maggie catches up to her, but they can’t make any headway. 
           They’re stuck. They watch Billie, who addresses the crowd:

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to talk to you about 
                        getting pregnant.

           The crowd giggles uncomfortably.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Now, I’m a couple years younger 
                        than most of you, but that doesn’t 
                        make me an idiot: my guess is 
                        getting pregnant ranks as pretty 
                        much the number-one Spring Break 
                        worst case scenario.

           The crowd laughs.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        But let me spin that around for 
                        you. Isn’t getting pregnant -- 
                        being pregnant -- bringing new life 
                        into the world -- isn’t that the 
                        most powerful, magical thing that 
                        anyone on earth could possibly do? 
                        And isn’t it crazy -- unfair almost 
                        -- that only half of us humans are 
                        physically able to do it? Talk 
                        about superwomen.

           Some supportive whistles and whoops from women in the crowd. 

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        But with great power comes great 
                        responsibility. Uncle Ben stole 
                        that from Churchill who stole it 
                        from Voltaire. Fortunately, the 
                        application in this case is easy:
                             (pauses for effect)
                        Don’t kill the baby.
           That’s a mood shift. The crowd is hushed.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinking: 
                        postpartum depression is real, no 
                        one kills their baby in their right 
                        mind, et cetera et cetera. Let me 
                        narrow it down: don’t kill the baby 
                        before she’s even born.

           Whoa.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Now, a lot of you are thinking: of 
                        course not, that’s insane. But at 
                        the same time, you know that every 
                        year nearly a million babies are 
                        killed by their mothers before 
                        they’re even born. And, guys, I’m 
                        letting you off the hook for this 
                        one. The feminists are right about 
                        something: this is a female issue. 
                        We’re the ones killing babies. And 
                        we’re the ones who can stop it.

           A woman cheers. Another woman yells: FUCK YOU! In response, 
           someone else yells to Billie: KEEP GOING, GIRL!, and is 
           echoed by a smattering of support for Billie. Taken aback, 
           Sara Jane looks in vain for the source of the smattering.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        There is a long tradition of 
                        personal responsibility in this 
                        country. It’s tied to respect. 
                        Respect from your countrymen. 
                        Respect from yourself. For too many 
                        generations, women have been denied 
                        respect. We’ve been told we don’t 
                        matter.

           Calls of: That’s right! Billie sees Sara Jane in the crowd. 
           They lock eyes. Their eyes remain locked as Billie finishes: 

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s time we took responsibility. 
                        For ourselves. For our power. For 
                        the lives we create. Because when 
                        you look at it straight: a choice 
                        between life and death is no choice 
                        at all.

           She drops the mic and the crowd roars. Sara Jane fumes, 
           immobilized by the roaring crowd. The M.C. retrieves the mic.
                                 M.C.
                        Give it up for this little 
                        firecracker! Whether you agree with 
                        her or not, you’ve gotta admit: 
                        it’s sexy when a woman speaks her 
                        mind!

           Billie is helped gently off the stage, where she is 
           surrounded by a knot of ADMIRERS. Sara Jane lunges in the 
           direction of Billie’s exit, but still can’t part the crowd.

           An admirer praises Billie:

                                 BLONDE GIRL
                        You’re so confident! I can’t ima--

           A SENSITIVE FRAT BRO interrupts her:

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        That really resonated with me. My 
                        high-school girlfriend had an 
                        abortion while we were together and 
                        it’s never sat well with me.

                                 REDHEAD GIRL
                        You are just the frickin’ cutest!

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        I’m attracted to independent women, 
                        but we don’t even talk anymore, and 
                        I’m like: I had a kid that I didn’t 
                        even get to meet, you know.

           The redhead girl links her arm possessively around Billie’s.

                                 REDHEAD GIRL
                        You have to come back with us, I 
                        want to know everything about you. 
                        Isn’t she just girl power 
                        personified?

           As this latest group moves away from the stage, Billie moves 
           with it, this time in the very middle.

           Sara Jane sees Billie disappear and looks around for Maggie. 
           Sighting her, Sara Jane gestures that Maggie should follow 
           her out the back of the crowd. Once free, they run around the 
           crowd to where Billie left the stage, but... she’s gone. 
           Nowhere in sight. Sara Jane gets a text from Bethany: PD says 
           your car seen in western NC. I have reported it stolen. Send 
           me vid if not stolen.

                                 SARA JANE
                        GOD DAMN IT!
                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay. Let’s take a break.

           I/E. MOTEL

           College students rail lines off of dirty counters and try to 
           knock each other over using only their butts.

           Sitting on a lounge chair by the pool, surrounded by college 
           students, Billie holds court, telling some sort of story. A 
           butt-naked cannon-baller slices across the foreground to the 
           pool as, behind him, Billie gets to her punchline and 
           everybody laughs.

           EXT. MOTEL POOL

           Billie floats on her back in the center of the motel pool. 
           Others hang around the pool’s edges, but where she is, she’s 
           blissfully alone.

           The gentle curve of her pregnant belly arcs gracefully over 
           the water. Our little bundle of disaster is utterly, 
           entirely, and blissfuly at peace.

           As we relish the quietude, the camera spins slowly around her 
           at water-level, and we track how very young she is. Her face 
           in profile, eyes closed. Her hands, her feet. Then, from 
           overhead, her full body star-fished in pure calm.

           We hold there.

           And hold...

           And hold...

           Until the thinnest trail of red liquid curls out into the 
           pool’s clear water, stemming from between her legs. There’s 
           no pain, so she’s oblivious. In another context, the patterns 
           the blood makes would be beautiful.

           A girl sitting on the edge of the pool is the first to see 
           the blood. She screams and pulls her feet out of the pool. 

           Her female FRIEND, standing next to her chest-deep in the 
           water, catches her gaze and follows it. The friend sprints 
           through the water toward Billie, reaching her first as the 
           sensitive frat bro jumps into the water. 

           Billie’s eyes jolt open, her peace shattered by her rescuers.

                                 BILLIE
                        What the--
           She sees the blood.

                                 BILLIE (CONT’D)
                        No.

                                 FRIEND
                             (to the party)
                        She’s fine! It’s just her period.

                                 BILLIE
                        No it’s not.

           The friend looks at Billie, sees her pregnancy, gets it.

                                 FRIEND
                        How many weeks?

                                 BILLIE
                        Eighteen.

           The friend divides by four and her face falls. You don’t need 
           experience with pregnancy to know: that’s not enough.

                                 FRIEND
                             (to the party)
                        We’ve got to get her to a hospital.

           On that signal, the sensitive bro scoops Billie up and 
           carries her to the edge of the water. Startled, Billie 
           thrashes at first, but by the time she’s being lifted out of 
           the pool, she’s given herself over to the rescue circus.

                                 DRUNK GIRL
                        Clench your vaj and elevate. Keep 
                        the blood inside.

                                 FEET IN WATER GIRL
                        Does anyone have a car?

                                 EXTREMELY DRUNK GUY
                        Not if she bleeds on it.

                                 SOMEONE
                        Call 9-1-1!

                                 SOMEONE ELSE
                        Don’t! They’ll make her pay for an 
                        ambulance.

                                 ANOTHER PERSON
                        Hide the coke! And anything else 
                        illegal!
           The sensitive bro carries Billie out to the parking lot, 
           where he sets her down gently on a curb, minding her head.

           Billie lies on her back with her legs tightly crossed and 
           also up in the air as she listens to the debate:

                                 SOMEONE ELSE (O.S.)
                        I don’t see why someone isn’t just 
                        driving her.

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        Who? 

                                 SOMEONE ELSE (O.S.)
                        Anyone! You!

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        I’m drunk.

                                 SOMEONE ELSE (O.S.)
                        And that has stopped you so many 
                        times in the past.

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        It’s Spring Break. I’m not getting 
                        arrested to drive some chick I 
                        don’t know to the E.R.

           An Uber pulls up. We stay on Billie’s face.

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        See, they’re here. She’ll be fine. 

                                 SOMEONE ELSE (O.S.)
                        So it’s not worth getting arrested 
                        to keep a girl from bleeding out.

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        Not some rando girl who I. Do. Not. 
                        Know. From. Shit.

           The sensitive bro looks down at Billie. His head looms like a 
           surgeon from the perspective of the operating table.

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        I have a car but I’m too drunk to 
                        drive.

                                 BILLIE
                        I need you to find someone for me.
           EXT. BEACH, OFF FROM THE CROWDS

           Sara Jane and Maggie walk on the beach, off from the crowds.

           Ahead of them, upwind so sound travels toward them, MURIEL 
           (late 30s or greater, black) on a beach blanket minds a small 
           group of KIDS (all genders, black) playing with shovels and 
           pails and maybe a Barbie or two.

           Sara Jane and Maggie sit down, facing the water.

           One of the kids, TARELL (7 or 8), bounds around Muriel.

                                 TARELL
                        But I wanna SWIM! Please let me 
                        swim. Please! Please.

                                 MURIEL
                        You can go to your knees, I told 
                        you.

                                 TARELL
                        That’s not swimming, that’s wading.

                                 MURIEL
                        I don’t know what to tell you. I 
                        can’t watch you in the water and 
                        watch everyone else here. And you 
                        need someone to watch you because 
                        you know what will happen if you 
                        drown.

                                 TARELL
                        My mom will be mad.

                                 MURIEL
                        Have you ever seen your mom mad 
                        before?

                                 TARELL
                        No.

                                 MURIEL
                        Do you want to see that?

                                 TARELL
                        No.

           Sara Jane’s face has lit up. She looks at Maggie. Maggie’s 
           face falls. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dude.
                                 SARA JANE
                        I gotta do it.

           She gets up and walks toward Muriel. Maggie bites her lip.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, my friend and I couldn’t help 
                        but overhear -- I’d be happy to 
                        take him for a swim.

           Muriel clocks Sara Jane. What to do about this.

           Tarell also hears her. He starts jumping up and down.

                                 TARELL
                        Yes! Yes yes! SWIMMMMINGGGG!

           Tarell runs in circles.

                                 TARELL (CONT’D)
                        Swimming swimming swimming.

                                 MURIEL
                        That’s very kind of you. I just 
                        can’t responsibly let him go off 
                        with a stranger.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I completely understand. We will 
                        stay right in front of you. Totally 
                        in sight.

                                 TARELL
                        Right in front! Charge!

           Tarell punches his arms like a flying superhero and barrels 
           toward the water.

                                 MURIEL
                        Tarell!

           Muriel stands up and begins to start after him, but stops as 
           if tethered to the other children.

                                 MURIEL (CONT’D)
                        Tarell!

           Sara Jane strips off her cover-up, throws it toward Maggie, 
           and is already after Tarell. In her sporty underwear, she 
           steps into the water at his side. 

           If you thought she was going to bring him back to Muriel, you 
           haven’t been paying attention. Attentively, Sara Jane follows 
           Tarell out into the ocean.
           As they approach the break, Sara Jane lifts Tarell up so he 
           isn’t knocked over.

           Beyond the break, Tarell swims in circles as Sara Jane 
           watches him. He’s a safe swimmer. The break was the risky 
           part.

           Sara Jane sees Tarell tiring out.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You can float, you know.

           She floats on her back, demonstrating. Keeps her head up to 
           keep an eye on him.

           Tarell flips over onto his back and floats.

           The sky is blue.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Perfect, isn’t it?

           Tarell is vertical again, bobbing.

                                 TARELL
                        Kinda not.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (playing along)
                        No? Why not.

                                 TARELL
                             (coy)
                        I dunno.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (still playing)
                        You can tell me.

                                 TARELL
                        Maybe cuz...

           He trails off.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Cuz what?

                                 TARELL
                        Cuz you’re here?

           Sara Jane’s face falls.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Do you wanna go back?
                                 TARELL
                        Yeah.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Stay with me. I’ll help you with 
                        the break.

           EXT. BEACH, OFF FROM THE CROWDS

           Sara Jane walks behind Tarell as he sprints out of the water. 
           Tarell rushes back to Muriel and the other children.

           As Sara Jane ascends the beach, the sensitive frat bro 
           approaches at a run from the direction of the boardwalk. 

           Maggie balls up Sara Jane’s t-shirt.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sara Jane!

           The sensitive frat bro hears the name and homes in on them.

           Sara Jane puts up a hand for the shirt. Maggie throws it. 
           Sara Jane catches it. The sensitive bro catches his breath. 

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        Your friend sent me. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who?

           The sensitive bro is momentarily caught up by the vision that 
           is Maggie. But he stays on-mission.

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        The little pregnant girl. 
                        Something’s wrong with her.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah, we figured that out.

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        Wrong with the pregnancy. They took 
                        her to Tidelands. She asked me to 
                        get you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Us?

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        No.
                             (to Sara Jane)
                        Just you.
           Sopping wet, Sara Jane pulls on the shirt.

           Tarell is chasing and hugging the other kids, making them 
           wet. Since they’re watching the frat bro, Tarell manages to 
           catch them off-guard.

                                 SARA JANE
                        And?

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        She’s asking for you.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I bet she convinced you she’s some 
                        sort of victim, huh?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dude.

           The bro notices that they have an audience of children.

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        Can we maybe have this discussion 
                        on the way to your car?

           Sarah Jane gets that this discussion is not for the children. 
           She turns to Muriel, who is pulling Tarell off of someone.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I have to go. I--

                                 MURIEL
                             (relieved)
                        Go!
                             (fastidiously polite)
                        Thank you so much for your help. 
                             (honest)
                        No one’s asking for you here.

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        Great, let’s go.

           Sara Jane registers what Muriel said as the bro sprints back 
           toward the boardwalk. Maggie follows. Then, like someone 
           whose identity is shattering behind her eyes, Sara Jane.

           We stay behind with Muriel, who watches them go.

                                 MURIEL
                        Fucking white women.

           A beat. Then:
                                 TARELL
                        You said “fucking”! You said 
                        “fucking”!

           The other kids join in with Tarell, all chanting together. 
           Muriel reacts. The gift that keeps on giving.

           EXT. E.R. ENTRANCE

           Billie arrives alone in an Uber at the entrance to the E.R. 
           She opens the car door. No one comes to help her in. She 
           waddles out and slams the door shut. The UBER DRIVER rolls 
           down the front passenger window.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        I’m gonna have to charge a clean-
                        up. I know this is not what you 
                        wanna hear, but this is my 
                        livelihood.

                                 BILLIE
                        It’s not my account.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Ah. So you don’t mind if I give 
                        them one star.

                                 BILLIE
                        Give them zero. Zero stars.

           Billie waddles to the doors, which whoosh open automatically.

           INT. E.R. RECEIVING ROOM

           Billie waddles into the E.R. It’s full of carpetbagging 
           college students who have partied a little too hard:

           - A boy holds a bag of frozen vegetables to his head, 
           whimpering into his stars-and-stripes bandana.

           - A girl lies on a bench, her swollen ankle raised high in 
           the air.

           - A girl in pajamas’ eyes have swollen shut. She holds 
           eyeglasses in one hand and a contact case in the other.

           Billie doesn’t know whom to talk to.

           Someone barely visible across the room is hysterically crying 
           and yelling. A nurse walks over to quiet her down. Billie 
           clocks that. Close on her as she closes her eyes and opens 
           her mouth to scream.
           EXT. MYRTLE BEACH ALLEY

           Maggie and the sensitive frat bro reach the covered car 
           first. It’s a flirty race, where Maggie’s been leading but 
           once they get to the car, he grabs her around the waist and 
           holds her back so he can slap the car before she does. She 
           squeals in delighted protest. 

           Sara Jane trots up sullenly behind them.

           Maggie playfully bats the bro away (he quickly releases her), 
           then tosses Sara Jane the keys. Sara Jane doesn’t catch them. 
           They hit the ground with a clank.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m not going.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What the fuck.

                                 SARA JANE
                        She’s not gonna suddenly be a good 
                        person.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So? She’s in trouble.

                                 SARA JANE
                        She’s lied about that before.

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        She was definitely bleeding.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Not my problem.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who are you?

                                 SARA JANE
                        The point of finding her was to get 
                        her to pretend that none of this 
                        ever happened. If she’s at a 
                        hospital, that’s a credible third-
                        party record. The only chance I had 
                        was there being no hard evidence. 
                        But now that there is... it’s out 
                        of my hands. Nothing to be done.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re serious.
                                 SARA JANE
                        I don’t know how to destroy 
                        hospital records. That’s beyond my 
                        capabilities.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (disgusted)
                        That’s not why you should go. You 
                        spent all day being so obsessed 
                        with helping people, and now here’s 
                        someone who needs you, actually 
                        asking for your help.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Why her? Why not literally anyone 
                        else?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why not someone you could feel good 
                        about helping?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Is that so wrong?

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s selfish.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I don’t have a right to be selfish?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You do. It just doesn’t help. 

           Sara Jane’s phone buzzes. It’s Bethany. Sara Jane picks up on 
           speaker.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Now Maggie really IS upset, because 
                        she wants me to drive my car, which 
                        I don’t want to do for several 
                        reasons, including because you 
                        reported it stolen and driving it 
                        anywhere right now is itself a 
                        crime.

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        Hello to you too.

                                 SARA JANE
                        And you know what? Maybe you’re 
                        right. Maybe I should get a job in 
                        the private sector and buy a car 
                        that is registered solely to ME.
                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        Don’t you want to know why I’m 
                        calling?

                                 SARA JANE
                        No!

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                        The police in Grover asked where 
                        you were and I told them you were 
                        on Spring Break in Myrtle Beach, 
                        but I’m calling to ask what hotel.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You told them I’m in Myrtle Beach.

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                             (sincere)
                        But it sounds like your car wasn’t 
                        stolen after all, so now I don’t 
                        know what’s going on.

                                 SARA JANE
                        No, you don’t!

                                 BETHANY (O.S.)
                             (hurt)
                        Well, I would if you’d tell me.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Or you wouldn’t need to if you 
                        trusted that I know what I’m doing! 

           Bethany hangs up. Sara Jane stares at her phone. Maggie and 
           the sensitive frat bro stare at Sara Jane. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s it. I’m done. I have stuck 
                        by you all day today, after you 
                        tricked me into thinking you came 
                        here to “do Spring Break.” You 
                        don’t care about Spring Break. You 
                        never cared about Spring Break. 
                        You’re only here because it’s the 
                        last place you thought they’d look 
                        for someone as principled as you. I 
                        told you from the start that this 
                        was a bad idea, and you did it 
                        anyway, and here we are.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (bitter/biting)
                        If I’d known I was so unworthy of 
                        your company, I wouldn’t have come.
                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s what you don’t get. I’m glad 
                        you’re here. This is what being a 
                        person is. Helping people even 
                        though they’re wrong.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I can’t help someone who has shitty 
                        beliefs. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why the hell not?

                                 SARA JANE
                        She doesn’t deserve it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’ve tried everything else.
                             (to sensitive bro)
                        C’mon... what’s your name?

                                 SENSITIVE FRAT BRO
                        Cody.

                                 MAGGIE
                        C’mon, Cody. You’ve gotta meet my 
                        friends.

           Maggie starts toward the beach. Then she stops, turns back:

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Someday you’ll realize that you 
                        need help you don’t deserve. And 
                        you’ll be too sanctimonious to ask 
                        for it.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I don’t want anything I don’t 
                        deserve.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You do. And when you’re ready to 
                        admit it, call me. And not before.

           Maggie storms off. Cody obediently trots off behind her.

           Sara Jane is left all alone. She storms silently. Then she 
           picks up her keys and starts to uncover the car.

           INT. E.R. RECEIVING ROOM

           Billie goes through an intake checklist with a nurse.
                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        And how long have you been 
                        experiencing these symptoms?

                                 BILLIE
                        I dunno. My grasp of time is fucked 
                        today.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        So just today.

                                 BILLIE
                        Yeah, just now. Like it just 
                        started.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Do you have a primary care 
                        physician in the area? Or an O-B-G-
                        Y-N?

                                 BILLIE
                        No. I don’t live here. I’m bleeding 
                        from my vagina and it feels like 
                        something is like coming out.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Right. Sounds like a spontaneous 
                        abortion. I’ll put you in for a 
                        room and we’ll have a doctor 
                        confirm.

                                 BILLIE
                        I’m sorry, a what?

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Hun, the doctor will tell you.

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / US-17

           Sara Jane drives. 

           She gets a text on Signal: Your passenger’s appointment in 
           Washington, DC is in 1 hour. Check-in is in 30 minutes. 
           Please drive safely. Only the passenger can update or cancel 
           an appointment.

           She fishes Billie’s phone out of the driver’s door and tries 
           to unlock it. She can’t. She tosses it on the passenger seat.

           It lights up on impact and we see its background: Billie 
           scowling at the camera in a pop star crouch. Sara Jane looks 
           at the photo, and her expression changes. She drives faster.
           INT. HOSPITAL

           The real Billie is in a wheelchair sitting on a pile of gauze-
           like pads as a nurse wheels her toward a room with other 
           NURSES standing in front of it.

                                 NURSE
                        I need that room. We’ve got a 
                        spontaneous abortion.

                                 BILLIE
                        I DON’T WANT AN ABORTION.

           The nurse wheels Billie into the room.

                                 NURSE
                        You don’t have a choice in the 
                        matter. That’s what “spontaneous” 
                        means.

                                 BILLIE
                        I AM MORALLY OPPOSED TO ABORTION.

           The nurse puts a gown and a stack of paper sheets on the bed.

                                 NURSE
                        Hun, you’re having a miscarriage. 
                        You can be morally opposed all you 
                        want, that’s just the medical term. 
                        This is happening whether you want 
                        it or not.

                                 BILLIE
                        That’s not fair.

                                 NURSE
                        Not a bit. Up. You have a bed now; 
                        other people need the chair.

           Billie waddles to the bed. Looks at the pile of paper sheets. 
           Billie spreads the sheets out on the bed.

           EXT. E.R. ENTRANCE

           Sara Jane pulls up in front of the E.R. She gets out of the 
           car and lopes toward the sliding doors. A passing HOSPITAL 
           WORKER notices that no one is in the car anymore.

                                 HOSPITAL WORKER
                        Miss, you can’t leave that car 
                        there.
                                 SARA JANE
                        I need to--

                                 HOSPITAL WORKER
                        You’re not the only car at the 
                        emergency room. If you can run like 
                        that you can park the car.

           Sara Jane returns to her car. From her POV, we move forward 
           in the car toward a sign that reads “Hospital Parking.” Sara 
           Jane drives down a ramp toward a parking gate. She rolls down 
           the window and ferociously punches the button for a ticket.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Billie lies on the hospital bed with her pelvis elevated. She 
           looks at the door. No one comes in.

           I/E. PARKING GARAGE

           Sara Jane prowls the lines of full parking spots on one of 
           the highest floors of the garage, looking for an opening.

           OTHER PART OF GARAGE:

           The car parked, Sara Jane grabs a pair of sweatpants out of 
           the trunk and pulls them on. She now has her wallet.

           Sara Jane’s phone buzzes: You have missed the 30-minute check-
           in for your passenger’s appointment. Failure to appear will 
           revoke your approval as a driver.

           She closes the trunk, beeps her car locked and looks around 
           for the stairs. They are at the other end of the garage. 
           Naturally. She sprints toward the stairs.

           GARAGE STAIRS:

           Sara Jane climbs the stairs around and around down down down.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Billie stares at the ceiling. It is made of particle-board 
           tiles separated by half-inch white bands. It has those dots 
           that could take a lifetime to count.

           EXT. E.R. ENTRANCE

           Sara Jane trots toward the whooshing doors.
           INT. E.R. RECEIVING ROOM

           Sara Jane enters the E.R. and looks around for Billie. Not 
           there. She approaches a desk where the same receiving nurse 
           is seated. She shows the nurse Billie’s photo on Billie’s 
           phone background.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Hi, I’m looking for this patient? 
                        She’s having some sort of pregnancy 
                        complication. 

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        And you are?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Sara Jane Wrightship.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Are you family?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Mmhm. And what’s the patient name?

           Sara Jane stares at her dumbly.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t look her up from a picture.

           That’s entirely reasonable. Here’s the thing: “Billie” is not 
           Billie’s name.

           We can see it on Sara Jane’s face: that is a thing she should 
           know. Then the mask goes up. She is in full lying mode.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I don’t know what name she would 
                        have given.

           The nurse is unimpressed.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        She’s been through a lot. She has 
                        some fake IDs. She’s fourteen. 
                        She’s pregnant. Something’s wrong. 
                        Black hair with green roots. There 
                        can’t be another one. She asked me 
                        to be here. She sent someone across 
                        town to get me.
                             (a beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t make her go through 
                        this alone.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Give me your I.D. If she’s here, 
                        I’ll have someone ask her.

           Sara Jane hesitates. Then she gives the nurse her driver’s 
           license. The nurse takes the driver’s license and makes a 
           photocopy of it. She takes a slip of colored paper headed 
           “visit request form” and scribbles “family” in a box, then 
           staples it to the photocopy.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You can sit down now.

           Sara Jane retreats to an empty chair. She can see the 
           receiving nurse give the form to the nurse who wheeled Billie 
           to her room. The nurse asks the receiving nurse who the 
           family member is. The receiving nurse nods toward Sara Jane. 
           The other nurse clocks her, then leaves.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           The wheeling nurse enters the room. She takes Billie’s blood.

                                 BILLIE
                        Where’s the doctor?

                                 NURSE
                        He’s coming. Just as fast as he 
                        can. This lady says you called her? 
                        Do you want me to let her in to be 
                        with you?

           The nurse shows Billie the photocopy of Sara Jane’s driver’s 
           license. Billie looks at the black-and-white scan. Then, she 
           bursts into tears.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Hun?

           Billie nods.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then. Sign this.

           Billie signs. The nurse leaves and, still lying on her back 
           with her pelvis raised, Billie continues to quietly sob.
           INT. E.R. RECEIVING ROOM

           Sara Jane waits. She texts Bethany: I’m sorry. I was awful. 
           That wasn’t about you. The three dots float on her screen: 
           Bethany is typing. They disappear. After agonizing seconds, 
           Bethany’s reply comes through: It’s okay, sweetie. Turns out 
           Randy is very unhappy at work. His job lacks meaning. We’ll 
           talk when you’re ready.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE (O.S.)
                        Sara Jane Wrightship?

           Sara Jane jumps up and trots over to the desk.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You can see her. She’s in 216. 

           The nurse points at the doors to the hall of rooms. Sara Jane 
           walks to the doors. Ceremoniously, she opens them and walks 
           through.

           INT. E.R. HALLWAY

           Sara Jane finds Room 216. She opens it and walks in.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Billie is tear-stained but not crying. She sees Sara Jane.

                                 BILLIE
                        You came.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I thought this might be a sting.

           She sits down next to Billie.

                                 BILLIE
                        I wish it was.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I... I’m sorry something’s wrong.

                                 BILLIE
                        The nurse said I’m having a 
                        miscarriage.

                                 SARA JANE
                        What did the doctor say?

                                 BILLIE
                        He hasn’t come.
                                 SARA JANE
                        How long’s it been?

           She picks up Billie’s chart. It says Abigail Bentley. ABBY. 

                                 ABBY
                        I dunno.

                                 SARA JANE
                        This you?

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Abigail or Abby?

                                 ABBY
                        Abby.

                                 SARA JANE
                        What do you want me to do? Do you 
                        want me to go try to get him? Do 
                        you want me to call your mom?

                                 ABBY
                        I wasn’t gonna tell her until it 
                        was six months and no one could 
                        stop me.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I think you have to tell her now.

                                 ABBY
                             (aggressive)
                        I don’t need you to think for me.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (matching her tone)
                        So I’ll just sit here and be quiet.

                                 ABBY
                             (softly, sincere)
                        Yeah.

           Sara Jane is caught off-guard. She sits back down next to 
           Abby. Silently.

           Sara Jane puts out her hand. 

           It hangs there for a moment.

           Abby takes it. And squeezes hard.
           Sara Jane looks at the wall and thinks.

           After a long time, she says:

                                 SARA JANE
                        It would be better if this could 
                        happen near home.

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah.

           They sit together. For long enough that when the doctor comes 
           in, we almost don’t want him to.

           The DOCTOR knocks and enters. He glances at the girls.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Good, you’ve elevated. Is there 
                        leakage of fluids?

                                 ABBY
                        Yes. I am leaking.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Any vaginal bleeding?

                                 ABBY
                        Yes.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Any contractions? Do you feel any 
                        movement?

                                 ABBY
                        Maybe, should I?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Let’s take a look. You’re how many 
                        weeks?

                                 ABBY
                        Eighteen.

           He looks. With a speculum. We focus on faces.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yeah, this is an inevitable 
                        spontaneous abortion.

           Sara Jane reacts to hearing the term for the first time.
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        It’s only a matter of time -- the 
                        products of conception will come 
                        out eventually. I’d have to do an 
                        ultrasound to be sure, but most 
                        likely it’s an incompetent cervix. 
                        Unusual in your age cohort but 
                        could be the result of past trauma 
                        to the area. Have you ever had a 
                        D&C? Any other type of cervical 
                        trauma?

                                 ABBY
                        No.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Huh. Genetic, then. Rare, but it 
                        happens. Not usually so young. But 
                        it’s definitely an incompetent 
                        cervix. You’re already too far 
                        dilated for a cerclage.

                                 SARA JANE
                        What are you saying?

                                 DOCTOR
                        The time for intervention on this 
                        was weeks ago. She’s so far 
                        dilated, as soon as we tip her down 
                        it’s gonna slide right out. But the 
                        good news is, next time you get 
                        pregnant, get a little cerclage at 
                        fourteen weeks, sooner if you want, 
                        that’ll hold it in through full 
                        term.

                                 ABBY
                        What’s a cerclage?

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s a little band, like a loop? 
                        That stitches it together. It’s the 
                        treatment for an incompetent 
                        cervix.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Can you stop calling her cervix 
                        incompetent?

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s just the medical term.
                                 ABBY
                        Could stress or running or being 
                        buried in sand have caused this?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Absolutely not. It’s a problem with 
                        your cervix, not with the fetus. 
                        Have you had contractions the last 
                        couple of days?

                                 ABBY
                        No.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Then there’s no way you could have 
                        known. No one puts a prophylactic 
                        cerclage in a teenager.

                                 ABBY
                        But what did I do wrong?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Probably nothing. Are you ready?

                                 ABBY
                        No.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’re gonna lie upside down 
                        forever?

                                 ABBY
                        Would that work?

                                 DOCTOR
                        No.

                                 ABBY
                        Okay.

           The doctor removes what’s propping up Abby’s hips and guides 
           her into a sitting up position. And, just as the doctor said, 
           something slides out onto the bed. It’s an orb the size of 
           Abby’s hands, cupped together. Or an apple, if that’s easier.

           The sac is glazed with blood but itself is somewhere between 
           clear and amber, filled with a translucent fluid. It looks 
           unearthly, like an egg from an alien world. The doctor puts 
           it in a plastic tray.

                                 DOCTOR
                        En caul. You don’t see that every 
                        day. Do you want me to pierce it 
                        and expose the fetus?
                                 ABBY
                        She’s in there?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yeah.

                                 ABBY
                        I want her to stay in there. It 
                        looks... warm.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Okay. I’ll send someone in for it.

           The doctor leaves.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You don’t want to hold it?

           Abby shakes her head.

                                 ABBY
                        I know what it looks like. This is 
                        nicer.

           A nurse comes in and takes the tray. Sara Jane holds out an 
           arm to stop her.

                                 SARA JANE
                             (to Abby)
                        Do you need more time?

           Abby takes one last look at the orb. Then she shakes her head 
           no. The nurse takes the tray away.

           Abby and Sara Jane sit in silence.

           The nurse comes back with a menstrual pad.

                                 NURSE
                        You can get dressed now.

           INT. E.R. RECEIVING ROOM

           Abby and Sara Jane stand at the desk. Abby wears her clothes.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Come back in a week for a follow-
                        up.

                                 ABBY
                        I am never coming back here.
                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Well, call then, to get the report 
                        sent to your doctor. No baths, no 
                        swimming, showers only, no 
                        strenuous exercise, no sex, no 
                        tampons, no douches. Come back if 
                        something smells bad, if you have a 
                        fever, if you have a elevated heart 
                        rate, if you feel weak or dizzy, or 
                        if you’re bleeding through more 
                        than one pad an hour.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m never coming back.

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        To an emergency room. Any emergency 
                        room.

           A beat.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That’s it?

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        You’re free to go.

                                 SARA JANE
                        What can she expect today, 
                        tomorrow, this week?

                                 RECEIVING NURSE
                        Ma’am, I am not the internet. Ask 
                        your primary care doctor or a 
                        friend who’s had a miscarriage. 
                        This is an emergency room and there 
                        are patients to attend to.

           Off the girls.

           EXT. E.R. ENTRANCE

           Sara Jane and Abby stand side-by-side outside the entrance to 
           the E.R. Sara Jane gets a final message on Signal: You have 
           missed your passenger’s appointment. Your approval as a 
           driver has been revoked and future appointments have been 
           reassigned.

                                 ABBY
                        Was that Maggie?
                                 SARA JANE
                        No, the Network. We missed your 
                        appointment, so I’m not allowed to 
                        drive for them anymore.

                                 ABBY
                        You don’t seem mad.

           It’s a good observation. Every past text has provoked Sara 
           Jane. For the first time, she doesn’t care.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I guess I’m not.

           She and Abby stand there, at a loss. The silence goes on a 
           little too long.

                                 ABBY
                        Okay, gimme my phone.

           Sara Jane pauses, considers her instinct not to, then does. 
           Abby checks her texts.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I can drive you home.

                                 ABBY
                        You can’t. There’s cops at my 
                        house. And all around it.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Shit.

                                 ABBY
                        It’s fine. Just take your plates 
                        off and don’t go home for a few 
                        days.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That’s not gonna work. 

                                 ABBY
                        I’d call them off but they’d only 
                        believe me in person.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah, I just had that thought.

           A beat. Abby opens up her camera in selfie mode and records:

                                 ABBY
                        Hey. My name is Abigail Bentley and 
                        I’m of sound mind or whatever and 
                        not under any sort of duress. 
           She lifts up the phone to get Sara Jane in the shot over her 
           shoulder, standing a non-threatening distance away.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        That’s Sara Jane. I don’t know her 
                        last name but if you’re watching 
                        this, you do.

           Abby walks the phone around so you get a sense for the safety 
           and normalcy of the situation. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, so. As you can see from the 
                        metadata of this video, we are 
                        still in South Carolina and I’m not 
                        kidnapped. It was all just a joke 
                        that got out of hand. If I say 
                        anything else on the stand, which I 
                        might, I’ll be lying. I made this 
                        video to prove that we never left 
                        the state, and I’m going to send it 
                        to her. Please consider it grounds 
                        for reasonable doubt or whatever. 
                        Thanks. Peace and love.

           Abby turns off the video.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Turn on your bluetooth.

           Stunned, Sara Jane does. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, accept it.

           Sara Jane does.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got it?

           Sara Jane opens the video file.

                                 ABBY (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hey. My name is Abigail Bentley and 
                        I’m of sound mind or whatever--

           Sara Jane stops the video.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Now take me to the bus station. The 
                        Greyhound runs through Greenville.
                                 SARA JANE
                        Okay.
                             (beat)
                        Wait here. I’ll get the car.

           EXT. BUS STATION

           Sara Jane and Abby stand in front of a bus. It’s boarding.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You’ll call your mom when you get 
                        to Greenville?

                                 ABBY
                        Naw. I don’t want her to know what 
                        happened.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So you’ll take an Uber.

                                 ABBY
                        It’s her account. She’d see.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You want me to sign mine in?

                                 ABBY
                        No.

                                 SARA JANE
                        What’ll you do?

                                 ABBY
                        What do you care? You have the 
                        video. This is over for you. Like 
                        it never happened. No one will 
                        prosecute against that and I can’t 
                        take it back.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That’s true.

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, it is.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Goodbye, I guess?

                                 ABBY
                        Bye.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Goodbye, Abby.
           INT. GREYHOUND BUS

           Abby sits alone in her row, the green in her hair oddly 
           complementary of the 90s upholstery on the seat: red, yellow, 
           indigo, green, and lots of cyan -- speckles, wisps and 
           circles too big to be dots.

           She tries to turn on her phone. It won’t start up. Battery’s 
           died. Abby looks bored. Then, thinking, she looks sad. She 
           shakes herself out of it and looks around for something to 
           distract her. There’s nothing. It’s a bus. For a minute, it 
           looks like she’s going to cry. But she doesn’t.

           EXT. E.R. ENTRANCE

           A police car is parked in front of the emergency room, like 
           Sara Jane was. No one makes the cop move his car. His partner 
           walks out of the emergency room, gesturing in exasperation: 
           they missed them.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS

           The bus is stopped at the Greenville bus stop. Abby’s not 
           paying attention. People file past her for the door.

                                 BUS DRIVER (O.S.)
                        GREENVILLE.

           Abby starts. She looks up. Abby exits the bus, trying to 
           power up her phone. It’s still dead. Abby looks up.

           In front of her, sitting like a pin-up girl on the hood of 
           her dusty, plateless Ford Fusion, is Sara Jane.

           Abby reacts, then speaks:

                                 ABBY
                        You drove four hours to meet me at 
                        the bus station.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That is what I did.

                                 ABBY
                        Why.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I was worried you wouldn’t tell 
                        your parents about the miscarriage.

                                 ABBY
                        I wouldn’t.
                                 SARA JANE
                        They need to get you some therapy.

                                 ABBY
                        They’re not really therapy people.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Exactly. You’ve had a pretty 
                        traumatic day.

                                 ABBY
                        So you drove four hours to meet me 
                        at the bus station.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes.

                                 ABBY
                        Fuck you.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Huh?

                                 ABBY
                        That’s right. Fuck. You.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I probably should have expected 
                        that.

                                 ABBY
                        What was your plan?

                                 SARA JANE
                        I was gonna offer you moral support 
                        while you talk to your parents 
                        about what happened.

                                 ABBY
                        And your earlier concern about the 
                        police presence at my home somehow 
                        evaporated.

                                 SARA JANE
                        No. I believe you that your home is 
                        surrounded by cops.

                                 ABBY
                        And your plan for that was...

                                 SARA JANE
                        To avoid them. By taking some sort 
                        of secret backroad local alleyway, 
                        which you would tell me about.
                                 ABBY
                        Because in this plan I’m on board.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes.

                                 ABBY
                        Because you drove four hours to 
                        meet me at the bus station.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes.

                                 ABBY
                        Well, fuck you and your grand 
                        gesture and your absolutely 
                        crackbrained plan which truly 
                        expands the definition of idiocy.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You don’t like the plan.

                                 ABBY
                        The plan is bad.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It’s provisional.

                                 ABBY
                        What I don’t like is you. You think 
                        you’re better than me, and I feel 
                        like you’re winning, and fuck you.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I’m winning? The law is on your 
                        side!

                                 ABBY
                        And somehow you still don’t respect 
                        me! You just keep going like I 
                        don’t even matter. Like I don’t 
                        deserve to think for myself.

           A beat.

                                 SARA JANE
                        You’re right. I do think that.

           Abby looks up at the gravity of the admission.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        I think you’re wrong about pretty 
                        much everything, in a lot of 
                        hurtful ways.
                                 ABBY
                        Fuck you.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I can’t do anything about that. I 
                        really can’t, and it kills me. 
                        There’s nothing I can say or do 
                        that will change your mind. But I 
                        can do this. Because I know you 
                        need it, and I think you know too.

           Abby doesn’t retort.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to need help to get 
                        through the next few weeks. That’s 
                        why we need to talk to your 
                        parents.

                                 ABBY
                        By running a police gauntlet back 
                        to my house.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes.

                                 ABBY
                        You’re gonna get us both killed.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Police don’t shoot white girls.

                                 ABBY
                        Let me drive.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Absolutely not.

                                 ABBY
                        I know the area and you don’t. You 
                        said it yourself, it’s the whole 
                        crux of your plan.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Right, but you can just tell me 
                        where to go.

                                 ABBY
                        Not if things get hairy. There 
                        won’t be time -- you gotta go on 
                        instinct.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Can you even drive?
                                 ABBY
                        My mom can do it. How hard can it 
                        be?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah no.

                                 ABBY
                        It shows you’re not kidnapping me. 
                        If I’m driving, I’m in control.

                                 SARA JANE
                        That actually makes sense.

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah.

                                 SARA JANE
                        And you want that: to be in 
                        control?

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Okay.

                                 ABBY
                        Okay?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Okay. Fuck it. Let’s do this.

           Sara Jane tosses Abby the keys. Abby catches them.

           Sara Jane goes around to the passenger side door and gets in 
           the car. Abby gets into the driver’s seat. Both buckle up. 
           Abby adjusts the seat and the mirrors and looks at the dash.

                                 ABBY
                        Where do I put the key?

                                 SARA JANE
                        The key can be anywhere in the car.

                                 ABBY
                        Then why did you throw it to me?

                                 SARA JANE
                        So you’d have control.

           Abby considers. Nods.
                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Now put your foot on the break and 
                        press the ON button. Can I turn on 
                        your lights for you?
                             (off Abby’s nod)
                        Okay, keep your foot on the break. 
                        I’m gonna put it in drive. Now, 
                        when you take your foot off the 
                        break, it’ll start to go. Now, gas, 
                        breaks, and steering. The car’s 
                        automatic, so that’s all there is.

                                 ABBY
                        What if I need to go backwards.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Brake to a stop and yell “reverse” 
                        and I’ll shift for you. Then gas.

           Abby starts to slowly pull out of the parking spot. Sara Jane 
           takes out her own phone and also Abby’s phone.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Just practice driving around the 
                        lot while I do some recon. Unlock 
                        your phone for me?

           Abby puts her thumb on her phone without taking her eyes off 
           the road. It unlocks. Sara Jane opens both phones to Google 
           Maps and starts tapping on them.

                                 ABBY
                        What’re you doing?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Checking possible routes for 
                        reports of police cars and 
                        checkpoints. Hopefully your 
                        neighbors are flagging all of them.

                                 ABBY
                        Dum spiro spero.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Huh?

                                 ABBY
                        “While I breathe I hope.” State 
                        motto. You ready?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah. Avoid Woodruff. There’s one 
                        near it and whatever SC-14 is.
                                 ABBY
                        Copy.

           Abby pulls out of the parking lot a back way and onto a road.

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / GREENVILLE

           The area around the bus stop has wide, spacious roads and 
           well-kept strip malls, peppered with woodsy conifer trees.

           Sara Jane pulls up alternate routes on the two phones, 
           checking stretches of road ahead for little teardrop icons 
           indicating police presence.

                                 SARA JANE
                        I think the general strategy is to 
                        avoid big roads...

                                 ABBY
                        Groundbreaking.

                                 SARA JANE
                        ... and to cross them as far away 
                        as possible from where I can see 
                        the police are stationed.

                                 ABBY
                        Got it.

           Abby drives the jerky, halting way of someone just learning.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So, if we keep going straight we 
                        hit a cop in four blocks. Let me 
                        check right versus left.

                                 ABBY
                        I can’t just sit here at the 
                        intersection.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Right! Turn right and then left.

           Abby turns right. Instead of turning left, she goes straight.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        I said left! There’s another cop 
                        ahead!

                                 ABBY
                        You didn’t say when to turn left!
                                 SARA JANE
                        The immediate next left! Pull over. 
                        Now make like a U-turn and then a 
                        right. Good. Now pull over behind 
                        that SUV and wait a second.

           Abby does. Sara Jane puts the car in park and pores over the 
           map. Abby looks over at it. Sara Jane has focused in on the 
           major road just up ahead.

                                 ABBY
                        There are like twelve cops all 
                        clustered together on that road?

                                 SARA JANE
                        I think it’s one cop and he’s 
                        driving back and forth.

                                 ABBY
                        And people are reporting him at 
                        different points.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yeah.

                                 ABBY
                        Can we go around?

                                 SARA JANE
                        We could if we knew how far he was 
                        driving.

                                 ABBY
                        This is hard.

                                 SARA JANE
                        We just need to cross without him 
                        noticing.

           Sara Jane rolls down the window and leans out to try to scope 
           out the street.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t see around the SUV.

           This sparks an idea.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Here’s what you’re gonna do.
           I/E. SAME - MINUTES LATER

           Sara Jane is twisted around in the passenger seat, watching 
           the street behind them. Quickly she faces front again.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Okay, this one. Close but not 
                        touching.

           A GIANT SUV passes them, and Abby pulls out behind it. As the 
           intersection with the major street approaches, she rides the 
           tail of the SUV, completely eclipsed by its heft.

           A COP CAR drives past on the major street. The Fusion 
           tailgates the SUV across the intersection.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Now pull off.

           Abby turns onto another small road, losing the SUV. Sara taps 
           at the phones.

                                 ABBY
                        I know where we are. I can get us 
                        home from here.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Fantastic. All clear.

           I/E. SARA JANE’S CAR / ABBY’S NEIGHBORHOOD

           The neighborhood has become residential. Sidewalks, trees, 
           happy suburban houses.

                                 ABBY
                        We’re two minutes away.

           Abby turns the corner. Up ahead, heading straight at them is 
           a POLICE CAR. Abby slams on the breaks.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        REVERSE!

           Sara Jane puts the car in reverse. Abby pulls back around the 
           corner and reverses down the block she just came up.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME THERE WAS A 
                        COP THERE?

                                 SARA JANE
                        He wasn’t on the map!
           Abby reverses into an intersection and stops.

                                 ABBY
                        FORWARD!

           Sara Jane puts the car in drive. Abby pulls forward.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Why wasn’t he on the map??

           There’s a siren now, the police car definitely saw them and 
           is following them. Sara Jane fusses with Google Maps.

                                 SARA JANE
                        No one reported him! I can only see 
                        what’s on the app!

                                 ABBY
                        The app is not useful unless it 
                        shows ALL of the cops!

                                 SARA JANE
                        It showed a lot of the cops!

                                 ABBY
                        Just not the one chasing us.

                                 SARA JANE
                        It shows him now. I reported him.

           They pass another police car, which joins the chase.

                                 ABBY
                        How about that one? Was that one on 
                        the app?

                                 SARA JANE
                        That one was.

           A third police car appears as backup, behind the other two. 
           And then, noisy overhead: a helicopter. It’s over.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, we should look for a public 
                        place to pull over, with lots of 
                        witnesses.

                                 ABBY
                        We’re not pulling over. 

                                 SARA JANE
                        We’re not?
                                 ABBY
                        We’re not there yet.

           The Fusion continues to speed erratically down the street. 
           The lead police car gains on them from behind.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Is he gonna bump us?

           Sara Jane turns around in the passenger seat to look.

                                 SARA JANE
                        If he does, accelerate. It’ll 
                        lessen the impact.

                                 ABBY
                        Right. Obviously.

           The police car doesn’t bump them. Instead, it SHOOTS a barbed 
           net off its front at the Fusion’s back wheel. The Grappler 
           Police Bumper net is tied to a line secured to the front of 
           the police car.

           Abby characteristically swerves just as the net is shot and 
           it MISSES.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Fuck yeah!

           Sara Jane turns back around front and sees straight ahead and 
           rapidly approaching: Abby’s family’s home. 

           It’s the nice house from the beginning, with a picturesque 
           windowed breakfast nook in its center. Through the tall, 
           paned windows, we can see that the breakfast nook is 
           currently empty.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Abby?

           The police car SHOOTS a SECOND NET at the other back wheel. 

           The net HITS the Fusion’s wheel and WRAPS around the tire, 
           puncturing it and tethering the Fusion to the front of the 
           police car. Abby feels the impact, mistakes it for a bump, 
           and ACCELERATES.

           The cop car slows to a stop and we watch the line reel out.

           The Fusion hurtles on collision course for the house. Unless 
           the police tether stops it in time, the Fusion’s gonna crash 
           into the house. The Fusion jumps the curb, hurtles across the 
           front lawn -- there’s still time for the leash to stop it! -- 
           until it CRASHES into the breakfast nook.
           The front of the car crumples, glass and dust flies 
           everywhere, airbags deploy. Then, the tether on the wheel-net 
           goes taut. Twelve inches too late.

           More police cars pull up, sirens blaring, and park in the 
           street, blocking any escape. OFFICERS dismount and approach.

           Sara Jane raises her hands in the air. Abby’s have fallen off 
           the wheel, obscured by the now-flaccid airbag.

           ABBY’S MOM and DAD burst out of the house and rush toward the 
           car. They are shockingly normal-looking upper-middle-class 
           people who have changed out of their work clothes. A female 
           officer holds them back.

           The officer approaching Abby’s door calls an order:

                                 OFFICER
                        I need to see your hands.

           Abby raises her hands.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Good, keep them there. Now open the 
                        driver side door.

           Abby does, looking shell-shocked. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Does anyone have any weapons?

                                 SARA JANE
                        No. We come in peace. Abby, you 
                        okay?

                                 ABBY
                        I think so.

                                 OFFICER
                        Step out of the vehicle please.

           Abby stumbles out of the car. As she does, we see that the 
           seat is wet with her blood.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Miss, are you injured?

           Abby looks at the seat, then down at what used to be her lap. 
           She says calmly:

                                 ABBY
                        Oh. That’s just my miscarriage.

           Sara Jane stifles a snort of laughter. Abby’s parents react.
                                 ABBY’S MOM
                        Your what?!

                                 OFFICER
                             (to Abby)
                        You’re the one who lives here?
                             (off Abby’s nod)
                        We’ve got her! She’s safe!

           An EMT appears and wraps Abby in a space blanket. The officer 
           walks around to Sara Jane.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Is this your car?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes, but--

                                 OFFICER
                        This is your car?

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes.

                                 OFFICER
                        You are--

                                 SARA JANE
                        Sara Jane Wrightship.

                                 OFFICER
                        Sara Jane Wrightship, you have the 
                        right to remain silent. Anything 
                        you say can and will be used 
                        against you in a court of law. You 
                        have the right to an attorney. If 
                        you cannot afford an attorney, one 
                        will be provided for you. Do you 
                        understand the rights I have just 
                        read to you? With these rights in 
                        mind, do you wish to speak to me?

           As the officer reads Sara Jane her rights, Sara Jane watches 
           as Abby talks to her parents, out of earshot but visibly 
           animated. It looks... productive.

           When the officer is done speaking, Sara Jane asks:

                                 SARA JANE
                        Am I under arrest?

                                 OFFICER
                        We’re gonna go ahead and take you 
                        in.
           Sara Jane puts out her wrists for handcuffs, and, like the 
           savvy woman she is, says absolutely nothing.

           The officer begins to walk Sara Jane over to a police car. 
           Abby notices and breaks off talking with her parents to trot 
           over to Sara Jane. Tight on Abby in her space blanket as she 
           approaches the cop car that Sara Jane is being ducked into.

           Tight on Sara Jane, her head is being protected by the 
           officer so it won’t hit the top of the door.

                                 ABBY
                        Officer, wait!

           The officer does. Bent over, Sara Jane is the same height as 
           Abby. Abby and Sara Jane lock gazes.

           An imagined future passes behind their eyes: Sara Jane leans 
           over the back of Abby’s chair as Abby rejects an ABORTION IS 
           MURDER bumper sticker in favor of a LET’S TALK ABOUT 
           ABORTION; Abby learns to drive, Sara Jane in the passenger 
           seat; Abby saves Sara Jane a seat for her high school one-act 
           questioning when life begins; Abby comes to Sara Jane’s 
           college graduation, where Sara Jane gets top honors and a 
           prize for community service; Abby dances with Sara Jane at 
           Maggie’s wedding.

           They both see it. We can see it on their faces.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                             (to Sara Jane)
                        I told them.
                             (to officer, but really to 
                              Sara Jane)
                        Go easy on her. Will you?

           Off Sara Jane.

           INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING

           Sara Jane is being given her one phone call. She stands at 
           the police phone, observed by a female OFFICER, and dials.

           INTERCUT: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BREAKERS

           Maggie is woken up in Cody’s bed by the insistent buzzing of 
           her phone. She looks at the number, doesn’t recognize it. 
           But, given recent events, she picks up.

                                 AUTOMATED PHONE VOICE
                        This is a call from Greenville 
                        County--
           Sara Jane waits for the call to be picked up. When it is:

                                 SARA JANE
                        Maggie?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 SARA JANE
                        So, I had a lot of time to think 
                        last night.
                             (nothing from Maggie)
                        No sleep. Lots of thinking.
                             (still nothing)
                        You said to call when I was ready 
                        to admit that I need something I 
                        don’t deserve. There’s a lot of 
                        things. I don’t deserve your 
                        attention, or forgiveness, or the 
                        benefit of the doubt, or to 
                        interrupt your Spring Break. I 
                        don’t deserve to play hero--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Or abduct small children from their 
                        guardians.

                                 SARA JANE
                        Yes. That. Definitely done with 
                        that. And, after what I put you 
                        through yesterday, the thing I 
                        least deserve is your help.

           Maggie’s sitting up, listening, taking it in.

                                 SARA JANE (CONT’D)
                        Maggie, will you come and bail me 
                        out?

           Maggie takes a deep breath, the kind where you close your 
           eyes. When she opens them again, the barest smile pulls at 
           the corner of her mouth.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Cody, find your keys. I’ll drive.

           TITLE: STATE LINES

           Credits roll alongside a montage of the photos Maggie took, 
           vertical videos of Abby’s wet t-shirt performance, and the 
           video Abby self-taped.

           Each is labeled as a courtroom exhibit.
