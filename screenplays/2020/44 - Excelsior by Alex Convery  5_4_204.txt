           The opening chords of “A BEGINNING” by The Beatles. 

           Fluttering strings, soft before --

                                 EILEEN (V.O.)
                        What did you want? 

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY 

           TITLE CARD READS: 2005

           STAN LEE, 83, sits behind a table. His gray hair, at least 
           what’s left of it, is SLICKED BACK. 

           His half moon brown eyes are hidden behind his iconic SHADED 
           GLASSES, tinted like the windows of a sports car.

           The table sits in a beautiful board room. Wide windows look 
           out over the shimmering New York skyline. Middle aged men and 
           women in pressed suits fill the other seats. 

           The place reeks of fuck you money and six figure retainers. 

           Directly across from Stan is EILEEN, 40’s, the arbitrator. 
           She has long red hair and block glasses.

                                 STAN LEE
                        What did I want? I wanted to write 
                        the Great American Novel.

                                 EILEEN
                        And what happened?

                                 STAN LEE
                        I lost track of time. 

                                 EILEEN
                        Mr. Lieber, Let’s talk about Kirby.

                                 STAN LEE
                        My name is Stan Lee. 

                                 EILEEN
                        Excuse me? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        My name isn’t Stanley Lieber. It’s 
                        Stan Lee. 
                                 EILEEN
                             (looking back at the 
                              documents)
                        It says here --

                                 STAN LEE
                        My name was legally changed last 
                        month.

                                 EILEEN
                        I apologize for the confusion Mr...
                             (catches herself)
                        Lee. So, Kirby. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I haven’t seen Jack Kirby in twenty 
                        years. What would I have to say? 

                                 EILEEN
                        Many would argue that you knew him 
                        better than anyone else.

                                 STAN LEE
                        That’s not true. He had a family.

                                 EILEEN
                        His wife is the one who told me 
                        that. 

           Stan gives a thin smile. Defeated. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Where do you want me to start?

                                 EILEEN
                        How about at the beginning? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        The beginning... 

           Close on Stan’s eyes as they drift off, like the start of a 
           dream -- 

           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - DAY

           We breeze past A PAIR OF MOVERS carrying a large couch out of 
           the office. 

           Drift into...
           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - STAN’S CORNER - DAY

           A CLAUSTROPHOBIC CORNER. Two large rows of FILING CABINETS 
           line the walls. Squeezed between them is...

           STAN LEE. But, it’s not the Stan Lee we know. Not yet. Right 
           now, he’s....

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (O.S.)
                        LIEBER!!! Get in here!! 

           STANLEY LIEBER: publisher of a dying line of comic books. 

           He gets up, BUMPING one of the cabinets. FOLDERS AND PAPERS 
           fall everywhere, littering the floor. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        God dammit. 

           No time to worry about it. Not now. He dashes across the 
           office, criss-crossing cubicles, a cacophony of type writer 
           keys scoring his journey. 

           A SECRETARY, 50’s, motions for him. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Lieber, Mr. Romita wanted to 
                        talk to you. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Not now. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (O.S.)
                        Lieber!!!

           It never ends.  

           As he continues across the office, he’s joined by SOL 
           BRODSKY, 28, pale, bulky glasses, forever the second banana 
           AKA assistant editor.

                                 SOL BRODSKY 
                        We need the Frankenstein pages in 
                        half an hour if we want the book to 
                        press by next week. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You’ll have them in twenty-nine 
                        minutes. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (O.S.)
                        Lieb --
           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - GOODMAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Stan rockets through the open door before MARTIN GOODMAN, 53, 
           slight but imposing in a trim suit, can finish. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes, sir. Did last month’s numbers 
                        come in? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I just came from the golf course 
                        with Leibowitz. Have you seen this?

           Goodman SLAMS a comic onto the desk. Stan peers over to see --

           JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA #1. The iconic cover with the DC 
           HEROES fighting Starro, who is, quite literally, a giant star 
           fish. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        All of their heroes in one comic. 
                        He said it’s selling like crazy. 
                        How did we not think of this? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Interesting. 
                             (thumbing through the 
                              comic)
                        So you want to steal their idea?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Exactly. Take all of our heroes and 
                        put them in one book. Captain 
                        America. Human Torch. Mariner. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Did last month’s numbers come in? 

                                 GOODMAN’S SECRETARY
                             (calling from just outside 
                              the office)
                        Mr. Goodman, Mr. Hart is on line 
                        one. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        No. 

                                 GOODMAN’S SECRETARY
                        Your wife is on line two. 
                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Absolutely not. Hold all my calls.
                             (finally has to answer 
                              Stan)
                        They did. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        The numbers came in.

                                 STAN LEE
                        And? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Shut the door. 

           Uh oh. Stan does. The mood of the room changing with it. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        We have to make some changes. No 
                        more artists in the office.

                                 STAN LEE
                        They weren’t good. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Perhaps you noticed the movers? You 
                        thought I was selling half our 
                        furniture for the fuck of it? To do 
                        some redecorating? It was the worst 
                        month in company history, Lieber.

           He tosses a comic across his desk. The title reads: MILLIE 
           THE MODEL. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        What is this? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, it’s--

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        That was a rhetorical question. 
                        It’s quite obviously shit.

                                 STAN LEE
                        You asked me to write a romance 
                        book and--

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I asked you to write a book that 
                        would sell.
           He slides the SALES NUMBERS across the desk.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        Would you say you were successful 
                        in that task?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin, if we keep changing our 
                        plan based on last month’s numbers 
                        we’re going to continue going in 
                        circles. 
                             (Stan realizes what 
                              Goodman is implying)
                        I mean I don’t... I don’t have 
                        anything to worry about, do I? 

           Goodman doesn’t say anything. He clearly does. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I like you, Lieber. I do. You’re a 
                        hard worker. Never miss a deadline. 
                        But... there’s only so long this 
                        can go on. There’s not time for us 
                        to keep throwing your ideas up 
                        against the wall. 
                             (trying to help)
                        How old are you now?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Thirty-nine.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                             (older than he thought)
                        This is a young man’s game. Listen, 
                        just man to man... Maybe you’re not 
                        in the right business. Have you 
                        thought about sales? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. I’m a writer. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Then you need to write something 
                        good. 

           A gut punch to Stan. But he can’t argue it. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        Just get me something good, Lieber. 
                        I don’t care how you do it. Or who 
                        you do it with.

           Close on Stan. His wheels spinning. 
           EXT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - EVENING

           Forest Hills. A street lined with suburban houses. A power 
           plant of nuclear families. Stan walks up to the front door of 
           one of them. Rings the doorbell. 

           No answer. He knocks. Waits...

           Still nothing. He looks through the window. No one.  

           He tries the front door. It’s open. He steps in...

           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - FOYER - EVENING

                                 STAN LEE
                        Hello? Jack? 

           He hears a VOICE. It’s coming from the basement. Muffled. 
           What the hell?

           He continues down the hall. And that’s when we realize what 
           the voice is...

                                 YANKEES ANNOUNCER
                             (from a radio)
                        Berra steps in. Yanks still down 3-
                        2, two outs in the 8th. 

           Stan smiles. Shakes his head. 

           He opens the basement door and stares down a looooong rickety 
           staircase.

           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - EVENING

           The Yankee game is BLARING from the radio. 

                                 YANKEES ANNOUNCER
                             Berra takes the 1-2 pitch. 
                              Low, ball 2. 

           Stan turns a corner and wafts through the SMOKE that clouds 
           from the cigar of --

                                 STAN LEE
                             (coughing loudly)
                        Jack. 

           JACK KIRBY. 42. Stocky, squared hands and jaw. He resembles 
           his drawings: blocky, kinetic, and alive. (He’s always 
           smoking a cigar unless otherwise noted.)
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Stanley. Let yourself in I see? 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (talking over the Yankees)
                        You can’t hear anything down here. 
                        What if there was a fire? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Then I’d burn. 

           Water DRIPS onto Stan’s head from the pipes above.

                                 YANKEES ANNOUNCER
                        And, it’s in there - strike 3. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        They’re playing like shit. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Did you see this?

           He tosses Jack the same comic Goodman showed him: JUSTICE 
           LEAGUE. Jack begins to thumb through it.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        All their heroes in one book. 
                        Interesting.

                                 STAN LEE
                        That’s what I said. And it got me 
                        thinking...

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Stan, don’t even--

                                 STAN LEE
                        Just hear me out. Goodman--

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Goodman is a crook. I’m not working 
                        for him again. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin’s changed. Even Ditko would 
                        say so.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You’re referring to the same 
                        Goodman who demanded that I stay up 
                        for a week straight to finish an 
                        issue of Captain America because he 
                        was worried Hitler was going to die 
                        before the pages went to press?

                        That Martin Goodman? Who then 
                        proceeded to stiff me on the 
                        royalties?

                                 STAN LEE
                             (starting to dig in)
                        I really need you on this, Jack. 
                        What are you working on?

           Stan goes through the pages on Jack’s desk. He’s drawing ads. 
           For shaving cream. A man’s smiling face - half covered in 
           white foam. “It’s Barbasol for me!”

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Barbasol? Come on, Jack. You’re 
                        better than this. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Ads pay the bills.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Do they?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Almost. We’re a little behind. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We are too. 
                             (he sighs)
                        Listen, Jack, I know we’ve had some 
                        duds--

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Some???

                                 STAN LEE
                        If this isn’t good, I’ll never ask 
                        you to pencil another book for me. 
                        Super heroes. We can get back to 
                        our roots.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Why me? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You’re the only one who can do it. 
                        No one can draw like you. I know 
                        that’s true. You know that’s true. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What did Goodman say? 
                                 STAN LEE
                        Don’t worry about Goodman. He said 
                        he wants us to try something 
                        different. No pressure at all. 

           Jack’s still not breaking. Stan presses on. No other choice.

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        You’re the man who created Captain 
                        America... you shouldn’t be stuck 
                        in a basement drawing ads.
                             (takes a breath)
                        I’m really in a corner here, Jack. 
                        I need your help.

           Kirby takes a long puff of his cigar. The leak from the 
           ceiling starts again -- Drip. Drip. Jack bites his lip. 
           Thinks. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Come by the office tomorrow night. 
                        6pm. We’ll have the place to 
                        ourselves. We can hash everything 
                        out.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I don’t know, Stanley. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Take the night to think about it. 
                        If you’re interested, I’ll see you 
                        at six tomorrow. If not... well, 
                        we’ll catch a Yankee game down the 
                        road and you can keep drawing 
                        shaving cream ads. No sweat.  
                             (checking his watch)
                        Shit. I’m late. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        To what?

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’ll tell you about it tomorrow. 

           Stan gives him a smile and heads up the creaky stairs. Kirby 
           takes a long puff of his cigar.

           Close on the shaving cream ad. The man’s smiling face. 

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           A gorgeous home. Summer in the suburbs. Paradise for some, 
           hell for those who don’t have it. America in a nutshell. 
           JOAN LIEBER, former British hat model, always trying to make 
           an impression. And it’s not helping that her husband is--

           STAN. Who’s late. Very late. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        You’re late. Very late.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I know. Traffic was crazy. I had--

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Let’s go! Diane and Todd have been 
                        waiting all night. Todd might have 
                        a job opportunity for you. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Joan, I...

           They walk through the long foyer and out to--

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           A sprawling back yard. String lights. Barbecue going... it’s 
           a suburban fantasy. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Wow.

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                             (putting on her nice 
                              voice)
                        Everyone, Stan made it!

                                 STAN LEE
                        Sorry about that! I haven’t seen a 
                        rush out of the city like that 
                        since the Dodgers left in ‘57!

           Mild laughter. Everyone over the excuse. Back to their own 
           conversations. 

           TODD, 35, clad in a loud Hawaiian shirt and pastel shorts, 
           saunters over.   

                                 TODD
                        Stan, the man of mystery!

                                 STAN LEE
                        This is amazing. You own this 
                        place?
                                 TODD
                        Ink dried on the mortgage three 
                        months ago. Hell of a process. 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (looking around)
                        It’s beautiful. 

                                 TODD
                        Well, thanks, That’s awfully nice 
                        of you to say...
                             (leans in)
                        And if the S&P keeps up, we’ll have 
                        a pool installed by next summer. 

           He laughs. Rich guy banker asshole laugh.

                                 TODD (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Say, what do you do again, Stan? 
                        Joan said you might be looking for 
                        some work?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Me? No, I... I’m a writer. 

                                 TODD
                        You don’t say! What sort of novels 
                        do you write?  

                                 STAN LEE 
                        Oh uh... not novels exactly. I’m 
                        actually planning to start one soon 
                        though. I write...
                             (thinking)
                        Various magazines. 

                                 TODD
                        Hit me with some titles! I fancy 
                        myself a reader, I’m sure I’ve 
                        heard of them.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well... I don’t know about that. 
                        They’re mostly for children.  

                                 TOM
                        Like... comic books?

                                 STAN LEE
                             (swallowing)
                        No, not comics. They’re more 
                        magazine style. 

           Awkward. Can kind of tell that Stan’s lying.
                                 TOM
                        Oh, ok. Well, that’s swell. Sorry I 
                        said anything about the job, there 
                        must have been some 
                        miscommunication.  

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. It’s fine. I... yeah... I... 
                        You might like them. 

                                 TODD
                        Write one I can read and I will. 
                             (looking around)
                        Well... I’m going to see about 
                        these deviled eggs. Can I get you 
                        one?

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m alright, thank you. 

           Stan takes a long sip of wine before he’s BUMPED by a passing 
           guest. The wine SPILLS all over his shirt. 

           OVERLAP: A CRYING baby. 

           INT. LIEBER APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Claustrophobic walls. You thought Stan’s office was cramped? 
           Take a look at his apartment. He and Joan getting home. A 
           BABYSITTER holds their crying child, JOAN CELIA LEE or “JC”. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        How was she? 

                                 BABYSITTER
                        Great. I don’t know why she’s 
                        crying now... she was so good all 
                        night. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Must be her parents. 

           Nervous and awkward laughter. Money exchanged with the 
           sitter. Joan takes the baby.  

                                 JOAN LIEBER (CONT'D)
                        Have a good night. 

           She turns to Stan. Rocking the baby. Stan begins to remove 
           his wine-soaked shirt.
                                 JOAN LIEBER (CONT'D)
                        It seemed like you and Todd really 
                        hit it off. Did you get his card?
                             (starting to pick through 
                              the mail)
                        Did last month’s numbers come in?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Not yet. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        It’s the 16th. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Things have been hectic. 

           Flipping through BILLS on the table. Overdue. Overdue. And... 
           Overdue.

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        So your royalties won’t be here 
                        until next week? We need the money, 
                        Stan. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I know. Joan I want to--

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        We’re not young anymore... how long 
                        can we live in a one bedroom? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I think I’m close to--

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        I’m afraid to invite people over. 
                        They live in houses! You saw Diane 
                        and Todd’s place. They have 
                        backyards, and neighbors, and 
                        barbecues. We have... this. 

           Crooked pictures on the wall. Everything second-rate.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I know. Joanie... we’re close. I 
                        talked to Jack today. We...

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Write what you want to write. Do 
                        something different. Something you 
                        can put your real name on. What’s 
                        the worst thing that could happen? 
                                 STAN LEE
                        I know.

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Why don’t you write about what 
                        people care about?
                             (off Stan’s glance)
                        People. I mean... Super heroes can 
                        be people too, right? 

           Close on Stan. Holy shit. 

           INT. STAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Stan at his desk. The blank page in front of him. The boulder 
           at the foot of the mountain. 

           Stares at the pictures of his family. His wedding photo with 
           Joan. His mom and dad. People. 

           He starts typing.

           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - OFFICE - EVENING

           The office is emptying out, everyone heading home for the 
           night. 

           Stan sits in his corner. He checks the clock: 5:58pm. 

           The last person he wants to see is...

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Say, want to grab a drink, Stan? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No, I can’t. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Are you waiting for someone? 
                        Something I can help with? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. No. Just have some more work to 
                        get done. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Alright, then. See you in the 
                        morning. 

           Stan continues typing. Once he’s sure that everyone is gone, 
           he reaches into his bag. Removes a single sheet of paper. 
           He is waiting. Anxiously.

           He watches the clock. 6:03pm. No Kirby. Shit. 

           He begins to pack his things. Downtrodden. And then--

           A puff of smoke. From around the corner -- KIRBY. Disheveled, 
           always tripping over himself. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Traffic was shit. I hate this 
                        fucking city. 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (trying to hide an 
                              enormous smile)
                        Jack. 

           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING

           A conference room that’s turned into a makeshift storage 
           unit. Boxes piled up everywhere. Random stacks of comics on 
           the table. Safe to say it hasn’t been used in a while. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I read Justice League. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Me too.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I liked it.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        But...?

                                 STAN LEE
                        But... something’s missing. The 
                        characters don’t have 
                        relationships. Well, they do... but 
                        they’re all the same...they’re all 
                        friends. It’s all smiles and happy 
                        endings. What if it was more 
                        complicated than that? What if they 
                        felt like... a family?
                             (off Jack)
                        Why don’t adults read Super-Man? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Because he wears red underwear. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No, that’s not it. 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Because comics are for children. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        But why do they have to be?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Because they’re comics.

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s because we don’t care about 
                        Clark Kent.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You want to write the Amazing 
                        Adventures of Clark Kent? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What’s your biggest problem? Right 
                        now. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’m fat. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Perfect. What else?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I have to sneak my last drink of 
                        the night in the basement so Roz 
                        doesn’t see.  

                                 STAN LEE
                        Good. Keep going.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        The Russians could nuke us at any 
                        moment. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Atomic fear. And...

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Stop. What about you? 

           Stan does stop. Looks at the stack of comics on the table. 
           Millie the Model. Then back at Jack.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Not being the person I wanted to 
                        be.
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        So you want to make a super-hero 
                        book about someone who is fat, has 
                        problems with their wife, is afraid 
                        that the Russians are going nuke 
                        him, and has failed aspirations?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Remember what I said about Justice 
                        League? What was it missing?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        A family.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Bingo. Real people with real 
                        problems. What if Super-Man and 
                        Lois Lane couldn’t stand each 
                        other? 
                             (a beat)
                        What do you think?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I think you’re absolutely insane. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Luckily, we don’t have time to 
                        reconsider. You draw it, I’ll add 
                        the dialogue after. 

           Slides a SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER across the table. Take note of 
           this piece of paper. It’s going to be very, very, important.  

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        That’s it? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s how we’re working these days. 
                        One page summaries. You do the 
                        blocking and I’ll add the dialogue 
                        after. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                             (skeptical, but...)
                        OK. Ditko works like this too?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yeah. Take a look. I even have a 
                        title.

                                                               SLAM TO:
           FANTASTIC FOUR #1 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        What the fuck is this? 

           The now famous cover. A giant monster crashing through the 
           street pavement. The Fantastic Four trapped in its clutches. 
           None of them are wearing costumes, they’re in street clothes. 

           Goodman flipping through the pages of the first issue. His 
           eyebrow is raised. Clearly skeptical. Uh-oh. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        I asked for a super hero book. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It is a super hero book. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Then where are the superheroes? 
                        Where are the costumes?

                                 STAN LEE
                        There aren’t any costumes.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        There. aren’t. any. costumes... 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s not about that. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        And what is it about, Lieber. 
                        Marital issues? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes, actually. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Oh, good god. 
                             (face in his hands)
                        It’s entertainment, Lieber. People 
                        read these things so they don’t 
                        have to think about the real world. 
                        They don’t want to read about their 
                        problems, they want to forget them.

                                 STAN LEE
                        We’ll see. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Comics are for two types of people: 
                        children and illiterate adults. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        I think you’re wrong. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Excuse me? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I said you’re wrong. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I would advise you to start packing 
                        your things.  

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin... I don’t have anything el--

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        When Jan and I honeymooned in 
                        Europe, we had plans to return to 
                        the states on a beautiful blimp. I 
                        went to get the tickets, and they 
                        were sold out. Jan was crushed. 
                        Complained the whole way home. I 
                        never thought I’d hear the end of 
                        it. You know what the name of the 
                        blimp was? 
                             (off Stan’s silence)
                        The Hindenburg. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jesus.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        What I’m trying to say is -- life 
                        isn’t so bad. You never know when 
                        it could get worse. You’ll figure 
                        it out, Lieber. It just won’t be 
                        here.

           Stan gets up and slumps through the door. KIRBY is waiting 
           anxiously. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What’d he think?

           Stan says nothing. But that says everything. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           Stan and Jack pace down the street, heads hung.
           The kinetic energy of the city all around them. This is one 
           of the worst days of their life, but everything else keeps 
           going. That’s how the world works. It doesn’t rain only when 
           you need it to. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What is Joan going to say? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I don’t want to go home. I don’t 
                        think I can. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’m backed up on ads. This set me 
                        back a week. At least.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Maybe this is the sign I needed. I 
                        wanted to start my novel anyway.

           They stop. Look at each other, like they had the same idea at 
           the same time.  

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Should we just catch a movie?

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

           Close on the poster for THE HUSTLER. 

           “It delves without compromise into the hungers that lie deep 
           within us all!” 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

           Stan and Jack watching THE HUSTLER. Sharing a large bag of 
           popcorn. Escaping. The world can go fuck itself sometimes. 

                                 FAST EDDIE
                             (from the theater audio)
                        Maybe I’m not such a high-class 
                        piece of property right now. But a 
                        25% slice of something big is 
                        better than a 100% slice of 
                        nothing. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                             (leaning over, whispering, 
                              popcorn in his mouth)
                        Stan... what we made... it was 
                        good. I know it was. I don’t care 
                        what Goodman says. 
           Stan leans back. Not so sure. 

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        We don’t want to be caught up in 
                        their business anyway. Why don’t we 
                        make our own books? Forget about 
                        them. Publish independent. 

                                 STAN LEE 
                        I don’t know, I--

           SHHHHHH! 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                             (even quieter)
                        I’ll need to pick up another gig. 
                        Maybe an Ads job.
                             (thinking)
                        But I do have some ideas. For some 
                        other heroes. You’re right...
                             (smiling)
                        We don’t need them. 

           The light from the screen bathing them. Everything ahead.  

           INT. LIEBER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Stan trudges through the door. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Stanley, where in god’s name have 
                        you been? Is everything ok? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Joan, I’m sorry I...

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                             (waiting to hear he’s been 
                              fired)
                        What is it??

                                 STAN LEE
                        Goodman loved it. He thinks we have 
                        a hit.

                                 JOAN LIEBER 
                        Oh my god!

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack and I have been out 
                        celebrating. 

           JC starts crying. Joan hugs him. 
                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        I can’t believe it. I mean, I can. 
                        I didn’t mean it like...

                                 STAN LEE
                        I know. 

           He brings Joan close. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Everything’s going to be ok. I 
                        promise. 

           INT. LIEBER RESIDENCE - MORNING

           Joan sits at the kitchen table, spooning the baby food. Stan 
           walks out of the bedroom...

           HE’S DRESSED FOR WORK. A full suit, his hair gelled back. 

           Joan leans in, gives him a peck on the cheek. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        We’re so proud of you. 

           EXT./INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Stan walks up the long wind of stairs leading to...

           The Library. He’s incredibly over dressed. Catching glances 
           as he paces through the lobby in his suit. 

           He sits in the type writer room. Sets down his briefcase. 
           Breathes in. Looks around. And from around the corner...

           KIRBY. Cigar in mouth, art supplies tucked under his arm. He 
           stands over Stan. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You wore a suit?

           Everyone in the room looking at them.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Sir... you can’t smoke in here!

           INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - EVENING

           Hours later. Paper spread out all over the table. Stan’s 
           notes, Jack’s sketches. No sign of stopping. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        What about a teenager who’s 
                        bullied? Or a Jekyll and Hyde. A 
                        blind man. What else?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        They need day jobs. A photographer. 
                        A lawyer. A scientist. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        A scientist. Who can’t control when 
                        the monster takes over. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        The Hulk. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        The Hulk...
                             (as he chews it over)
                        I was thinking... if our heroes 
                        have normal lives, normal jobs... 
                        then they should live in New York. 
                        No Metropolis, No Gotham City.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Perfect for crossovers. The books 
                        can intersect. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Exactly. A whole universe.
                             (taking a breath)
                        How are the ads going? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’m going to be up late. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I applied to some classified ads 
                        myself. Just copy work. But I 
                        really think we’re...

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Gentlemen... we’re closing. 

           They look around. The only ones left in the library. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Jesus, what time is it? 

           Stan smiles. A glimmer in his eye. They’re at the end of the 
           line. But, this feels right. Sitting in the library with 
           Jack. Creating. It feels right.  
           INT. LIEBER APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Stan comes in from his day at “work”. Joan walks to give him 
           a kiss. The baby in a high chair. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        You smell different. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        I mean you smell different than 
                        normal. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Huh. Well, they’ve been moving 
                        furniture out of the office. Had 
                        some meetings today. I don’t...

           The phone rings. Joan reaches for it. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Hello? 
                             (holding her hand over the 
                              receiver)
                        Are you applying to jobs? This is 
                        an ad firm? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What? No... I...

           He’s struggling for an excuse. But... 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        If you want to poach my husband, 
                        the offer better be good. And don’t 
                        you dare call our home after 6pm. 

           Stan smiles. Phew. 

           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Pipes still rattling. Jack sits at his board, working on 
           another ad, this one for cigarettes. 

           ROZ, his wife, comes into the room to kiss him goodnight. She 
           motions for him to come upstairs with her. He can’t.

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        Don’t you have time to work on 
                        these during the day? 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Picked up an extra few gigs.

           She shakes her head as she heads back up the stairs. 

           He reaches under his board for... his last glass of whiskey.

           INT. PRINTING PRESS - DAY

           The PRINTING MACHINES grind and whir. Copies of FANTASTIC 
           FOUR #1 stack up. The cover glowing in brilliant technicolor. 

           The garage door at the rear of the warehouse opens up. Boxes 
           of comics are stacked and loaded into the back of a TRUCK. 

           Dawn breaks over the sleeping streets of Manhattan. The truck 
           sputters to life and glides away. 

           Everything is about to change.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEWS STAND - DAY

           August 8th, 1961. Stan approaches a news stand. Various 
           headlines read: “EAST GERMANY BEGINS WORK ON WALL”.

           He looks up to the NEWS STAND EMPLOYEE, 65, grumpy. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Do you have a copy of the new 
                        Magazine Management book? Fantastic 
                        Four? 

                                 NEWS STAND EMPLOYEE
                        You look a little old to be reading 
                        comics. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You don’t have it?  

                                 NEWS STAND EMPLOYEE
                        No. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You get all their books. 

                                 NEWS STAND EMPLOYEE
                        Don’t know what to tell you, buddy. 
                        We carry Playboy. Why don’t you 
                        take a look at that? Might see some 
                        things you’ve never seen before. 

           Stan walks away, shaking his head. 
           INT. LIEBER APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Stan walks in. Joan holding the baby at the counter. She’s on 
           the phone, just wrapping a conversation. 

                                 JOAN LEE
                        How was your day? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Productive. I...

           The phone rings. Joan reaches for it, but Stan answers just 
           before. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Hello? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Lieber. It’s Goodman. 

           Stan looks around, in shock. He walks around the corner, the 
           cord on the phone streeeetching. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Stan...?

           He covers the phone, almost in a whisper.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin... what’s going on?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I want you to come in tomorrow.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Did I leave something in the 
                        office? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Not quite. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Our news stand didn’t even have 
                        Fantastic Four.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        That’s probably because it sold 
                        out. 

           Close on Stan as the realization hits. Holy shit. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I thought you didn’t need me?
                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        We don’t need you. We need 
                        Fantastic Four #2. 

           Off Stan’s wide smile--

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

                                 EILEEN
                        Did you and Mr. Kirby have direct 
                        communication regarding the book’s 
                        success? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, we kept on going. Issue #2 
                        was due the next month. That’s how 
                        it works. There’s never time to 
                        dwell on the current issue.

                                 EILEEN
                        And despite what you told Mr. 
                        Kirby, you did not move to full 
                        scripts?

                                 STAN LEE
                        That’s correct. But... We did all 
                        our books that way. Jack knew that. 

                                 EILEEN
                        And the rest of the company? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, to put it simply: everyone 
                        wanted in. 

           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - GOODMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Stan sits across from Martin. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Well? You want to gloat? Say I told 
                        you so?

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. Our royalties will suffice. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Let’s not forget it was my idea to 
                        put multiple heroes in one book. 
                             (off Stan’s smile)
                        Well, you’ve done it once. Now, you 
                        need to do it ten more times. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        How about twice?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        All or nothing, Lieber. You have 
                        carte blanche with these 
                        characters. There’s only one thing 
                        I’m requiring: they need to have 
                        costumes. I’m not having heroes 
                        dressed in slacks. If you want to 
                        write about the IRS, go do it at 
                        DC. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Normal people, Martin. That’s the 
                        whole idea. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Normal people wear costumes, too. 
                        For God’s Sake. And I lied... there 
                        is one more thing: I want a new 
                        name for this line. Something 
                        fresh. We need to distance 
                        ourselves from the shit you did 
                        before. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’ll take that as a compliment. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Any ideas?

                                 STAN LEE
                             (beginning to get up)
                        Let me think on it. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                             (yelling at him as he 
                              exits)
                        Costumes!

                                 STAN LEE
                        I got it. 

           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - STAN’S CORNER - DAY

           Stan sits in his corner, working. STEVE DITKO. 33, skinny as 
           a rail, bespectacled, angular, a walking isosceles triangle, 
           approaches from behind.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Stan. You have a minute? 
                                 STAN LEE
                             (startled)
                        Jesus, Ditko, you scared me. I 
                        didn’t know you were in the office 
                        today. Have a seat. You want a 
                        drink?

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I don’t drink.

                                 STAN LEE
                        A smoke?

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I thought you didn’t smoke? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I don’t.  

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Then why did you ask? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I...

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Conformity. It’s a disease. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You should come into the office 
                        more.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Well, I’d love to, Stan. The only 
                        thing is I hate it here. Small 
                        talk. Cubicles. We’re supposedly 
                        making art, but we’re still under 
                        the shadow of the corporation. But 
                        I digress. 
                             (finally getting to his 
                              point)
                        I read Fantastic Four. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What’d you think? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I loved it. It was different. 
                        Colorful. Off-beat. Frankly, I 
                        didn’t think you had that in you. 
                        And you know what I loved the most? 
                        No costumes. They’re humans.
                                 STAN LEE
                        Well... we’re adding costumes. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I should have known. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What do you want, Ditko? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I want a superhero book too. Plain 
                        and simple. I’m through with horror 
                        comics. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We all are. But Kirby’s handling 
                        superheroes right now. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I can bring something different. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What are you interested in? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Have you read any Ayn Rand? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Who? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Never mind. You and Kirby are 
                        pushing boundaries. I want to join 
                        you. I think you’re on the verge of 
                        a revolution, Stan. Keep me in 
                        mind. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Come into the office more and I’ll 
                        think about it. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I believe the two to be mutually 
                        exclusive. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Out of sight, out of mind. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I believe in the opposite. Alas, I 
                        don’t have time for this. I’m using 
                        my lunch break to talk to you. Let 
                        me have a superhero book.

                                 STEVE DITKO (CONT'D)
                        That’s all. I’m going to smoke 
                        three cigarettes.

           He shakes his head as Ditko leaves. Stretches his legs and 
           finds, waiting at his feet - a bag of mail. Fan mail. 

           Aa couple dozen letters maybe. But a start. He looks to Sol. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Let’s reserve a page at the end of 
                        each book.

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        For what? 

           Stan’s picking through the bag of letters.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I want to publish some of these. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Are you serious? 

           Close on Stan as he continues reading through the letters. 

           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING

           Stan and Jack back at it after hours. The same conference 
           room. They’re mid-brainstorm. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We’ll do the Hulk next. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You... don’t want to save the Hulk? 
                        For our own line?

                                 STAN LEE
                        This is our own line. “Carte 
                        blanche”. That’s what he said, 
                        Jack, “carte blanche”. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Fair. I just thought... We can 
                        still do this on our own. We could 
                        have ownership.  

                                 STAN LEE
                        We have to be realistic. We have 
                        everything we need here. The 
                        capital, editorial backing... we 
                        just... we don’t have the resources 
                        to do this on our own.

                        Not at this scale. I think we got a 
                        little ahead of ourselves. Don’t 
                        get me wrong, it was exciting, the 
                        idea of it. It’s just...

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You need the money. 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (kind of laughing)
                        Yeah. We really do. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I get it. We do too. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        There’s nothing wrong with a steady 
                        check. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        No, you’re right. Something my 
                        parents never had. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Me either. My dad was always 
                        unemployed. Bounced factory job to 
                        factory job. I slept in our living 
                        room. He and my mother fought. They 
                        all did. I’m not any different, I 
                        suppose. What I remember... is we 
                        had no view. Our window looked 
                        right into the brick wall of the 
                        building next to us. Just a red 
                        brick wall. 
                             (remembering the brick 
                              wall)
                        What about you? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Ah, we didn’t have money to do 
                        much. Once my Mom told me we were 
                        going on vacation and just took me 
                        out to the fire escape. I loved it. 
                        Didn’t know the difference. It felt 
                        like another world out there. First 
                        time I left New York was with the 
                        army.
                             (a beat)
                        You served, right? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Uh... yeah. I did. 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What do you mean? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I mean... I was a reserve. Worked 
                        the radio. Wrote the copy for 
                        manuals, correspondences.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        All the same. 

           They’re caught in their own thoughts. Stan slides a piece of 
           paper across the table. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Issue three of FF. One thing - we 
                        need to give them costumes. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What?? The whole idea was-- I 
                        thought we had “carte blanche?” 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well... almost. 

           Jack’s looking the issue summary over. Again, just one page.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Stan... I... I’m not going to be 
                        able to work like this on every 
                        issue. I can’t block the entire 
                        story. I need more than a one-
                        pager. I need a script. Ditko might 
                        be OK with this on horror books, 
                        but it’s a lot of work turning one 
                        page of summary into twenty-two 
                        pages of comic. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I know. It won’t be like this 
                        forever. I just need to get ahead a 
                        little more. Can a few issues ahead 
                        of time. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        OK. I get it. You work too hard, 
                        man. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        For not enough. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Ain’t that the truth. Hey, listen, 
                        don’t worry about it.

                        These will sell. We’re in this 
                        together. We make decisions 
                        together. Independent or not. 

           Stan smiles. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We’re onto something, Jack. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I think so too.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Hang onto your hat, true believer. 

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           OVER “NORWEGIAN WOOD” by The Beatles. 

           Kirby sketches a page of the INCREDIBLE HULK.

           The same page now on Stan’s desk. He types the dialogue.

           And finally, the finished page. Scroll across the panel -- 

           “The world seems to stand still, trembling on the brink of 
           infinity, as his ear-splitting screams fill the air.”

           The printing presses are HUMMING. Pumping out pages.

           Joan sits a the table with the baby. Alone. 

           Time lapse as Marvel books fly off the news stand. 

           Close on the technicolor pages. The art. The kinetic energy 
           of Kirby’s panels. There’s nothing else like it. 

           “Written by Smilin’ Stan Lee, Art by Jack “King” Kirby.

           More fan letters pouring in. Hundreds now.  

           Jack gets another one pager from Stan. Doesn’t say anything. 
           But his eyebrow is raised. 

           The Hulk. Thor. Daredevil. The X-Men. Stan and Jack create 
           more iconic, enduring characters in a shorter time than 
           anyone before or since.

           Close on the cover of Fantastic Four #3 to reveal -- 

           The name of the publisher in the top right corner now reads: 
           MARVEL COMICS.
           END MONTAGE

           It’s working...

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Goodman stands on top of a table -- surrounded by what little 
           staff is in the office. JACK and SOL together in the back. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Folks, we have a hit. And you all 
                        know that there’s nothing I love 
                        more than a hit. Welcome to... 
                        Marvel Comics. 

           He POPS a champagne bottle. It ricochets off a light, and 
           SMASHES it. Glass rains to the floor.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Lieber, that’s coming out of your 
                        next paycheck.
           Stan shakes his head. Goodman takes a deep gulp from the 
           bottle. The office cheers.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                             (stepping down)
                        Lieber. Get over here.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Congratulations, Mr. Goodman.

           Goodman wraps his arm around Stan, bringing him close.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I want more super-hero books. We’re 
                        not doubling production, we’re 
                        tripling it. Joan isn’t going to 
                        see you until Christmas. 

           Stan smiles. A glimmer in his eye. 

           Jack stands in the corner. Watching.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Eileen stares across the table at Stan. 

                                 EILEEN
                        Tell us more about the “Marvel 
                        Method”.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I think I’ve been more than clear.

                                 EILEEN
                        You’re suing your own company for 
                        ten million dollars, Mr. Lee. It’s 
                        like Colonel Sanders suing Kentucky 
                        Fried Chicken. If there’s any time 
                        to be descriptive... it’s now. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We had too many books running for 
                        me to write every word of every 
                        script. So, just like I did for the 
                        first issue of Fantastic Four, I 
                        opted for a summary instead of a 
                        full script. I would either give 
                        this summary to the artist, or work 
                        on it with them, then they would go 
                        off and draw the book, filling in 
                        the details panel by panel. After 
                        the pages were finished, I would 
                        add the dialogue.
                                 EILEEN
                        So, you weren’t actually writing 
                        the books?

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. I was. But the artists did the 
                        physical plotting. On the page.
                             (he looks across the 
                              table)
                        To my understanding, Marvel still 
                        uses this method.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - MARTIN'S OFFICE - DAY

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        How many books are you writing a 
                        month now? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Seven or eight. Depends. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Unbelievable. I’ve never seen so 
                        many ad requests. I’m thinking we 
                        can add a page or two. Maybe cut 
                        something for an Ad. How about the 
                        letters page?

                                 STAN LEE
                        No - we need that.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Why? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Because the fans feel engaged. They 
                        feel like they’re a part of 
                        something. A community. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        And are they? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                             (laughing)
                        How about a drink? 

           Martin fixes two glasses. Drops in ice.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        So what’s next?
                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m thinking we need a book about a 
                        younger person. A high schooler. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You know, I always thought about a 
                        super hero book about an athlete. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No, not a jock. The opposite. The 
                        guy who’s bullied.

           Goodman goes to hand Stan the drink. Stan doesn’t notice...

           We follow his distracted gaze up the wall, where he’s 
           watching....

           A SPIDER. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Lieber...?

           Goodman picks up a pile of comics on the desk, rolls them up, 
           and SLAPS the spider dead.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        Disgusting little creatures. And no 
                        one wants to read a book about a 
                        loser, Lieber.  

                                 STAN LEE
                             (snapping back into it)
                        Sorry. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Is there something you want to talk 
                        about? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m just busy. I’m barely on top of 
                        everything. I need some help. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Then do what I do when I need help.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Which is? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Hire a secretary. 
           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S CORNER - DAY

           Stan and Sol sit across from -- 

           FLO STEINBERG. 24. She’s wearing a pink pant suit and crisp 
           white gloves. You can tell she’s always the smartest person 
           in the room. Star and moon earrings dangling from her ears.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m looking for someone that can 
                        take my calls, keep everyone on 
                        schedule, answer the fan mail for 
                        me. We produce our books in a very 
                        unique style. There will be some 
                        dictation work when I’m plotting.

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        That sounds like something I can 
                        help with. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We live crisis to crisis around 
                        here, Ms. Steinberg. I think that’s 
                        the best way to put it. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I live in a two bedroom apartment 
                        with three twenty-four year old 
                        girls, Mr. Lee. I’m not sure what 
                        your definition of a crisis is, but 
                        I assure you I’ve grown equipped 
                        with each and every variety.

                                 STAN LEE
                        And what would you say sets you 
                        apart from the other girls I’ll be 
                        speaking to? 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Well, I’m observant. For example, 
                        I’ve been doing a lot of interviews 
                        this week, and I noticed there have 
                        always been at least three other 
                        girls waiting outside at the other 
                        ones. Here...?

           They both turn. No one there. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG (CONT'D)
                        I don’t think you have time for 
                        dozens of interviews, Mr. Lee. And, 
                        frankly, if you do, you’re doing 
                        something wrong. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        That’s presumptuous of you. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Well, if you hire me maybe you will 
                        have time. Until then, your desk 
                        will continue to look like it’s 
                        recovering from a hurricane. 

           We see his desk. She’s not exaggerating. In fact, she’s 
           probably underselling it.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Can you start Monday? 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I was planning on it, Mr. Lee. 

           Stan smiling. She’s no bullshit.

                                 STAN LEE
                        See you then. 

           Sol gets up with her. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Sol, can you stick around for a 
                        second? 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        What’s up? 

                                 STAN LEE 
                        I was thinking about a new addition 
                        to the letter pages. I want you to 
                        draw everyone in the office. All at 
                        the same time, working together. 
                        Make it look crowded. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        But none of the artists come into 
                        the office. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Kirby does. A few days a week. And 
                        the others do... to drop off the 
                        pages. I want our readers to 
                        identify with us. We should be 
                        characters too. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        I get it. I just... it’s a lie. 

           Stan bites his lip. Lies are only wishes.
                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s not a lie. It’s a staff photo. 
                        Think of it like that. And add a 
                        title at the top...
                             (he takes a pause for 
                              dramatic effect)
                        The House of Ideas.

           Smiling. Proud of himself. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        OK. By the way, we’re been getting 
                        a lot of letters about corrections. 
                        Readers noticing typos. Or 
                        continuity errors. I, mean, that 
                        could be the problem with setting 
                        everything in New York... fans 
                        start looking for inconsistencies.

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. No. This is perfect.

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        It is? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Start saving those letters.

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Why?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Because I want to give them a 
                        prize.

           “Congratulations! This envelope contains a genuine Marvel 
           Comics NO-PRIZE which you have just won!”

           A BRIGHTLY COLORED ENVELOPE. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN'S CORNER - DAY

           Stan flips it over. Then back again. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Beautiful.

           Stan’s gaze drifts out to the bullpen as he sees...

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Ditko!

           Ditko slides through the door. He picks up the NO-PRIZE. 
                                 STEVE DITKO
                        The hell is this? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We’re sending them to fans who 
                        notice errors in the books.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                             (shaking his head)
                        Like moths to the flame. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’ve been thinking about our 
                        conversation.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        And?

                                 STAN LEE
                        And I have something for you.

           THE COVER OF AMAZING FANTASY #15

           SPIDER-MAN swings across the cover, a criminal stashed under 
           his arm.

           The issue sells like crazy. Leading to...

           AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #1. A crossover with the Fantastic Four. 
           Stan’s idea is paying off... 

           The issues of Spider-Man pile up. #2, #3, #4....

           Ditko reads over Stan’s one-pager for the next issue. HE 
           CRUMPLES IT UP and begins drawing on his own. 

           Stan gets the pages back. Confused. But he looks at the 
           clock. No time. He begins adding dialogue.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Stan and Jack back at it. Plotting. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        FF #8. I’ve been thinking, the 
                        Thing has enough trouble as is with 
                        his appearance. What if he had a 
                        love interest? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        OK. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        But... she’s blind. She doesn’t 
                        know how deformed he is. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I like it. 

           Stan takes stock. Can tell Jack is low energy. He looks 
           tired. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Is everything ok? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I... no. I guess that’s the answer: 
                        no. Roz is pregnant. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I mean, Jack, that’s great. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        No, it is. It is. But... I can’t 
                        keep coming in to the office. Roz 
                        needs me at home. Commute adds two 
                        hours to my day. At least. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No, I get it. 
                             (thinking)
                        Why don’t you get a place in the 
                        city? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Roz likes the neighborhood. She 
                        wants to raise a family there. The 
                        city isn’t for us. It’s not bad 
                        having a backyard, you know? And 
                        not paying rent. I’ll still come in 
                        to turn in pages. And after she 
                        gives birth... it will be easier. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Don’t worry about it.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I have been. I just... I worry 
                        about the plotting.

                                 STAN LEE
                        We have the phone.

           Jack is clearly worried about this. Knows he’s losing 
           something.
                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, what’d you say? We make 
                        decisions together. 

           INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

           Stan sits across from two RADIO HOSTS, they all wear bulky 
           headphones. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Now, Stan, tell us about the 
                        office. The Merry Marvel Bullpen. 
                        The House of Ideas. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, it’s my pride and joy. You 
                        wouldn’t know what the hell is 
                        going on if you just walked in. It 
                        would be like entering the eye of 
                        the storm. But there’s a method to 
                        the madness. You can bet on that. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        It must be wonderful. The 
                        collaboration...

           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Jack sits alone in the basement. The pipes still DRIPPING.

                                 STAN LEE (V.O.)
                        There’s really nothing like it. 

           INT. DITKO’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ditko alone at his drawing board. The apartment small. So 
           lonely it hurts.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Just you, joltin’ Jack, smilin’ 
                        Steve and fabulous Flo Steinberg. I 
                        can only imagine what those 
                        conversations are like. 

           INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

           We’re back to the radio station. Stan turns to the 
           interviewers. Looks them right in the eye. Smiles. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s really quite magical. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S CORNER - DAY

                                 STAN LEE
                        Ditko, I need you in the office. 

           Turn to REVEAL: Stan’s talking to KIRBY and DITKO. All 
           crammed into Stan’s corner.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        To do what? We can draw anywhere. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack needs to spend more time at 
                        home. And readers are responding to 
                        us as a group. And to be honest, 
                        Steve, it couldn’t hurt creatively. 
                        Your pages have been going off 
                        plan.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        So your lie has sparked with fans 
                        and now you want to bring truth to 
                        said lie. So we can all pretend it 
                        was never a lie in the first place.
                             (picking up a coming and 
                              flipping to the back)
                        Like this?

           He holds up the Marvel Letters Page. The image Stan asked Sol 
           for is in the corner: THE MERRY MARVEL BULLPEN!

           In the drawing, Stan looks over Jack and Steve as they work 
           on pages, in the middle of pitching an idea. Flo and Sol 
           carry stacks of paper. Everyone smiling. A happy office. 

           EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY 

           Flo, Sol, and Romita walk the street, returning from lunch.

                                 JOHN ROMITA
                        How did Ditko get Spider-Man? 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Because it’s about a bullied 
                        teenager. Ditko is a loon.

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I like Steve.

                        You like everyone. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I do not. 

                                 ROY THOMAS
                        Do you see that?

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Who do you not like? 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Well, it’s not as easy as...

                                 ROY THOMAS
                        Guys.

           They stop. Look up the street -- Cars are stopped in place. 
           Doors open, radios on. HORNS HONK. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S CORNER - DAY

                                 STAN LEE
                        On that front, We’re putting 
                        together a record. To send to the 
                        fans. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        A record? Of what?  

                                 STAN LEE
                        Of all of us. Everyone in the 
                        office. We’re going to record it 
                        next week. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I’m not doing it. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Steve, come on. It will take an 
                        hour.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        It’s not about the time, it’s about 
                        the principle. We’re not trained 
                        circus animals... we’re artists. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes, and commercial art requires 
                        commercial commitments. Like 
                        connecting with fans. They love 
                        you, Steve. 
                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I didn’t get into this for love. 
                        No, love’s a fool’s errand. 

           Stan rolls his eyes. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack, can I count on you to be 
                        there?

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Don’t do it, Kirby. Have some 
                        dignity. 

           Close on JACK. Looking back and forth between Stan and Ditko. 
           Just as he opens his mouth to say something...

           Flo, Sol, and Romita rush back into the office. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        JFK! He’s been shot!

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Holy shit. 

           The entire office scrambles around a RADIO. 

                                 REPORTER 
                             (from the radio)
                        Details are still coming in, but 
                        the President is in critical 
                        condition.

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Let’s go to the bar. They’ll have a 
                        TV. 

           Everyone starts to gather their things... except for Stan. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Are you coming? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No... need to keep working. And 
                        could you bring the radio in?

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                             (in semi-disbelief)
                        OK. 

           The other staffers look at each other. Can’t believe it. The 
           TAK-TAK of the type writer keys are audible as they exit.
           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Stan, Sol, Roy Thomas, and Romita are all crammed into a 
           recording booth. Mildly drunk. Making the record. 

           Kirby stands outside the booth, watching. Ditko isn’t there.

           Stan waves Jack in. Jack shakes his head.

           Stan motions, come on! 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (into the mic)
                        Hey, out there in Marvel Land! Face 
                        front, this is Stan Lee speaking! 
                        You’ve probably never heard a 
                        record like this before. Anything 
                        is liable to happen! Well, well, 
                        it’s Jolly Jack Kirby! Say a few 
                        words to the fans, Jack! 

           Jack shakes his head, stepping in. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        OK... a few words. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Hey, what’s all that commotion out 
                        there, Sol?

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Why, it’s shy Steve Ditko! He heard 
                        you’re making a record and he’s got 
                        mic fright! Whoops! There he goes!

                                 STAN LEE
                        Out the window again? You know, I’m 
                        beginning to think he is Spider-
                        Man. 

           They all laugh, except for Kirby who bites his lip.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (V.O.)
                        Take a look --

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Goodman open an oak door to....

           A REAL OFFICE. Glass windows looking over the towering 
           skyscrapers and city street below. Shag rug spread across the 
           center of the room. Ties the place together. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        Wow.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Numbers are up, Lieber.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Listen, I know there have been some 
                        preliminary talks about a Fantastic 
                        Four cartoon, which I think is 
                        great, but I was thinking why not 
                        take it further?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Further?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Hollywood, Martin. We could take 
                        exactly what we’re doing here and 
                        adapt it. You’ve seen the latest 
                        special effects... the Godzilla 
                        movies... Cleopatra.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Lieber... we’ve been publishing 
                        super heroes for two years and you 
                        already want out.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I don’t want out, I want more. We 
                        could at least take some meetings 
                        in Hollywood. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Let’s focus on what we have first. 
                        See how the Fantastic Four cartoon 
                        does. Focus on what you have. 

           They look around. It’s really fucking nice. The city shining 
           in front of them. Yet, Stan 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Stan and Joan wander through a beautiful apartment by any 
           standards. A nice view of the skyline. Spacious. 

                                 REALTOR
                        So, what do you think?

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Oh my god! The ceilings are so 
                        high... and the counters...
           But...

                                 REALTOR
                        Mr. Lieber?

           Stan is staring out one of the back windows--

           The view is of a brick wall.

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. Not this one. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Stan, this is perfect.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Not this one. 

           Close on the brick wall.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Eileen stares across the table at Stan. 

                                 EILEEN
                        1965. Marvel has gone from a 
                        floundering company to the best-
                        selling line of comics. With you as 
                        the face. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Things were good. 

                                 EILEEN
                        But you knew the artists were 
                        discontent? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I knew Ditko was. But I had Jack. I 
                        knew I could count at Jack. 

                                 EILEEN
                        You could count on Jack. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well... I could. At that time.

                                 EILEEN
                        And when did that change? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I guess it started with the 
                        reporter. 
           Off Stan’s gaze --

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Stan’s in a frenzy. Reorganizing his office.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I need Jack to come in this 
                        Wednesday. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Jack doesn’t come in on Wednesdays.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes, thank you, that’s why I’m 
                        asking you to make a one time 
                        exception so that he does. 
                        Wednesdays are the same as all 
                        other days. There’s nothing special 
                        about them. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        It seems like you and Jack are 
                        mostly plotting on the phone now--

                                 STAN LEE
                        Sol, thank you. Thank you for your 
                        input. Do you need me to ask Jack? 
                        I have to get to this convention, I 
                        don’t have time to--

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        What’s going on?

                                 STAN LEE
                        We have a reporter coming in next 
                        week. 
                             (raising his voice to 
                              reach outside)
                        Flo! This office is a mess!

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        A reporter? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes, a serious reporter writing a 
                        serious article. About us.
           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           A dimly lit gymnasium. Fold-up tables are set up around the 
           perimeter of the room. It looks like a middle school science 
           fair, only missing the baking soda volcanoes --

           It’s the first official comic book convention. We’re privy to 
           this information thanks to the paper banner hanging over the 
           door. Title hand-painted on. A far cry from San Diego.

           Stan’s table is mobbed. He’s smiling, posing for photos.

           We turn to face Ditko, who sits behind one of the tables. He 
           does not smile. A thin line of FANS waiting to meet him. 

                                 KID
                        Mr. Ditko! Can I get an autograph? 

           Ditko signs an issue of Spider-Man without a word. 

                                 KID (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Who was your favorite artist 
                        growing up? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Cezanne. 

                                 KID
                        What book does he draw? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Go to a museum. 

                                 KID #2
                        Mr. Ditko, what should I do if I 
                        want to be an artist? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Draw. 

                                 MAN #1
                        Do you have any advice for breaking 
                        into the industry? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Don’t.

           Ditko looks across the aisle - Stan posing with kids. Telling 
           emotive stories, acting out. He knows how to put it on. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           NAT FREELAND, a spectacled reporter, knocks on the door.
                                 STAN LEE
                        Oh, Mr. Freeland! Please, come in. 
                        I was just finishing up an issue. 

                                 NAT FREELAND
                        Oh, well, I’m happy to wait if--

                                 STAN LEE
                        No, no, please. 

                                 NAT FREELAND 
                        So, tell me a little bit about your 
                        famed collaborations. Let’s use 
                        Spider-Man as an example. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, the same way we do all of our 
                        books. We call it the Marvel 
                        Method. I write the plot, a brief 
                        description of what’s going to 
                        happen in the book. Then the artist 
                        draws it, breaks it down panel by 
                        panel, and then I add all the 
                        dialogue when I get the pages back.

                                 NAT FREELAND
                        So you don’t write a script?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well... I do. It’s a little out of 
                        order, but... speaking of, Ditko 
                        was supposed to be here today, 
                        but... 

           He phones Flo. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        Is Ditko coming in? 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I’m not sure. Let me...

           Kirby appears at the door. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack! Come in. This is Nat 
                        Freeland. One of the most respected 
                        reporters over at the Herald. 

                                 NAT FREELAND
                        Well, I wouldn’t say that...
                                 STAN LEE
                        Please, he’s being modest. Anyway, 
                        like we had talked about, I thought 
                        it would be nice for Mr. Freeland 
                        to sit in on one of our infamous 
                        brain storming sessions. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, I’m not sure that there’s 
                        anything to see. 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (giving Jack a glare)
                        Oh, come on Jack. I really just 
                        want to show him what a genius you 
                        are. Mr. Freeland, you’ll see that 
                        I’m hardly doing any of the work 
                        around here.

           Freeland flips to a fresh page on his note pad. Motioning for 
           them to begin. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Fantastic Four #55. I’m thinking we 
                        bring the Silver Surfer back. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I thought that wasn’t going to 
                        happen until next year? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        He’s been somewhere out in space 
                        since he helped the FF stop 
                        Galactus from destroying earth. 
                        This is the perfect time to bring 
                        him back. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Umm....

                                 STAN LEE
                        Suppose Alicia, the Thing’s blind 
                        girlfriend, is in some kind of 
                        trouble. And the Surfer comes to 
                        help her. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I see. 

           Stan HOPS UP ON HIS DESK. Begins to act everything out. 
           Freeland is eating this up. Vigorously writing.
                                 STAN LEE
                        The Thing sees them together and 
                        misunderstands. So he starts a big 
                        fight with Silver Surfer. Meanwhile 
                        the Fantastic Four is in lots of 
                        trouble. Doctor Doom is back and 
                        they need the Thing’s help. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        OK...

           Stan starts THROWING AIR PUNCHES. 

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Stanley, you know that the Surfer 
                        is exiled to earth. He hasn’t been 
                        up in space. We talked about this. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Oh, come on. Those are stupid rules 
                        you and I made up on the fly.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        It’s in the book... 

                                 STAN LEE
                        So, we’ll send a No-Prize to anyone 
                        who notices. Anyway, the Thing 
                        finally beats the Surfer. But then 
                        Alicia makes him realize he’s made 
                        a terrible mistake. And this is 
                        what The Thing has always feared, 
                        that he would lose control and 
                        really CLOBBER somebody!

                                 NAT FREELAND
                        Mr. Kirby... what do you think? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I think it’s swell. Just swell. 

           Freeland watches Kirby in the corner, as if he’s waiting for 
           Jack to say something more. He doesn’t.

           EXT. NEWS STAND - DAY

           Roz and Jack wait for the news stand to open. The front panel 
           finally slides open. Roz first in line. 

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        Herald? 

           The KID working the stand exchanges The Herald for a nickel. 
           Roz finds the article. Begins to read it. Suddenly the smile 
           on her face dissolves to a look of disgust. 

                                 ROZ KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        Jack, what did you say to this guy? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Nothing, really. 

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        Jack, look at this!
                             (reading from the article)
                        “Kirby, a middle-aged man with 
                        baggy eyes and a baggy suit. He is 
                        sucking a huge green cigar and if 
                        you stood next to him on the subway 
                        you would peg him for the assistant 
                        foreman in a griddle factory.”

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Let me see that. 

           He grabs the paper from Roz. Begins to read over the article. 
           Shaking his head.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S OFFICE  - DAY

           Stan sits behind his desk, reviewing penciled pages for 
           Spider-Man. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What the hell is this? Sol! Get in 
                        here. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                             (entering the room)
                        Yes? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Did you talk to Ditko about the 
                        latest Spider-Man? 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        No, why? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        He didn’t follow my summary at all. 
                        This is almost all Peter Parker. 
                        Spider-Man is on one page. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Perhaps he’s trying to explore the 
                        character. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        There’s a way to do that without 
                        alienating. Flo, get me Ditko. 

           They wait. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        He didn’t answer. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Can you try again? 

           She does. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Still no answer.

           Sol looks around the office. Knows that Ditko is on thin ice.

           INT. DITKO’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ditko holds a folded newspaper. Reading the article. His 
           phone ringing in the background.   

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        “The assistant foreman in a griddle 
                        factory.”

           He shakes his head as he puts the paper down, ignoring the 
           phone.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - DAY 

           Flo sits at her desk, typing away. Ditko approaches from down 
           the hall. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Here are this month’s Spider-Man 
                        pages, Ms. Steinberg. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Great, thanks Steve. Anything else 
                        you need?

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Yes, please let Stan know that this 
                        will be my last issue on Spider-Man 
                        and at Marvel. Consider this my two 
                        week notice. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        What? 
                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I’m leaving Marvel. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Hang on, hang on. Let me get Stan.

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        That’s quite alright. I don’t need 
                        to speak to him. 

           Ditko turns around. Begins to head out of the office. Flo 
           runs into Stan’s office.

           Stan comes rushing out of his office. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Steve! What’s going on? 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I gave Ms. Steinberg all the 
                        relevant information. I’m leaving. 

           The rest of the office starts to stir. Looking around. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Steve, don’t do this. Let’s talk. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        We’ve done enough of that. Perhaps 
                        you could call your journalist 
                        friend and he could join us. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Steve. I’ve been asking you to come 
                        into the office for years. It’s not 
                        my fault they write about the 
                        people who are here. 

                                 STEVE DITKO
                        Nothing happens in the damn office! 
                        Kirby may not have the spine to 
                        stand up for himself, but I do. 
                        Don’t blame us for a culture you’ve 
                        created for the press and the sheep 
                        who write into your letter pages. I 
                        haven’t followed one of your 
                        simpleton single-page plots in 
                        years. And you know it. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        And what do you want me to do about 
                        it? 
                                 STEVE DITKO
                        I want you to give credit to the 
                        people that deserve the credit. 
                        Remember when I told you I didn’t 
                        think you had the Fantastic Four in 
                        you? I was right... it was Kirby. 
                        You’re a fool. A carnival barker 
                        disguised as an artist. To be 
                        honest, it disgusts me. 
                             (looks around to the rest 
                              of the office)
                        And if all of you can’t see it, 
                        then you’re the true fools. 

           And with that, he’s out the door. The rest of the office sits 
           in stunned silence. Stan lingers in his doorway. 

           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                             (handing Jack an envelope)
                        You got some mail, honey. 

           He tries to open it gently, but his blocky hands tear some of 
           the paper inside --

           A letter. He begins to read.

                                 STEVE DITKO (V.O.)
                        Jack, by the time you’re reading 
                        this I will have left Marvel. 
                        Having just read the article in the 
                        Herald, I’ve decided that I’ve had 
                        enough. I believe that we’re being 
                        controlled by a larger corporate 
                        entity that cares more for the 
                        bottom line than the creative 
                        forces that drive its sales. Jack, 
                        I urge you to join me. I believe we 
                        are capable of even more than we 
                        are currently being asked. When I 
                        first read Fantastic Four #1, I 
                        couldn’t believe that the 
                        publishing house that once 
                        delivered half hearted horror and 
                        romance comics was on the verge of 
                        a revolution. But now I know, Jack. 
                        It was you. It wasn’t Stan. It was 
                        you. 

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        Who’s it from?
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Just a fan. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - OFFICE - DAY

           Stan stands on the conference room table, the rest of the 
           staff gathered around him. Eager. Anxious. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I wanted to call this meeting 
                        because of... speculation, I guess 
                        you could say. As you all know by 
                        now, we lost Ditko. I want to make 
                        it clear that he has been nothing 
                        but integral to how far Marvel has 
                        come in just a few short years. It 
                        hurts me deeply to see him go.

           Everyone biting their lips. It’s not quite landing. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        More importantly, we’re making 
                        books we can be proud of. Three 
                        years ago, I was at a dinner party 
                        with my wife, and when people asked 
                        what I did for a living, I had to 
                        lie. If I told them I was writing 
                        comics, they would have laughed. No 
                        one’s laughing anymore.

                                 JOHN ROMITA
                        Where’s Jack? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack’s at home. Working. Like he 
                        does every Wednesday. He’s not 
                        coming into the office as much any 
                        more. You’ve all noticed that. It’s 
                        normal. The man is working on four 
                        books a month. He doesn’t have the 
                        time to come in and make small 
                        talk. It doesn’t mean he’s leaving. 
                        Our relationship has never been 
                        better. I’ve been unfair. I’m 
                        willing to admit that. But things 
                        are going to change. 

           Quiet. Everyone looks around, waiting for someone to speak.

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        I promise. 
           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kirby sits on his couch, watching television. Turn to 
           reveal... 

           It’s a Fantastic Four cartoon.

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        I didn’t know they were doing a 
                        cartoon.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                             (neither did he)
                        Yeah. 

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        Are we getting royalties from this? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                             (he’s not)
                        Yeah. 

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        How much?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’d have to check. 

           Roz walks out of the room. Kirby remains on the couch. Close 
           on the animated Fantastic Four, riding the Fantastic-Car 
           through the sky. Smiling.

           INT. BARD COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Stan paces back and forth backstage. He’s clad in a full tux. 
           We can hear the gentle roar of a waiting audience. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No one has an iron? 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        You look great, Mr. Lee. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s wrinkled. 

                                 HOST
                             (on stage)
                        And now, we’re pleased to welcome 
                        the man behind Marvel Comics... 
                        Stan Lee!

           The crowd cheers. Stan walks from backstage to --
           INT. BARD COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Over “REVOLUTION 1” by The Beatles. 

           The audience is a sea of tie dye, faded jeans, and headbands. 
           It looks like Woodstock. 

           Stan can’t believe it. His tuxedo sticks out like a sore 
           thumb. 

           This is his audience.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - EVENING

           Jack walks into the office. Just a few people left. Of course 
           one of them is... SOL. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Hey, Sol. Is Stan here?

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Jack! Good to see you. No, he’s at 
                        another publicity gig. Some college 
                        speaking event. Bard, I think. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        He’s been doing a lot of those 
                        lately. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Yeah. Did you need something from 
                        him?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        No... just wanted to talk to him 
                        about something. It can wait. 
                             (looking over Sol’s 
                              shoulder)
                        What are you working on? 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Oh, Stan’s been so busy with these 
                        events. He’s letting me do a little 
                        work. Just touching up some 
                        dialogue.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        But, that’s the Fantastic Four. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Yeah, awesome - isn’t it?
           Kirby looks on. Wary. His art staring back as Sol adds 
           another line of dialogue. 

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT 

           Title card reads: Christmas, 1967. 

           The holiday party. The room is done up in lavish decorations. 
           We’re at the height of 60’s fashion. 

           Stan is tossed around the party. Starting with -- 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Stan, I want you to meet Martin 
                        Ackerman. President and CEO of the 
                        Perfect Film Chemical Corporation. 

           MARTIN ACKERMAN. He’s all of 5’8, but demands the presence of 
           someone much larger. Stan shakes his hand. The grip is tight. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        So this is the mastermind!

                                 STAN LEE
                        Oh, well I wouldn’t say that. It 
                        takes an army. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Is the artist here? What’s his 
                        name? Cubit? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Kirby. Jack Kirby. He’s right over 
                        there. 

           Kirby stands in the corner with Roz. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Looks like a real stick in the mud. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack? No, you’ll have to meet him. 

           Martin pulls Ackerman away to meet another group. 

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        Who was that? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Some corporate muckety-muck.

                                 JOAN LIEBER
                        He seemed quite interested in you. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m sure his kid reads Spider-Man.

           Close on Jack and Roz. 

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        This is nice, isn’t it? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I wish Ditko was here.

                                 ROZ KIRBY
                        Is everything OK, with you and 
                        Stan? 

           Jack doesn’t say anything. Looks out to Stan in the middle of 
           the crowd. Shaking hands. Smiling. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You want some more wine? 

           Stan climbs atop a table, CLINKING his glass. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Thank you all for coming. What a 
                        wonderful turn out. I just want to 
                        say... we couldn’t do it without 
                        each and every one of you. When I 
                        was in the army... they had this 
                        saying. 

           Close on Jack as Stan talks about his time in the army. 

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        They would say: every day’s a 
                        holiday, every meal’s a feast. 
                        Well, Martin and I just got the 
                        annual numbers in, and... This 
                        whole year has been a feast. 1967 
                        was officially the best year in 
                        company history. 
                             (cheers from the crowd)
                        We’ve officially passed DC as the 
                        leading comics publisher in the 
                        world. 
                             (even louder cheers)
                        So, with that said... I want to 
                        make a toast. A toast to you! And a 
                        toast to Marvel! 

           He JUMPS UP, attempting to click his heels. A broad smile on 
           his face before -- 

           He comes CRASHING TO THE GROUND. His ankle TWISTS.
                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                             (in terrible pain)
                        AHHH. 

           SMASH TO BLACK

           The opening chords of “DEAR PRUDENCE” by The Beatles. 

           INT./EXT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Jack’s crammed into the subway, his stocky frame pushing 
           against other riders. 

           The person next to him is reading FANTASTIC FOUR. Jack gives 
           a slight grin, shifts his head to get a better look. 

           They flip to the opening page: “Written by Stan Lee” 

           Close on Jack. He looks out the window. The world flying by. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jack walks up to Stan’s office. Stan’s on crutches. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Jack! Good to see you. Let me see 
                        if Stan’s free. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        No need. 

           Jack walks right into the office. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack! I thought you weren’t 
                        bringing in pages until next week?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Stanley, I want to talk to you 
                        about that Fantastic Four cartoon 
                        on CBS. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Have you been watching? They really 
                        did a number on Doctor Doom. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Yes, I have been watching as a 
                        matter of fact. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Those are our characters, Jack. 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Are you getting royalties for that 
                        cartoon? Are you getting paid? 

           This takes Stan aback. He gets up from his desk, walks across 
           the office, and SHUTS the door. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. No, I mean... not directly. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What does that mean? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        The company is getting royalties. 
                        The company is getting paid. You 
                        and I are both employees of the 
                        company. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        But you get an extra check for the 
                        show. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I... 
                             (recomposes himself)
                        I get an extra check every month 
                        for editing. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        And you edit the show? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, yes. I get the scripts ahead 
                        of time. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Have you ever changed anything? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        They do a good job over there. A 
                        real fine job. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Why don’t I get to look at the 
                        scripts? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Because you’re the artist, not the 
                        writer. 

           Jack’s angry. Takes a moment before responding.
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I thought they were our characters. 
                        Isn’t that what you just said?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack, come on. You know what I 
                        meant. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I thought I did. It’s not fair, 
                        Stan. It’s not fair. You know that. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack, I don’t make these decisions. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Oh, stop it, Stanley. We said we 
                        were in this together. That we’d 
                        make decisions together. So why are 
                        you the only one benefitting? I 
                        didn’t say anything after that 
                        article --

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack, the article was--

                                 JACK KIRBY 
                        That’s not how we plot stories! You 
                        hung me out to dry! 

                                 STAN LEE
                        But, it’s how people think we do 
                        it. It’s important that we--

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Then tell the truth! Tell them we 
                        do it on the phone. Tell them you 
                        give me one god damn piece of paper-

                                 STAN LEE
                        I did!

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Then where was that in the 
                        article?? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I don’t choose what they print! 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You’re perpetuating a lie! It’s 
                        exactly what Ditko said--
                                 STAN LEE
                        It sells! 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Who cares??

                                 STAN LEE
                        You should! Because it’s keeping 
                        you employed! You want to go back 
                        to the basement? Back to drawing 
                        Barbasol ads? No? Then you damn 
                        well better care about how it 
                        sells.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You’ve changed, Stanley. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Stop calling me Stanley! 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        It’s your name. 

           Jack doesn’t look back as he walks out the door. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           TITLE CARD READS: 1968 

           A beautiful restaurant in the lobby of a five star hotel. 
           ACKERMAN and Goodman dine together, both in loud suits.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I want you to know that this wasn’t 
                        an easy thing to do. I’m proud of 
                        this company. I built it from the 
                        ground up. From nothing.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Nothing has changed on the 
                        financials. 15 million. Cash. But, 
                        before we finalize everything, we 
                        have another term that we’d like to 
                        ensure is locked in place. We need 
                        to ensure that Stan Lee will stay 
                        on as well. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Lieber?

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Who? 
                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        That’s his name. Stanley Lieber. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        So, what will it take? I’m willing 
                        to sweeten the contract however we 
                        can. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Contract? No. He’s never worked on 
                        a contract. He’s still freelance 
                        technically.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        He doesn’t have any ownership in 
                        these characters?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        No.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Incredible. How is that possible? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Our writers and artists are 
                        freelancers, Marty. That’s how 
                        we’ve always worked.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        I’m not concerned about the 
                        artists, but we need Lee in place.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Lieber. His real name is Lieber. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Frankly, I don’t give a shit.

           Chomps down on his cigar. Raises a flaming match up to it. 

           INT. LIEBER RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Stan gazes at himself in the mirror. He’s wearing a TOUPEE. 
           He positions it with his hands, shaping the hair with a comb.

           Flashes himself a signature Stan smile -- 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Stay tuned, True Believer. 
           INT. MARVEL COMICS - OFFICE - DAY

           Stan walks into the office. Flo sees his hair, immediately 
           looks HORRIFIED. She rushes him into --

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                             (almost whispering)
                        Are you wearing a toupee? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes. How does it look? 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Terrible! 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Really?

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Yes!

           Tries to take it off. Oh god it looks even worse.

                                 FLO STEINBERG (CONT'D)
                        No! Don’t do that. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Ok. Ok. 

           He fixes it. Better.

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        What would I do with you, Flo?

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Well... this is awkward now, but, 
                        can we talk? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What’s up?  

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I’ve been trying to find the right 
                        way to ask this but... I need a 
                        raise. It’s been two years.

                                 STAN LEE
                             (sighs)
                        Flo, this is a tough time. I’m not 
                        saying you don’t deserve it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        You and I both know that you do. 
                        But.. There’s a lot going on right 
                        now. 

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Remember what you told me the day 
                        you hired me? There’s always a lot 
                        going on. I’ve never used that as 
                        an excuse. All I’m asking is that 
                        you do the same. I don’t know if 
                        you’ve noticed... but morale is 
                        down. I want to be here to help. 
                        But I can’t on minimum wage 
                        forever.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Of course. We’ll get it worked out, 
                        Flo. I promise. 

           She nods. Unconvinced.

                        Jack.... it’s good to see you. It’s 
                        been... gosh, it’s been too long.

                        I had an appointment downtown.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Come on. Let’s go for a walk.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

           Stan and Jack sit in a near-empty theater. EASY RIDER plays.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Listen, the cartoon. I’m sorry. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I know. I overreacted. I just..

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. No, you didn’t. It’s unfair. 
                        You’re right. But... I’ve been 
                        thinking, Jack... I’m growing tired 
                        of the office politics. Of all the 
                        oversight. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You sound like Ditko. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What’s he up to these days? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Oh, who knows. Probably cooped up 
                        in his apartment plotting out a 
                        revolution. 
                             (a beat)
                        I miss him. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I do too.
           They sit in silence, watching more of the movie. 

           SHHHHHH!

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                             (whispering)
                        I’m just saying, Jack... You were 
                        right... Everything we’re done... 
                        none of it belongs to us. Now I 
                        figure, for the first time, at my 
                        age, it’s time we started thinking 
                        of other things. I know some 
                        producers- trying to do a movie 
                        scenario. The only problem is, as 
                        long as I’m here I don’t have the 
                        time to write them. And if I leave 
                        I don’t get the income, which I 
                        need to keep living.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You remember what you told me the 
                        day we first met? 
                             (off Stan)
                        That you were getting out of the 
                        business soon. You told me you were 
                        getting ready to start your novel. 
                        If you want to write a novel or a 
                        movie, or whatever it is, so badly, 
                        then just do it. No one is stopping 
                        you. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m going to quit. And I want you 
                        to do the same. Enough. We’ll start 
                        our own imprint. We’ll have total 
                        control.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Are you serious? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You were on to it from the very 
                        beginning. From the library. We 
                        should have kept Hulk for 
                        ourselves. Now’s our chance. 

           Jack nods. Close on both their faces, the reflection of the 
           screen coloring the room.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - GOODMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Stan sits across from Goodman, who’s already smiling.
                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin... we need to talk. I don’t--

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You’re right, Lieber. We do need to 
                        talk. The time has come. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It... it has? I mean, yes. How did 
                        you... 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You already know? Who told you? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Told me what? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        About Ackerman?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Who’s Ackerman? 

           Both of them confused as hell. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Martin Ackerman. You met him at the 
                        Christmas Party. OK, so you didn’t 
                        know. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Know what? Martin, you introduce me 
                        to hundreds of people at those 
                        things. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Believe me, he’s not someone you 
                        forget. He’s purchasing the 
                        company. He will become the 
                        majority owner of Marvel Comics in 
                        two weeks. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin... what?  This is your baby. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Well, I’ll be staying on as 
                        Publisher, of course. That won’t 
                        change. But the deal is done. It’s 
                        time, Stan. I’ve built this empire 
                        as high as one man can take it. Now 
                        it’s time for the real business. 
                        Take a look at this...

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                             (tosses a packet of papers 
                              on the desk)
                        We’re offering you your first long-
                        term contract with the company. 
                        You’re essential to what we’re 
                        doing here, Stan. 

           The first time he’s called him Stan.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (CONT'D)
                        Ackerman wanted to keep everyone on 
                        freelance, but I said no. Everyone 
                        can stay the way they are, but not 
                        Stan. He deserves more. He’s a 
                        pillar.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I... I can’t believe it. Thank you, 
                        Martin. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Once this goes through, you and 
                        Joanie will never have to want for 
                        anything as long as you live. I’ll 
                        get you set up with a financial 
                        advisor. You’re going to need a 
                        good one. So what was it you wanted 
                        to talk about? 
                             (looking at Stan)
                        You accept, I assume? 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (still in a daze)
                        Oh... yes... I... yes. It was 
                        nothing. 
                             (then realizing)
                        Wait, what about Jack? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Do you think it’s necessary? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes. Of course. Jack’s just as 
                        essential as I am. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Hmm. I don’t know if Ackerman will 
                        go for it. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin - for god’s sake. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I’ll work on him. 
           He begins to flip through the contract again...

           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Jack on the phone with Stan. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What’d Goodman say? God, I wish I 
                        could have seen the look on his 
                        face.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack... I’m not...
                             (correcting himself)
                        We’re not leaving. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What??

                                 STAN LEE
                        You’re not going to believe what 
                        happened. 

           Close on Jack’s wide eyes.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Those same eyes now watching... 

           The whole staff gathered. They huddle around the table, with 
           Goodman and Ackerman at the head. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Everyone... I’d like you to meet 
                        the new owner of Marvel Comics: 
                        Martin Ackerman. 

           Ackerman climbs up onto the table. Lights his cigar. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Thank you, Martin. The pleasure is 
                        all mine.

           Stan glances to the rest of the staff. Flo gives him a look: 
           “What the hell?”. Sol looks around. Suspicious. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                        In my mind, the highest priority 
                        here is to leave everything exactly 
                        as it is. Each and every one of you 
                        is essential. What you’ve created 
                        here is special.

                        I couldn’t live with myself if we 
                        changed that. And there’s an easy 
                        solution to that: we won’t.

           Off the staff’s looks. Phew.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - STAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Stan begins to pour a drink. Looks at Flo, offering her one 
           as well. She shakes her head. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What do you think?

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I mean, Stan, he’s an ass hole. You 
                        don’t need me to tell you that. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It sounds good doesn’t it? Not 
                        changing anything.

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        You don’t actually believe that do 
                        you? If nothing is changing, he 
                        wouldn’t be here. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Do you need something?

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Remember the conversation we had? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Flo, I’m trying. The company was 
                        just sold.

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I mean... Stan, I’m going to leave 
                        if I can’t get a raise. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Flo, please.

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        I’m almost 30, and I’m still making 
                        the same rate as when I started. 
                        It’s not like I want to spend my 
                        whole life answering calls. I can 
                        edit, you know? Maybe do some 
                        writing. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        Flo...

           A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. They both turn to see --

           ACKERMAN. He gives them a wave.

                                 ACKERMAN
                        I’m not interrupting anything, am 
                        I?

                        No, I was just leaving actually. 

           She blows past Ackerman, her head down. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                             (smiling)
                        Was it something I said? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Just office politics. You know how 
                        it is.

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Of course. 
                             (he shuts the door)
                        Were you listening in there?

                                 STAN LEE
                        In there? Of course. I thought --

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Forget everything I said. It was 
                        all bull shit. None of those people 
                        matter. It’s you, Stan. It’s you.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin, I... 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Don’t let any of these people get 
                        in your way. All I’m going to say 
                        is that a lot is going to happen 
                        over the next few years. But there 
                        will be two constants. You and me. 
                        I know you haven’t been treated the 
                        way you deserve. But you will be. 
                        You remind me of myself, Stan. And 
                        I like people that remind me of 
                        myself. 

           Stan stares back. Blank faced. He’s scared.

           The phone RINGS. Jack continues drawing. The phone RINGS 
           again. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Roz? 

           No answer. RING. Jack gets up, hurries up the stairs -- 

           TRIPS. Catches himself. RING. RING. Jack rushes into the 
           kitchen. Reaches for the phone. RI--

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        Hello? 

                                 CARMINE INFANTINO
                             (through the phone)
                        Mr. Kirby? Jack? This is Carmine 
                        Infantino. From over at DC comics. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                             (catching his breath)
                        Oh... hello. 

                                 CARMINE INFANTINO
                        I was hoping you might have a 
                        moment to talk. Is this a good 
                        time?
                             (a beat)
                        Jack? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Yes. Yes it is. 

           He shuts the door with a slow THUD. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - GOODMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        We’re giving Kirby two years.

                                 STAN LEE
                        It needs to be longer - two 
                        years... that’s not a long time. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Ackerman said two years, that’s 
                        what we’re doing. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        Ackerman said nothing around here 
                        was going to change. What happened 
                        to that?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You’ve all worked as free lancers 
                        for a decade. Now we’re giving you 
                        contracts. That’s changing things. 
                        Kirby should be thankful. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        This might as well be a free lance 
                        contract. This is an insult to him. 
                        We could lose him, Martin.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        He’s lucky to have us. Not the 
                        other way around. Remember that. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        He said nothing was going to 
                        change. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        How old are you, Lieber? Did you 
                        believe Daddy when he said that he 
                        loved Mommy? We’re doing what’s 
                        best for the company, not what’s 
                        best for Jack Kirby. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        There’s one more thing. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        What now? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        My secretary. Florence. I want to 
                        give her a raise. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You have to be kidding me. How many 
                        raises are you going to ask me for? 
                        It’s hard to find quality artists, 
                        but we can find a quality secretary 
                        on the street anytime.

                                 STAN LEE
                        She’s been here since the 
                        beginning. 
                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        So have we! You don’t see me coming 
                        into your office begging for a 
                        raise. Who do you want to keep? 
                        Kirby or her?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin, don’t make me do this. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Welcome to the world of business 
                        Stan, it’s not all rainbows and 
                        butterflies like it is down in 
                        comics. There’s a bottom line. Why 
                        do you think The Beatles are 
                        breaking up?

                                 STAN LEE
                        The Beatles aren’t breaking up. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Tell your secretary to stop getting 
                        her panties in a bunch. If she 
                        wants a better rate she can go get 
                        a degree like the rest of us. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You don’t have a degree.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You know what I mean. Now...

           ACKERMAN knocks on the door.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        I’m not interrupting anything, am 
                        I? Stan, how’s that contract 
                        looking to you?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Very generous, Mr. Ackerman, but 
                        Martin and I were just 
                        discussing... we’d like to go 
                        longer for Kirby. He...

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Not we. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        He deserves four years. Jack’s been 
                        here since the beginning.
                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Fair enough. Fair enough. But if he 
                        deserves to be here so badly... 
                        then where the hell is he? Why are 
                        you the one telling me this?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Listen, Jack... he’s not keen on 
                        the business side of things. He 
                        doesn’t like being in the office. 
                        He... he’s an artist.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        If Jack Kirby wants to be here, he 
                        can come into this office, look me 
                        in the eye and tell me why he 
                        deserves four years.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Done.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - DAY

           Close on a SPINNING RECORD. “TWO OF US” continues. 

           Colorful slacks, bell bottoms, go-go skirts, and head bands, 
           It’s the 70’s. 

           Sol sits on a table, holding up the record sleeve of LET IT 
           BE for Romita. The famous cover. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Just released this morning. I lined 
                        up at 4am to get it. 

                                 JOHN ROMITA
                        You’re insane. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Are you kidding me? This is going 
                        to be worth a mint. First pressing!

                                 JOHN ROMITA
                        I heard this is the last album.
                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        No way. 

                                 JOHN ROMITA
                        They ended Abbey Road with a song 
                        called The End. 

           Stan walks in. 

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Stan, new Beatles! 

           He blows by them. Approaches his office, in a rush--

                        He’s not here yet.

                        For the love of--

           But from around the corner... KIRBY.

           Jack steps into Stan’s office. Calm and reserved. 

           He’s not smoking a cigar. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack. You’re late. Let’s get up to 
                        Ackerman. Did you get the contract? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Yes, I did.

                                 STAN LEE
                        OK, good. Four years. Not bad, 
                        right? I think --

                        I’m not signing it, Stanley.

                        Stan... you’re not yourself

                        for god’s sake, you don’t even

                        Where are you going? Freelance? 
                        Some big ad company? I mean if....

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’m going to DC.

           Stan’s face absolutely drops. Like a dagger in the heart.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack... No...

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What do you want me to do? They’re 
                        offering me a great rate. Full 
                        creative control. Something you

                        It’s been worked out. You’re a 
                        people pleaser. You tell whoever is 
                        in front of you whatever they want 
                        to hear. You were supposed to quit! 
                        And your offer was shit. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It wasn’t my offer! God dammit! 

           He sweeps his hand across his desk, sending the contents 
           CRASHING to the floor.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’m sorry, Stanley. I wish it 
                        wasn’t like this. But you can’t 
                        blame me. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack, give me a day. We’ll get you 
                        a better offer. It’s ok. We can 
                        break the DC contract. Nothing is 
                        binding. We...

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You don’t get it. I want to go to 
                        DC. I signed the contract this 
                        morning. It’s done. We’re moving to 
                        California. 
           Stan in complete shock. 

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        It’s not about the contract. It’s 
                        not about the money. It’s about 
                        you. We didn’t get into this for 
                        the promotional tours or the money 
                        or... we did it because we wanted 
                        to. And we had a good run. But 
                        nothing lasts forever.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack, don’t do this. You know, when 
                        I was in the army, I--

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You weren’t in the army! Stop 
                        saying that. OK? Stop! I was in the 
                        army. I stormed the beaches at 
                        Normandy. You wrote manuals. It’s 
                        not the same. You didn’t see the 
                        same things I did. 

           Stan, for once in his life, is speechless. Jack gets up. 
           Begins to walk out.

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        Good luck, Stanley. I hope you find 
                        peace. Write your novel. 

           ACKERMAN comes walking down the hall.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Ah, the great Jack Kirby! We had a 
                        meeting scheduled in my office --

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Hello, Mr. Ackerman. Thank you for 
                        the opportunity, but I have to be 
                        going. Stanley can fill you in. 

           Jack walks away. As he nears the door, he takes one last look 
           back at the bullpen. And with that... he’s gone. 

           Stan tries to stay calm. Still in shock. Takes a deep breath. 
           Looks to Flo, who stands in the door with Ackerman.

                                 FLO STEINBERG
                        Is everything OK?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Everything is fine. Thank you, Flo. 
           She looks at Stan’s empty desk, everything that used to be on 
           it SCATTERED across the floor. The guitar solo on LET IT BE 
           blasts. 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - OFFICE - DAY

           TITLE CARD READS: 1972

           Over “FEARLESS” by Pink Floyd 

           Close on a CHUNK OF CIGAR. It’s fixed to plaque that reads: 
           KIRBY WAS HERE.

           We sweep across the Marvel office/bullpen. Almost every desk 
           is occupied by a new face. 

                                 AGNES  (O.S.)
                        Mr. Lee? 

           INT. MARVEL COMICS OFFICE - STAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Stan looks up from his desk. His toupee looks worse than 
           ever. AGNES, his new secretary, 60’s, is in the doorway.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes, Agnes?

                                 AGNES
                        Sol would like to see you. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Great, let him in.

           Sol paces into the room, holding a comic.

                                 SOL BRODSKY
                        Did you see this? 

           He slaps a copy of MISTER MIRACLE #6 on Stan’s desk. Clearly 
           Kirby’s work. A comic from his line at DC.

           A character named FUNKY FLASHMAN adorns the cover. It looks 
           exactly like Stan. A mockery. 

           His dialogue reads: “All the great words and quotations and 
           cliches ever written are at my beck and call! Even if I say 
           them sideways, the little people will listen! - in wonder! In 
           awe!”

           He has a slave: “Master funky! My leader!” 
                                 SOL BRODSKY (CONT'D)
                        That’s me. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It appears so. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN (O.S.)
                        Can we talk?

           Stan looks up. Goodman stands in his doorway. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s really not a good time. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Then I’ll make this very simple. We 
                        got last month’s numbers -- Horror 
                        is back in, Stan. Cancel a 
                        superhero book or two. 

           Stan can’t believe it. It’s 1961 all over again. 

           Two GIANT POSTERS behind him: The Fantastic Four by Jack 
           Kirby and Spider-Man by Steve Ditko. They tower over him.

           INT. LIEBER RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Stan stares into the mirror. He holds the copy of Mister 
           Miracle. Funky Flashman staring right back at him. 

           He covers his face in shaving cream. Removes a razor and 
           SHAVES OFF all of his thick beard. The sink clogged with 
           facial hair.

                                 JOAN (O.S.)
                        Stan! Phone for you. 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (picking up the phone in 
                              his room)
                        Hello? 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Stan. It’s Marty Ackerman. Do you 
                        have any time for a drink later 
                        this afternoon?

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - DAY

           Stan enters to find Ackerman already seated at a table in the 
           restaurant. He cradles a glass of whiskey, and nods to 
           another full glass on the opposite side of the table. 
                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        I ordered for both of us. I hope 
                        you don’t mind. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Of course not.
                             (coughing as he takes a 
                              sip)
                        That’s strong. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        I don’t drink anything unless it’s 
                        at least a decade old. Now, as I’m 
                        sure you’ve guessed, this was not 
                        strictly a social drink. I’m sorry 
                        to drag you away on a Saturday, I’m 
                        sure you’re busy on the latest 
                        scripts. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, I’m not writing as much now.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Modest as always. One of your 
                        strongest qualities. 
                             (off Stan)
                        You know that when we bought this 
                        company our number one priority was 
                        that you were locked up long term.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes, and I can’t thank you enough.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        And, as of today, I’m removing you 
                        from that position.
                             (off Stan’s puzzled look)
                        Congratulations. You’re the new 
                        publisher at Marvel Comics. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        What? What about Goodman?

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Goodman wants his son to take over 
                        as publisher. There’s not a rat’s 
                        chance in hell that I’d let his son 
                        run this company. Nepotism can get 
                        you many things, but it won’t get 
                        you past Marty Ackerman. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I can’t... thank you enough, Mr. 
                        Ackerman. 
                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Goodman could have rewarded you at 
                        any time. He didn’t. Now, it’s your 
                        time to be in charge. 

           Off Stan. It feels dirty. But Ackerman is right.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                        You worry about the comics, I’ll 
                        worry about Goodman. Martin won’t 
                        be a problem. Now, time for cigars. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I don’t smoke. 

           As Ackerman sparks his lighter.... 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        You do now.

                        Yes. Let’s. I’ll make this very 
                        simple for you. Do you want to be

                        I dropped out of 5th grade. I 
                        worked construction every day for 
                        ten years. I built a publishing 
                        empire from the ground up. I didn’t 
                        do that to be put out by a

                        No Martin, you didn’t. I built 
                        this. On a freelance contract. And 
                        you did nothing to help me.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I hired you! I paid you a salary!

                        Then you should have left! You 
                        should have gotten up and walked 
                        out! You should have gone 
                        independent. Don’t blame me for a

                        How long did you think you could 
                        keep taking advantage of us? 
                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Us?? Kirby is gone. Ditko is gone. 
                        You’re a glorified ad man! You 
                        don’t even write anymore. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I manage the writers. Just like you 
                        manage the company. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        They wanted to get rid of you 
                        Lieber. Said your salary was too 
                        high, that anyone could do your 
                        job. I fought for you.

                                 STAN LEE
                        No, Martin. You didn’t. After all 
                        these years you think you can 
                        blatantly lie to my face. I know 
                        you. I’m not the child you hired 
                        thirty years ago. I grew up, 
                        Martin. You didn’t. Did you believe 
                        Daddy when he said he loved Mommy?

           Martin bites his lip. His own words. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Goodbye, Lieber. Congratulations. 

           Martin walks out. SLAMMING the door behind him. 

           Stan is alone in the office. He places his hand on the cold 
           window. Fixes himself a lone drink. He sits down on the 
           couch. Takes a long drink as snow falls outside.

                        You know it’s snowing in New York 
                        right now? You can’t miss that.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, I wish we could get Yankee 
                        games out here.

                        We have the Dodgers! 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I hate the Dodgers.

                                 CARMINE INFANTINO
                        Well, listen Jack. We love what 
                        you’ve been doing. Newest Mister 
                        Miracle was a hoot. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        What is it?

                        We think you need a writer. 

           Like a dagger through Jack’s chest. He takes a deep breath.

           Stan is in the midst of holding a staff meeting. His toupee 
           is GONE, his remaining hair slicked back, his shirt more 
           colorful, his iconic glasses even darker. 

           He’s in charge. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        This morning I received a call from 
                        a top dog at Hasbro, yelling at me 
                        because we put webs in Spider-Man’s 
                        arm pits. All character changes 
                        need to be run by me. I’m tired of 
                        opening up new issues and seeing 
                        different costumes. Spider-Man has 
                        webs under his arms again, Captain 
                        America has wing tips on his mask. 
                        We have multi-million toy deals 
                        that are being affected by this.

           Reveal the staff. We hardly recognize anyone.

                        Is that understood?

                              head nods)
                        Good. If you have any pressing 
                        questions, Roy can answer them. 
                        I’ll see you all next week when I

           SQUINTING.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           THE HULK rises from the water. SCREAMING.

                                 LOU FERRIGNO
                        AHHHHH. 

           The HULK (LOU FERRIGNO) wrestles with a BROWN BEAR in a 
           creek. He fights the bear off, wrestling it underwater. 

                                 DIRECTOR
                        CUT! Cut. 

           We’re on the SET of the INCREDIBLE HULK TV show. Stan sits in 
           video village with the DIRECTOR, a total douche.

                                 DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                        Alright, great work everyone. Kyle, 
                        get out of that costume, let’s 
                        prepare the bear doll.

                                 BEAR/KYLE
                        OK, sounds good. 

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Five minute break everyone. What do 
                        you think, Mr. Lee?

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s fantastic. Just like the 
                        books.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Lou! Get over here! 

           Ferrigno walks over, still in his HULK makeup.
                                 DIRECTOR (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Do you know who this is? 

                                 LOU FERRIGNO
                        No. 

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Of course you don’t. It’s Stan Lee. 
                        He created the Hulk. You wouldn’t 
                        be here if it weren’t for him. 

           The BEAR walks over. His mask is now off to reveal KYLE, a 
           nerdy stunt man. 

                                 BEAR/KYLE
                        I’m actually a huge fan, Mr. Lee. 
                        It’s an honor to meet you.

           INT. KIRBY RESIDENCE - CALIFORNIA - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Kirby sits across from WILL EISNER, a legendary cartoonist, 
           who is conducting an interview.

                                 WILL EISNER 
                        Thank you for sitting down with me, 
                        Jack. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Of course, Mr. Eisner. You know I’m 
                        a fan of your work. 

                                 WILL EISNER
                        And I yours. I think it’s important 
                        that the world knows your side of 
                        the story. Let’s start with 1961. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, they were going to close 
                        everything up. Things were in a bad 
                        way. I remember telling Stanley I 
                        had some ideas... So we began to 
                        build a new line of superheroes. 

                                 WILL EISNER
                        And how did you and Lee 
                        collaborate? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Stan Lee was not writing. I was 
                        doing the writing.

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        Stan added dialogue... to a story I 
                        had already turned in. Most of the 
                        writing at Marvel is done by the 
                        artist of that script. That’s the 
                        way it’s always been. “The Marvel 
                        Method”.

                                 WILL EISNER
                        And the Fantastic Four? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’m not saying that Stan had 
                        nothing to do with it. Of course he 
                        did. We talked things out. As 
                        things went on, I began to work at 
                        home and I no longer came into the 
                        office. I developed all the stuff 
                        at home and just sent it in.

                                 WILL EISNER
                        Do you keep up with Marvel? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Here and there. Have you seen this 
                        one?

           He holds up an issue of Spider-Man.

           Flips to the middle and displays an AD: Stan standing with 
           his arms crossed. “When you create super-heroes, people 
           expect you to look like one. I wear Hathaway shirts!”

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        That’s Stanley for you. 

           INT./EXT. STAN LEE’S CAR - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Stan cruises down Sunset Blvd. in his convertible. Bright 
           red, reflecting the low Los Angeles sunset. He’s wearing a 
           Hathaway shirt. 

           INT. MARVEL PRODUCTION OFFICES - DAY

           TOM SELLECK sits across from Stan. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        So, Mr. Selleck, what do you know 
                        about Doctor Strange?

           Selleck shrugs his shoulders. 
                                 TOM SELLECK
                        You want to go grab a drink? I know 
                        some girls we could call. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        That sounds wonderful, Mr. Selleck. 
                        I’m married though.  

                                 TOM SELLECK
                        How long have you been in 
                        Hollywood, Stan?

                                 STAN LEE
                        A few months now. 

                                 TOM SELLECK
                        Yeah. You’ll get adjusted. Send me 
                        some books and I’ll have my intern 
                        read them. 

           He gets up to leave. Agnes comes into the office. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Agnes, can you make sure we get 
                        some Doctor Strange comics to Mr. 
                        Selleck? And we need to get James 
                        Cameron on the phone. The script he 
                        turned in is about a man who turns 
                        into a giant spider, not Spider-
                        Man. 

                                 AGNES
                        Of course, Mr. Lee. Mail. 

           She dumps a pile of magazines and bills on Stan’s desk. The 
           cover of COMICS JOURNAL catches his eye.

           “JACK KIRBY TELLS ALL.” Stan does a double take. Immediately 
           flips to the center of the magazine. A full page photograph 
           of Jack. He begins to read the interview.

                                 REPORTER
                        Mr. Lee, how does it feel to 
                        finally take Marvel Comics public? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Fantastic. Just swell. 
           They walk up the stairs, towards the bell. There’s a COSTUMED 
           SPIDER-MAN dancing around them. 

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN
                        Isn’t he great? Hired him out of 
                        the paper. 

           They both turn as the Spider-Man actor does a strange 
           combination of interpretive dance and web-shooting.

                                 MARTIN ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Come on, Stan, smile. You’re rich. 

           Stan and Ackerman are joined by Spider-Man. They all smile 
           for the BRIGHT FLASH of the cameras.

                        back to those days of the Merry 
                        Marvel Bullpen. What was it like? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, Warren, I didn’t consider it 
                        merry. In those days, it was a 
                        professional type thing, you turned 
                        in your ideas and you got your 
                        wages. It’s nothing that should be 
                        glamorized. I would be in the 
                        office maybe once a week. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           Stan is driving a rental car back from the stock exchange. He 
           listens to the radio. Tunes it and hears -- 

           Jack’s voice.
           INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

                                 WARREN REECE
                        But, Jack, what about those 
                        legendary story conferences with 
                        you and Stan, acting the stories 
                        out? When it was just you and Stan 
                        and fabulous Flo Steinberg livening 
                        up the office?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I... uh... I’d have to disagree 
                        with that. It wasn’t like that at 
                        all. It may have been like that 
                        after I went home. 

           The phone lines are ringing with callers. An INTERN picks up 
           one of the phones. 

                                 INTERN
                        WBAI, what’s your topic? 
                             (he listens)
                        Wait, what? 

           He mutes the phone and turns to the producer. Warren taps his 
           ear. Listening in. Can’t believe what he’s about to say. 

                                 WARREN REECE
                        Now what a surprise... we have a 
                        special surprise guest for 
                        tonight’s program. It’s Stan Lee! 

           A crackle. An expectant silence before Stan’s voice comes 
           alive on the other line. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I just... I want to wish Jack a 
                        happy birthday. This is a hell of a 
                        coincidence. I’m in New York and I 
                        was tuning in the radio. And there 
                        I hear him talking about Marvel and 
                        figured I might as well call and 
                        say happy returns, Jack.  

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, Stanley. I want to thank you 
                        for calling. And I hope you’re in 
                        good health.

                                 STAN LEE
                        And you too, Jack. Nobody could 
                        ever draw a hero like you could.

                                 STAN LEE (CONT'D)
                        One of the marks of a truly great 
                        artists is having a style, and 
                        that’s certainly true of you Jack. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I’m certain that whatever we did 
                        together, we got sales for Marvel.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, I think it was more than 
                        that. We certainly got the sales, 
                        but whatever we did together, and 
                        no matter who did what... and I 
                        guess that will be something argued 
                        forever... it was more than the sum 
                        of its parts. Like some sort of 
                        magic. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, I was never sorry for it, 
                        Stanley. 

                                 WARREN REECE
                        I would also like to put to you 
                        gentlemen, that what made your work 
                        so tremendous... it doesn’t matter 
                        who did what. Although it would be 
                        interesting to know if Galactus’ 
                        exit speech in FF #50 was an 
                        example of Jack’s dialogue or 
                        Stan’s, but...

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, I’ll say this: every word of 
                        dialogue in those scripts was mine.
                             (awkward laughter from the 
                              hosts)
                        Every story.

                                 WARREN REECE
                        Now, I don’t want to get into 
                        controversy, but I want to stress 
                        that the whole equals more than the 
                        sum of its parts that’s how groups 
                        like the Beatles...

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I can tell you that I wrote a few 
                        lines myself above every panel.

                                 STAN LEE
                        They weren’t printed in the book! 
                                 WARREN REECE
                        Alright, look...

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack isn’t wrong in his own rights, 
                        but....

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I wasn’t allowed to write! 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Did you ever read one of the 
                        stories after they were finished? I 
                        don’t think you did! You were busy 
                        working on the next issue. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You used my own dialogue. Whatever 
                        was written in them was 
                        insignificant.

                                 WARREN REECE
                        Well, ego is the fuel of 
                        creativity, and uh... well, I’m 
                        very proud to have had both Jack 
                        Kirby and Stan Lee live on earth-
                        watch. And as we close this 
                        program, I’d like each of you to 
                        make a concluding statement.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, I just want to say that Jack 
                        has, I think, made a tremendous 
                        mark on American culture, if not 
                        world culture. He should be 
                        incredibly proud. I want to wish 
                        him all the best, him and his wife, 
                        Roz, and I hope ten years from now 
                        I’ll be in some town listening to a 
                        tribute to his 80th birthday. 
                        Jack... I love ya. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, same here Stan. But... uh.... 
                        uh... yeah. Thank you very much 
                        Stan.
                             (a moment of silence)
                        Warren? Are you there?

                                 WARREN REECE
                        Yes, I am. We’re all here. 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Listen... uh... you can understand 
                        now how things really were. And of 
                        course, I want to thank you for 
                        inviting me on your show.

           INT. MARVEL COMICS - ACKERMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Stan sits across from Ackerman. There are stacks of comics on 
           his desk. Stan flips through them. 

           They’re all copies of X-Men: Apocalypse. The same issue, but 
           with ten different covers. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Everyone’s talking about you and 
                        Kirby. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        That was a nice surprise.

                                 ACKERMAN
                        He’s a loon. Clearly jealous of the 
                        credit and success you’re 
                        receiving. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I understand why he’s upset. I just 
                        wish -- 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Wish he would shut his mouth. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. Jack’s a friend. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Tell me about Howard the Duck. The 
                        dailies look amazing. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s... I was hoping we’d find 
                        another property to develop first. 
                        But, I think it’s coming together. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        It’s going to be huge, Stan. 
                        Absolutely huge. 

           Stan flips through the X-Men comic. It’s like he doesn’t 
           recognize it. 
                                 STAN LEE
                        I think we need to cut back on all 
                        these variant covers. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Are you kidding me? These things 
                        are a cash cow. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It doesn’t seem... Dishonest? 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Dishonest? The market favors the 
                        collectors now. They want a copy of 
                        everything, so why not multiply 
                        everything by three or four? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I just worry that it’s a bubble. 
                        These things aren’t going to be 
                        worth anything if there are 
                        millions of them. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        We’ll let time decide that. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        The issues from the 60’s are 
                        valuable only because there’s a 
                        limited quantity. You know... The 
                        thing that set Marvel apart from 
                        the beginning was that we did 
                        things differently. The stories 
                        were original. We didn’t create 
                        this just so we could print ten 
                        different covers for every issue.

                                 ACKERMAN
                        I have a news flash for you, Stan. 
                        We’re not in the 60’s anymore.
                             (Stan doesn’t respond)
                        Are you ready for 60 minutes? It’s 
                        going to be pretty exciting to meet 
                        Larry King, huh? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes. I’m actually taking a quick 
                        trip down to Florida first. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Florida? What’s in Florida? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        An old friend. 
           INT. MARTIN GOODMAN’S CONDO - FLORIDA - DAY

           Floral wallpaper. A stale breeze. Florida. 

           Stan enters the condo. Martin sits out on the deck. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Isn’t Florida supposed to be warm? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You’ve grown weak in the California 
                        sun. 58 degrees in January and 
                        you’re complaining. Take a seat. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s good to see you, Martin.

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Let’s stop with the pleasantries. I 
                        didn’t ask you to come down so you 
                        could blow smoke up my ass. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Then why did you call me? 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Because you don’t always get to 
                        choose when you say goodbye. So I 
                        thought I would. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Martin. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        You know I went to the news stand 
                        the other day. Just to see what was 
                        selling. It’s amazing how things 
                        have changed. Ten covers for every 
                        issue. Holograms. I see the company 
                        went public. That must make you and 
                        your wallet happy. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        It’s been good, Martin. We’re good. 
                        But...

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        But?

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m worried that we’re on the verge 
                        of trouble. It feels like we’re 
                        standing on the cliff. This bubble 
                        is going to burst. 
                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        And Hollywood? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Hollywood is... it’s not coming 
                        together exactly as I hoped. But --

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Making movies isn’t easy, Stan. You 
                        always acted like you could just 
                        snap your fingers and turn these 
                        things into successful films. If it 
                        was that simple, everyone would be 
                        doing it. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We’ll figure it out. It’s just 
                        taking longer than I hoped. More 
                        money too. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        How’s your writing? What have you 
                        been working on? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        This and that. This and that. I’m 
                        going to start my novel soon. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Ah, yes.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m sorry, Martin. For how it all 
                        turned out. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I don’t blame you. I’m sure I would 
                        have done the same had I been in 
                        your position. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I didn’t mean to... It wasn’t my 
                        idea, you know. I set out to do 
                        something unique, you set out to 
                        make money. We ended up with 
                        something that was the perfect 
                        balance of both. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Maybe that was the problem.

           Stan says nothing as the wind picks up, the breeze off the 
           ocean blowing their hair back. Stan shields his eyes with his 
           hand. The waves breaking back and forth. 
           INT. SIXTY MINUTES SET - NIGHT

           LARRY KING brings them in from commercial break. 

                                 LARRY KING
                        Welcome back to 60 Minutes. We 
                        continue our conversation with the 
                        man still behind Marvel comics 
                        after all these years: Stan Lee. 
                        Let’s take a look at a clip from 
                        his latest work. The feature film: 
                        Howard the Duck. 

           The clip plays. HOWARD THE DUCK is in a woman’s bedroom. He 
           wears a red robe, the girl in just her underwear. 

                                 HOWARD THE DUCK
                        I have to get back to my own kind. 
                        Although....

           He watches the girl climb on the bed. 

                                 HOWARD THE DUCK (CONT'D)
                             (raising his eyebrow 
                              seductively)
                        I have developed a greater 
                        appreciation for the human anatomy. 

           Howard laughs. However ducks laugh. The clip ends. It sucks. 

                                 LARRY KING
                        I have to say, and please pardon 
                        the pun, that looks like a real 
                        marvel! Thanks again for joining 
                        us, Stan. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        My pleasure, Larry. 

                                 LARRY KING
                        Stan, more and more we’re seeing an 
                        industry that’s driven towards 
                        collectors. Comics used to be sold 
                        on the news stand with newspapers, 
                        on spinner racks at the drug store. 
                        Now we have stores that sell 
                        nothing but comics and the 
                        merchandise associated with them. 
                             (looking to Stan)
                        Are you worried that Marvel is 
                        pushing more than the market can 
                        bear? 
                                 STAN LEE
                        No, that’s a negative way to put 
                        it. All we’re doing is giving the 
                        public more of what they want. 

                                                              SMASH TO:

           Captain America is tied to a rocket. The Red Skull stands in

           incredibly fake.

           TITLE CARD READS: 1998

           A beautiful home in the Brentwood Hills.

           Stan stands with a BLOCK CELL PHONE to his ear. Joan, in full 
           90’s mom jeans and loud shirt, listens on the couch. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        How is this going to affect the 
                        Hollywood office? That’s all I’m 
                        concerned about. 
                             (listening)
                        I know. I know. We’re close on 
                        Spider-Man. Relatively close.

                        Yes, I’ll have my lawyers review 
                        the paperwork. 

           He walks back inside. Puts the phone down. It’s massive. 

                                 JOAN
                        What’s going on?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Everything is fine. Some contracts 
                        are being voided.

                                 JOAN
                        Which ones?

                        Honey, I have a lifetime contract. 
                        You can’t void a lifetime contract.

                                 JOAN
                        Are you sure?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes. My contract was voided about a 
                        week later. When I arrived in New 
                        York, I was greeted with a new 
                        contract that would pay me 50% less

                        I agreed to an amended contract 
                        that would pay me less, with one 
                        stipulation added.

                                 EILEEN
                        A stipulation?

                        It’s unfortunate Stan, but I’m glad 
                        we can work this out. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Have you given thought to the rest 
                        of the proposal?

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Of course. Of course.

           He covers the receiver. Looks at the other men in the room.
                                 ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck is he talking about? 

                                 MARVEL EXECUTIVE
                        He asked for 10% of all future film 
                        and television profits. 

                                 ACKERMAN
                        Do we have anything in production?
                             (they all shake their 
                              heads)
                        It’s a deal. We’ll have the papers

                        My understanding is that in the 
                        wake of the bankruptcy, there were 
                        multiple financial “reshuffling”

                        Ackerman was fired. And what of 
                        you? 

           INT. SAN DIEGO CONVENTION CENTER- DAY

           San Diego Comic Con. It’s not the Comic Con we know today. 
           Hollywood has no presence there. There’s no Hall H. No 
           trailer drops. It’s pure, closer to that gym in Brooklyn than 
           today’s behemoth. 
           Stan is walking down the aisles of booths, taking in the 
           array of art, promotions, costumes, and weirdos. Something 
           catches his attention out of the corner of his eye -- 

           He turns toward it, making sure he read the sign correctly. 
           He did. KIRBY sits in front of him. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Jack?

                                 JACK KIRBY
                             (surprised but composed)
                        Stanley. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I didn’t know you’d be here. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Everyone’s in San Diego. You here 
                        with Marvel? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        No - promoting the new company. 
                        POW. We’re launching soon.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I hadn’t heard. Congratulations. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We’ll have to get you in the office 
                        next time you’re in LA. I think 
                        you’d like it, Jack. It reminds me 
                        of the good old days. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Sure. 

                                 STAN LEE
                             (sitting down across from 
                              him)
                        Listen, I... I’m glad I ran into 
                        you. I wanted to apologize for that 
                        stuff on the radio. It was... it 
                        was stupid. I shouldn’t have called 
                        in. That was your show. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        It’s OK, Stanley. I got worked up. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You remember that first evening? 
                        When we dreamed up Fantastic Four? 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Of course. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        We had a good thing, Jack. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Yeah, we did. Those were good 
                        books. Real good. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I know things didn’t turn out the 
                        way we were expecting. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I don’t know about that. I think 
                        everyone could see it coming. 
                        Everyone but you. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        You know the only other person who 
                        calls me Stanley is my wife. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, it’s your name. I think you 
                        forget that sometimes. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Maybe I do. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I have to get to a panel.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Of course, of course. Maybe we 
                        could get dinner tonight? See a 
                        movie? You know the restaurant from 
                        Top Gun is right down the street? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        I fly out at eight.

                                 STAN LEE
                        Oh. Too bad.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Yes. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Well, let’s... let’s get together 
                        soon. I know Joan would love to see 
                        Roz. And... I don’t know, maybe we 
                        could work on something. Like the 
                        old days. 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        The old days. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yeah. Who knows, we might still 
                        have some of that magic. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Goodbye, Stanley. Have you started 
                        that novel? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Not yet. Soon. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Did you ever think... All your talk 
                        about your novel... maybe Fantastic 
                        Four, maybe Marvel... maybe that 
                        was the Great American Novel. It 
                        was right under your nose the whole 
                        time. And you couldn’t wait to get 
                        away to chase the very thing you 
                        were already doing. 
                             (off Stan’s stunned 
                              silence)
                        We got everything we wanted, 
                        Stanley. We just couldn’t hold onto 
                        it. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        There’s still time. 

           Jack just smiles. Remember, you don’t always get to choose 
           when you say goodbye. 

           INT. BOARD ROOM - EVENING

                                 EILEEN
                        How did you find out?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Sol called. Roz called Sol and told 
                        him to tell me. 

                                 EILEEN
                        You didn’t know about his heart?

                                 STAN LEE
                        No. I had no idea. 

                                 EILEEN
                        You went to the funeral? 
                                 STAN LEE
                        Yeah. It was good to see everyone.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Church bells RINGING. Kirby’s funeral.

           Stan is in the back of the church. Stands against the wall. 
           People look back, giving him glances.

           No one’s talking to Stan. 

           INT. LOS ANGELES COURT HOUSE - DAY

           Stan waits for a JUDGE. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Reason for name change? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        I... 

           The judge STAMPS the sheet.

                                 JUDGE
                        You’re all set, Mr. Lee. 

           He slides the sheet back to Stan. We get a look at it: 
           “CERTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME”

           It’s official. Stanley Lieber is now Stan Lee. 

           INT. BOARD ROOM - NIGHT

           The sun has set. The board room dark. 

                                 EILEEN
                        And here we are. Spider-Man earned 
                        over 500 million dollars and you’re 
                        looking for your cut.

                                 STAN LEE
                        I’m just asking for what is fair. 

                                 EILEEN
                        Fair?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Yes. 
                                 EILEEN
                        5:02. Any more questions for the 
                        day? 
                             (No.)
                        Then we’ll resume tomorrow. 

           The group surrounding the table gathers their things. Papers 
           shuffling. Folders closing. Bags zipping. 

           Stan sits alone in the room as everyone else leaves. JIM, 
           50’s, a member of the panel, lingers. 

                                 JIM
                        Mr. Lee. I wanted to ask you... 
                        would you mind signing this?

           He pulls an envelope out from the bottom of his stack of 
           papers. Dusts it off. 

           It’s a NO-PRIZE. “Congratulations! This envelope contains a 
           genuine Marvel Comics NO-PRIZE which you have just won!”

                                 JIM (CONT'D)
                        I wrote in to the letter pages as a 
                        kid. Found a typo. 

           He opens the envelope. Tips it over.

           There’s nothing inside.

                                 JIM (CONT'D)
                        What was it like? The first day on 
                        set? 

           INT. SET OF SPIDER-MAN - STAN’S TRAILER - DAY

           Stan sits in his trailer, MAKE UP ARTISTS working on his 
           face. AVI ARAD stands next to him. 

                                 AVI ARAD
                        What do you think, Stan, is this 
                        the one? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        At this point I’m not optimistic. I 
                        mean, this thing is only going to 
                        go so far. They’re not going to 
                        make a Guardians of the Galaxy 
                        movie.

           Avi nods. He can’t disagree. A KNOCK at the door. A young 
           P.A. sneaks his head into the trailer. 
                                 P.A.
                        Mr. Lee? They’re ready for you. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Call me Stan. 

           EXT. SET OF SPIDER-MAN - DAY

           The P.A. guides Stan through the chaos of the set. Extras 
           everywhere. They snake through video village.

           Three different SPIDER-MAN’s all stand together.

                                 SAM RAIMI
                        Alright, Stan. You ready? 

           Stan turns. Gives his patented smile and a THUMBS UP.

                                 SAM RAIMI (CONT'D)
                        Ready.... And... ACTION!

           CUT TO BLACK 

           The first few strings of “GOOD NIGHT” by the Beatles before 
           we fade up to...

           INT. MAGAZINE MANAGEMENT - DAY

           KIRBY works at a desk. But he’s thinner, healthier, despite 
           the fact that he’s still chomping on a cigar. 

           It’s 1941. Jack’s only 24. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Kirby, did you read the paper this 
                        morning? I’m worried about Hitler. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        You’re worried about... Hitler?

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        I’m worried that he’s going to blow 
                        his brains out. We’d have to 
                        completely re-do this week’s issue. 

                                 STAN LEE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Goodman! 

           Goodman rolls his eyes as...
                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Jack... meet Stanley Lieber. He’s 
                        my wife’s cousin’s... how are we 
                        related again?

           It’s STAN. Just 20. All dressed up for work. 

                                 STAN LEE
                        My wife is your wife’s cousin. 

                                 MARTIN GOODMAN
                        Right. Anyhow. We’ve hired him to 
                        come aboard as an assistant editor. 
                        Perhaps you can you find something 
                        for him to do? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Can I empty your ash tray for you, 
                        Mr. Kirby? 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        That’s alright, I don’t need you to 
                        do that. What have you been working 
                        on so far? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        Mr. Simon gave me my first 
                        assignment. Take a look.

           Jack flips through it. An issue of Captain America. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Why’s it say Stan Lee? I thought 
                        your name was Lieber?

                                 STAN LEE
                        I didn’t use my real name. I don’t 
                        want to derail my future career. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Future career as what? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        As a serious writer. I’d like to 
                        write a novel.

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Oh yeah? What type of novel? 

                                 STAN LEE
                        The Great American novel. 
                                 JACK KIRBY
                        So you want to write a novel, but 
                        you don’t know what it’s going to 
                        be about?

                                 STAN LEE
                        The way I see it, that’s not the 
                        important part. I’ll figure out 
                        exactly what folks want to read, 
                        and that’s what I’ll write. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, I think people should be who 
                        they are. No shame in hiding it.
                        So, what the hell are you doing 
                        here then?

                                 STAN LEE
                        Just passing the time. I’m recently 
                        married - need to pay the bills. 
                        But I won’t be here for long. 

                                 JACK KIRBY
                        Well, I wish you luck, Stanley. For 
                        your sake, I hope you’re not here 
                        for long either.

           Stan smiles.

                                 JACK KIRBY (CONT'D)
                        And I’ll keep an eye out for your 
                        name. In the book store. Stanley 
                        Lieber. That’s quite a name.

           TITLE CARDS READ: 

           Stan Lee and Marvel Comics settled in 2005 for a one-time 
           payment of 10 million dollars with an annual salary of one 
           million dollars in perpetuity.

           Steve Ditko died in 2018. He had not given an interview since 

           In 2010, Jack Kirby’s children sued Marvel for control of the 
           characters Kirby had helped create. The court ruled in the 
           favor of Marvel before a settlement was reached. 

           To date, Marvel films have made over 22.5 Billion Dollars 
           worldwide. If Lee’s original contract was honored, he would 
           be owed over two billion dollars.
           Stan Lee died in 2018 at the age of 95. He never finished his 
           novel. 

           The title card for the Marvel films still reads: Created by 
           Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.
