           INT. PITTSBURGH - BLUE LINE SUBWAY - NIGHT

           Heaters HISS under the feet of daily commuters. 

           Someone COUGHS into their scarf.

           Another shuffles the Times to the next article, side-eyeing a 
           MAN down the row, who’s feverishly talking to himself... 

                                 MAN
                             (whispering)
                        Shut up! Shut up. 

           Black trench, dress shirt, brogue shoes. If it wasn’t for his 
           one-sided conversation, he’d blend right in. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m going as fast as I can. 

           Other passengers move farther away from him, he notices. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        It better work. 

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT 

           The man’s flashlight combs through file cabinets. 

                                 MAN
                        It’s not here. 

           He listens for an answer. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve looked through all of them!! 

           Listens, turns to a cabinet in the corner. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        I see it. 

           He grabs a crowbar and wedges the locked drawer open. Looks 
           through the contents... Plucks out a folder. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        Got it. Where do I go now? 

           INT. RED LINE SUBWAY - CONT. 

           A quick ride. He grips the straps to his backpack. 
           EXT. LIBERTY BRIDGE - NIGHT 

           He hustles to the middle of the bridge. Looks around. 

                                 MAN
                        I’m here! Tell me!! 

           Listens... 

           Takes the folder out of his bag, then a lighter. He holds it 
           over the ledge and starts the folder on fire. 

           Other pedestrians notice, some walk away, a few raise their 
           phones to their ears. 

           Once the flame has taken most of the papers, he lets it drop 
           130 feet to the water... 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        It’s done. Now hold up your end of 
                        the bargain. 
                             (beat)
                        No. NO! No more! 

           He wipes the tears from his eyes. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        Please. Just tell me how to make it 
                        stop...   

           Listens... 

           His face drops. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        Promise me. 
                             (beat)
                        Okay. 

           He reaches into his bag, pulls out a coil of rope. He ties 
           one end to the railing. Ties another knot. 

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Hey! Sir, what’s going on? 

           Two cops on bicycles pull up.

                                 MAN
                             (seeing them)
                        Shit. Look what you’ve done! 

           A crowd starts to form...

           The man looks over the ledge. 
                                 COP
                        Easy now. Why don’t you come stand 
                        over here? 

           The man hops up on the railing. The onlookers GASP.

           But all is well, he’s still holding onto the rope attached to 
           the railing. 

                                 COP (CONT'D)
                        HEY! Come down!! We can help you. 

           Urine runs down his pant leg, drips off the railing. 

           Takes a deep breath. 

                                 MAN
                        You can’t help me now. 

           He slips the rope over his head, he didn’t tie a knot... 

           He tied a noose. 

           Someone SCREAMS as he falls backward into the darkness. 

           We PUSH toward the trailing slack in the rope over the edge 
           and follow the man’s free fall. 

           The rope is pulled TAUT, on the CRUNCH, we

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. PITTSBURGH STREETS - PSYCHIC STOREFRONT - NIGHT

           A car splashes by. 

           Rain. 

           Cold, bleak rain. 

           A neon sign HUMS in the window of a small, grey building. It 
           reads “PSYCHIC”. 

           INT. PSYCHIC STORE - RECEPTION - NIGHT

           No frills here. No incense, no three-eyed elephants. This 
           place could almost pass as a doctor’s clinic. 

           The front door opens and a large woman enters. From the back, 
           a VOICE calls out. 
                                 KIMBALL (O.S.)
                        Hi, Ola! 

           OLA beams at the sound of her name being called out. 

                                 OLA
                        You always know it’s me! 

           KIMBALL (30’s) walks out, hair cut to her shoulders, a 
           comfortable yet modern sweater on. She gives Ola a hug. 

                                 OLA (CONT'D)
                        You are talented, aren’t you. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Thank you. But also... 

           She points to the security camera in the corner. 

                                 OLA
                             (laughs)
                        I still think you’re talented. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You’re sweet. Come on back. 

           INT. PSYCHIC STORE - READING ROOM - CONT. 

           Kimball leads Ola to a sitting area with a small circular 
           table surrounded by floor pillows. 

           Ola points to an iPad. 

                                 OLA
                        May I? I’ve been debating what to 
                        play all week. 

           Ola scrolls through Spotify, finally selecting a track. 

           Etta James’ “At Last” starts to play. Ola looks satisfied. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Not that one. Sorry.

           Kimball reaches across and stops it.

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You can pick any song... just not 
                        that one. 

           Ola eyes her as she looks for another song. 
                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Anything else that will help open 
                        your mind. Something that will drop 
                        your walls. 

           Ola scrolls. Taps. Tap-tap. 

           John Legend’s “Stay With You” plays from the speakers. 

           Kimball smirks, too obvious. 

           She motions for Ola’s hands, they go palm to palm. 

           The music fills the room with sultry tones. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        When were you going to tell me, 
                        Ola?

                                 OLA
                        Tell you what?

           Ola giggles, she’s not a good liar.

           Kimball closes her eyes again. Grips Ola’s hands. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Your chakra is firing like a 
                        burning furnace. I can feel your 
                        heart filling up...
                             (opens her eyes)
                        Where did you meet him?

                                 OLA
                        At work. He’s a client. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Don’t lie to me. 

                                 OLA
                        Tinder.  

           Kimball nods. Takes a deep breath. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        He’s kind. Mature. But what is this 
                        that I’m sensing... 

           Ola leans in, what could it be? 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Complications. 
                                 OLA
                        What complications? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        From the past. Do you know what I’m 
                        speaking of? 

                                 OLA
                             (sighs)
                        Yes. I think I do. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Say it out loud. 

                                 OLA
                        He’s got kids. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Ola, listen carefully because what 
                        I’m about to say to you is very 
                        important. And I feel that more 
                        than one spirit here that wants to 
                        convey this to you.

           Ola looks around at the room, bewildered, excited... 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Care for those who need you and 
                        love unconditionally. With the 
                        proper care and guidance, I feel 
                        this could turn into love for you. 
                        A love that will last. 

           Ola wipes a tear from her eyes. Squeezes Kimball’s hands. 

                                 OLA
                        Thank you. 

           Ola gets out some cash and puts it on the table. 

                                 OLA (CONT'D)
                        So, I should say yes? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        To what?

                                 OLA
                        His proposal. 

           Hold up.

                                 KIMBALL
                        He proposed? Already? 
                                 OLA
                        It’s great timing too. I can retire 
                        with full pension in 6 months. 
                        We’re going on an extended 
                        honeymoon in 9 different countries--

           Kimball quickly grabs Ola’s hands again. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Ola, this is what the Universe 
                        desires for you. Tell him you won’t 
                        consider marriage for two years--

                                 OLA
                        Two years...?

                                 KIMBALL
                        And make sure your retirement is in 
                        the pre-nup. 

                                 OLA
                        You sense that for me? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I do. 

           Ola’s a little confused, but she nods anyway. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        I’m very excited for you, Ola. This 
                        is the start of something 
                        wonderful. I can feel that. And I 
                        think you can too. 

                                 OLA
                        I can. Thank you, Kimball. 

           INT. PSYCHIC STORE - RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Kimball sits at the reception desk, scrolls through Facebook 
           on her phone, she stops and clicks a video from JUST NOW. 

           A COURTROOM shows the trial of a man in an orange jumpsuit 
           and handcuffs. We’ll come to know him as LENNY HAYES. 

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Months ago, after the defense 
                        council moved to plead insanity for 
                        Leonard Hayes... Lenny, spoke the 
                        magic words... 

           Lenny leans into the mic. Smiles, savoring his words...
                                 LENNY
                        Guilty. 

           The courtroom erupts. 

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        The decision to serve the death 
                        penalty is now with the Governor, 
                        who seeks a consensus in 
                        psychiatric evaluations whether 
                        Lenny Hayes was sane during his 
                        gruesome murders...  

           Kimball shakes her head. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        That’s bullshit. 

           The reporter wraps things up as footage of Lenny loops. 

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...and unless all of the doctors 
                        agree on insanity, we could see the 
                        first sanctioned execution in 
                        Pennsylvania in over a decade... 

           GRAINY VIDEO of Lenny sitting in the courtroom, smiling. 
           Whispering to himself. 

           Nodding. 

           Chuckling... 

           RING! 

           Kimball jumps as the door opens. 

           A man in a suit cautiously steps in. Loose tie, friendly 
           smile. This is JUDD RYAN (40). 

                                 JUDD
                        Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you. 
                        Do you take walk ins?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Of course. Come on in.

           Judd notices the video looping on her phone. She locks the 
           screen and gestures to the back room. 

                                 KIMBALL  (CONT'D)
                        Right this way. 
           INT. PSYCHIC STORE - READING ROOM - CONT.

           Judd sits down at the table. Kimball hands him the tablet. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Go ahead and pick a song, something 
                        that speaks to you and what your 
                        soul calls out to right now. 

           He looks through the list of song. Taps. 

           A 70’s disco ballad plays. Judd sets it down, satisfied. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Right... Okay. 

           She reaches for his hands. Looks him in the eyes. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You’ve had a hell of a week.

                                 JUDD
                        Yeah. I guess you could say that. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m sensing... something in your 
                        personal life. 

           Judd reluctantly nods along. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        No, something in your work life 
                        that’s affecting your personal 
                        life. Want to tell me what it is?

                                 JUDD
                        Why don’t you tell me, just go 
                        ahead and do your thing. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m not a fortune teller. I’m a 
                        psychic. Think of this like a 
                        spiritual conversation. 

                                 JUDD
                        Alright. Yeah, there’s a new person 
                        that’s making things... 
                        complicated. At work.  

           She waits for more. 
                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        ...well you see, she’s married too. 
                        Just makes me wonder if I’ve made a 
                        mistake but the uh... ‘chemistry’. 
                        It’s amazing. You know? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Right. The ‘chemistry’. 

                                 JUDD
                        Being with my wife for so long has 
                        made me wonder if this is what’s 
                        supposed to happen, or if I’m just 
                        acting out. Desperate for a change. 

           Kimball retracts her hands, crosses her arms. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Are you done? 

                                 JUDD
                        With what?

                                 KIMBALL
                        With this whole thing. 

                                 JUDD
                        Have I done something wrong? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Look. I take my job seriously, 
                        whether you put any stock into it 
                        or not. So don’t come in here with 
                        your bullshit and bait me into 
                        whatever game you’re trying to 
                        play. 

           Judd sits back, adequately chastised. Sets his jaw. 

                                 JUDD
                        Pretty ironic coming from you. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Excuse me? 

                                 JUDD
                        This isn’t a psychic reading. 

           He turns off the music. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        You’re just reading body language. 
                        And using the music to intuit what 
                        kind of fortune I want.
                                 KIMBALL
                        I told you it’s not fortune-- 

                                 JUDD
                        You want me to stop the bullshit? 
                        Let’s stop the bullshit then. 

           He reaches into his jacket pocket. Pulls out a stack of 
           twenty dollar bills and lays it on the table. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        You tell me as many things about me 
                        as you can. And for every one you 
                        get right, you get a twenty. 

           He pulls a bill off and puts it to the side. 

           There’s at least $200 there... 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Three strikes and I walk out free 
                        of charge. Deal?

           Kimball eyes him. He returns her gaze. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Deal. 
                             (then)
                        You’re from the East coast. 

                                 JUDD
                        You can hear that in my accent, 
                        that really shouldn’t count. 

           But he moves a twenty over anyway. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        This is first time you’ve worn a 
                        suit this week.

                                 JUDD
                        Strike one. 

           She thinks. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You’ve never been to a psychic 
                        before today. 

                                 JUDD
                        Strike two.

           Dammit. 
           She closes her eyes. 

           Takes a deep breath... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You have a sibling. A sister. 

           Judd opens his mouth to speak--

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Had... You had a sister. 

           She waits. 

           He moves a twenty over. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        She inspired you to take the job 
                        that you have now. 

           Another twenty. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        The person complicating your work 
                        is someone that knew your sister.

           Another. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        But you don’t work with that 
                        person... They are the job. 

           Another. 

           Getting faster.

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        And that’s the reason you’re here. 

           Another. 

           Faster. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You’re an attorney for the State. 

           Another. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You’re prosecuting her killer... 

           Another. 

           Kimball opens her eyes. 
                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        ...who’s name is Lenny Hayes. 

           Silence. 

           She waits. 

           Slowly, he picks up the last twenty... 

           Moves it over. 

           He slides over the stack. 

                                 JUDD
                        I believe this is yours. 

           INT. PSYCHIC STORE - RECEPTION - MINUTES LATER

           Judd puts his jacket back on as he walks to the door. 

                                 JUDD
                        So... How much of this is real? 

           He waves his finger around. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Be honest. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        None of it. 

                                 JUDD
                        So you getting right answers back 
                        to back was...

                                 KIMBALL
                        Luck. 

           Judd considers this. 

                                 JUDD
                        It’s definitely not your doctorate 
                        in counseling psychology? Or your 
                        minor in music therapy?

           He smiles as his info drop seems to have hit a nerve. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Tell me, Kimball Cavannagh, age 34. 
                        Why does a remedial psychologist 
                        work at a psychic store? 
                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s not any of your business. 

                                 JUDD
                        Just a question. 

           After a second, 

                                 KIMBALL
                        The people that come to psychics 
                        are the same people that need 
                        therapists, only they can’t afford 
                        it. 

                                 JUDD
                        And you think you’re helping them 
                        here? Really? I’ve seen your 
                        customers, Kimball. Horny 
                        housewives and people who pray to 
                        rocks. Come on. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        So you’re saying if they don’t look 
                        or act like what you deem as 
                        “normal” they don’t get help? What, 
                        they don’t deserve help? Or even 
                        just someone who will listen to 
                        them? Who are you to decide that?   

           There’s passion here. Something burns under the surface. 

                                 JUDD
                        You want to make a difference? 
                        Really, truly, help people?

           When she doesn’t answer, Judd steps closer to the reception 
           desk, leans on it. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        I’m recruiting for someone with 
                        your skillset, nothing permanent. 
                        Just a little contract work for the 
                        State Attorney. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Like, forensic psychiatry? 

                                 JUDD
                        Forensic psychiatry... adjacent. 
                        Anyway, it pays well--

                                 KIMBALL
                        I don’t need money. 
                                 JUDD
                        Then what do you want? A job in 
                        politics? A cushy position at the 
                        state hospital-- 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Listen. I’ve got somewhere I need 
                        to be, so. 

                                 JUDD
                        Well. In case you change your 
                        mind... 

           He removes his hand from the desk, leaves the card there.

           After he exits, Kimball picks it up. Blank, except for: 

                              Eastern State Mental Institute

                             606 Fairmount Ave, Pittsburgh, PA

           EXT. NELLIES HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kimball waits at the door. The porch light comes on. 

           An older woman, NELLIE, hesitantly opens the door, then opens 
           it all the way when she sees Kimball. 

                                 NELLIE
                        You missed your appointment. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I know. I’m sorry, I got caught up. 
                        Can I see her?

                                 NELLIE
                        She’s sleeping now. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I just want to see her. I won’t 
                        wake her. I promise. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Okay, but I can’t mark you present. 

           Nellie relents. Let’s her inside. 

                                 NELLIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t drag mud in or I’m going to 
                        make you mop it up. 

           Kimball laughs and gives her a hug. 
           INT. NELLIE’S HOUSE - RILEY’S ROOM - CONT. 

           RILEY (3), like sleeping angel is wrapped up in her blanket.

           Kimball and Nellie watch her from the doorway. 

                                 NELLIE
                        She’s looking more and more like 
                        her momma every day. 

           Kimball smiles at this. Leaves Nellie to gently creep in. 

           She gives Riley a kiss on the cheek, covers her a bit more 
           with the blanket. 

           Just as Kimball is about to close the door, we get a glimpse 
           at a photo on the nightstand: Kimball cradling an infant. 

           INT. NELLIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nellie and Kimball sit at her table, each with a cup of tea. 

                                 NELLIE
                        What about guardianship? Sometimes 
                        it’s an easier ask.

                                 KIMBALL
                        They won’t consider it, not with my 
                        history. Turns out a foster kid 
                        adopting a foster kid isn’t so 
                        easy. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Even with your family--

                                 KIMBALL
                        Nell, believe me. I’ve been through 
                        it. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Well, don’t give up. She asks about 
                        you every day. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I wish she wouldn’t. 

                                 NELLIE
                        She loves you. That’s what kids do. 

                                 FOSTER CHILD (O.S.)
                        Aunt Nellie?

           Just then, a FOSTER CHILD walks into Nellie’s arms. 
                                 NELLIE
                        Harry, what are you doing out of 
                        bed? 

           Nellie picks him up, even with her old age, she’s got 
           strength. 

                                 NELLIE (CONT'D)
                             (to Kimball)
                        Can you let yourself out?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Of course. 

                                 NELLIE
                        And I’ll mark you present for 
                        today. Just don’t tell anyone. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Thank you, Nellie. 

           She smiles and carries the child out. 

           INT. KIMBALL’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Kimball turns the faucet for more hot water before reaching 
           out of the tub for the wine bottle on the floor. 

           Her phone plays the song we heard earlier, “At Last”. 

           She pours the rest in her glass -- there wasn’t much left. 
           She downs the glass. 

           She reaches over and looks at the business card Judd left. 
           It’s sopping wet now. 

           She wipes a tear from her red face, flush from the heat or 
           the alcohol. Tosses the card away. 

           Takes a shaky breath. 

           Submerges herself under the water until the music softly 
           MUFFLES out.

           INT./EXT. KIMBALL’S CAR - MORNING

           The GPS blinks, “You have arrived”.

           Kimball looks out her window at the barbed wire fences of 
           Eastern State Mental Institute.

           You can see it in her face: This was a bad idea. 
           INT. CLEARANCE ROOM - DAY

           Kimball sits alone in a room with four chairs. Judd walks in 
           with a security officer.  

                                 JUDD
                        You came. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I figured an interview couldn’t 
                        hurt. 

           Kimball stands, Judd notices her outfit for the first time - 
           a v-neck blouse, tailored dress skirt. 

                                 JUDD
                        You don’t have another change of 
                        clothes by chance, do you?

                                 KIMBALL
                        No... Why?

                                 JUDD
                        It’s fine. Just... stay close. 

           INT. COMMON FLOOR - CONT. 

           The common area is full of people -- patients in baby blue 
           jumpsuits and workers in white scrubs. 

           In one corner, a woman pounds a wall with her fists while a 
           nurse tries to calm her down. 

           Another table hosts a mock-tea ceremony, the attendants are 
           all shirtless.  

           A SQUIRRELLY MAN comes stomping towards them, flapping his 
           arms with his hands in his pits. 

                                 SQUIRRELLY MAN
                        QUACK! QUACK!! QUACK QUACK!! 

           He takes one large side-step to Kimball and lifts up her 
           skirt revealing her underwear. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        HEY!

           A nurse runs over to scold him as he scuttles away. 

                                 JUDD
                        You okay? Did he touch you?
           Kimball watches him stomp across the room. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I recognize him. From the news. 

                                 JUDD
                        Yeah, Kevin Atwater. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 JUDD
                        What do you mean? He’s obviously a 
                        duck. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        No, what is he doing here? 
                        Shouldn’t he be locked up?

                                 JUDD
                        This is a facility for the sick. 
                        Not a prison. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        But he shot up a diner... He killed 
                        dozens of people! 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, everyone here has killed 
                        someone. 

           She looks around with fresh eyes. Women and men, all in 
           varying stages of sanity. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        That’s right. This room is full of 
                        rapists, molesters, and murderers.   

                                 KIMBALL
                        Then why are they here?

                                 JUDD
                        Because guilty or not, they were 
                        declared insane.  

                                 KIMBALL
                        That doesn’t seem right. 

                                 JUDD
                        No? So what if they don’t look like 
                        what you deem as “sick”. Who are 
                        you to decide if they deserve help 
                        or not? Do you get to decide that?
           He’s got her, she knows it. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Should they be in prison? Most of 
                        them, probably. But that’s not how 
                        the system works. This is what 
                        we’re fighting against, Kimball. 
                        This is why we’re here.
                             (then)
                        Come on. Let’s keep moving.

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONT. 

           Judd and Kimball follow behind the security guard, OMAR. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Where are we going?

                                 JUDD
                        Separate wing. That’s where the 
                        work is taking place. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Which is what exactly? 

                                 JUDD
                        Research. We’re using new tech that 
                        allows us to study someone’s 
                        psychology, specifically their 
                        memories. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        And why do that here?

                                 JUDD
                        For the obvious reasons. Prevention 
                        of future crimes, corroborate past 
                        ones, and in some cases even 
                        assisting a conviction.

                                 KIMBALL
                        How big is the team?

                                 JUDD
                        It was just me and one other, 
                        you’ll meet him in a bit. There was 
                        one more, but unfortunately he 
                        passed away a couple weeks ago. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m sorry. 
                                 JUDD
                        He was a good man. But the work has 
                        to continue. 

           INT. INTAKE ROOM - CONT. 

           ANTHONY (40s) stands when Kimball and Judd enter. He wipes 
           his hand on his pants and offers it to Kimball. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Sorry if it’s clammy. 

                                 JUDD
                        Anthony is our resident 
                        neurologist. He legitimizes our 
                        operation here. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Penn State?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yale, you? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Penn State. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Penn’s a good school. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s no Yale. 

           Anthony bashfully smiles, shrugs. 

                                 JUDD
                        Let’s get started, shall we?

           Judd motions for her to sit at the table, where a device has 
           been set up. It looks like a modern day polygraph. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Didn’t realize this interview would 
                        be through a polygraph.

                                 JUDD
                        This isn’t really a job interview, 
                        but probably the closest thing to 
                        it that we’ll have. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        And this isn’t a polygraph.

           Anthony hands her a headset, it’s plugged into the machine.
                                 KIMBALL
                        Then what is it? 

           Anthony looks to Judd to answer, who shrugs it off. 

                                 JUDD
                        All you need to know is that when 
                        we start this, one of two things 
                        are going to happen. Either you’re 
                        going to see some images in your 
                        mind... or you won’t. You just have 
                        to tell us if you do. Simple. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        So it’s a test? 

                                 JUDD
                             (thinks)
                        Sure. 

           As Kimball puts the headset on, she notices another identical 
           cord is plugged in to the machine, but it runs out of the 
           room under the door... 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        All good? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Yeah.  

           Anthony starts to turn it on. Kimball looks to Anthony.

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        It’s not going to hurt, is it?

                                 ANTHONY
                        It shouldn’t.

           Anthony turns a nob. The machine WHIRS as it gears up. 

           A dial needle goes up, Anthony notes it, looks over at Judd 
           and nods. 

                                 JUDD
                        Alright. Here we go. 

           Another switch, the dial turns. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        And three...

           A high pitch frequency SOUNDS, getting louder and louder... 
                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Two... 

           Kimball grips her chair.  

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        One. 

           He lowers a lever, and with a THUNK, we

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           After a few seconds, we 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           - Traffic sounds, tires screech. 

           - We RUSH through the city in HYPERSPEED. 

           - Snippets of conversations blaze past us and we settle on

           EXT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           POV FROM AFAR: a YOUNG WOMAN locks her door, she repositions 
           her camel-skin peacoat to ward off the cold winter air.  

           She walks down the sidewalk, messages on her phone. Still 
           hasn’t noticed we’re following right behind her. 

           We look down at our hands. Old work gloves, stained with 
           splotches of dark muddy brown. 

           We take out a carving knife. 

           The woman still hasn’t seen us. 

           We pick up the pace. 

           We need to time it right when she’s going past that staircase 
           leading to the basement apartment... 

           Almost there. 

           We hear our voice shout out to her. 

                                 MAN (REVERB)
                        Miss? 

           She turns, only sees our knife for a split second before it 
           enters her belly. 
           She’s at the bottom of the stairwell now. Blood pooling under 
           her exposed, bare torso. 

           We hurry and slip our gloves off. 

           We need bare hands for this. Spit.

           We grunt. Moan in pleasure... 

           A shuffling of clothes as we stand above her. 

                                 KIMBALL (REVERB)
                        No... NO. NO!! STOP!!! 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - CONT. 

           Kimball is having a complete panic attack. 

           Anthony quickly comes over, takes off the headset. 

           She’s freaking out. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What the hell just happened?? 

                                 JUDD
                        You saw something... Didn’t you?

           She doesn’t need to answer. Judd slams his fist on the table. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        YES. I knew it!!  

                                 KIMBALL
                        What did you just do to me??

           No one says anything. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Someone answer me!!! 

           She looks at Anthony. He gives in. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        IF and WHEN the machine works, it 
                        allows the someone to see into 
                        another person’s memories.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Another person? Who?
                                 ANTHONY
                        Whoever is hooked up to the other 
                        end--

                                 JUDD
                             (scolding)
                        Anthony.

           Kimball looks at the cords running under the door. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Now, sit back and we’ll try it 
                        again...

           Kimball jumps up, swipes Judd’s key card from his belt and 
           runs to the door.

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        HEY! 

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - CONT. 

           Kimball follows the cords on the ground, they lead down the 
           hall to a door to a separate wing.  

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, stop!!

           She starts to fast walk, trailing the cords... 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        You can’t go down there!

           She runs. 

           Follows the cords until they disappear under a door that 
           reads “Secure Treatment Wing”.

           She looks through the small window in the door just as Omar 
           is walking someone back to a cell... 

           The man briefly turns to flash a brilliant smile. We 
           recognize him from the news report yesterday:

           Lenny Hayes. 

           Judd has caught up, he pulls her away from the door. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Goddamn it. What are you doing??
                                 KIMBALL
                        Why didn’t you tell me I’d be going 
                        into Lenny Hayes memories??

                                 JUDD
                        You wouldn’t have come if I had. 

           He’s right. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        But now we know, you can do this. 
                        With the machine you can see into 
                        his memories. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        See into his memories? HIS 
                        memories? Why would anyone want to 
                        do that?? 

                                 JUDD
                        Because we need to know if he 
                        killed those women or not. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        He’s already plead guilty! 

                                 JUDD
                        It. Doesn’t. Matter. Even if he’s 
                        declared insane, a guilty plea 
                        won’t do much. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’ll go under oath, he’s insane. 
                        There. 

                                 JUDD
                        If you do that then he ends up 
                        right out there playing Duck, Duck 
                        Goose with Kevin Atwater. You want 
                        that to happen? You know how many 
                        of those people end up back out in 
                        the streets? 51%. More than half. 
                        And the average time a patient is 
                        here? 8 years. 8 years and Lenny 
                        Hayes is out there killing more 
                        women. Is that what you want?? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I think I’m going to throw up. 

           Kimball paces. Runs her hands through her hair. 
                                 JUDD
                        Kimball. The machine worked for 
                        you. You’re in the unique position 
                        where you can not only testify to 
                        his sanity but you can also help us 
                        figure out how he’s doing it. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What do you mean doing it? 

                                 JUDD
                        All of his murders the last decade 
                        happened while he was in a holding 
                        cell in county for petty crimes. 
                        Grand theft auto, armed robbery, 
                        the list goes on. Pittsburgh Jail 
                        is his alibi.  

                                 KIMBALL
                        That’s impossible. 

                                 JUDD
                        And now there’s been 3 murders in 
                        the last two weeks alone. All of 
                        the bodies have the exact same 
                        identifiers that Lenny Hayes is 
                        locked in that cell for right now. 
                        So if he’s not our guy, I have to 
                        know. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Then go in there and put that thing 
                        on yourself and take a look! 

                                 JUDD
                        I can’t. It doesn’t work for me, it 
                        doesn’t work for Anthony. But it 
                        works for you. Please.  

           Kimball crosses her arms. Uncrosses them. Like she can’t find 
           a comfortable way to stand. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        He did it. That’s what I saw.

                                 JUDD
                        Okay. What exactly did you see? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        A woman, mid 30’s. He dragged her 
                        down some stairs. And... he was 
                        jacking off on top of her. 

           He’s silent.  
                                 JUDD
                        What was she wearing? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        A peacoat. 

                                 JUDD
                        Camel skin. 

           It clicks. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You knew her. 

                                 JUDD
                        Yes. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Your sister. 

           The gravity of this hits. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        I’m so sorry. 

                                 JUDD
                        Well. Now you know. And now we know 
                        the machine works for you. If we 
                        can get enough information we can--

                                 KIMBALL
                        No. I’m sorry. But I’m not going 
                        back in there. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, women will continue to die 
                        unless we help them! 

           Anthony walks up from behind them. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m sorry. But I can’t. 

           She walks away. Anthony waits for Judd to give him the ‘go 
           ahead’. Judd nods, Anthony follows her out.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONT. 

           Anthony and Kimball get in, Anthony BEEPS his security card 
           and pushes the button for the ground floor. 

           They stand in silence. 
           BUZZZZZZ. 

           Kimball jumps, Anthony pulls out his phone. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Sorry... 

           He answers it. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Laura? 

                                 PHONE (O.S.)
                        Daddy?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Megan, hi sweetie. Can I call you 
                        back? 

                                 PHONE (O.S.)
                        I made something for you! 

                                 ANTHONY
                        That’s great, honey. I’ll be home 
                        soon and I’m going to come see it, 
                        okay? Okay. Bye. Love you. 

           He hangs it up. 

           The door opens, Anthony holds it for Kimball to step out. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Doing a job like this, with a 
                        killer like Lenny Hayes... Don’t 
                        you think about your family?

           He looks at her straight in the eyes. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeah. I do. Every day.
                             (beat)
                        Thanks for coming in, Kimball. 

           The elevator doors close. 

           INT. NELLIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kimball walks in and closes the door. A social worker, SARAH 
           CARVER stands from a chair and shakes Kimball’s hand. 

                                 SARAH
                        Nice to see you again, Ms. 
                        Cavannagh. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        You too, I didn’t realize this was 
                        going to be a supervised visit. 

                                 SARAH
                        That’s the point. Also, I’ve been 
                        looking through your attendance--

                                 RILEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy!!

           Riley runs from around the corner and hugs Kimball. Sarah 
           waits for Kimball’s response. Kimball bends down to Riley. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Hey cutie bug, whatcha doing?

                                 RILEY
                        Coloring. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        That’s good. I want to see what 
                        you’re coloring... But ummm... 

           Kimball looks up at Sarah, who’s still watching... 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Listen, remember how I told you 
                        that you can’t call me mommy?

           Riley thinks about this. 

                                 RILEY
                        No. 

           Kids... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Well, I did. So you gotta try 
                        harder to call me by my name, okay? 

           Riley nods. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You remember what that is? 

           Riley shakes her head. 

           Sarah jots down a note. This is not going well...

                                 NELLIE (O.S.)
                        Dinner, everyone! 

           Nellie walks in from the kitchen. Sees Kimball. 
                                 NELLIE (CONT'D)
                        Kimball, have you had supper? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Not yet. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Come grab a plate then. 

           Kimball ushers Riley forward. 

           Sarah waits for Nellie to invite her as well. 

                                 NELLIE (CONT'D)
                        Ms. Carver. I’ve prepared a chair 
                        for you to observe from. 

           Nellie turns on a heel back into the kitchen. Sarah forces a 
           smile and gestures for Kimball to go first. 

                                 SARAH
                        After you. 

           EXT. NELLIE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Sarah walks from the porch, Kimball comes out as well. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Ms. Carver? 

           Sarah turns, but doesn’t slow down. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to say thank you, for 
                        coming by and I appreciate all that 
                        you’re doing. 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s my job. Happy to do it. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I was also wondering if you had any 
                        updates on where things are in the 
                        adoption process. 

                                 SARAH
                        Unfortunately, I don’t. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s just, it’s been 3 years. 

           Sarah finally stops walking. 
                                 SARAH
                        And?

                                 KIMBALL
                        And I was just hoping to have her 
                        by her birthday--

                                 SARAH
                        Ms. Cavannagh. It’s my job to make 
                        sure every child is placed in the 
                        right home, a good home. Surely, 
                        you out of all people know the 
                        value of that. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I do, which is--

                                 SARAH
                        Which is why I’m not rushing to 
                        take Riley from Nellie regardless 
                        of your connection with her. 

           Supremely chastised, Kimball just nods in agreement. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        If you’re so desperate to adopt a 
                        child, there are other options. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        There are no other options for me. 

                                 SARAH
                        Then I recommend you be patient. 

           Sarah leaves Kimball at the sidewalk.

           INT. CLEARANCE ROOM - MORNING

           Kimball stands as soon as Judd opens the door. 

                                 JUDD
                        You changed your mind? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        No. But I figured out what I want 
                        in return. 

           Kimball takes a deep breath, looks at her hands. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        I’m in the process of adopting a 3 
                        year old girl, fulfilling a promise 
                        to... well, to fulfill a promise. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        But there are things in my past 
                        that have prevented me from doing 
                        that and could potentially 
                        disqualify me from ever doing that. 
                        So, if there’s anyway--

                                 JUDD
                        Done. 

           She looks up. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Once we accomplish what we’ve set 
                        out to do, the Attorney General 
                        should have no qualms about pushing 
                        that through. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Okay... Thank you. 

                                 JUDD
                        Thank me after. Let’s get to work. 

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - CONT. 

           Omar leads them to the Secure Treatment Wing door and opens 
           it. Dozens of high security, barred cells on both sides.

           It’s a long, long hallway...

                                 KIMBALL
                        I thought you said they don’t lock 
                        people up here... 

                                 JUDD
                        Obviously, some patients are a 
                        little more... high risk. 

           On the far end, a table has been set up for them.

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Relax. We won’t be in the same room 
                        as him. He’ll remain in his cell.

           She still doesn’t move. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        And what happens if you turn it on 
                        and it doesn’t work this time? 
                                 JUDD
                        We start looking for someone else. 
                        And you go back to reading tarot 
                        cards. 

           She flips him off. 

           Along the wall, cockroaches scuttle out of sight. 

           Kimball and Judd are halfway to the other end when they start 
           to hear something. 

           Someone’s whistling a song... 

           Omar raps on Lenny’s cell.

                                 GUARD
                        Hands out, Lenny. You know the 
                        drill.

           Two hands appear, Omar cuffs them to the bars. 

           Kimball and Judd step around to face him, and here we get our 
           first good look at Lenny Hayes in the flesh. 

           Deep socketed eyes. Buzzed hair. His frame suggests an 
           athletic build but clearly his diet hasn’t supported it for 
           years. 

           He licks his lips as Kimball comes into view.  

                                 LENNY
                        Time for my last meal already? 

           If Kimball is unnerved, she doesn’t show it. 

           Anthony comes jogging down the hall with the machine cradled 
           in his arms, he sets the machine down on the table.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Sorry I’m late. 

                                 LENNY
                        God, what is that smell?

           Lenny pretends like he’s seeing Anthony for the first time. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Ah. Leave it to the spics to stink 
                        of mildew in the dead of winter. 

           Anthony flushes red. Kimball sniffs. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        I smell it too.

           She takes a step closer to Lenny and takes a whiff. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        But it smells like... loneliness 
                        and dried semen to me. 

           Anthony cracks a smile. But Lenny grins ear to ear. 

                                 LENNY
                        Oh, you know as well as I do that I 
                        only do that on special occasions. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Is that a confession?

           He licks his palms and holds them up in surrender. 

                                 LENNY
                        Guilty. 

                                 JUDD
                        Enough. Let’s get started. 

           Judd moves a seat out for her. 

                                 LENNY
                        So Jed, what’s on the docket for 
                        today? 

                                 JUDD
                        That’s not my name.  

                                 LENNY
                        I know, but I like “Jed” better. 
                        Reminds me of a girl I once fucked. 

           Lenny catches Judd’s eye, pleased with how tense Judd 
           suddenly is. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Kind of looked like you too. 

           Judd’s jaw tightens, he walks to Lenny who smooches his lips.

                                 JUDD
                             (to Omar)
                        Strap him in.  

                                 LENNY
                        Mmmm. 
           Omar enters Lenny’s cell, brings in a similar chair to the 
           one Kimball sits in. Handcuffs dangle from each arm.

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Oh, daddy... 

           He winks at Kimball. She looks away. 

           Omar exits the cell. He uncuffs Lenny from the bars. 

                                 OMAR
                        In the chair. 

           Lenny slumps into the chair. Cuffs himself. 

                                 OMAR (CONT'D)
                        Tighter. 

           Caught -- Lenny grins. CLICK-CLICK. They’re tight now. 

           A cockroach scurries over to where Lenny sits, he STOMPS it. 
           Smears it across the concrete floor. 

           Anthony finishes setting up the machine. He plugs two 
           identical headbands in. Leaves one on the table next to 
           Kimball, feeds the other through the bars. 

                                 OMAR (CONT'D)
                        He’s good. 

           Anthony goes in, he’s shaking as he puts the headband on 
           Lenny’s head. Lenny’s very calm... 

           Suddenly, Lenny BARKS and BITES at Anthony who jumps out of 
           his skin. 

           Lenny ROARS with laughter. 

                                 LENNY
                        Oh, grow a pair. Jesus.

           Anthony finishes and hurries out. Goes to Kimball next. 

           He lines the headset up so two nodes are directly over her 
           temples. He then reaches for some arm straps. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        I’m going to strap your wrists 
                        down, just a precaution in case 
                        you... well, just in case. 

           Her leg is shaking like crazy. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s probably too late to go to the 
                        bathroom, right?

           Meanwhile, Lenny is all set up directly across from her -- 
           cool as a cucumber. Whistling the same song again. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You a fan of “It’s a Wonderful 
                        Life”?

                                 LENNY
                        What? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        “Buffalo Gals”, the song you’re 
                        whistling. It’s from the movie 
                        “It’s a Wonderful Life”. 

                                 LENNY
                        Never seen it.  

           Omar exits the cell, closing the door with a SLAM. 

           Anthony flicks a couple of switches. Watches the dial go up. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        NMDA level’s at 540. We’re good. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, you ready? 

           She nods, or at least tries to. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Kimball?

                                 KIMBALL
                        I- I’m ready. 

           Anthony turns a nob. The machine WHIRS as it gears up. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Alright. Here we go. And three...

           Another switch. A high pitch frequency SOUNDS, getting louder 
           and louder... 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Two... 

           Lenny smiles at her from across the bars. 

           Kimball’s hyperventilating. 
                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        One. 

           He lowers a lever, and with a THUNK, we

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           After a moment of complete silence, we hear a

           Ding!

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open. A young BRUNETTE smiles and steps 
           in. We hear our voice:

                                 LENNY 
                        What floor? 

                                 BRUNETTE
                        Three. Thanks. 

           We shuffle the box in our hands to reach over and push the 
           button. No others are lit. 

           It’s silent as we admire her heels. Tight jeans...

           The elevator door opens. 

                                 LENNY
                        After you. 

           She goes right. We follow. 

           She stops at a door, fumbles with her keys. Is she stalling? 

           We check the slip on our box. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Apartment 304... Let’s see... 

           We move past her. 

           Her door unlocks. She steps in. 

           Immediately we’ve turned around. 

           Lunging for the shutting door...

           Just as it’s about to close, success. Our knife blocks it 
           from closing. 

           We GRUNT as we put our shoulder into the door. 
           It flies open, the brunette falls backwards from the force.

           She SHRIEKS. 

           No matter... She’ll be quiet soon. 

           We chase the screaming brunette around her apartment. 

           One slash on her outstretched hand. 

           The brunette shuts the door to her bedroom. 

           We try the handle. Locked. 

           We kick it. 

           Again. 

           Finally, one more kick and it opens. 

           Our shadow casts into the room between two twin beds. 

           Totally different from the one the brunette just went into.

           We’re now in:

           INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           A makeshift tent is set up in between a couple of twin beds. 
           The GLOW from a nightlight casts the shadow of two GIRLS. 

           They whisper and GIGGLE together under the bedsheet canopy. 

           A door SLAMS in the distance. 

                                 KIMBALL (AGE 9) 
                             (whispers)
                        Dad’s home! 

           They both scramble out of the tent and get into bed. 

                                 CARTER (AGE 9)
                        The light!

           CARTER gets out, flicks off the light just as the door opens. 

           Kimball and Carter’s father SAM stands in the doorway, his 
           silhouette separating the two seemingly slumbering girls... 

                                 SAM
                        Girls? 

           No one moves. 
           He walks over to Kimball. He leans over, her eyes are shut. 

           But the moment he goes to Carter, Kimball’s eyes shoot open. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Carter? 

           Kimball’s frozen as she waits for him to leave. 

           It’s quiet. 

           She finally looks over at Carter’s bed.

           It’s empty. 

                                 KIMBALL (AGE 9)
                        Carter...? Carter?? 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - CONT. 

           Kimball’s back. Drenched in sweat. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m fine.

           Judd helps Anthony take the straps off. 

           She’s shaking. She steadies her hands before anyone sees it. 

           Except for Lenny. 

           INT. JUDD’S OFFICE - DAY

           A voice recorder is on the desk. Anthony sits in a corner 
           chair and Judd paces in front of Kimball, who holds a cup of 
           coffee in her hands. 

                                 JUDD
                        Go through it again. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Brunette. Early, maybe mid 20’s. 
                        She lived in an apartment building 
                        on the third floor--
                                 JUDD
                        What about the box Lenny was 
                        carrying? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I don’t know. It was just a regular 
                        cardboard box. 

                                 JUDD
                        Any labels? Decals? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 JUDD
                        Well, what was he wearing? Any sort 
                        of uniform?

                                 KIMBALL
                        I don’t remember. 

                                 JUDD
                        Then how do you know it was him? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        His voice was the same when he 
                        asked her what floor on the 
                        elevator. 

                                 JUDD
                        His voice was the same.

           Judd rubs his forehead. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        You got to do better than this. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 JUDD
                        Without specifics all of this is 
                        worthless. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’ll do better next time. 

           Anthony looks through his data sheets. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        What about after he followed her 
                        inside her apartment? 
                                 KIMBALL
                        What do you mean?

                                 ANTHONY
                        The NMDA levels spiked near the 
                        end, like he tapped into a deeper 
                        memory.  

           Judd waits for her reply. She scrambles for an answer.

                                 KIMBALL
                        No. Nothing. That’s where it ended. 

           Anthony looks though his data again. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Really? That’s strange... 

           Judd looks at his watch. 

                                 JUDD
                        I have an appointment to update the 
                        Governor. Which seems like a waste 
                        of time today, if I’m honest... 

           He grabs his coat and hurriedly throws it on.

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        I’ll talk to you guys tomorrow. 

           He leaves. After a moment of silence,

                                 KIMBALL
                        What’s NMDA mean? 

                                 ANTHONY
                        The machine records synaptic 
                        connections during memory 
                        retrieval, specifically in the N-
                        menthyl D-aspartate or “NMDA” 
                        receptors. An open receptor appears 
                        as a 0 and a closed one as a 1, 
                        then it gives us a numeric score 
                        where the higher number equal the 
                        more closed receptors.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Right...

                                 ANTHONY
                        Think of it like a flood gate. The 
                        more receptors are closed, the 
                        bigger the number and the higher 
                        the wall. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Which is a problem for the water...
                             (points at Kimball)
                        ...trying to get through. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        How high is too high? 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Anything over 600 would make his 
                        memories difficult to access. Over 
                        1000, impossible. And possibly 
                        dangerous. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Good to know. I’m going to take off-

           She stands to get her coat. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Today it spiked to 900. 

           Beat. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Thought maybe you dug up something 
                        that might be worth mentioning. A 
                        traumatic memory of some kind. 

           She turns to face him. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I saw him murder a woman in her own 
                        apartment. So yeah, it was pretty 
                        traumatic. 

           She puts on her coat. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        See you tomorrow. 

           INT. KIMBALL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A bedsheet tent is mid-progress. Kimball stumbles into the 
           room, uncorks a bottle of wine. 

           It becomes pretty clear, Riley isn’t here. She’s alone... 

           She collapses into the tent. 

           Unlocks her phone. 

           Spotify. 
           She plays, “At Last” by Etta James. 

           She lets it play for 10 seconds but suddenly can’t take it. 
           She turns it off. 

           She wipes her eyes and opens up her phone again. 

           A tear falls down her cheek but she quickly wipes it away. 

           She goes back to her phone, plays “At Last”. 

           She turns off the lights. Turns over to go to sleep.

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - CONT. 

           Judd walks in with Kimball, Anthony is already at the table 
           setting up. 

           In the cell, Lenny is on the ground, finger-painting with 
           toothpaste. He glances up as Kimball takes a seat. 

                                 LENNY
                        Hiiiii. Does this look like a lion?

           It doesn’t. 

           Kimball ignores him. 

                                 JUDD
                        Omar, could you get him ready 
                        please?

           Anthony and Judd starts to strap Kimball in. Omar raps on the 
           cell bars. 

                                 GUARD
                        Hands out. Let’s go. 

           Lenny leaps to his feet, smiling ear to ear. Just as Omar is 
           about to grab his wrist, Lenny pulls it back. 

                                 LENNY
                        Oops. 

           He puts it back out. Pulls it again as Omar reaches for it. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Oops. Oops! Gotta be faster! 

           Lenny sticks both arms out a different parts this time like 
           wack-a-mole. 

           Omar seizes his arm, forces the cuffs on him. 
                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Ouch! That hurt... 

           Then Lenny starts to cry. Actual tears. 

           Kimball sees this, somehow this seems sincere... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You okay? 

           He avoids looking at her, quietly sobs to himself. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        No earworm today?

           He peeks one eye over at her. 

                                 LENNY
                        What’s a ear worm? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        An earworm is something that gets 
                        stuck in your head. Like that song 
                        you were whistling last time. 

                                 LENNY
                        Oh, I can’t whistle. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Yes, you can. I heard you 
                        yesterday. 

                                 LENNY
                        No, I can’t. You must be thinking 
                        of my brother. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Your brother? Who’s your brother? 

                                 LENNY
                        Lenny Hayes. 

           She looks over at Judd, he shrugs. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You’re right. I was thinking of 
                        him. So what’s your name? 

           He wipes his nose on his sleeve. Snorts. 

                                 LENNY
                        Howie Hayes. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        Nice to meet you, Howie. 

           Omar uncuffs Lenny from the bars. 

                                 GUARD
                        Alright, go to the chair and put 
                        those on. 

           Lenny obeys like an obedient little puppy, he tightens the 
           cuffs all the way, unlike the other day. 

           Omar lets Anthony in to put the head band on him. 

                                 LENNY
                        Oh no! I don’t like that! I don’t 
                        want that!! 

           He starts to struggle as Anthony tries to put it on his head. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hold... Still!!

                                 LENNY
                        I don’t like it!!! No!! 

           Omar steps in to hold him down, but Lenny only squirms more. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Howie, it’s okay. Look! It’s on me 
                        too! 

           Lenny’s not listening. Twisting. Writhing. Screaming. 

           Kimball watches as he starts slamming his fists on the chair, 
           the cuffs start to cut into his wrists. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                             (singing)
                        Buffalo gals, won’t you come out 
                        tonight? Come out tonight, come out 
                        tonight... 

           Lenny suddenly looks over. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Buffalo gals, won’t you come out 
                        tonight? 

           Lenny smiles, tears still streaming down his face. He starts 
           to sing with her. 
                                                         KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                           LENNY
           And dance by the light of the 
           moon...
                                              And dance by the light of the 
                                              moon...

           Anthony carefully slips the head band on his head. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        That’s from my favorite movie!  

                                 KIMBALL
                        I thought you’ve never seen it? 

                                 LENNY
                        Noooo! I watch it every day! “I 
                        wish I had a million dollars. Hot 
                        dog!!”

           Anthony mans his post at the machine. The NMDA dial is 
           steadily dropping... 

                                 ANTHONY
                        NMDA at 620... 580... 

           Judd leans over to Kimball, whispers. 

                                 JUDD
                        Keep him distracted.

           She turns back to Lenny, talking to him like he’s a child. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Hey Howie, let’s play a game. I’m 
                        going to sing the song and you 
                        close your eyes and try and imagine 
                        the movie in your head. Okay? 

           Lenny beams. Shuts his eyes with all his strength. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                             (sings)
                        Buffalo gals, won’t you come out 
                        tonight...

                                 ANTHONY
                             (hushed)
                        Three... 

           Anthony flips on the switch. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Two...

           Turns a knob. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        Come out tonight... 

                                 ANTHONY
                        One...

           Throws the lever. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Come out tonight... 

           Kimball closes her eyes and we 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. GRANVILLE ADOPTION AGENCY - DAY

           SERIES OF FRANTIC SHOTS

           - We PUSH through the steel gates of a stone cast building. 
           It towers over a sun-scorched lawn and a broken sidewalk. 

           - A long corridor. Children run from one room to another. 
           Tagging each other and giggling. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - CONT. 

           A small boy (9) draws in a notebook. He suddenly perks up.  

                                 LENNY (AGE 9)
                        Can I go play with the mouse?

           A WOMAN reads a book in the corner. She waves for him to go. 

           Lenny runs out of the room. 

           EXT. COURTYARD - CONT.

           In the middle of the corridors is a courtyard, a small boy 
           (identical to Lenny) plays in the dirt. Lenny runs over to 
           him. 

                                 LENNY (AGE 9)
                        Let me hold him.  

           Howie looks up at his brother. Holds his hands out. 

                                 HOWIE (AGE 9)
                        Careful... 
           In his hands, a MOUSE squirms and fights for freedom. It 
           almost gets out of their hands. 

                                 HOWIE (AGE 9) (CONT'D)
                        You’ll lose him! 

                                 LENNY (AGE 9)
                        No, I won’t. 

           Lenny grips Howie’s hands together. Squeezing the mouse in 
           their hands... 

                                 HOWIE (AGE 9)
                        Stop!! 

           Lenny grits his teeth. Doubles down... 

           A SQUEAL EEKS from the mouse and-- 

           CRUNCH. 

           Watery, pink ooze drips from their hands. 

           Lenny’s eyes glimmer with excitement. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE (O.S.)
                        BOYS!! 

           MS. CONSTANCE, a stern looking woman (40s) storms into the 
           courtyard. She marches right up to them.  

           Lenny sticks his hands in his pockets, Howie for obvious 
           reasons, isn’t able to. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE (CONT'D)
                        Open your hands. NOW.

           A bloody, clump falls from Howie’s hands. 

           She grabs both of them by their hair and YANKS them, drags 
           them to the building. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE  (CONT'D)
                        Both of you are going to the boiler 
                        room! For the rest of the week!!

           They’re dragged away. 

           The mouse twitches on the ground. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - MORNING

           Kimball comes back with a GASP. 

           Judd unstraps her, takes the headband off. 

                                 JUDD
                        We’ll finish up. Wait for us 
                        outside. 

           Kimball starts to walk away. 

                                 LENNY (O.S.)
                        Wait! 

           Lenny is crouched over something on the ground. He walks to 
           the bars with his fingers delicately covering something. 

                                 LENNY  (CONT'D)
                        Will you take him with you? He 
                        wants to be outside. 

           Kimball walks closer to see what he’s holding... 

           It’s a cockroach. 

           She reaches to take it from him. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, no!

           Lenny gently passes it over to her. 

                                 LENNY
                        I didn’t mean to hurt the little 
                        mousey. 

           His eyes water with tears. Then he walks back to his cot. 

                                 KIMBALL
                             (sotto)
                        I know. I know you didn’t. 

           EXT. EASTERN STATE MENTAL INSTITUTE - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Kimball paces as Judd leans against his car, Anthony has a 
           voice recorder out. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        ...this could be his way of dealing 
                        with trauma from when he was a kid. 
                        Abandonment by his parents, abuse, 
                        neglect, whatever. 
                                 ANTHONY
                        That could also be why he 
                        repressing those memories. You 
                        should’ve seen the synapses light 
                        up as soon as you started singing 
                        that song. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Well, music has been found to 
                        stimulate neurogenesis in the-- 

                                 ANTHONY
                        --hippocampus, where memories the 
                        are stored. Exactly. He’s buried 
                        something in there. 

           Anthony and Kimball are on the same wavelength. Judd shrugs. 

                                 JUDD
                        I don’t know. Isn’t it possible 
                        he’s created Howie? Like multiple 
                        personalities?

                                 KIMBALL
                             (corrects him)
                        Dissociative personality. It is 
                        possible, people do tend to 
                        fabricate memories, or alter them 
                        to fit their own narrative in order 
                        to hide wounds, suppress guilt... 

                                 ANTHONY
                        You think he’s faking it to get 
                        insanity? 

                                 JUDD
                        Absolutely. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Maybe. But I saw two boys. Even if 
                        the act is fake, my gut tells me 
                        the memory was real.
                             (then)
                        What do we know about his 
                        upbringing?

                                 JUDD
                        He was put in an adoption agency 
                        after his father killed his mother 
                        and then shot himself... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        God... 
                                 JUDD
                        Then chucked into the foster 
                        program at 9, where his foster 
                        mother stabbed his foster father 
                        and then killed herself. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Another murder suicide?

           He nods, continues. 

                                 JUDD
                        Followed by years of home after 
                        home. Arrested at age 15 for arson, 
                        16 for armed theft... two decades 
                        more of this and that. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        And his brother Howie?

                                 JUDD
                        Before today, we didn’t even know 
                        he had a brother. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        There’s more here. I know there is. 

                                 JUDD
                        I can go poke around. Visit the 
                        adoption agency. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Could I go with you?

                                 JUDD
                        I don’t know... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Judd. I need to go. 

           Judd thinks about this. 

                                 JUDD
                        It can’t be an official inquiry. No 
                        flashing badges, none of that. We 
                        can’t push for any information they 
                        don’t volunteer. Got it?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Understood. 
                                 ANTHONY
                        Is it alright if I sit this one 
                        out? Lauren would kill me if I make 
                        it home late again. 

                                 JUDD
                        Of course. Tell her I said hi. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        I will. 
                             (to Kimball)
                        Good work today. The singing and 
                        all that... brilliant. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Thanks, Anthony. 

           Anthony walks off, Kimball waits for Judd.  

           He sighs. 

                                 JUDD
                        Alright. I’ll drive. 

           EXT. GRANVILLE ADOPTION AGENCY - EVENING

           Black steel gates. 

           Neglected lawn. 

           We’ve seen this place before. 

           INT. GRANVILLE ADOPTION AGENCY - HALLWAY - CONT. 

           It’s just as we saw in Lenny’s memory before: four hallways 
           form a square around a central courtyard. 

                                 JUDD
                        I think the office is this way. 

           Kimball nods, but her eyes are fixed in the middle, as if 
           expecting to see two boys strangling a mouse in the dirt.

                                 WHISPER (O.S.)
                        Over here...

           She turns toward the voice... But there’s no one there. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Did you say something? 
                                 JUDD
                        Huh? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I just heard someone say--

           A group of kids run out of a doorway, down the hall. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Nothing. Sorry. 

           They keep walking. 

                                 WHISPER (O.S.)
                        Turn right... 

           She stops, grabs Judd’s arm to stop him as well. 

                                 JUDD
                        What is it?

           She puts her finger to her lips. 

           To their right, a door. She tries the door knob. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Locked?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Yeah. 

           She starts to walk away, then the door creaks open. 

                                 JUDD
                        I thought it was locked?

           She turns the doorknob. It’s firm. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It is. 

           She pushes it more, someone’s taped the doorframe so it won’t 
           close all the way. 

           The door opens, reveals staircase leading down. 

           Kimball starts to walk down. Judd reluctantly follows her. 

           INT. GRANVILLE ADOPTION AGENCY - BASEMENT - CONT. 

           Kimball and Judd creep down the stairs to the dimly lit 
           basement. 
                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, what are we doing... 

                                 WHISPER (O.S.)
                        Go straight...

           There’s a long hallway in front of them.

           They move forward. A couple small mice hug the hallway as 
           they run away from them. 

           At the end of the hallway, there’s a single blue door. 

                                 WHISPER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Open it...

           A RUMBLE comes from behind it... 

                                 WHISPER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Hurry!!

           Kimball picks up the pace. 

           Reaches for the door. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?!

           Behind them, a stern woman charges at them, MS. CONSTANCE. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE (CONT'D)
                        What in the world do you think 
                        you’re doing? 

           The closer she comes, we can see she’s the same woman from 
           Lenny’s memory, 20 or so years older. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m sorry, we were just looking for 
                        the administration office. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        And you thought that it would be in 
                        the basement? 

           Fair point. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        We got lost. 

           A bad lie. 

           Judd sighs, reaches into his jacket, pulls out his badge. 
                                 JUDD
                        I work for the District Attorney, 
                        just needed to talk to whoever is 
                        in charge. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        That would be me. Do you have a 
                        warrant? 

                                 JUDD
                        No ma’am. This isn’t an 
                        investigation, nor do we plan on 
                        seizing any property. We just 
                        wanted to ask some questions about 
                        Lenny Hayes.  

           Her lips purse. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Well, I’m happy to talk to you but 
                        I’d rather do it in my office. 

           She motions toward the exits with her arm and they walk past. 

           Ms. Constance shoots one last look at the blue door, then 
           follows behind them. 

           INT. MS. CONSTANCE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kimball and Judd sit in oversized arm chairs, like everything 
           else here, they’re old and tattered. 

           Ms. Constance sits. Neatly places her hands on the desk. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Now. You had some questions. 

                                 JUDD
                        Yes. Just regarding Lenny Hayes. At 
                        what age did he get here? 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Leonard was here before he was two 
                        years old. The police came and 
                        handed him over without a word. It 
                        was as unceremonious as can be. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        And his brother. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Excuse me? 
                                 KIMBALL
                        His younger brother, Howie. I 
                        assume he came at the same time. 

           Ms. Constance sizes her up for a moment. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        That’s right. 

                                 JUDD
                        So he does have a brother?

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Had. Howard died as a young boy. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        How?

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Someone pushed him down the stairs. 
                        Cracked his head right open. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        That’s awful. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Truly. He was a very sweet boy. 

                                 JUDD
                        Would that explain some of the 
                        problems Lenny’s had? 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        No, Leonard was troubled long 
                        before that. 

                                 JUDD
                        How so?

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        As I said, someone pushed Howard 
                        down the stairs. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You’re not suggesting he pushed his 
                        twin brother to his death, are you? 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Leonard was born violent. Even as a 
                        child, you could see he had the 
                        devil in his eyes. Howard was 
                        sweet, if he wasn’t retarded they 
                        might have had a chance to find a 
                        home. 
           Ms. Constance sees their reactions. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE  (CONT'D)
                        Oh, I know nowadays people frown at 
                        that word but what do you want me 
                        to say? He was slow? Mentally 
                        handicapped? Un-adoptable, that’s 
                        what most parents call it. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        People adopt kids with disabilities 
                        all the time. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        They don’t adopt a retard and a 
                        demon. Not together. 

           Kimball is fuming. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Because that’s all that matters, 
                        isn’t it?

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Adoption is our goal. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Because the longer kids are here 
                        the more of government assistance 
                        they eat up, isn’t that right?

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        That’s hardly fair to say. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Really? Because you clearly see 
                        throwing Lenny into the foster 
                        program as a victory. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Of course I do. Because otherwise 
                        he would have stayed here torturing 
                        the other children and dousing 
                        stray cats with gasoline. I was 
                        glad to be rid of him. It’s a shame 
                        it wasn’t Lenny’s brains splattered 
                        on the stairs.

           Kimball ready to blow, Judd steadies her. Ms. Constance is 
           goading her and he knows it.  

                                 JUDD
                        Do you have his papers? Birth 
                        certificate or medical records? 
                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        I would assume you already have 
                        that on record at the Institute. 

                                 JUDD
                        Not Lenny’s, Howie’s. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Unfortunately, we had a break in a 
                        couple months ago and his documents 
                        were among those that were taken.  

                                 KIMBALL
                        Someone took Howie’s documents?

           Ms. Constance stands. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        I’ve got to start getting ready for 
                        dinner. But feel free to come back 
                        when you have more questions. 

           Judd stands, shakes her hand. 

                                 JUDD
                        Thank you for your time. 

           Ms. Constance holds out her hand for Kimball. 

           Kimball looks like she wants to say more, but instead slowly 
           grabs her hand, shakes. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Thank you for coming by. 

           INT. NELLIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Kimball and Riley sit at the table, drawing with crayons. 

           Unconsciously, Kimball starts to whistle “Buffalo Gals”. 

                                 RILEY
                        What’s that? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s a kitty cat. See? 

                                 RILEY
                        No, that. 

           Riley starts to pretend to whistle. It’s ridiculously cute. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s called whistling. Watch. 

           She demonstrates it for Riley. Riley tries to mimic her. 
           Kimball reaches over to squish her lips to the right shape 
           but it just makes Riley giggle. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Do you know any songs?

           Riley shakes her head. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        None?

                                 RILEY
                        I don’t like songs. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Everyone likes songs, silly! You 
                        don’t like any?

           She shakes her head again. 

                                 RILEY
                        But friend can whistle. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You mean Harry? 

           Riley shakes her head. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        What’s your friend’s name? 

                                 RILEY
                        I dunno. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Is your friend a boy or girl?

                                 RILEY
                        Boy. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Is he small like you or big like 
                        me? 

                                 RILEY
                        Bigger than you. And he wears 
                        ‘jamas all the time. 

           Riley shows Kimball what she’s drawing... 
           Before we see it, Kimball grabs the drawing from Riley. 

           She jumps up. Locks the back door, closes the drapes.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Where did you see him? 

                                 RILEY
                        I dunno...

                                 KIMBALL
                        Riley, tell me RIGHT NOW where you 
                        saw this man. 

           Riley starts to cry. Nellie walks in. 

                                 NELLIE
                        What’s going on? 

           Kimball shows Nellie the drawing:

           A tall, large man in a blue jumpsuit... It’s Lenny.

           INT. NELLIE’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Kimball paces as Nellie holds the drawing. 

                                 NELLIE
                        It could just be a coincidence. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Nell, c’mon. 

                                 NELLIE
                        No, really. This could be the 
                        cookie monster! Or The Tick! The 
                        kids watch these shows--

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s not the cookie monster!! 

           Nellie puts the paper down. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Are you still seeing a therapist?

                                 KIMBALL
                        No. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Are you still drinking?

           Kimball doesn’t answer.
                                 NELLIE (CONT'D)
                        I think you need to reconsider 
                        doing this job. It’s making you 
                        paranoid. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m fine. Just promise me you’ll 
                        double check the locks. Every 
                        night. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Always do. Now go get some sleep. 

           INT. ANTHONY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Anthony’s at the desk. There’s a KNOCK on the door. It’s 
           Kimball. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hey, take a look at this. 

           She walks over to the other side of the desk, he’s got a 
           video pulled up, titled: TWIN TELEPATHY CASE STUDY.

           The video shows two twins, separated by a divider. A case 
           worker shows one twin a picture of an animal. The other twin 
           is blind folded. 

           Each time, the blind folded twin guesses the animal 
           correctly.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        What’s your opinion on any of this? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’d say it’s on the same level as 
                        ghost stories or witch doctors, or--

                                 ANTHONY
                        Psychics? 

           Touché. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I mean, twins are notoriously 
                        close. Some develop secret 
                        languages from birth, others 
                        experience extreme empathy...

                                 ANTHONY
                        Extreme empathy? 

           Judd walks in. He holds up some papers. 
                                 JUDD
                        There was another murder. Same 
                        identifiers. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What? When?

                                 JUDD
                        Two days ago. Around 3 or 4.   

                                 KIMBALL
                        AM?

                                 JUDD
                        PM. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        But that’s when we were here with 
                        Lenny.

                                 JUDD
                        No, we weren’t... 

           Kimball finishes his thought. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        ...we were here with Howie. 

           They realize the correlation. 

                                 JUDD
                        Let’s go. 

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - DAY

           Kimball sits in the chair, Anthony straps her down. 

           Omar exits the cell. He uncuffs Lenny. 

                                 GUARD
                        In the chair. Go.  

           Lenny saunters in, whistling “Buffalo Gals” as he does. Cuffs 
           himself loosely. 

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Lenny. Tighter. 

           Caught again -- Lenny grins. CLICK-CLICK.

           Anthony walks in to prep him. But as soon as he gets close, 
           Lenny jerks in his chair to startle Anthony. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        Had a good chat with Howie the 
                        other day. 

           That gets his attention. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        He’s a real good boy. 

                                 LENNY
                        You are not to talk to him. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Paranoid?  

                                 LENNY
                        Protective.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Why?

                                 LENNY
                        Wouldn’t you be? If it were me 
                        talking to Carter? 

           Beat... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What did you just say?

           Anthony flips the switch. The NMDA dial bounces. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        NMDA 550. Good to go. 

           Judd waits for Kimball to break from her stupor. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball?

           Lenny is whistling again. Taunting her. She takes the bait.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Ready. 

                                 JUDD
                        Okay. Here we go. 

           Anthony pushes the ON switch. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Three... 

           Kimball locks eyes with Lenny. 
                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Two... 

           Anthony turns the knob. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        One...

           Anthony flips the lever. 

           Kimball closes her eyes, and....

           Nothing happens. 

           She opens her eyes again, looks over at Judd, who looks at 
           Anthony -- he doesn’t know what’s going on either. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Umm. Let me restart. 

           Kimball gets settled again. Calms herself.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Three... Two... One... 

           Flips the lever. And we 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           After one second of BLACK we see

           One FLASH of an image and then we 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           Kimball’s eyes open, back in the chair. 

                                 JUDD
                        What happened?

                                 KIMBALL
                        I don’t know. It started to work 
                        and then it kicked me out... 

                                 ANTHONY
                        We’ve got a problem. His levels are 
                        skyrocketing. He’s almost breaking 
                        1000 right now. 

           She looks across at Lenny. He’s sweating bullets. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        He’s forcing me out. 
                                 JUDD
                        How?

                                 ANTHONY
                        I- I don’t know. But there’s no way 
                        to get in this high. 

           She looks around, sees Anthony’s phone on the table. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Can you play music through the 
                        speakers? 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Sure, what kind?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Something relaxing. 

           He plugs his phone in. Taps. 

           He plays Vivaldi’s “Op. 37: No.2 in D-Minor”. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Volume up. 

                                 LENNY
                        Yes, louder please! 

           Anthony obeys. The NMDA dial dips. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        NMDA 730, still not-- 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I can do it. 

           Anthony looks to Judd, he nods. 

           Anthony pushes the ON button. 

           The piano concerto tickles as he counts down.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Three...

           Turns the knob. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Two...

           Kimball clenches her jaw. Closes her eyes. 
                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        One... 

           Flips the lever. 

           BLACK. 

           A FLURRY of IMAGES:

           - a dog barking 

           - TV static

           - a woman being strangled

           Then suddenly we’re

                                                           BACK OUT TO:

           Kimball again. Sweating, panting. 

           Lenny’s out of breath too. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        NMDA’s back up to 940. We should 
                        abort--

                                 KIMBALL
                        Pick a different song. 

                                 ANTHONY
                             (apprehensive)
                        Kimball--

                                 KIMBALL
                        I can push through! Just pick 
                        something that will disarm him! 

           Anthony looks at his phone, then to Lenny, who just shrugs. 

                                 JUDD
                        Give it to me. 

           Judd grabs the phone, clicks, plays As I Lay Dying’s  
           “Blinded”. The metalcore ROARS through the corridor. 

           The NMDA dial dips drastically. 

                                 ANTHONY

                                 KIMBALL
                        Do it. 
                                 ANTHONY
                        And three... 

           Kimball locks eyes with Lenny. 

           He grits his teeth. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Two...

           The double hammer of the base drum THUNDERS like a TEMPEST. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        One. 

           Kimball concentrates... Lenny groans under pressure. 

           Then everything 

                                                         CUTS TO BLACK.

           Then,

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           TV static. 

           Everything is slightly skewed. The edges a little too sharp. 

           A small boy sits directly in front of a TV, we recognize him 
           as LENNY (12). The screen is filled with static. 

                                 FOSTER DAD (O.S.)
                        He’s doing it again.  

                                 FOSTER MOM (O.S.)
                        He likes it. Let him. 

           Heavy footsteps THUMP over and switches the TV channel. 

                                 FOSTER DAD
                        Your brain’s going to rot.  

           Lenny flips it back to static. 

           The man changes it again. 

                                 FOSTER MOM
                        Why don’t we play that Jimmy 
                        Stewart movie you like. Huh? 
           Lenny flips it back. 

           He lightly shoves Lenny with his foot. 

                                 FOSTER DAD
                        Alright. You’re done. Get away from 
                        the TV.  

           Shoves him again. Lenny refuses. 

                                 FOSTER DAD (CONT'D)
                        GO! Your room. NOW! 

           He tries to grab Lenny, but Lenny bites him. 

           He slaps Lenny, who falls over. 

           Lenny starts to cry. 

                                 FOSTER DAD (CONT'D)
                        He bit me! 
                             (to the mom)
                        He’s actually bit me! 

           Lenny gets up. Storms up the stairs. 

                                 FOSTER MOM
                        You shouldn’t have done that. 

                                 FOSTER DAD
                        He had it comin’. 

           INT. LENNY’S BEDROOM - CONT. 

           From under Lenny’s bed, we see him enter his room. 

                                 LENNY
                             (under his breath)
                        I’m going to kill them. 

           More mumbling. More pacing. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        No, I’m going to do it!!

           Then, in a very calm, confident voice. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Be quiet. I’ll be right back. 

           He kneels down under the bed, pries a floorboard up.

           He reaches in and pulls out a steak knife. 
           Walks back downstairs. 

           We wait in silence...

           And then, 

           A SCREAM from below. 

                                 FOSTER MOM (O.S.)
                        Oh God. No!! Stop!!  

           More screaming. 

           INT. APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 

           The knife drips blood from Lenny’s fingers. 

           And in front of him... two bodies crumpled together. 

           Even with blood splattered on his face, Lenny’s completely 
           impassive.

           He drops the knife. 

           And unbuckles his pants. 

           They drop around his ankles. 

           Then his boxers... 

           Keep in mind, he’s only 12 years old here.

           Even so, his face contorts as he stares at his dead foster 
           parents... 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - DAY

           Kimball’s in the chair. Her eyes shoot open. 

           She’s sweating. 

           Hyperventilating. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Judd. Get me out of this thing. 

           She raises her hands but it’s met with a CLINK of metal. 

           Handcuffs. 
           Wait. 

           She’s handcuffed in...???

           She looks around.

           She’s inside of Lenny’s cell. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        What the hell is going on?? 

           She looks across the bars and her face drops... 

           WE WHIP PAN TO SEE: Kimball’s body in the chair next to Judd 
           and Anthony, who have absolutely no idea what is going on. 

           When WE WHIP BACK to the cell, it’s not Kimball at all -- 
           It’s Lenny. 

           Somehow, they’ve swapped bodies. 

           Kimball is in Lenny’s body, and Lenny is in Kimball’s. 

                                 KIMBALL (IN LENNY’S BODY) (CONT'D)
                        Help me! What’s happening? Get me 
                        out! Get me out!! 

                                 JUDD
                        Anthony what the hell is going on??

           Anthony starts frantically turning off switches. Meanwhile, 
           Lenny (in Kimball’s body) is laughing maniacally. 

                                 KIMBALL (IN LENNY’S BODY)
                        Do something!!! 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Restarting! THREE TWO ONE! 

           Anthony screams through the sequences and both Kimball and 
           Lenny’s chins drop to their chests and we 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Then, 

                                                         SMASH BACK TO:

           Kimball takes a sharp breath. Looks down at her own body, 
           feels the fabric straps on her hands. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What just happened??
           Judd starts untying her. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        I was... When I came back out-- 

                                 JUDD
                        I know.

           She looks over at Lenny, who’s patiently waiting for his turn 
           to be released. 

                                 LENNY
                        You look frightened, Kimball. Was 
                        it seeing yourself from my 
                        perspective? Or realizing you and I 
                        have more in common than you 
                        thought? 

           Judd grabs her arm. Walks her down the hall. 

           Lenny calls after them. 

                                 LENNY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Run, Kimball! Run!  

           INT. JUDD’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Kimball holds a cup of coffee close to her face. Anthony’s in 
           the corner with his hands under his arms. 

           Judd’s waiting for the right moment to break the silence. 

                                 JUDD
                        So what happened? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I was hoping you’d tell me. 

                                 JUDD
                        Everything was normal on our side. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Then why don’t you tell me exactly 
                        what that machine does. 

                                 JUDD
                        We have told you. 

           A little more coffee. A little more strength. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        How does it work? 
           She looks at Anthony. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        It allows you into the memories of 
                        the person on the other end--

                                 KIMBALL
                        I didn’t ask what it does. I asked 
                        how it does it. 

           Anthony doesn’t respond, looks to Judd, who shakes his head.

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You don’t actually know, do you? 

           Beat. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Did you actually go to Yale?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yes! I did. For about a year... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Oh my God... How could I have been 
                        so stupid.

           Judd raises both hands to calm her. 

                                 JUDD
                        Okay. Okay. Look... We were trying 
                        to see if he was lying about the 
                        multiple personalities, so we used 
                        a polygraph--

                                 KIMBALL
                        Polygraphs are bullshit--

                                 JUDD
                        Regardless, when Anthony connected 
                        my old partner to Lenny, he found 
                        that he was able to do what you do. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        How?

                                 ANTHONY
                        We don’t know. It just did.

                                 KIMBALL
                        So you invented the microwave. 

                                 JUDD
                        Huh?
                                 ANTHONY
                        The person who invented the 
                        microwave was developing radio 
                        transmitters during WWII. He 
                        noticed when he got too close it 
                        melted the chocolate bar in his 
                        pocket. A couple years later, we 
                        got the microwave oven. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        That’s right. You learn that at 
                        Yale too? 

           Anthony looks down at his hands. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        So what happened to him? Your 
                        partner? 

                                 JUDD
                        I told you. He’s dead. 

           Judd reaches over to a book shelf, picks up a framed 
           photograph and hands it to Kimball. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Killed himself about a month ago. 

           She looks at the photo... 

           It’s the man from the opening scene, the one that jumped off 
           the bridge. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Something about him and Lenny made 
                        it happen. And so I started trying 
                        to find his replacement. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Starting with psychics? 

           He shakes his head. 

                                 JUDD
                        Starting with twins... 

           Kimball sets her coffee down. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        You said you wanted someone with my 
                        skillset to HELP people. But really 
                        you just needed someone wired the 
                        same, someone with a dead twin to 
                        operate your stupid machine!! 
           She looks at Anthony. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        And you knew it too. That’s why you 
                        showed me that twin study. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        I didn’t know for sure! I- I knew 
                        you both had a twin but I wasn’t 
                        sure if that was the key or not! 

                                 KIMBALL
                        So does the machine really let me 
                        into his memories? 

           He takes a second to think about his answer... 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yes.

                                 KIMBALL
                        But... 

                                 ANTHONY
                        But... There’s not always room for 
                        two people in one person’s mind. 

           Kimball looks like she’s about to be sick. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        So when I’m in his mind... Where is 
                        he??

           Anthony can’t look at her anymore. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, you have to understand 
                        where we’re coming from--

                                 KIMBALL
                        Where is he, Judd?? 

           Judd looks at her, you got it. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Right, people are dying out there 
                        so you let a PSYCHOPATHIC MURDERER 
                        rummage around in my head! 

           She grabs her things and storms out. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, wait--
           INT. KIMBALL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kimball stumbles into her bedroom, hastily sets down a bottle 
           of wine next to her bed, takes one last gulp from her glass 
           and then collapses into her bed. 

           We CUT BACK AND FORTH from her DREAMS as we MOVE down to 
           Kimball in bed, she’s in an uncomfortable slumber... 

           - Granville Adoption Agency, quiet at night.  

           - The wrought-iron gates SLAM shut and someone LOCKS it.

           - A RUSH of traffic.

           KIMBALL: MUMBLES in her sleep.

           - A old home. The back porch light is on. We look through the 
           windows... Someone is watching TV.  

           - POV: A knife is inserted into a door frame, it pops open. 

           KIMBALL: swats at her face. Something’s irritating her... 

           - We creep behind an armchair, it’s OCCUPANT unaware of our 
           presence, and us still unaware of who they are...  

           KIMBALL: mid-fever dream. Something squirms in her ear... 

           - Suddenly, we’re on top of the person in the chair. Choking 
           them. We finally look at their face as they GASP for air... 

           - It’s MS. CONSTANCE. 

           KIMBALL: We CLOSE IN ON her ear, as dozens of little WORMS 
           come crawling out of her ear canal, BUZZING with life. 

           Kimball JOLTS awake with a SCREAM, grabs her ear 
           frantically... but there’s nothing there. 

           Her phone BUZZES on the nightstand. 

           She reaches for it and knocks over a wine bottle and glass, 
           it shatters on the floor. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Shit!

           She turns on the light. Answers the phone. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Hello? 
                                 JUDD (O.S.)
                        Sorry to wake you. 

           She carefully steps around the shards of glass, starts to 
           pick them up. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What is it? 

                                 JUDD
                        There’s been an incident. 

           INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT./EXT. JUDD’S CAR - NIGHT

                                 KIMBALL
                        An incident? What do you mean?

                                 JUDD
                        Another woman was killed tonight.  

           Beat. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Ms. Constance.  

                                 JUDD
                        Yeah. Wait, how did you know? 
                        Shouldn’t be out to media yet...

                                 KIMBALL
                        I saw it. In my head.

                                 JUDD
                        What are you talking about?

                                 KIMBALL
                        I saw him go to her house and kill 
                        her. Somehow he’s still in my head. 

                                 JUDD
                        That’s not possible.
                             (then)
                        There’s something you need to see. 
                        Can meet me?

           Kimball steps on a piece of glass and drops a large shard of 
           glass, it clips her wrist and cuts her. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Ouch! Umm, honestly I probably 
                        shouldn’t. I’ve had a lot to drink.  
                                 JUDD
                        I’ll pick you up. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It can’t wait till tomorrow?

                                 JUDD
                        No, it can’t. See you soon. 

           EXT. MS. CONSTANCE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Judd and Kimball step out of the car. Judd flashes his DA’s 
           badge to a cop on the perimeter. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        That’s the back door, he used a 
                        knife to trip the latch. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, be quiet. 

           He looks around to see if anyone else heard her. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        No more talking while we’re here. 
                        Follow me. 

           He walks into the house. She follows. 

           INT. MS. CONSTANCE’S HOUSE - CONT. 

           The living room is a wreck, signs of a massive struggle. 
           There’s an white outline on the floor where Ms. Constance’s 
           body would have been. 

           Kimball walks in, follows Judd’s eye line to the wall. 

           On it, written in blood:

                                    RUN KIMBALL RUN

           EXT. MS. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Judd and Kimball walk back to his car. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It means we’re getting close. He 
                        wants to scare me off. 
                                 JUDD
                        Or he’s taunting us. Hoping we’ll 
                        do something reckless. 

           Judd notices something on Kimball’s sleeve. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Hey, I think you’re bleeding. 

           Sure enough, blood seeps through her shirt by her wrist. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Oh. 

                                 JUDD
                        How’d you do that?

                                 KIMBALL
                        I knocked over a glass when you 
                        called. I must’ve cut myself. 

           Judd watches her put pressure on it. He chooses his next 
           words carefully... 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball, can anyone provide an 
                        alibi for where you were tonight?

           She sees where he’s going with this. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I told you, I was drinking and 
                        knocked a bottle over... I saw 
                        Lenny’s memory of tonight. I swear. 

                                 JUDD
                        What if they’re not his memories? 
                        What if they’re yours? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Not possible.  

                                 JUDD
                        I didn’t think it was possible for 
                        you two to still be connected 
                        without the machine but you’re 
                        telling me you saw this happen--

                                 KIMBALL
                        Judd-- 

                                 JUDD
                        And just hours ago you woke up in 
                        his body and he in yours. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Someone killed Ms. Constance 
                        tonight and that someone isn’t 
                        behind bars.

                                 KIMBALL
                        I didn’t kill her!! 

           They look around, thankfully no one is close enough to hear. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You have to believe me. 

                                 JUDD
                        No. I don’t have to. 
                             (beat)
                        Let’s go find out. 

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           A SECURITY TECH sits with Kimball and Judd. He sips a cup of 
           coffee and works on the computer.  

                                 JUDD
                        No alarms, no breaches, nothing?

                                 SECURITY TECH
                        Nope. Nothing.  

           He scrubs through CCTV footage of Lenny’s cell.  

                                 JUDD
                        Can you play it here? 

           He plays it: Lenny’s pacing all over the room.

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Is there sound?

           The tech turns it up. 

           It’s shitty audio, but you can distinctly make out Lenny 
           whistling something. 

                                 SECURITY TECH
                        We keep his volume low. He whistles 
                        that all day. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Lenny’s earworm. 

                                 JUDD
                        Keep going. 
           Hours later, Lenny sits on the ground. The tech hits play. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        No whistling... 

           They scrub a little more... 

           Lenny stands and faces the corner. One hand steadies himself 
           against the wall, the other hand at his groin.

                                 JUDD
                        Is he pissing on the wall? 

           They look closer. 

           His hand jerks back and forth, back and forth...

                                 KIMBALL
                        No, I don’t think so. 

                                 JUDD
                        What’s the time stamp? 

           The tech looks in the corner of his screen. 

                                 SECURITY TECH
                        1:54am. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What time was Ms. Constance killed 
                        tonight?

                                 JUDD
                        Just before 2am. 

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - NIGHT

           Kimball and Judd speed walk to Lenny’s cell.  

                                 JUDD
                        Knock, knock.  

           Lenny turns to look at them. He sees Kimball and flashes her 
           a bright, friendly smile. 

                                 LENNY
                        Oh hi, Kimball! 

           Kimball looks to Judd, mouths “Howie”.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Hi, Howie. What are you doing?
                                 LENNY
                        Just counting. 

           He holds his fingers out, as if juggling numbers. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Counting what?

           Lenny looks at her like she’s an idiot. 

                                 LENNY
                        Seconds. Duh. 

           Resumes pacing. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)

           Anthony comes walking in, he looks half awake. 

                                 JUDD
                        Thanks for coming in. Hope we won’t 
                        get you in trouble. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Not as long as I’m back in bed 
                        before breakfast. It’s our 
                        anniversary tomorrow.

           He looks at his watch. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Or, today I guess. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Happy anniversary. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Thanks.

                                 LENNY (O.S.)
                        Happy anniversary! 

           Lenny waves, and then continues counting. 

           Anthony gets to work. Judd and Kimball approach the cell. 

                                 JUDD
                        Listen, Howie. A couple hours ago 
                        something happened and we need to 
                        ask you some questions. 

           Lenny ignores him. 
                                 LENNY

                                 JUDD
                        Howie?

                                 LENNY
                        I don’t want to talk to you. 

                                 JUDD
                        I just need to ask you-- 

                                 LENNY
                        Kimball, please tell him I’m not 
                        talking to him. 
                             (beat)
                        Also, he’s ugly. 
                             (beat)
                        And he smells like farts. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Do you mind if I ask you some 
                        things then? 

                                 LENNY
                        343. Okay, you can ask. 344... 

           Judd motions go ahead. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Tonight around 2 o’clock in the 
                        morning, did something happen? 

                                 LENNY

                                 KIMBALL
                        Did something happen Howie? 

                                 LENNY
                        Well yeaaaah but I didn’t look. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What do you mean?

                                 LENNY
                        I was ‘sposed to close my eyes. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Who told you to do that? Lenny?

                                 LENNY
                                 KIMBALL
                        And then you went into the corner 
                        and did something. Right. 

           Lenny stops. 

                                 LENNY
                        No. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I saw you, Howie. 

                                 LENNY
                        No!! I didn’t!! 

           He backs up to the wall. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s okay, Howie--

                                 LENNY
                        Don’t hit me!! I won’t do it again!

                                 KIMBALL
                        Howie! Calm down. I’m not going to 
                        hit you. It’s okay... 

           He wipes some tears from his face.  

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        I’m not going to hit you. I 
                        promise. 

                                 LENNY
                             (calming down)

                                 KIMBALL
                        Howie, can you tell me what 
                        happened at 2am?

                                 LENNY
                        Nope. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Okay. Can you tell me why you did 
                        it though? 

                                 LENNY
                        357... We always do it right after 
                        Lenny does it. 358... 

           Judd touches Kimball’s shoulder. This is it...
                                 KIMBALL
                        After he does what, Howie?

                                 LENNY
                        Can’t tell. He’ll be so so so mad. 
                        364! 365. 366.. 

           Kimball realizes something. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Howie, why are you counting? 

                                 LENNY
                        ‘cuz Lenny said he’ll be back when 
                        I count 1000 seconds.

           Kimball turns to Judd, no time to lose. 

           Judd quickly moves to help set up. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Howie, I know you can’t tell me. 
                        But do you think if I played some 
                        music, you could show me? 

           She takes out her phone, starts to play “Buffalo Gals”. 

           He starts to smile. 

                                 LENNY
                        Maaaaaaybe... 

           MOMENTS LATER 

           Anthony rushes to put everything together. Kimball straps 
           herself in, she restarts the song. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What second are we up to, Howie? 

           Howie’s getting strapped in. He’s having a blast. 

                                 LENNY
                        812! 813! 

           Judd kneels in front of her. 

                                 JUDD
                        Get in, find out where Lenny’s at 
                        and then get out. Got it?  

                                 KIMBALL
                        Got it. 
                                 JUDD
                        Be safe.  

           He grabs her hand. She squeezes it.

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Anthony, how’s it looking? 

           Anthony walks over to the machine. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Well below, 400. We’re good to go. 

           Kimball nods at them, determined. 

                                 JUDD
                        Let’s do it. 

           Anthony flips the switch. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Three...

           Turns the knob. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        Two... 

           Kimball braces herself. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        One. 

           Throws the lever. And we 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Silence. Then, 

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           We walk past a line of cars. 

           It’s quiet. 

           Too early for anyone to be up. 

           We put on our work gloves. Dirty. Tight. 

           We open the gate to a house. 
           We look up at the two story Colonial style house... 

           It’s Nellie’s. 

                                                          SMASH OUT TO:

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - CONT. 

           Kimball comes back. PANICKING. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        HE’S AT NELLIE’S!! HE’S GOING AFTER 
                        RILEY!! HE’S ALREADY THERE!! 

           Judd runs over. 

                                 JUDD
                        What are you talking about??

           Kimball’s hysterical. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        He’s at 134 Sycamore we need to get 
                        there now!!!  

           Judd starts to get her unstrapped, it’s taking too long. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Leave me! JUST GO!!! Please Judd!!

           Judd takes off running down the hallway. 

           Kimball sits back in the chair, readjusts the headset. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        What are you doing? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m going back in. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        But--

                                 KIMBALL
                        NOW!!

           Anthony flips the switch. Turns the knob. 

           Kimball braces herself. Looks across at Lenny. 

           Just as Anthony throws the lever, the NMDA dial skyrockets 
           into the red... 
           Lenny smiles. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        Gotcha.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Silence. Then,

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Kimball (9) sleeps peacefully in her bed. Her father stands 
           in the doorway behind her. He slowly walks in. 

                                 SAM
                             (whispers)
                        Carter. 

           Carter stirs. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Come with me. 

           Over Kimball’s shoulder. We see Sam lead Carter out of the 
           room. The door SHUTS and Kimball stirs awake. 

           Kimball looks over at her sisters bed...

           Empty. 

           EXT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. 

           Kimball looks around. Kitchen oven light is on... and the 
           doorframe to her father’s room glows across the hall. 

           She tip-toes to it. 

           MUMBLES from Sam. Crying from Carter... 

           Kimball settles herself. 

           She knocks. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Carter?

           No answer. Knocks again. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Carter??
                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Go back to sleep, Kimball. 

                                 CARTER (O.S.)
                        Kimball??

           She continues to pound on the door. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Let me in!! 

           More pounding. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        You’re hurting her! You’re hurting 
                        her!! 

           Kimball knocks harder. Harder. 

           The door opens. Sam’s shirtless, eyes bloodshot.  

           He shoves Kimball away from the door. 

                                 SAM
                        Go back to bed! NOW! 

           He slams the door. 

           Kimball waits for a moment. 

           Walks to the kitchen.

           Takes a carving knife out of the knife block. 

           She walks back to the door. Holds the knife behind her. 

           Knocks. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I want to sleep in there too.

           Silence. 

           The door opens. 

           We wait outside the door as she quietly steps inside.

           There’s a rustle of movement inside. 

           A whimper from Carter. 

           A SLINK as metal punctures tissue. 

           Sam GASPS. 
           The ajar door slowly starts to open...

           We hear another puncture. 

           Another. 

           A SCREAM from Carter.

           The door has opened enough for us to SEE the THUD as Sam hits 
           the ground. He’s naked and drenched in his own blood. 

           He holds his neck as blood pours over his own fingers. 

           On the bed, one of the twins, Kimball, is splattered with 
           blood. She holds Carter who’s sobbing uncontrollably. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        I couldn’t have done better myself. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Kimball and Carter, now TEENAGERS. Sleep in a bed together.

           Carter jolts awake. Full panic. 

                                 CARTER
                        Don’t touch me!! Stop!!! 

           Kimball grabs her. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s okay! It’s okay! No one is 
                        here! It’s just me. 

           Carter starts to sob. 

                                 CARTER
                        I can feel him on me. I can still 
                        feel him grab me... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s okay. He’s gone. 

           There’s a KNOCK at the door.

           NELLIE, much younger than we know her, opens the door. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Girls? Everything okay? 
                                 KIMBALL
                        We’re okay. Thank you, Nellie. 

           Nellie’s footsteps fade down the hall.  

           Kimball grabs a small stereo. She checks the CD, pushes play. 

           It begins to play, “At Last”, by Etta James. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Just listen to the music, relax. 

           Carter visibly starts to calm down. 

                                 CARTER
                        I wish he’d leave me alone... I 
                        just wish he’d leave me alone... 

           She starts to cry more. Kimball holds her. 

           The music plays on: 

                                 ETTA JAMES (O.S.)
                        ...my lonely days, are over. And 
                        life is like a song... 

           PRE-LAP: LOUD KNOCKS on a door. 

                                 KIMBALL
                             (pre-lap)
                        CARTER! Carter, open up right now!! 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           There’s a shuffle of feet and then BANG! The door flies open. 

           Kimball (20) rushes in front of a group of COLLEGE KIDS.  

           Carter (20) is on the ground. One arm is bleeding, there’s a 
           spilled bottle of pills on the ground. She’s dazed. 

                                 CARTER
                        I’m sorry... 

           Kimball turns to the gawkers. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Someone call an ambulance!!!

           One of the boys pulls out his cell phone and starts to dial. 
           INT. HOSPITAL - EVENING

           Kimball stands just outside of the room talking to a doctor. 

           Carter watches the rain PATTER on the window. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KIMBALL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kimball makes out on the couch with a boyfriend, GREG. It’s 
           passionate, clothes start to come off. 

           Suddenly, Kimball breaks away. 

                                 GREG
                        What’s wrong?

                                 KIMBALL
                        I have to go. 

                                 GREG
                        What are you talking about?

           Kimball grabs her phone, dials. No answer. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s my sister. I’m sorry. 

                                 GREG
                        She’s probably fine. 

           He tries to kiss her again but she stops him. 

           Kimball redials. Greg carries on. It goes to voicemail.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Can you stop? 

           She dials again, starts to get dressed. Voicemail. 

                                 GREG
                        Kim, you do this all the time and 
                        nothing is ever wrong. 

           He stands to stop her from dressing. 

                                 GREG (CONT'D)
                        She needs to learn to manage on her 
                        own. 

           She ignores him, shuts the door behind her.  
           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kimball walks in with a can of black olives. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Where’s the girl making me crave 
                        olives? 

           The apartment is a mess. In the corner, a pregnant Carter. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Where’s Nate? 

                                 CARTER
                        He’s gone. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Gone where?

                                 CARTER
                        Just gone, okay??

           Kimball walks over, sits with her on the ground. 

                                 CARTER (CONT'D)
                        He’s right. I’m broken. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        No, you’re not. 

                                 CARTER
                        Yes, I am. I can feel it. There are 
                        pieces of me missing... Like 
                        someone took them from me. 

           Kimball puts her arms around her, HUSHES her. After a beat:

                                 CARTER (CONT'D)
                        Why do you think he picked me? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Nate?

           Carter shakes her head. 

                                 CARTER
                        Dad. 

           Kimball doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 CARTER (CONT'D)
                        We’re identical, right? So why did 
                        he pick me? 
                                 KIMBALL
                        I don’t know, Car. 

                                 CARTER
                        I think it was because you’re 
                        stronger than me. 

           Kimball reaches over for her hand. 

           Carter leans her head on Kimball’s shoulder. 

                                 CARTER (CONT'D)
                        Do you ever feel bad? About... 
                        About what you did. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        No. Not at all. 

           Kimball closes her eyes... 

           PRE-LAP: “At Last” plays again in the distance...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

           Two DRUNK GIRLS sing bad karaoke. 

                                 DRUNK GIRLS
                        “...at last, my love, has come 
                        along...” 

           Kimball sits in the audience, Greg comes back with drinks.

                                 GREG
                        We’re up next!

           He kisses her on the cheek. She’s having a great night.

           BUZZ. 

           Kimball checks her phone, it’s Carter. 

           Greg sees it, immediately takes his arm off of her. 

                                 GREG (CONT'D)
                        I’m getting another drink. 

           She watches him go, debates... Answers it. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Carter?
           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - CONT. 

           Carter’s a mess. In the corner, a baby CRIES. 

                                 CARTER
                        I can’t take it, Kimball. I’m going 
                        to do it. 

           EXT. KARAOKE BAR - CONT. 

           Kimball walks out, finger in one ear to hear better. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CARTER (O.S.)
                        Just please keep your promise, 
                        okay? I just need to know you’ll 
                        keep your promise. 

           Through the windows, we can see Greg looking at Kimball. He 
           throws up his hands and points to the stage. 

           Kimball gives him the “one sec” with her hands. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’ll come over a little later. 
                        Okay? 

           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - CONT. 

           Carter holds a small silver six-shooter. She turns the 
           chamber, it’s full. 

                                 CARTER
                        I can still hear him. It’s like 
                        he’s stuck in my head... I can’t 
                        take it anymore. 

                                 KIMBALL (O.S.)
                        Carter, enough. Stop it!

           EXT. KARAOKE BAR - CONT. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I’m going back inside now. So I’ll 
                        see you in a couple of hours. Okay?

           Carter’s sobbing on the phone. The baby crying harder. 
                                 CARTER (O.S.)
                        I’m just going to do it. I’m just 
                        going to do it. 

           Kimball sees Greg through the windows, he turns away from 
           her, disappointed. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        No, you’re not! You can’t keep 
                        doing this Carter!!  

                                 CARTER (O.S.)
                             (sobbing)
                        Just please remember your promise. 
                        Remember what you promised...    

                                 KIMBALL
                        You do this all time! It’s got to 
                        stop!  

                                 CARTER (O.S.)
                        I’m going stop it right now... I’ll 
                        just do it right now... 

           Greg opens the door. 

                                 GREG
                        Kim, you coming or not? 

           Kimball loses it. 

                                 KIMBALL
                             (into the phone)
                        Yeah? You’re going to do it? 

                                 CARTER (O.S.)
                        Yes. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Yeah? Then just fucking do it 
                        already.

           Then through the phone, we hear it... 

           Gunshot. 

           Kimball can’t move. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        Carter? 

           Nothing. 
                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        CARTER??? 

           Everything SLOWS as Greg holds her as she starts to scream in 
           her phone... 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        Ironic...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - NIGHT

           Kimball starts to seize up as she stares straight ahead at 
           Lenny, who’s verging on catatonic. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        She was right, you know. You were 
                        stronger. 

           Anthony runs to her side. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Kimball? Wake up!!

           She continues to shake, starts to foam at the mouth. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        And that’s why your daddy liked 
                        your sister. The weak can only 
                        fight for so long.

           Anthony yells to Omar. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Turn it off!!

           Anthony holds Kimball down as she seizes in her chair. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        You killed your daddy and never 
                        lost a wink of sleep over it. I 
                        don’t blame you, I’d done the same. 

           Omar unplugs the machine, but the dials don’t turn off.

                                 OMAR
                        It’s not turning off! 

           Anthony rips off Kimball’s headband, but it doesn’t help.
                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        But this? You did this. She didn’t 
                        commit suicide. You killed her.

           Lenny is in his cell, eyes bulging as he stares at Kimball.  

                                 ANTHONY
                        We have to get his off!!!

           Omar fumbles with the keys to unlock Lenny’s cell.

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        You think you can pay penance for 
                        this by saving a bunch of whores!

           Omar finally unlocks it. Anthony slips in past him to grab 
           Lenny’s headband off.

                                 LENNY (REVERB) (CONT'D)
                        But you can’t. There’s no getting 
                        past this. You’re a monster. 

           But suddenly, Lenny grabs Anthony and wraps the cords around 
           his neck and pushes the cell door shut with his legs, keeping 
           Omar out as he strangles Anthony who’s squirming under him.

                                 OMAR
                        Someone!! HELP!!

           Omar runs over to the wall and pushes the ALARM. 

           Anthony is purple faced. His legs kick under him. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        You’re a killer. Just like me.

           Omar shoulders the door. Finally forces the door open. 

           He strikes Lenny in the head with his baton and Lenny 
           releases Anthony, who rolls off of him, limp. 

           Omar puts his hand on Anthony... dead. 

           Kimball’s eye droop and she falls out of her chair. 

           Some more GUARDS arrive, but they’re just footsteps to 
           Kimball who’s on the ground, eye to eye with Lenny. 

           They stare at each other, still in each other’s heads...

                        But I can help you, Kimball.

                                                          DIP TO BLACK:
           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           Kimball’s in a gurney getting compressions. She fades in and 
           out, the edges around her sharpen. Blur...

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        I can make all of the hurt go away, 
                        Kimball. 

           The overhead lights blur until they DISSOLVE to the bokeh of 
           the cityscape through the windows of

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONT. 

           Judd sleeps in the chair next to Kimball’s hospital bed.

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        I can help you find what you came 
                        looking for.

           Kimball is as still as a corpse. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB) (CONT'D)
                        Would you like me to help you make 
                        it all go away?  

           She hasn’t moved a muscle, but we HEAR Kimball crying. 

                                 KIMBALL (REVERB)
                        Yes. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        Then do as I tell you. 
                             (beat)
                        Get up. 

           Her eyes open. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB) (CONT'D)
                        Quietly. 

           Kimball moves her legs off the side of the bed. Stands. 

           She opens the door, shuts it gently behind her.

                                 LENNY (REVERB) (CONT'D)
                        Now, take the subway. 

           INT. RED LINE SUBWAY - CONT. 

           Kimball holds onto the rails, still mid-trance.

                        Get off at the bridge. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONT. 

           Judd shifts in his sleep, his eyes open for half a second. 

           He jerks awake, realizing Kimball is gone. 

                                  JUDD
                        Kimball?? 

           He looks around, runs out the door. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Somebody??

           EXT. PITTSBURGH STREETS - NIGHT 

           Kimball walks barefoot past a camp of transients. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        Almost there. Keep going. 

           INT./EXT. JUDD’S CAR - CONT. 

           Judd floors it. Scans the streets for Kimball. 

           Up ahead, he sees the Liberty bridge. 

           Guns it. 

           EXT. LIBERTY BRIDGE - CONT. 

           Kimball gets to the center of the bridge. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        Stop here. 

           She looks over the ledge. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB) (CONT'D)
                        This is the last thing I need you 
                        to do. And then it’ll all go away. 

           A tear falls from Kimball’s impassive face.

                                 LENNY (REVERB) (CONT'D)
                        Climb up on the railing. 
           One foot, then the next. 

           She stands up. 

           Just then, Judd SCREECHES to a halt. He gets out of his car.

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball!! 

           She wobbles. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Kimball. Come down from there. 

           She finds her balance. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I just want to make it stop. He’s 
                        helping me get it out of my head. 

                                 JUDD
                        No he’s not. Come down...

           Kimball’s toes hang over the edge. 

                                 RILEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy?

           Riley climbs out of the car. 

           She looks up at Kimball on the edge. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Hi cutie... 

           Judd softly walks over, holds out his hand. 

                                 JUDD
                        We can help you.

           She takes a deep breath.

           Takes his hand. 

           Kimball climbs down and Riley runs into her arms. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER

           Kimball comes to, back in bed. Riley curled up next to her. 

           Judd sits next to her, he looks like he hasn’t slept in days. 

           Kimball tries to speak, but her mouth is too dry. 
                                 JUDD
                        Here... 

           He brings over a water with a straw in it. She sips it. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Anthony?

           Judd shakes his head. His shoulders slump, his bullet proof 
           facade breaking for the first time. 

                                 KIMBALL (CONT'D)
                        It my fault. I was reckless. 

                                 JUDD
                        I should’ve never put you in that 
                        position.  

                                 KIMBALL
                        No, I wanted it. I hoped if I was 
                        able to help people, maybe I 
                        wouldn’t hurt anymore. But I’ve 
                        realized, I think pain is my 
                        earworm. Something I’ll just have 
                        to learn to live with.

           Judd listens. Thinks for a minute, 

                                 JUDD
                        My sister was a musician. And you’d 
                        know she was working on something 
                        new because that’s all she’d hum, 
                        all day, all night. And it drove 
                        her crazy, well it drove ME more 
                        crazy if I’m being honest with you. 

           Kimball cracks a tiny smile. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        But as soon as she finished the 
                        song, poof. It was gone. The song 
                        just needed to work itself out. 

           He lets this sink in. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        Maybe that’s what you need to do. 
                        Let the pain in, let it work itself 
                        out.

           He pulls out an envelope. 

                                 JUDD (CONT'D)
                        This is for you. 
           She takes it, opens it. 

           It’s an adoption application, signed by the Attorney General.

                                 KIMBALL
                        But we’re not done...

                                 JUDD
                        No. We are. We’re done. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        We haven’t figured out how to stop 
                        him... 

                                 JUDD
                        I’m not sure that we will. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        If we can catch him when he’s 
                        Howie, I think we can figure out 
                        how he’s doing it. We can do this. 

                                 JUDD
                        We’re out of time. He’ll get 
                        insanity, we can only hope for the 
                        best from there. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I can do it. I can get through. 

                                 JUDD
                        You’re no match for him! Look what 
                        happened last time you forced your 
                        way in!

                                 KIMBALL
                        I just need to figure out how to 
                        bring his guard down. Find his 
                        song... 

           Judd sits back, tired of arguing with her.

                                 RILEY
                        Maybe he doesn’t like songs. 

           Kimball looks down at Riley.  

                                 KIMBALL
                        What did you say, baby?

                                 RILEY
                        Maybe he doesn’t like songs. 

           Lightbulb. 
                                 KIMBALL
                        He doesn’t like songs... It’s not a 
                        song. 

                                 JUDD
                        What? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        I know how to get through to him. 

                                 JUDD
                        Kimball--

                                 KIMBALL
                        Please. I need you to trust me. 
                        Just one more chance. 

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - NIGHT

           Lenny’s got a big bruise on his forehead. He grins when he 
           sees Kimball and Judd walk in. 

                                 LENNY
                        Glad to see you’ve made a full 
                        recovery. I thought you were going 
                        off the edge for a while there. 

           He laughs at his own joke as Judd sets up the table. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Oh no. Not this again. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        We’re going to try something a 
                        little different this time. 

                                 LENNY
                        Oh really? Found my song, did you? 
                        It’s not the stupid tune I keep 
                        whistling if that’s what you think 
                        it is. 

           He puts his hands out of the bars for Omar to cuff him. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        “Have you considered it might be 
                        ‘Who Let the Dogs Out?’ Or 
                        ‘Careless Whisper’? That Boy George 
                        back in the day-- 

           His face drops as he sees what Judd is pushing over... 

           A television. 
           Boxy, analog. Similar to the one we’ve seen in his memories. 

           Lenny tries to back up, but he’s cuffed to the bar. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Uncuff me. 

           He starts shaking the bars. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Stop!! I’ll tell you what you want 
                        to know! 

           Judd flips on the TV. 

           STATIC. 

           Lenny goes completely silent as he stares at the screen. Omar 
           slips the headset on him. 

           Once it’s on, the NMDA dial plunges, hovers right at 0... 

           Omar offers Kimball the other headset, but instead, Kimball 
           reaches in her bag, pull out some headphones. She connects it 
           to her phone and puts them on. 

           She plays her own earworm. 

           “At Last” drowns out the static.

                        “At last, my love has come along..”

           Kimball takes a deep breath.

                             (sotto)
                        Okay, Carter. Let’s finish the 
                        song. 

           She focuses on the swell of the music. 

                                 ETTA JAMES (O.S.)
                        “My lonely days are over...”

                                                            FADE UP ON:
           INT. PARK - DAY

           Kimball’s phone is playing music, while she dozes. A very 
           pregnant Carter lays next to her in the grass, with an open 
           can of black olives. 

           A bedsheet tent providing shade and a safe place for them.

                                 CARTER
                        Kim?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Hmmm?

                                 CARTER
                        If something ever happens to me, 
                        will you be Riley’s mom?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Nothing’s going to happen to you. 

                                 CARTER
                        But if it does. 

           Kimball sits up. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Why are you asking me?

                                 CARTER
                        I just want to know that you’ll 
                        take care of her. Like you’ve taken 
                        care of me. 

           She’s serious. Kimball can see that. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Of course. 

                                 CARTER
                        Promise?

                                 KIMBALL
                        I promise. 

           Kimball rests her head on Carter’s stomach. Hums along to the 
           song, the MUSIC suddenly cuts as

                                                           WE SMASH TO:

           STATIC. 

           It switches to another channel. 
           Then, static. 

           Finally, we see:

           IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYS ON AN ANALOG TV SCREEN.

           We PULL BACK and reveal we’re at

           INT. GRANVILLE ADOPTION AGENCY - DAY

           Two boys, LENNY (9) and HOWIE (9) sit in front of a TV set. 

           They’re both entranced by George Bailey and Mary Hatch 
           walking down the sidewalk singing together. 

                       GEORGE BAILEY
                                                       MARY HATCH
                 (sings)
                                                (sings)
           ...and dance by the light of 
           the moon.
                                              ...and dance by the light of 
                                              the moon.

           Behind the boys, MS. CONSTANCE and a couple of SOCIAL WORKERS 
           walk up to them. One grabs Lenny and the other grabs Howie. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Get up. Time to go. 

                                 LENNY
                        Go where? 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        You, are being fostered. 

                                 LENNY
                        What about my brother? 

           Ms. Constance looks from Howie to Lenny. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE
                        Your brother? What do you mean? He 
                        died last week after you pushed him 
                        down the stairs. 

           Howie starts to fight and SCREAM, he kicks over the TV, it 
           immediately goes to complete STATIC. 

           Ms. Constance grabs Lenny’s face. 

                                 MS. CONSTANCE  (CONT'D)
                        You’ll never see him, talk to him, 
                        or be in the same room together, 
                        ever again. You understand me? This 
                        is goodbye, forever. 
           Lenny spits in her face. 

           She SLAPS him, the way one adult would hit another. 

           INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

           A sliding van door SLAMS and Lenny’s face appears next to it. 
           He looks up at Granville as they drive away. 

                                 LENNY
                             (under his breath)
                        Howie? 

           He looks to the front of the van, the driver isn’t watching.

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Howie, can you hear me? 

           INT. BOILER ROOM - CONT. 

           Howie cries on a mattress in the corner of the room. The 
           boiler GROWLS nearby. 

           Howie stops and listens. 

                                 HOWIE
                        Lenny? Where are you?

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        I don’t know.

                                 HOWIE
                        I’m scared. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        Don’t be scared. I’ll be with you.

           SERIES OF SHOTS 

           - A school yard, kids run and play together. In the sandbox, 
           Lenny’s alone, drawing Tic-Tac-Toe in the sand.... 

           - Howie’s in the courtyard of Granville, similarly drawing in 
           the dirt. He plays the other half of Lenny’s Tic-Tac-Toe. 

           - We’re OVERHEAD on Lenny as he lies on his bed. He’s on his 
           side, pillow-talking to someone next to him... But when we 
           TRUCK over, no one is there. 

           We keep TRUCKING past the wall and complete the MOVE AND see:
           - An empty spot on another bed. Howie mirrors Lenny’s 
           position, talking to the empty spot in his bed. 

           A fluid conversation between the twins in separate locations. 

           INT. LENNY’S FOSTER HOME - DAY

           Lenny is now a teenager, already over 6ft tall. He yells at 
           his foster parents, slams his door to shut them out. 

                                 LENNY
                        You there, little brother? 

           INTERCUT:

           EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

           Howie is also built large, but is slumped over in a ball as a 
           bunch of boys throw rocks at him at the park. 

                                 TEENS
                        Get out of here, stupid! 

           Howie covers his head as more rocks come flying. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        Go fight them, Howie!

                                 HOWIE
                        I can’t. 

           BACK TO LENNY

           He paces around his room. Fists clenched. 

           He gets an idea. 

                                 LENNY 
                        Howie. You want me to do it for 
                        you? 

           HOWIE 

           wipes his bloody nose. Nods. 

                                 HOWIE
                        Okay. 

                                 LENNY (O.S.)
                        Close your eyes. 

           LENNY 
           closes his eyes. Rolls his head back. 

           HOWIE 

           closes his eyes. Tilts his head back... 

           Then, Howie stands. 

           His posture is straighter. 

           Voice deeper... 

                                 HOWIE
                        Don’t leave my room, Howie. I’ll be 
                        right back. 

           Howie picks up an ugly rock, walks towards the teenagers.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN PHILLY - NIGHT

           Rain pours in downtown Philly. Howie (now in his 30s) runs 
           under an awning by a cafe. 

           He’s been crying. 

                                 HOWIE
                        Lenny, I’m lost... 

           INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONT. 

           Lenny’s (30s) in a holding cell with a bunch of other men. 

                                 LENNY
                        I can’t help you right now. Ask 
                        someone else, Howie.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN PHILLY - CONT. 

           Howie stops a YOUNG WOMAN in a dress and heels.

                                 HOWIE
                        Can you walk me home?

           But she doesn’t know how to deal with this strange grown man. 

           Howie watches her walk away. His gaze lingers a little too 
           long on the back of her legs. 

                                 LENNY (REVERB)
                        You know, I might know the way back 
                        home, Howie. 
           The woman crosses the street.

                                 LENNY (REVERB) (CONT'D)
                        You want to switch places with me 
                        for a bit? 

           Howie wipes his eyes. 

                                 HOWIE
                        Okay. 

                                 LENNY (O.S.)
                        Close your eyes. 

           Howie closes his eyes. Tilts his head back... 

           Stands up straighter. 

           He crosses the street, walks after the woman. 

           INT. BOILER ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Howie rushes into the room, buzzed with energy. 

           He takes off his shirt, it’s completely stained red. 

           He goes to the sink, washes his hands of blood. 

                                 HOWIE
                        Just hold on, Howie. I’m almost 
                        ready. 

           He puts on a new shirt. 

           Walks over to the TV, pushes in a video cassette. 

           ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ begins to play. 

           He sits on the bed. 

                                 HOWIE (CONT'D)
                        Alright. Close your eyes, little 
                        brother. I’m ready. 

           He closes his eyes. Tilts his head back... 

           He opens them again with a big smile. He sees the TV. 

                                 HOWIE (CONT'D)
                        Hot dog! You wanna watch with me?
           INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT 

           Lenny puts his hands behind his head. Satisfied.

                                 LENNY
                        No, you go ahead.

           Begins to whistle “Buffalo Gals”. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SECURE TREATMENT WING - NIGHT

           Kimball comes back. Gets to her feet, immediately starts 
           walking to the door. 

                                 LENNY 
                        Don’t you dare touch him! I’ll kill 
                        you!! I’ll fucking kill you!!! 

           Judd catches up to her. 

                                 JUDD
                        Where are you going??

           EXT. GRANVILLE ADOPTION AGENCY - MORNING

           Kimball, Judd, and a host of armed police officers storm past 
           the black steel gates. 

           INT. BASEMENT - CONT. 

           Kimball leads the way, down the narrow corridor we saw 
           before. 

           She walks to the heavy, blue door.

           Music echoes in the hallway, coming from behind the door... 

           Kimball turns the handle and opens it. 

           INT. BOILER ROOM - CONT. 

           The giant boiler HISSES and SHUDDERS. 

           There’s a book shelf. Even a couple small plants. 

           A TV plays ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’. 
           ON THE SCREEN: George Bailey and Mary Hatch walk down the 
           sidewalk singing:

                       GEORGE BAILEY
                                                       MARY HATCH
                 (singing)
                                                (singing)
           Buffalo gals, won’t you come 
           out tonight, come out 
           tonight, come out tonight...
                                              Buffalo gals, won’t you come 
                                              out tonight, come out 
                                              tonight, come out tonight...

           And in the far corner of the room, laying on the mattress 
           with his back against the wall... 

           Howie. 

           He lights up as Kimball walks into the room. Waves.

                                 HOWIE
                        Oh hi, Kimball! 

           INT. GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Kimball and Judd sit at the table. Judd has a stack of papers 
           and a box with the machine next to him. 

           The door opens and GOVERNOR PARK storms in. Judd stands, 
           Kimball follows suit. 

           The Governor sits without acknowledging them, he flips 
           through a stack of papers. He throws it on the table. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Anyone want to tell me what the 
                        hell is going on? 

           Judd grabs his notes. 

                                 JUDD
                        Well, as I explained in our report--

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Is Lenny Hayes our killer or not? 

                                 JUDD
                        He is. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Wasn’t he in custody during the 
                        times the murders took place?

                                 JUDD
                        Yes. Umm, that’s correct. 
                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        So he escaped from county? 

                                 JUDD
                        Well no-- 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Which is it? Someone tell me what 
                        the hell is going on!!

                                 KIMBALL
                        May I, sir? 

           Governor Park notices her for the first time. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        And who are you?

                                 KIMBALL
                        Kimball Cavannagh. I was the one 
                        who shared a psychic connection 
                        with Lenny Hayes. 

           He grabs his papers, flips a couple pages. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Cavannagh. Okay. Go ahead. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        There’s a theory, if you can even 
                        call it that, it’s called ‘twin 
                        telepathy’. Which is that by 
                        nature, twins are able to share a 
                        psychic connection. I knew this, 
                        not because of my studies, but 
                        because I had a twin sister with 
                        whom I experienced it with in the 
                        past.  

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        But you don’t anymore? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Not since she killed herself 3 
                        years ago.

           He goes back to shutting the hell up. 

                                 JUDD
                        This is how Lenny Hayes was able to 
                        get away with the murders for so 
                        long.

                        He purposefully put himself in 
                        custody for petty crimes on the 
                        nights he killed because he didn’t 
                        need to physically be there. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        He simply had to mind swap with his 
                        brother Howie and kill through him.

                                 JUDD
                        The DNA samples matched because 
                        identical twins share identical 
                        DNA. Lenny was the only suspect 
                        because thanks to Granville 
                        Adoption Agency, Howie died at age 
                        9. He didn’t exist.

                                 KIMBALL
                        When Ms. Constance faked Howie’s 
                        death-- 

                                 JUDD
                        --to bypass the law prohibiting 
                        separating siblings-- 

                                 KIMBALL
                        --she forced the twins to cling to 
                        the only bond they had ever had 
                        their entire lives. If their 
                        psychic connection was a muscle, 
                        this trauma was like a steroid. She 
                        forced them to exercise and 
                        strengthen it over miles and miles 
                        and years upon years. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        But what about the machine? Isn’t 
                        that how you were getting into his 
                        mind?

                                 JUDD
                        We’re unsure if it acted as a 
                        conduit or simply amplified Lenny’s 
                        abilities to entrench himself in 
                        Kimball’s mind, eventually they 
                        became connected even without the 
                        machine’s help. 

           The Governors pales, looks to Kimball. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Does this mean... Is he still in 
                        your head? 
           Kimball closes her eyes as if to listen... 

                                 LENNY
                             (whispers)
                        ...cut your wrists and watch you 
                        bleed. And then I’ll... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Yes. He’s still here.

           Governor Park stands up. Walks to the window. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Can you prove any of this? 

           Judd and Kimball each take turns shaking their heads, no. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK (CONT'D)
                        So who’s the killer here? The non-
                        existent twin with the mental 
                        capacity of a 10 year old, or the 
                        psycho twin that can’t be placed at 
                        any of the crime scenes?  

           He waits for a response. Finally, 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Howie wouldn’t hurt anyone. If you 
                        talk to him, you’ll see that. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        How would I know I was talking to 
                        him at all? 

                                 KIMBALL
                        He’s not like Lenny. He’s kind, 
                        childlike.  

                                 JUDD
                        In a way, Howie wasn’t even there.

                                 KIMBALL
                        That’s right. It was Lenny the 
                        whole time. Lenny’s guilty. 

           The Governor thinks about this. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK
                        Here’s what we’re going to do. 
                        You’re going to destroy that 
                        machine and any records you’ve been 
                        keeping. 

           He points at Kimball. 
                                 GOVERNOR PARK (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to sign a medical 
                        evaluation stating Lenny Hayes is 
                        of sound mind now AND was so even 
                        at the time of the crimes.  

           Then to Judd. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK (CONT'D)
                        You’ll be transferring to another 
                        unit. Pick one.

           They both nod in acknowledgment. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK (CONT'D)
                        And next week, Lenny Hayes will be 
                        executed by lethal injection. 

           He tosses over his copy of the report. 

                                 GOVERNOR PARK (CONT'D)
                        And then we bury this 6ft under. 

           EXT. GRANVILLE ADOPTION AGENCY - DAY

           The steel black gates are shut. 

           A chain is fitted through the bars, it’s padlocked shut. 

           EXT. NELLIES HOUSE - DAY

           Kimball and Riley hold hands and wave to Nellie as they walk 
           from the porch, a couple of bags in their arms. 

           Nellie wipes a happy tear and watches them go. 

           INT. EASTERN STATE PRISON - DAY

           Lenny is escorted out of a cell. He’s walked past other 
           inmates who YELL and JEER at him.

           A door opens, inside is a medical chair. Lenny stands at the 
           entrance, he slowly walks in. 

           INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT. MENTAL INSTITUTION - CONT. 

           HOWIE sits on a couch. He clings to a pillow and sobs. 
           LENNY

           is strapped down to the medical chair. 

           A nurse swabs his arm with alcohol. 

           He rests his head back, as a JUDGE reads him the verdict.

           HOWIE

           rocks back and forth, tears stream down his face. 

           LENNY

           tries to whistle Buffalo Gals and fails. 

           Closes his eyes. 

           Rests his head back.

                                 LENNY 
                        Goodbye little brother.

           He exhales as the doctor inserts the lethal dose into his IV.

           The heart rate monitor flatlines. 

           HOWIE

           howls as he clutches his pillow, heaving two heavy sobs into 
           it. He knows his brother is gone... 

           A couple of SOCIAL WORKERS rub his back.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER 1
                        You want to watch a movie or 
                        something? 

                                 SOCIAL WORKER 2
                        We can put on “It’s a Wonderful 
                        Life” if you want?

           Howie shakes his head, wipes his tears. 

                                 HOWIE
                        No. I just want to go to my room. 

           They come and take Howie’s arm. 

           FROM A DISTANCE:

           Judd watches as they turn and walk down the corridor with 
           Howie to the exit. 
           INT. MENTAL INSTITUTION - HOWIE’S NEW ROOM - CONT. 

           The staff member opens the door for Howie and he goes 
           straight to the bed. 

           The door closes, leaving just a small vertical window for us 
           to see him through. 

           He lays on his bed. 

           Puts his hands behind his head. 

           With a smile... 

           He begins to whistle... 

           EXT. NELLIE’S HOUSE - CONT. 

           Kimball stops dead in her tracks. 

                                 RILEY
                        What’s wrong, Mommy?

           She turns, the faint tune of “Buffalo Gals” in her head... 

                                 KIMBALL
                        Oh my God... 

                                                                CUT TO:

                                                                 BLACK.

                                                                   END.
