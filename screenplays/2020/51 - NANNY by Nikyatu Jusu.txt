           INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - DAY

           THE SOUND OF WATER RUNNING, unfettered, unencumbered--perhaps 
           overflowing...

           We creep through a longish hallway littered with doorways and 
           framed pictures. In these pictures are various poses of a 
           PERFECT UPPER EAST SIDE FAMILY comprised of a WHITE COUPLE 
           [30’s] and their angelic BABY BOY [4].

           At the foot of one doorway, shards of light refract like 
           luminescent knives off a pool of blood. We float past...

           A faintly discernible larger than life arachnid shadow ambles 
           along hallway walls.

           Whispers. Barely discernible--then louder emanate from--

           An AFRO-DOMINICAN WOMAN [45], at the end of the hallway. Her 
           back is to us. She’s frantic. Desperate.

           She presses a phone to her ear--in her other hand: a top of 
           the line, bloody, French Laguiole steak knife. 

           She stumbles through tears.

                                 AFRO DOMINICAN WOMAN
                            (spanish)
                        I...don’t know. I don’t know what 
                        happened. I was tired. Confused. It 
                        wasn’t the boy. It was something 
                        else--

           An INHUMAN GROAN echoes just behind her. She freezes, turning 
           slowly and we see her face for the first time: palpable fear. 

           Defense scratches etch her face. 

           A SMALL SPIDER emerges from her ear, making its way across 
           her cheek.  

           She drops the bloody phone as she faces an ANIMALISTIC WAIL.

           She raises the knife to her own neck... 

           INT. CATERING HALL - DAY 

           A KNIFE HACKS into a MEWLING GOAT’S neck. Blood erupts from a 
           carotid artery forming crimson pools on concrete. 

           Steaming slabs of roasted meat pass between hands, piled in 
           chafing dishes.

           We follow AISHA [26], eyeing the nape of her neck as she 
           saunters into the bustle. She’s dressed in traditional 
           African wear. Her profile grants us a look at a jarringly 
           pretty dark skinned woman with the eyes of a griot in a 
           youthful face.

           An AFRICAN WOMAN carrying a brimming pan of food darts past 
           as Aisha surveys the space. 

           A sign strung on a wall reads: “HAPPY 6th BIRTHDAY ROMANO”. 
           Ribbons and balloons hang haphazardly. West African music 
           blares from speakers.

           Aisha places a carefully wrapped box in a pile of gifts--each 
           distinct wrapping paper an ode from its gift giver. 

                                 WOMAN
                        AISHA!

           SALLAY [30], bright eyed with a permanently mischievous grin 
           bee-lines towards Aisha. Her bright red blush matches her 
           crimson lipstick. 

                                 AISHA
                        As late as I am they’re still 
                        setting up?

                                 SALLAY 
                        You know how things go. Time is the 
                        white man’s invention. 

           Sallay envelopes Aisha in a warm hug.

                                 SALLAY (CONT'D)
                        Sierra Leoneans know how to party. 
                        Guess who’s coming? Idris Elba! 
                        He’s my friend’s cousin. 

           Sallay whisks Aisha away, enveloping her in infectious 
           energy. 

           INT. CATERING HALL - CAKE CUTTING ROOM - DAY

           ROMANO [6 today], an effusive child sits at the helm of a 
           table flanked by COUSINS and FRIENDS. Children wear various 
           superhero party masks,stark American contrasts colliding with 
           continental flair. 

           A multi-tiered cake is placed before Romano aglow with six 
           candles. 

           Taking in the scene from her perch, Aisha smiles to herself 
           observing the boy’s contagious joy. Fire dances in his eyes.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Revelry plays in slow motion as the crowd rises in a Happy 
           Birthday song. Some sing the African version. 

                                 CROWD
                        Appy birtday to you! Appy birtday 
                        to you! Everybody like you! 
                        Everybody like you!

           Romano leans in to blow out his candles.

           Aisha closes her eyes and inhales, making a silent wish 
           alongside the boy. 

           She opens her eyes. 

           In Romano’s place sits another child--the one we will come to 
           know as KOFI [6], Aisha’s son. 

           Kofi grants Aisha a dazzling smile before blowing out candles 
           with all his might. 

           Back to reality, Aisha watches Romano bounce in his chair. 

           INT. CATERING HALL - DANCEFLOOR - EVENING 

           THE IDRIS ELBA enters the party as AUNTIES REGALE him with 
           money--pressing it to his face and upper body, scooping up 
           bills as they hit the floor, only to begin the cycle again. 

           He revels in the attention as women crowd around him in 
           celebration. A throng of PARTYGOERS fill the dance floor.

           Sallay and Aisha dance the night away, testing their maturing  
           knees as they literally hit the floor. 

           Prince Nico Mbarga’s, “Sweet Mother” blasts from speakers: 

                                 SONG
                        Sweet mother I no go forget you for 
                        de suffer weh you suffer for me, 
                        yea...

           INT. MOVING TRAIN - NIGHT

           Still draped in her traditional African wear, Aisha stares 
           ahead. Her body sways with the train’s movement. 

           The black canvas of the subway window behind her seems to 
           pulsate as the train speeds ahead.

           A WOMAN’S STERN VOICE slices through silence:

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 CARIBBEAN WOMAN (VO)
                        They seem nice enough. Grandmother 
                        was caring for the child, had to go 
                        leave NY. Your immigration status 
                        don’t matter. You will be their 
                        first Nanny.

                                 AISHA (VO) 
                        Do they know?

                                 CARIBBEAN WOMAN(VO)
                        No. Don’t tell them. They need to
                        feel you are only focused on their 
                        child--that nothing will distract 
                        you. Chloe is the most important 
                        thing. You hear?

                                 AISHA(VO) 
                        Yes. 

                                 CARIBBEAN WOMAN (VO)
                        They prefer someone young, so
                        that works in your favor. And you 
                        speak French fluently? Another 
                        plus. You’ve been in America how 
                        long?

                                 AISHA (VO) 
                        Almost one year. 

                                 WOMAN (VO)
                        You’re too smart to braid hair all
                        day. The money is better here. They 
                        have no experience so it’s a fresh 
                        start for you and them. No family 
                        is perfect. Be nice. Do your job. 
                        You will be fine...

           We push in on Aisha, like a painting--perfectly composed in 
           the melody of the darkness enveloping her.

           RISING BEEP BEEP BEEP of a phone alarm echoes.

           INT. APARTMENT - AISHA’S ROOM - HARLEM - DAY 

           Aisha, buried in a twin sized bed pressed against a wall, 
           opens her eyes and darts out of bed. 

           We scan her room: quaint as to be expected, but not without 
           brush strokes of style. Shards of African fabric peek from 
           nooks. A small pile of books nestle in a corner of the room.

           Pictures encased in baroque frames intimate a life before 
           this. 

           In one photo Aisha grins happily with a boy in her arms. Her 
           mini me: KOFI.

           We see a collection of knick knacks. Toys. Trinkets. Boy’s 
           Clothes. Pictures. Images of Kofi smiling, dancing, 
           playing...A shrine dedicated to his impending arrival in 
           America. 

           Tangible reminders of why she’s here. 

           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 

           Aisha puts on makeup as an attempted WhatsApp video call 
           rings endlessly--just as she's about to give up an image 
           flashes on the screen: 

           A WOMAN: blurry but decipherable. Her name, we will learn, is 
           MARIATOU. She’s approximately Aisha’s age. 

           They alternate between their tribal language and English. 

                                 MARIATOU
                        Hello, Hello, Aisha--

           Aisha holds the phone up. 

                                 AISHA
                        Yes! Mariatou? Hello?

           Jumbled conversation of people in distant lands struggling to 
           communicate, words tumbling on top of each other, delayed 
           seconds of understanding--

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Can you hear me?

                                 MARIATOU
                        Loud and clear! 

                                 AISHA
                        Is Kofi near you?

                                 MARIATOU
                        You know your son is slippery. Hold 
                        on...

           Aisha waits for what feels like an eternity. She watches as 
           Mariatou scurries off screen, then
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           KOFI. In digital flesh. Aisha visibly softens at the sight 
           and sound of him.

                                 KOFI 
                        Hi mamma!

                                 AISHA
                        Kofi, my baby. Are you being a good 
                        boy? Aunty Mariatou tells me you’re 
                        not listening. 

                                 KOFI 
                        She’s lying.  

                                 AISHA
                        Ah Ah! You call your aunty a liar? 

           Kofi shakes his head no. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        I heard you went to Musa’s birthday 
                        party. Was it fun? 

                                 KOFI
                        They had so much food. I ate too 
                        much. 

                                 AISHA
                        Is there anything you want to tell 
                        me?

           Kofi pretends not to hear his mother. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Hello. Kofi, did you bite Musa?

                                 KOFI
                        He took my toy!

                                 AISHA
                        I don’t want to hear about anymore 
                        trouble. When you come we will have 
                        so many toys you won’t want 
                        anymore. 

                                 KOFI
                        Ok...will it be cold?

                                 AISHA
                        Very cold. There will be snow on 
                        the ground. Remember the pictures I 
                        sent you.

                                 KOFI 
                        White cotton candy. 

           Aisha laughs. 

                                 AISHA
                        White cotton candy. I will have a 
                        very warm coat waiting for you. 
                        When you come to New York we’ll go 
                        to Ray’s Pizza. Kofi it’s the best 
                        pizza you will ever have...

                                 KOFI
                        When will we go to the beach?

                                 AISHA
                        When it’s hot. The water is not as 
                        clear...

           Kofi is distracted. He talks to someone off screen. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Kofi, I’m talking to you. We don’t 
                        have much time. 

           Kofi’s voice dissipates into a crackling sound. His image 
           freezes on screen. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Kofi? Hello? Kofi...

           Aisha stares at Kofi’s frozen image. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know if you hear me but 
                        I’ll see you soon, my love. 

           INT. APARTMENT - HARLEM - DAY 

           The apartment is unveiled in all it’s tiny glory. A living 
           room seamlessly tumbles into a kitchen, which bumps into a 
           bathroom. Indistinct boundaries of cramped spaces. 

           Dressed and ready to go, Aisha tucks food in a backpack.

           She pauses at a slightly ajar door. 

                                 AISHA
                        I’m leaving now.
                            (Beat)
                        Aunty, are you here?

           Silence. She’s not. Aisha darts out of the apartment.

           INT. SERIES OF TRAIN STATIONS - MORNING

           --A train arrives. Aisha gets on, sandwiched between a sea of 
           bodies. Music emanating from her headphones insulates her 
           from the raging city around her. 

           --Aisha climbs up a flight of steps, weaving in and out of 
           bodies in an attempt to hustle to the next train. 

           --AN OLDER BLACK WOMAN standing at a platform across from 
           Aisha is barely discernible behind the barreling train that, 
           rather than stopping, flies through the station. 

           Her stare fixates on Aisha. Aisha notices her briefly. 

           The woman is gone when the train passes

           --Aisha walks alongside a train as it arrives, angling for a 
           good seat.

           EXT. 19 STORY DOORMAN BUILDING - UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

           Aisha enters, peeling away from the crowd of commuters. 

           INT. 19 STORY DOORMAN BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

           Her gaze lands on a DOOR MAN [31] behind the desk. He double 
           takes, standing up instinctively, allowing her to take all of 
           him in--muscly, lithe, formidable. 

           This man, cognizant of his beauty, is MALIK: fully aware of 
           his effect on Women...and men.  He flashes a pearly smile 
           meant solely for Aisha. 

           She pulls out her passport before he can ask for I.D. He 
           studies it. 

                                 MALIK
                        I-SHA. New Nanny for the HAVS 
                        right? You know where you goin’? 

                                 AISHA
                        Yes. Thank you. 

           Aisha tucks away her passport, makes her way to the 
           elevators...

           INT. 19 STORY DOORMAN BUILDING - ELEVATOR 

           Aisha stares at her reflection in the mirrored elevator doors 
           as she ascends. She glides chapstick over her lips. 

           INT./EXT. HAV CONDO - DAY

           AMY [36], opens the door. An ageless beauty belying a tightly 
           wound undercurrent of nerves. 

                                 AMY
                        Aisha! Welcome. 

           INT. HAV CONDO - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY

           Amy studies Aisha as she takes off her shoes and unloads her 
           bag. 

           We see the condo in all its glory: sterile, modern, spacious. 
           Lower upper class by New York standards, relative wealth by 
           national standards. A pristine box encased in floor to 
           ceiling windows.

           Aisha knowingly makes her way to the... 

           KITCHEN SINK

           She washes her hands meticulously. The women grant each other 
           tight, but warm smiles. 

                                 AMY
                        How was the commute? 

                                 AISHA
                        Not too bad. 

                                 AMY
                        Great! These are for you.

           Amy presses condo keys into Aisha’s palm. Aisha closes her 
           hand around them. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Now that it’s official let me give 
                        you the full tour... 

           Aisha trails Amy--her eyes swimming with curiosity as she 
           takes in the impressive space more closely this time. 

           Contemporary Art riddles walls traveling up sky high 
           ceilings. Various exotic house plants sprinkle the clinical 
           space with life.

           A Bird of Paradise plant sprawls upwards, branches reaching 
           out for dear life among schefflera amate and monstera plants.

           The inhabitants of this space are collectors of resplendent, 
           peculiar things.

           INT. GUEST BATHROOM 

           Amy flicks on a light. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        All yours. Nothing fancy. 

           Aisha peeks in. Quite fancy, actually. 

           Amy points at a door. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Chloe’s room. Little diva should be 
                        up soon. 

           GUEST BEDROOM

           From inside the room, we watch the door float open. Though 
           sparse, it’s spacious. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        For overnights. Please, please make 
                        this space yours. Bring whatever 
                        you need to feel at home: pictures, 
                        books, your favorite pillow. Just 
                        one small request: no candles or 
                        incense. Chloe’s hyper sensitive to 
                        certain smells. 

           A tight smile from Amy. Aisha returns it. 

                                 AISHA
                            (searching)
                        So many windows. 
                            (Beat)
                        Please remind me of the overnight 
                        rate. 

                                 AMY
                        Right. Yes. Chloe sleeps like a log 
                        once she has her bath so we’ll 
                        start with a flat rate: 150? 

                                 AISHA
                        (unsure, no blueprint)
                        Sure. That’s fine.

                                 AMY
                        Awesome. 

           They pass a slightly ajar door...

           Aisha furtively peeks through the sliver of access. A 30x45 
           FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of a WAILING AFRICAN WOMAN slumped on her 
           knees SCREAMS back at Aisha. The image is mesmerizing--
           whoever exists behind the lens is clearly skilled. 

           Amy closes the door abruptly. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Adam’s office. We civilians aren’t 
                        allowed. 

           They return to the... 

           INT. CONDO LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                 AMY
                        Chloe hasn’t stopped talking about 
                        you. She’s already obsessed. 

                                 AISHA 
                        She’s a sweet girl. 

           Amy slides a binder towards Aisha. 

                                 AMY
                        Don’t feel overwhelmed. Think of 
                        this as a loose guide: basic 
                        schedule, emergency contacts, a 
                        list of where things are...

           Aisha peruses the meticulous multi tabbed planner. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        All phone numbers you’ll ever need. 
                        Even her therapist...some blank 
                        pages for you to fill in and make 
                        it yours...

           Aisha lingers on a tentative schedule with end times “TBD”.

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you. 

           Amy gathers her belongings, willing herself to leave. 

                                 AMY
                        Ok...

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           She lingers a beat too long. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Is this weird? It’s kinda weird. Is 
                        that ok to say out loud? 

                                 AISHA
                        Everything will be fine.

           Amy approaches Aisha. 

                                 AMY
                        Can I?

           Amy dives in for the embrace anyway, wrapping herself around 
           Aisha. Aisha hugs her back. 

           INT. CHLOE'S ROOM - DAY

           CHLOE [5], a blonde haired blue eyed cherubic bundle of 
           cheeks. Dead asleep to the world. Aisha watches her for some 
           time. Stiff. Arms folded like a little corpse.

           Aisha checks the girl’s breath, her finger hovering just 
           below Chloe’s nose, feeling her exhalations. 

           Chloe’s long lashes flutter open.

                                 CHLOE
                        Aisha, you’re back!

           She springs into her outstretched arms, burrowing into Aisha. 

                                 AISHA
                        Salut petit amour.

           INT. CONDO - KITCHEN - DAY

           A FRIDGE OPENS meticulously organized with labels, color 
           coded stickies-- 

           “gluten free”, 

           "fermented kimchee - do not touch", 

           "help yourself"...etc. 

           Aisha scans the fridge landing on a pre-packaged meal labeled 
           “CHLOE”.

                                                              CUT TO:

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Settled in a kiddie chair with personalized plastic utensils, 
           Chloe turns her face defiantly away from an approaching spoon 
           of organic, gluten free slop.

                                 CHLOE
                        No.

                                 AISHA
                        Your mommy made this just for you. 
                        Don't you want to eat the healthy 
                        food Mommy made?

                                 CHLOE
                        I don’t want it.

                        Encore en français. Again in

                                 AISHA
                        Pas.

                                 CHLOE
                        PAH!

                                 CHLOE (CONT'D)
                        What does that mean?

                                 AISHA
                        I don’t want. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Je ne veux pas!

           Aisha holds her hand out for a high five. Chloe leaps up 
           eagerly, slapping Aisha’s hand. 

                                 AISHA 
                        Good girl! Ok...

           Aisha looks at the slop, braces herself, and shoves a 
           spoonful into her mouth. 

           Fighting her gag reflex, she forces a pained smile as she 
           swallows.

                        Mmm. Yum.

           Chloe giggles at Aisha's pathetic performance. Shakes her 
           head no. She watches Aisha unpack her own carefully packaged 
           lunch: rice, stew, plantains. Chloe sniffs the air 
           dramatically. She squinches her nose, curious. 

           The two are in a stare off. Aisha finally relents. 

           She scoops a tiny morsel of jollof rice onto a spoon and 
           hovers it before Chloe who snaps it up like a baby alligator.

           Chloe’s eyes light up. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           Chloe dances happily. She scoops a large spoonful of rice off 
           Aisha's plate into her mouth. 

           Aisha does the same. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Happy now? C’est délicieux?

           Chloe nods.

                                 CHLOE
                        Say deli-see-you.

           As though in defiance, Chloe grabs another mouthful off 
           Aisha's plate.

           EXT. UNION SQUARE - FARMER'S MARKET - DAY

           A sea of bodies flow through the open market. Aisha fights 
           upstream. Chloe is hoisted on her hip, arm wrapped around 
           Aisha’s neck, as Aisha pushes the stroller.

           Aisha lingers at a seafood stall. She points at a fat 
           branzino fish.

                                 AISHA
                        The receipt please. Yes. Thank you. 

           Another stall. Aisha receives a loaf of bread, adds it to her 
           brimming stroller. She holds Chloe with her other arm.

           A bouquet of roses floats from a seller's hand to Aisha's. 

           She adds them to the stroller. 

           The seller gives her a receipt without her asking. 

           Her arms are brimming now. She places Chloe down and crosses 
           off a final item on a handwritten list.

           SHRILL RING of a phone.

           INT. CONDO - DAY 

           Aisha rummages for her cell.

           She sees a face-time call from 'AMY' on the screen, deflating 
           a bit as she accepts the call. Chloe, glued to her ipad, is 
           lost in her own world. 

                                 AMY 
                        Hi Girls! What are you two up to?

                                 AISHA
                        We’re in the middle of French 
                        lessons. 

                                 AMY 
                        Did Chloe finish her food?

                                 AISHA
                        Every last drop.

           Off the cell phone screen Aisha extends her pinkie to Chloe 
           who hooks her pinkie finger in Aisha’s, promising to keep 
           their culinary adventure a secret. 

                                 AMY
                        Thank god. Picky doesn’t even begin 
                        to describe that child’s eating 
                        habits. Adam gets here sooner than 
                        expected so I’ll need your help 
                        getting everything together 
                        tomorrow. Can’t wait for him to 
                        meet you!

                                 AISHA
                        Looking forward. 

                                 AMY
                        Give me kiss,Chloe!
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Aisha holds the phone up for Amy to see her daughter 
           pantomime a kiss. Chloe’s gaze is still transfixed on her 
           ipad.

                                 CHLOE
                        Aw wava (au revoir), Mommy. 

                                 AMY
                        See you soon girlies. 

                                 AISHA
                        See you. 

           Aisha cups her chin, momentarily lost elsewhere. Chloe 
           mirrors her body language. Aisha forces a smile, putting a 
           thread of Chloe's hair behind her ear.

           INT. CONDO - GUEST BATHROOM - DAY

           Aisha stands over Chloe as she washes her hands.

                                 CHLOE
                        My booty burns.

                                 AISHA
                        No more African food for you. 

                                 CHLOE
                        But I like it!

           Chloe sleepily rubs her eyes. 

                                 AISHA
                        Wash your hands properly.

           Aisha is momentarily distracted by a flickering sconce. 

           A droplet of water falls on her face. She looks up to see...

           A SMALL WATER STAIN in the ceiling of the immaculate 
           bathroom. 

           She fixates on the stain until--

                                 CHLOE
                        What’s wrong?

           Aisha looks at Chloe, then back at the water stain. 

                                 AISHA
                        Rien. Nothing, mon amour.

           INT. CONDO - EVENING

           Aisha wipes off kitchen counters. She glances at a clock. The 
           minute hand ticks. 7pm.  Her phone is painfully silent. 

           She flips through her work binder to a blank page, scribbling 
           the date and her hours 8am-7pm.

           The sound of KEYS JANGLING grants a reprieve. Amy barrels 
           into the apartment.

                                 AMY
                        Sorry I’m late! Things got crazy. 

           As bubbly as Aisha can muster--

                                 AISHA
                        It’s ok. Chloe is in bed. 

                                 AMY
                        Everything was smooth. No tantrums?  

                                 AISHA
                        None at all. 

                                 AMY
                        You kept all the receipts?

           Aisha flips to a nook in the binder with carefully paper-
           clipped receipts. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        You are amazing.

           Reciprocal smiles. Aisha gathers her belongings. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        One more thing. Sorry for the last 
                        minute request but can you do an 
                        overnight tomorrow? Things will 
                        probably go late. We agreed on 100 
                        for overnights right?

           Aisha hesitates. 

                                 AISHA

                                 AMY
                        Yes. 150.

           INT. 19 STORY DOORMAN BUILDING - ELEVATOR - EVENING 

           Aisha stares at her reflection in the mirrored elevator doors 
           as she descends. She wipes sleep from her eyes.

           INT. 19 STORY DOORMAN BUILDING - LOBBY - EVENING

           POV SECURITY MONITORS: Aisha’s pixelated black and white 
           image exits the elevator. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           Her eyes search for Malik, but all she sees is an empty chair 
           at the doorman’s post--swiveling slowly as though moved by 
           some phantom body.

           She explodes into the bustling city air, exhaling for what 
           feels like the first time all day.

                                 KOFI (O.S.)
                        Mamma is in the computer.

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - AISHA’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Laughter emanates from a phone--

                                 MARIATOU (O.S.) 
                        Noooo Kofi!

                                 KOFI (O.S.) 
                        She in America. Hi Mommy! Sing AYO 
                        NENE.

           Aisha, sprawled on her bed stares at a pre-recorded video of 
           her son. She loops it back. We see phone imagery--faces that 
           accompany the voices. 

           Kofi’s bright face dances on the phone screen. 

                                 KOFI  (CONT'D)
                        Mamma is in the computer.

                                 MARIATOU
                        Nooo Kofi!

                        She in America. Hi Mommy! Sing AYO 
                        NENE.

           As though responding to Kofi in the flesh, Aisha sleepily 
           sings a lullaby, AYO NENE--rocking herself to sleep.

                            (tribal language)
                        Oh my baby, my little baby, who can 
                        calm you down? Oh my baby, my 
                        little baby who can calm you down 
                        and bring you to Saloum--

           Just outside her door, Aisha hears movement. She pops her 
           head out. 

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           AUNTY SARAH [55], dressed in nurse scrubs, wearily shuffles 
           out of the apartment. A ragged breath escapes her as though 
           steeling herself for the long shift ahead.

                                 AISHA
                        Do you need anything, Aunty?

                                 AUNTY SARAH
                        Toilet tissue. We’re almost out. 
                            (remembering)
                        How was it?

                                 AISHA
                        They seem nice. 

                                 AUNTY SARAH
                        Work hard to keep it. Jobs like 
                        that aren’t falling from the sky. 

                                 AISHA
                        Good night...

           But she’s already out the door. 

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - AISHA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Aisha’s heavy lids finally close. Phone in hand. We zoom into 
           the looping recorded imagery of Kofi until the individual 
           pixels hold the screen hostage. 

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Wet feet step out of the shower. 

           A hand wipes steam off of a mirror. 

           Aisha stares at her reflection, a towel wrapped around her 
           damp body. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Invasive whispers of a woman calling her name forces her to 
           turn towards the bathroom door, away from the mirror. 

                                 AISHA
                        Aunty?

           Her reflection in the mirror--its back still to us--stands 
           eerily still in spite of Aisha turning to face herself. Her 
           eyes widen...a twinge of dread plucking at her belly. Her 
           reflection lingers backwards, beads of water forming on its 
           moist shoulders. 

           Aisha retreats as the mirror figure slowly turns to face her, 
           its nebulous features coming into view. 

           Aisha readies a scream...

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - AISHA’S ROOM - DAY

           ...that never comes. She breathlessly darts awake. Panting. 
           Remembering the nightmare. 

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Aisha wipes the fogged mirror. She studies her reflection. 
           Turns away and back, as though trying to catch her image in 
           rebellion. 

           She laughs at herself. It was just a nightmare after all. 

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - AISHA'S ROOM - DAY

           ANGLE ON a duffel bag: A pair of clothes. Panties. Shoes 
           wrapped in an old grocery bag. 

           Aisha eyes her favorite pillow. Brings it with her. 

           She grabs a framed image of Kofi, sliding the photo from 
           glass and tucking it into her bag before leaving. 

           INT. 19 STORY DOORMAN BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

           Aisha passes Malik, offering him a good morning wave as he 
           signs in a VISITOR. 

                                 MALIK
                        No one told me we were having a 
                        sleepover!

           Aisha, eyes twinkling in response, slips through elevator 
           doors just before they close. 

                                 AMY (VO)
                        Caterers will be there around 5...

           INT. CONDO - VARIOUS ROOMS - EARLY EVENING

           --Aisha opens the door for CATERERS.

           --Aisha helps lay out platters of food. She glances at her 
           phone.

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        ...Make sure Chloe is dressed. She 
                        knows what she wants to wear...I 
                        just want everything as close to 
                        perfect as possible for him.

           --Chloe twirls in front of a mirror in a sparkly tutu and 
           pink cowboy boots.

           --Aisha guides a PREGNANT LATINA CLEANER to the bathroom.

           --Aisha runs through the house with Chloe on her back. Chloe 
           laughs, clinging to Aisha for dear life. 

           INT. CONDO - CHLOE'S ROOM - EVENING

           Aisha playfully dumps Chloe in her bed and the two sprawl on 
           their backs alongside each other, gleefully exhausted. 

           A KNOCK.

           Aisha props herself up as Amy enters. Amy’s steely expression 
           expands into a warm smile too quickly. 

                                 AMY
                        You two are having fun.  

           Aisha squeezes Chloe's arm, whispers in her ear. 

                                 AISHA
                        Go to Mommy.

           A twitch in Amy's saccharine smile as Chloe flops back on the 
           bed passive aggressively. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m tired.

           Aisha stands, making room for Amy to sit beside her daughter. 
           As Amy swaps with Aisha she gently squeezes Aisha's hand.

                                 AMY
                        Don’t go far. 

           Aisha leaves the two, catching a fleeting moment of Amy 
           clinically smelling strands of Chloe’s hair...

                                                              CUT TO:

           The Pregnant Latina, dangerously pregnant to be engaging in 
           physical labor, vacuums an opulent rug. 

           Our gaze lingers on her a beat too long. She looks up, 
           locking eyes with Aisha. 

           Aisha smiles. Looks away. Shame blooms under her skin--caught 
           in the act of pity, or projection...

           INT. CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING

           Aisha, settled in a loveseat, tries not to look directly at 
           Amy's half naked reflection in a mirror. 

           Her eyes flick across the room, resting on various curated 
           portraits of the All American Family: Amy, Adam and Chloe--
           poised like artfully designed photos you’d see in a TIME 
           magazine spread...

                                 AMY
                        ...it’s my fault. I should have 
                        told you. There’s always so much 
                        going on at work now. My brain is 
                        in a million different places...

           Amy balances a glass of red wine in one hand as she slides 
           her naked body into a dress in a 

           WALK IN CLOSET OFFSHOOT.

           Amy is like a moth. Frantic. Evanescent. Perpetually in 
           multiple places at once. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        No worries. I have the perfect 
                        dress. 

           Amy explodes from her closet. Poised. Manicured. 

           She presses a dress against Aisha’s frame.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        I swear red was made for your skin. 
                        Mahogany red, Imperial red, Wine 
                        red, the whole family. Speaking of 
                        wine--

           Amy knocks back what’s left in her glass. 

           INT. CONDO - GUEST BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Washcloth drenched in running water. 

           Aisha hits her hot spots with the damp washcloth, giving 
           herself a whore’s bath: armpits, neck, between her legs.

           Aisha turns to face the blood red dress hanging on the 
           bathroom door, its extravagance beckoning Aisha. 

           She slides into it. 

           In spite of her ambivalence, Aisha can’t deny she looks 
           stunning. She eyes her form in the mirror, snapping a selfie 
           to capture the moment. 

           Something moves in her periphery. She looks up. The water 
           stain is more formidable now: expanded into a weblike 
           fissure. 

           INT. CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM

           Amy zips Aisha into the dress with finality. It clings to her 
           every curve for dear life--a complimentary second skin.

           Amy places her hands on Aisha’s hips to turn her around. 

                                 AMY
                        I could never...

                                 AISHA
                        A little tight. 

                                 AMY
                        Isn’t that the point?

           Amy kisses Aisha on both cheeks and grants her a wink as she 
           floats by.

           The RISING MURMUR of a dinner party well underway SWELLS TO A 
           CRESCENDO.

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Shrouded in the shadows, lingering in the space where the 
           living room meets the hallway, Aisha takes in the gathering.

           FOUR HANDSOME COUPLES in their late 30’s, early 40's.

           Aisha hones in on the sole Black body in the white space: a 
           pretty CARAMEL SKINNED AMERICAN WOMAN framed by a nest of 
           natural hair.

           The Woman's ease and grace is palpable. She throws her head 
           back in laughter. 

           Then Amy, a little too drunk a little too soon. Aisha catches 
           slivers of their conversation. 

                                 AMY
                        ...When are we getting another book 
                        out of you?!

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        Oh honey, stay tuned. The 
                        apocalypse is not exactly a salve 
                        for my writer’s block... 

           Aisha studies the carefree Black woman who catches her 
           staring and grants her a genuine smile. Aisha smiles back. 

           Chloe emerges from the shadows. She wraps her arms around 
           Aisha's legs, stubbornly fighting sleep.

           Aisha scoops Chloe up. Chloe presses her head against Aisha’s 
           warm chest, inhaling her scent. 

           INT. CONDO - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Aisha watches Chloe sneakily drink a cup of juice bigger than 
           her head as the gathering buzzes around her. 

                                 AMY
                        Lights off!

           Chloe perks up, searching for Aisha in the revelry. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Daddy’s here!

           The gathering collapses in a hush. Lights expire descending 
           everyone into darkness. 

           A sliver of light cuts into the room as Amy slides out.
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           MUFFLED VOICES behind the door. A sharp conversation 
           discernible in pieces.

           Aisha hears her own breath.

                                 MAN 
                        ...No. Don't...

                                 AMY 
                        Seriously?

                                 MAN 
                        Are you drunk?

                                 AMY 
                        Drunk is relative...

                                 MAN
                        Give me a sec...
                            (beat)
                        Can I at least wash my fucking 
                        hands first? Go inside 
                        please...Stop.

           The door OPENS and SLAMS.

           A festoon of light. Everyone instinctively yells-

                                 EVERYONE
                        SURPRISE!

           But it’s just Amy. Alone. 

           She strolls to a nearby table and refills her empty wine 
           glass. Moments behind her...

           ADAM [37]. Rugged. Weary. A bundle of repressed emotion 
           comforted by a mask of logic. 

           Genuine surprise drains his face as he drops his bags, taking  
           in the small crowd.

                                 AMY
                        Surprise.

                                 CHLOE 
                        Daddy!

           Chloe leaps from Aisha’s arms, sprinting to her father. The 
           room buzzes with renewed vigor. He immediately wears a mask 
           of civility belying an impatience reserved for Amy. 

           Adam embraces familiar faces, making the rounds. He was 
           missed.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Adam hoists Chloe in his arms, whispering in her ear. Chloe 
           giggles as he places her down. He reveals a thin hardcover 
           book brought back from his travels--hands it to Chloe. She 
           clutches it tightly. 

           Adam notices Aisha just before a CHUBBY GUY tackles him in a 
           bear hug. Amy looks on with a scowl as Adam effortlessly 
           charms the room.

           INT. CONDO - CHLOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Chloe is fast asleep, clinging to Aisha like a koala. Aisha 
           sits on the edge of her bed, painstakingly peeling the girl 
           off her body without waking her. 

           She still clutches the book Adam gave her: Anansi the Spider: 
           A Tale from the Ashanti by Gerald McDermott.

           Aisha plucks the book from Chloe’s hand. She studies it, 
           flipping through its pages. 

           A CORNER OF CHLOE’S ROOM...

           A SHELF OF TEEMING WITH CHILDREN’S BOOKS FROM AROUND THE 
           WORLD. Aisha’s fingers scan the books. She wedges Chloe’s new 
           book in between books. 

           Nearby her eye catches an ever so slight movement. Something 
           mechanical hiding between stuffed animals.

           She walks closer to see a NANNY CAM.

           The head swivels as she moves, tracking her. Aisha bristles 
           at the discovery.

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Adam balances Amy on his lap. She’s DRUNK drunk and he’s jet-
           lagged but catching his second wind. 

           The star couple regales a CIRCLE OF FRIENDS, all engaged in 
           rapt attention as they dance through the quagmire of various 
           levels of intoxication. 

                                 CHUBBY GUY
                        How long are we graced with your 
                        presence this time?

                                 ADAM
                        A while.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 FRIEND 1
                        So your wife can finally give mine 
                        back. 

                                 AMY 
                        She likes me better. 

                                 FRIEND 1
                        Sold to the highest bidder! 

           Laughter. Knowing glances. Friend 1’s wife is the Black 
           American woman Aisha admired before...

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        Money can’t buy love, darling. If 
                        it did I’d still be on the shelf. 

           Amy leans into Adam. Wet lips graze his ear. 

                                 AMY
                        Did it buy yours yet?

           Adam dodges Amy’s wine kiss, granting her a paternal peck on 
           the forehead. 

                                 CHUBBY GUY
                        How you feeling about this trip? 

                                 ADAM
                        What’s stunning is that worldwide 
                        people are protesting the same 
                        things. The goal is to bring the 
                        brutality of those people’s 
                        experiences back in a way that even 
                        the most hardened people can--

                                 CHUBBY GUY
                        Ok save the PC bullshit. How does 
                        burning shit down and looting 
                        stores help their cause? This is 
                        not a rhetorical question.

           A nudge from the Chubby Guy’s wife abbreviates his 
           commentary. 

                                 AMY
                        Can we focus on the peaceful 
                        protestors though, like what 
                        they’re fighting for? They are 
                        people who matter, not theoretical 
                        talking points.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        Peaceful protest or not. If 
                        property damage dilutes the message 
                        then you didn’t want to hear the 
                        message in the first place--

           As the group erupts into a heated debate, Adam’s gaze lands 
           on Aisha--still salient in spite of her outfit change.  She 
           watches HOUSEKEEPERS pack up leftover food escaping the 
           condo, returning to their lives. 

           Adam nudges Amy who looks over at Aisha. The two engage in a 
           tension laced conversation. Pregnant looks in Aisha’s 
           direction. The more lucid of the two: Adam finally stands 
           decisively. 

           Aisha watches as he approaches. 

                                 ADAM
                        Whatever she said about me is a 
                        lie. Rude of her not to formally 
                        introduce us but she’s been gushing 
                        about you. Adam. 

                                 AISHA
                        Nice to finally meet you. 

                                 ADAM
                        Loud in here. Do you mind? Amy 
                        wanted me to talk to you about 
                        something. 

           Aisha glances at Amy, drowning in a drunken diatribe--her 
           friends her rapt audience. Aisha allows Adam’s hand to linger 
           on her shoulder, ever so delicately, as he guides her to...

           INT. ADAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Aisha enters reverently, eager to see this space. 

           Walls are littered with award winning photojournalistic 
           imagery...MAIMED children...PIERCING eyes...MEN darting away 
           from fire...GIRLS covered in burkas, their backs cagily 
           turned to the camera.

           Aisha revisits the PHOTOGRAPH of the WAILING AFRICAN WOMAN 
           slumped on her knees, allows her curious gaze to finally 
           return to Adam.  

           As Adam rifles through his wallet, Aisha watches the bills 
           flit between his fingers. She silently counts with him.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Satisfied, he hands her the small stack of cash, along with a 
           metro card. 

                                 ADAM
                        Tonight’s pay in advance. Amy 
                        should be keeping track. 

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you.

                                 ADAM
                        Je parle français aussi.

           Aisha suppresses a giggle. Adam’s pronunciation is ugly. He 
           smiles, able to poke fun at himself. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Go ahead, laugh. I’m well aware I 
                        suck--was just in Lille, France 
                        documenting anti racist protests. 

           Aisha’s attention drifts as a photo beckons to Aisha, pulling 
           her by some invisible thread...FLAMES dance behind a BLACK 
           TEENAGER. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        We have George Floyd, they have 
                        Adama Traoré. Malian-French man. 24 
                        years old...

           A building on fire casts an ominous glow on the Black teen’s 
           face. His arms are outstretched, God like. He’s elevated on a 
           structure--half his face shrouded in a surgical mask. 
           Protestors gaze up at him. 

           Adam shares Aisha’s fixation. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        No pun intended but that kid had a 
                        rare fire in him. Malcolm X-like. 
                        Protestors hung on his every word.
                            (beat)
                        He’s dead now. 

           Unnerved by his matter of factness.

                                 AISHA
                        What happened? 

           Adam shakes his head. The weight of seeing too much heavy on 
           his shoulders. 

                                 ADAM
                        They said it was gang related...

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Aisha returns to the image. Struck by its poignancy. Struck 
           that the boy’s extinguished life is now immortalized by the 
           confines of the photograph. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                            (laughing)
                        What kind of person does this for a 
                        living, right--freeze frames 
                        despair. 

           They lock eyes long enough for Aisha to turn away. A 
           momentary barely detectable break in the air.

                                 AISHA
                        Is it ok if I--

                                 ADAM
                        Oh yeah. Please feel free to go to 
                        bed. Wish I could. That’s really 
                        what we wanted to tell you...Sleep 
                        tight. 

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you. 

           Aisha, well versed in granting smiles that never quite reach 
           her eyes, slides past Adam...

           INT. CONDO - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT 

           THREE MISSED CALLS. Aisha’s finger flicks through her phone’s 
           call history: 

           MARIATOU.

           MARIATOU.

           MARIATOU. 

           Aisha listens to a voicemail from Kofi.

                                 KOFI (O.S.)
                        I just called to say goodnight 
                        mama. Love you. 

           It’s late in New York but even later in Senegal. Aisha takes 
           a chance, pressing the ringing phone to her ear, silently 
           wishing for contact. 

           The phone rings, endlessly. Aisha gives up. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           She unpacks her overnight bag, sliding Kofi’s photograph into 
           the groove of a dresser mirror. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           Light sleep finally takes its rightful place. Aisha’s chest 
           rises and falls in the darkness--a momentary respite.

           An other worldly GUTTURAL GROAN resonates, growing louder...

           Aisha opens her eyes. She darts up.

           PITTER PATTER--the scurrying of feet echo just outside her 
           door.

                                 AISHA
                        (whispering) 
                        Chloe?

           Clammy silence. 

           She pulls her covers to her chest, creating a thin wall. 
           Heart rate rising. She stares at the door, honing in on the 
           knob...

           Scrambling for her cell phone, Aisha activates the 
           flashlight, pointing it at the door. 

           Just as she’s about to turn the flashlight off, the knob 
           turns--ever so slowly. 

           Aisha sinks into her bed throwing her covers over her head. 

           She pants for some time under the sheets, struggling to make 
           sense of what she’s seeing and hearing. 

           FEET PAD deeper into the room, settling just inches from her. 

           Steeling herself, she wrenches the sheets off her head--

           WATER CASCADES into her room as an INHUMAN MOAN rises to a 
           piercing crescendo.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - MORNING

           Aisha darts out of bed, remembering...She takes inventory of 
           her room. 

           Water PLOPS on the smooth wood of the bare dresser. Three 
           more droplets fall in quick succession. 

           Kofi’s photograph is surprisingly unfazed as water drips 
           around it.  Aisha looks up. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           The water stain from the Guest Bathroom infiltrates the guest 
           room, yawning outwards into an intricate wet web.   

           She places a nearby towel under the sporadic drip and places 
           Kofi’s picture in her bag, out of harm’s way. 

           Glancing at her phone, Aisha hustles to get herself together. 

           INT. CHLOE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Adult fingers button a toddler’s shirt. Chloe hums quietly as 
           Aisha dresses her. Aisha recognizes the tune of the familiar 
           native lullaby emanating from Chloe. 

           Puerile humming stops abruptly. Chloe studies Aisha’s 
           doleful, distant eyes. She presses her small hand against 
           Aisha’s cheek, letting it linger.

           Aisha pauses, studying Chloe. 

                                 AISHA
                        How do you know that song?

                                 CHLOE
                        What song?

           Aisha shakes it off. Continuing to dress Chloe. 

                                 CHLOE (CONT'D)
                        Are you going to leave me?

                                 AISHA
                        No. Mon amour. 

           Chloe hugs her suddenly, desperately, toddler arms wrapped 
           tightly around Aisha’s neck. Holding onto her for dear life. 

           EXT. CONDO ELEVATOR - DAY

           Eyeing the numbers as they descend, Aisha musters everything 
           in her body to stay awake.  

           INT. 19 STORY DOORMAN BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY 

           As Aisha steps off the elevator she catches the reflection of 
           a BLACK BOY darting past in her periphery. 

           Eerie echoes of his giggles bounce of corridor walls.  She 
           follows the sound...
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           As she rounds a corner she sees the boy standing eerily still 
           at the end of a long hallway. He stares right at her. 

           The boy looks faintly like Kofi. 

           She walks towards him, puzzled but mesmerized...

           Malik appears from no where, breaking her trance. He scoops 
           the rambunctious boy in his arms--his son--BISHOP [6]. 

           Unwitting to Aisha, the boy’s SHADOW slinks away on all 
           fours, its movements unnatural, spider-like...

                                 MALIK
                        What I tell you about running 
                        around, knucklehead? We almost out. 
                        I need you to sit still so I’m not 
                        unemployed like you. 

           Malik studies Aisha. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        You ok? Look like you saw a ghost. 

           Aisha laughs it off. 

                                 AISHA
                        How old are you, handsome? 

           The boy looks at Aisha annoyed. 

                                 MALIK
                        Bishop is 6 going on 25. 

                                 AISHA
                        They let you bring him?

                                 MALIK
                            (laughing)
                        Let me? Shit happens. I brought 
                        him. 

           Bishop wriggles aggressively out of Malik’s slippery grasp. 

                                 BISHOP
                        My daddy has a crush on you!

           Malik laughs awkwardly. 

                                 MALIK
                        This guy...

           Aisha searches Malik’s face for confirmation. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        I mean. He ain’t lying. 

           Aisha sees her uber in her periphery. 

                                 MALIK  (CONT'D)
                        You think I could...see you
                        outside of here. 

           Aisha studies Malik’s hands noting the absence of a ring.

                                 AISHA 
                        I think you could.

           Malik’s phone is out and ready to go. Aisha punches her 
           number into his phone. Waves as she darts off. 

                                 MALIK
                        Get some sleep, beautiful--for the 
                        both of us. 

           Malik watches Aisha until his son play punches him in the 
           stomach. He crumples to the ground dramatically, pretending 
           to collapse in pain as Bishop giggles over him. 

           EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

           Aisha stares out at the passing city from the back seat. New 
           York: perpetually teeming with life. Passing bodies dance on 
           the car’s windows. 

           She closes her eyes.

           INT. AISHA’S ROOM - DAY

           Kofi’s corner. Aisha takes visual inventory of artifacts: 
           photos, toys, books, etc. Something catches her eye--

           ANOTHER FRAMED PHOTO OF KOFI. Aisha studies it. A small water 
           stain lingers near his head, it’s circumference threatening 
           to distort his face. 

           She instinctively looks up, searching for the water stain;s 
           source, but finds none...

           INT. WESTERN UNION - DAY

           LONG intricately designed NAILS click clack with every bill 
           flitting through deft fingers.‘NIKKI, THE TELLER’[30’s] 
           counts out two hundred dollars in twenties.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Aisha watches her behind murky glass, counting silently with 
           her.

                                 NIKKI
                        Dakar, Senegal.

                                 AISHA
                        Yes. When will they get it?

                                 NIKKI
                        Two business days. Cool?

                                 AISHA
                        Yes. Thanks Nikki.  

                                 NIKKI
                        How’s your little chocolate drop?

                                 AISHA
                        He’s coming to America, finally! I 
                        want him to celebrate his birthday 
                        with me. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Oh shit?! You got his ticket and 
                        everything?!

                                 AISHA
                        Not yet. I almost have enough.

                                 NIKKI
                        He comin to live or just visit?

                                 AISHA
                        To live, thank God.  

                                 NIKKI 
                        Word. African boy comin’ to the big 
                        apple! He gonna fit right in. 

                                 AISHA
                        How’s Nigel? 

                                 NIKKI
                        A raggedy mess. I told him if I 
                        gotta come up to that school one 
                        more time those teachers gonna have 
                        to start a gofundme for his casket.

           The women laugh warmly, temporarily in the presence of one 
           another--peripheral mothers forever in the background of 
           privileged mother’s highlight reels. 

           SOMEONE IN LINE coughs loudly.

                        those cheeks for me. 

           EXT. GRAND CENTRAL PARK -DAY

           The United Nations of Nanny-dom overtake the park as BROWN 
           AND BLACK CAREGIVERS tend to white and racially ambiguous 
           CHILDREN of varying ages.

           LATINA NANNIES populate one corner of the park speaking 
           Spanish.

           WEST INDIAN WOMEN chattering in English on park benches keep 
           their charges in their eye-lines.

           FRANCOPHONE WEST AFRICAN and HAITIAN WOMEN stick together 
           bonded by their French tinged english.

           Aisha, phone pressed to her ear, watches Chloe bossily guide 
           a new friend up a ladder. 

                                 MARIATOU (O.S.)
                        Hi, how are you?

                                 AISHA
                        Mari, how are you--

                                 MARIATOU (O.S.)
                        Ha just kidding! You’ve reached 
                        Mariatou. Leave a message after the-

           BEEEEEEEEEEP.

                                 AISHA
                        What kind of voicemail message is 
                        that, Mari? Tell Kofi I called.

           CYNTHIA and FLORENCE [50’s], JAMAICAN NANNIES, one heavyset, 
           one thin, both soul deep weary and wise, settle beside Aisha 
           with their CHARGES.

           They nod warmly at Aisha, scrutinizing her intensely but 
           innocently as older Caribbean women are wont to do.  

                        CYNTHIA 
                                                       FLORENCE
           Hello.
                                            Hello.

                                 AISHA
                        Hi. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Cynthia. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Florence. And you are?

                                 AISHA
                        Aisha.

           Cynthia furiously wipes snot from the nose of an OVERWEIGHT 
           RED HEADED BOY [5] shoveling a cinnabun into his mouth. 

           He stares at Aisha with an unnerving focus as Cynthia jerks 
           his head back and forth.

                                 RED HEADED BOY
                        Shit, Cynthia!

           Florence gasps.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You watch your mouth, David!

           She pushes him towards the park, smacking his behind.

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                        Go on and play now! You can use the 
                        exercise.
                            (to Florence)
                        No manners. Parents too busy 
                        letting him eat junk. I try to cook 
                        real food but everything too spicy. 
                        Curry too spicy. Salt too spicy. 
                        Air too spicy...

                                 FLORENCE
                        Why you let that boy call you by 
                        your first name?!

           Cynthia shakes her head, defeated. 

                                 FLORENCE (CONT'D)
                        Well, my baby Elizabeth: she know 
                        better.

                                 CYNTHIA

                        You better put a real coat on dear 
                        Lizzie. Police will lock you up 
                        quick fast if you make them people 
                        children sick. You know them quick 
                        to say “abuse.”...

           Florence drops to a whisper. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Too soon, Cynthia. Remember that 
                        Dominican nanny, Arlenis. 

           Cynthia’s eyes go big. She shakes her head, clucking in 
           dismay. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                            (to Aisha)
                        You heard about Arlenis? 

           Aisha shakes her head no. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Had a breakdown. Her employers 
                        fired everybody else: cleaners, 
                        night nanny, kept her but worked 
                        her to the bone and wouldn’t pay 
                        what they owed...then her daughter 
                        got ill back home. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                            (tapping her temple)
                        Arlenis was sick. The kind you 
                        can’t see...

           Cynthia and Florence’s voices fade into an inaudible babble 
           as Aisha’s gaze locks on something in the distance. 

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                        ...slit her employers’ child throat 
                        from ear to ear...

           Aisha stands--propelled towards some unseen object. Aisha 
           approaches slowly. Gingerly. Her eyes glossy with dead focus. 

           We finally see what captivates her...A BOY singing a familiar 
           tune: his back to us.

                                 BOY
                        Oh my baby, my little baby, who can 
                        calm you down? Oh my baby, my 
                        little baby who can calm you down 
                        and bring you to Saloum...

           Aisha approaches the child. 

           Inching closer. 

           She crouches behind the boy. 

           He turns to her slowly. 

           Is it Kofi?

           She reaches out for the boy. 

                                 AISHA
                        Kofi?

           A WOMAN’S SCREAM penetrates the air. Car’s SCREECH.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) 
                        OH MY GOD!

           Horns BLARE DEAFENINGLY LOUD. 

           Aisha darts up. 

           Her eyes search for the source of the chaos, landing on... 

           ...A NANNY cradling Chloe, consoling her. Chloe’s beet red 
           face is contorted in a wail of despair. 

           Aisha turns back to the boy. 

           He’s gone. 

           Lucid, she takes in the DISAPPROVING GLARES OF NANNIES 
           throughout the park enveloping her like an inescapable wall. 

           The FILIPINA NANNY holding Chloe stomps up to Aisha, handing 
           the red faced child to her. 

                                 FILLIPINA NANNY
                        You better pay attention. Someone 
                        will report you. How could you let 
                        her get out of the park?!

           Aisha grips Chloe’s hand, maybe too tightly, as the little 
           girl wipes fresh tears from her eyes. 

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you. 

           Aisha scoops Chloe in her arms, making her way out of the 
           park, escorted by the heavy weight of judgement.

           INT. ICE CREAM SHOP - DAY

           Chloe, tears dried, watches intently as a massive scoop of 
           strawberry ice-cream is scooped onto a cone. Aisha stops the 
           PIMPLE FACED TEEN behind the counter.

                                 AISHA
                        Is that gluten free?

           The teen points to a huge sign that reads:

           ALL OUR FLAVORS ARE GLUTEN FREE AND DAIRY FREE SO YOU CAN BE!

           EXT. ICE CREAM SHOP - DAY

           Aisha keeps Chloe close, watching her happily lick ice cream. 

           She’s a giddy ball of energy, the innocence of puerile 
           amnesia seems to wash away the previous incident... 

                                 AISHA
                        Chloe, why did you leave the park?

           Chloe extends the ice cream to Aisha. Aisha shakes her head 
           no.

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Chloe...

           A shadow suddenly falls over Chloe. She throws her ice-cream 
           on the ground shrieking at the top of her lungs. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I wanna go home! I wanna go home! 
                        Take me home! 

           INT. CHLOE'S ROOM - EVENING

           Chloe’s book shelf. Chloe’s small finger scans the books, 
           finally landing on a selection. She pulls the book from the 
           shelf.

                                                              CUT TO:

           A fabric fort illuminated by a flashlight. Two figures 
           inside: Aisha and Chloe. The silhouette of Aisha’s hand, 
           formed into a makeshift shadow spider, dances on the tent 
           walls, growing ominously. 

           Chloe fights sleep--hanging on Aisha’s every word as she 
           reads from Chloe’s selected book: Anansi The Spider by Gerald 
           McDermott.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 AISHA
                        "Hold on son, for if you fall Death 
                        is going to get you," Anansi the 
                        spider said to his child. However, 
                        the boy could not hold on any 
                        longer. Therefore, he fell.”

           Chloe gasps. Aisha’s makeshift spider hand climbs up Chloe’s 
           arm. Chloe bristles. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Anansi’s son died?!

                                 AISHA
                        Death caught the boy and opened the 
                        burlap bag. "It is your father I 
                        want… not you.” Then he placed the 
                        child into the burlap bag. Another 
                        of Anansi's daughters cried out to 
                        her father. "Puppa, please…my hands 
                        are tired. I am going to fall...”

                                 CHLOE
                        Is Anansi bad, Aisha?

           Aisha thinks, flipping through the pages. 

                                 AISHA
                        Do you know the word filou?

                                 CHLOE
                        Fee. Loo. 

                                 AISHA
                        Trickster. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Trickster. 

           Making a small circle with her thumb and pointer finger.

                                 AISHA
                        Anansi is this big. 

           Chloe mimics Aisha with her small fingers. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        And most of the people who bother 
                        Anansi are as big as me, so he uses 
                        his intelligence, sometimes good 
                        sometimes bad, to survive. He is a 
                        survivor. Survivant

                                 CHLOE
                        SYUR. VEE. VANT. Survivor. 

                                 AISHA
                        Are you ready to tell me why you 
                        left the park, Chloe?

           Chloe’s lids are heavy. She rubs her eyes. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Anansi told me to. 

           At this, Chloe unceremoniously curls into a ball, falling 
           asleep in the warm fort. Aisha watches her chest rise and 
           fall. 

           INT. CONDO - GUEST ROOM - EVENING

           ANGLE ON THE WORK BINDER; Aisha jots down her hours for the 
           day.

           She sits cross legged at the foot of the guest room bed.

           A NOLLYWOOD FILM blares in the background.

           ON SCREEN: a man painted in white howls over the deceased 
           body of a loved one. He wails maniacally--overacting as a 
           cheaply costumed witch creeps up behind him.  

           Aisha glances at her phone: 9:30PM, then up at the water 
           stain from the guest bathroom infiltrating the guest room. 

           KEYS JANGLE in the distance. Aisha darts up, methodically 
           gathering her belongings. 

           She snakes through the darkness towards the 

           MAIN ENTRANCE. 

           Stands still as she watches Amy’s dark figure stumble into 
           the condo. 

           Something CLANGS loudly hitting the floor.  

                                 AMY
                        Fuck. 

                                 AISHA
                        Amy.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 AMY
                        Homygawd! Aisha?! You scared the 
                        shit out of me. How long have you 
                        been standing there?

                                 AISHA
                        Not long.

                                 AMY
                        Why are you still here? I told Adam 
                        to let you leave. Where is he?

           At this, Aisha flicks the lights on, cocooning the Women in 
           brightness. 

                                 AISHA
                        I don’t know where he is? I haven’t 
                        seen him today. 

           Amy is visibly drunk. She grants Aisha a lipstick smeared 
           smile as she fumbles with her purse. She pulls out a wad of 
           cash, gripping it tightly. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s so hard when you’re the Woman 
                        overseeing everything: expected to 
                        get drinks with the guys every 
                        Friday to prove I’m one of them 
                        but...we’ll never be one of them. 
                        It’s a boy’s club. A serious 
                        fucking boy’s club--And when you’re 
                        a Mom on top of that...

           Amy creeps closer to Aisha. Aisha smells wine on her 
           breath...

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Guess who got a promotion?!

           Amy jumps up and down, giddy. She dances around Aisha to 
           music only she can hear, intertwining her fingers in Aisha’s 
           as she forces her to sway with her in celebration. 

           Aisha let’s her use her body as a prop until she doesn’t, 
           gently pulling away. Amy won’t let her go, embracing Aisha 
           tightly. Aisha’s hands hang limply at her sides. 

           The hug lingers, uncomfortably long. Aisha rips away.

                                 AISHA
                        Enough!

                            (whispering)
                        Aren’t you happy for me?

                                 AISHA
                        I need a set schedule. I need you 
                        to stick to the times you tell me.

           Amy’s face contorts. Her lip quivers. Weaponized tears stream 
           down her face.  

                                 AMY
                        I’m sorry. I...I mean this with all 
                        my heart: you’re like family to us 
                        now, Aisha. Chloe loves you so 
                        much...we’ll work out a clear 
                        schedule. Promise. 

                                 AISHA
                        Ok... 

           Amy follows Aisha as she makes her way to the door. She 
           presses the balled up bills in Aisha’s hand. 

                                 AMY
                        Do me a favor...Watch Adam for me.

                        Goodnight, Amy. 

           INT. MOVING ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Aisha presses out the crumpled bills, sixty dollars. She 
           scoffs, shaking her head at the gall of this woman.

           Aisha studies her fractured reflection in the descending 
           elevator. 

           EXT. NYC TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           As Aisha makes her way into the train station, she recognizes 
           Malik a few steps ahead. She watches him as she joins the 
           herd of people descending into the train station.

           INT. TRAIN PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

           She swipes her card, just behind Malik. They’re going in the 
           same direction. Taking the same train. The kind of NYC 
           coincidence that makes perfect sense.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Tired commuters fill up sparse platform seats. Most are 
           forced to stand. 

           Aisha watches Malik, debating. He nods to the music in his 
           headphones. She decides against breaking her voyeuristic 
           perch, staring ahead...

           Then, a touch on her shoulder. She turns too see Malik--that 
           Colgate smile. 

                                 MALIK
                        Aisha. You following me?

                                 AISHA
                        You wish.  

                                 MALIK
                        Naw you gotta take a number. I got 
                        too many stalkers.

           Aisha smiles in spite of her exhaustion. 

                                 AISHA
                        Where do you get off?

                                 MALIK
                        That depends on where you get 
                        off...Sorry. Lemme not be a creep. 
                        116th. You?

                                 AISHA
                        Same.

           Malik holds his hand up for a fist bump. Aisha grants him 
           one.  As if on cue, a train flies towards the platform. 
           Onlookers brace themselves to secure a seat.

           INT. MOVING TRAIN - NIGHT

           Aisha trails Malik as he darts towards an open seat in the 
           bustle. He uses his body to create a barrier that allows her 
           to slide into the empty seat. She looks up at him. He stands 
           over her, protective. 

                                 AISHA
                        There’s space. 

                                 MALIK
                        Naw you got it. 

           His body sways as the train pulls off.

                        You gonna tell me where you’re from 
                        or you think I’m a dumb American 
                        who thinks Africa is one big ass 
                        country? 

                                 AISHA
                        It starts with an S. 

                                 MALIK
                        (singing Frank Ocean song) 
                        Blood diamonds. Sieeerrrraaaa 
                        Leoooone. 

           Aisha shakes her head no. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        South Africa? 

           Wrong again. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Senegal!

           Aisha’s face lights up. She grants Malik an affirmative 
           smile. 

                                 AISHA
                        Have you been to Africa?

                                 MALIK
                        Does Harlem count?

           Aisha laughs. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Trying to make my way over there. 
                        Got a couple of homies dipping to 
                        Ghana as soon as the world opens up 
                        again. 

           A space opens up next to Aisha. Malik immediately settles 
           beside her--their legs pressed together on the cramped train. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        So lemme ask you this but you gotta 
                        tell the truth: who has the best 
                        jollof rice, cuz let Nigerians tell 
                        it...

                                 AISHA
                        Let Nigerians tell it, they have 
                        the best of everything. What do you 
                        know about jollof rice?!

                        What don’t I know about jollof 
                        rice, baby?!

           EXT. 116TH TRAIN STATION - HARLEM - NIGHT 

           TIRED PASSENGERS file into the night air. Malik strolls 
           alongside Aisha. 

           Aisha stops him. 

                                 AISHA
                        You don’t have to.

                                 MALIK
                        You sure? It’s late. 

                                 AISHA
                        I come home late all the time. 

                                 MALIK
                        Copy that. 

           Malik lingers behind her.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Don’t be dreaming about me!

           Aisha laughs to herself as she drifts towards home. 

           INT./EXT. AFRICAN HAIR BRAIDING SALON - DAY

           Aisha peers through the glass of the salon, phone pressed to 
           her ear. 

                                 MARIATOU (O.S.)
                        Hi, how are you?

                                 AISHA
                        Mari--

                                 MARIATOU (O.S.)
                        Ha just kidding! You’ve reached 
                        Mariatou. Leave a message after the-

           BEEEEEEEEEEP.

                                 AISHA
                        Mari, please change this voicemail.  
                        I beg you.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Sally unlocks the door, greeting Aisha warmly with a kiss on 
           the cheek. In spite of her tired, sunken eyes, she ekes out 
           joy in the presence of her friend. 

           She wears a t-shirt tucked into a lappa. As Aisha follows her 
           into the shop we see a SLEEPING BABY tied to Sallay’s back, 
           anchored tightly by another lappa.

                                                              CUT TO:

           OVERMODULATED SOUND of a Nollywood movie drones in the 
           background. Exaggerated Nigerian dialects ebb and flow. 

           Sallay returns to her customer, an ANNOYED AMERICAN GIRL 
           getting individual braids.

           Aisha settles into a salon chair.

           The American girl scrolls through her phone. She has a small 
           tuft of hair left to be braided, which she touches hopefully. 

           Every time we think the tuft is finally too small to part, 
           Sallay parts another smaller tuft to braid.  

           Sallay and Aisha speak in their native language, sprinkled 
           with English. 

                                 SALLAY
                        I was like, this girl forgot about 
                        me. No call, no text, no visit...

                                 AISHA
                        They own me, Sallay. I have no 
                        life. 

                                 SALLAY
                        I just did an overnight. This is my 
                        only customer today then I’m going 
                        to sleep! Work until you die. The 
                        American dream, right?

                                 AISHA
                        Speaking of American dream, I’m so 
                        close to being able to buy Kofi and 
                        Mari’s tickets.

                                 SALLAY
                        I wish I could just give it to you, 
                        Aisha.

           The girl looks up from her phone.

                        Sallay, I told you about pulling on 
                        my edges. How many you got left?!

                                 SALLAY 
                        Three more. Almost done. Your man 
                        is gonna ask you to marry him when 
                        he sees you. 

                                 ANNOYED AMERICAN GIRL
                        I don’t have a man. I have a girl. 

                                 SALLAY
                        Oh...

           Sallay gives Aisha a “good for her?!” look. Aisha laughs. 

                                 SALLAY (CONT'D)
                        If only being attracted to men was 
                        a choice. I would choose anything 
                        else.

                        It can be a choice you know. 

           Sallay nudges her playfully. 

                                 SALLAY
                        In your dreams girl.

                        Maybe if you apologize to the 
                        family they can help you. 

                                 AISHA
                        Apologize for what?! He knew he was 
                        married when he started paying my 
                        school fees, when he gave me money 
                        for food, clothes, for my sick 
                        mother, when he slept with me.

                                 SALLAY
                        Calm down. You think I don’t know 
                        how it is? Big men play with little 
                        girls and it’s always the girls who 
                        are punished. I don’t know why 
                        their wives brag about their 
                        husbands like we can’t all date 
                        them too. 

                                 AISHA
                        He doesn’t care whether his own son 
                        lives or dies--cut me off when I 
                        got pregnant. 
                            (beat)
                        I remember walking to the beach. 
                        The moon was so big. The water was 
                        cold at my feet...

           Aisha shakes off the memory. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        I’m glad I didn’t do it. This one I 
                        would keep. Kofi is the best thing 
                        that happened to me, Sallay. He is 
                        my greatest work.  

                                 SALLAY
                        Kofi is a beautiful boy. Let them 
                        be corrupt and rich in their own 
                        country. I would rather be a slave 
                        in America than a slave in Africa. 
                        At least here when you work you see 
                        the money. 

                                 AISHA
                        Do we?

           That mischievous smile creeps over Sallay’s face.

                                 SALLAY
                        You heard about your friend

                                 SALLAY
                        She better hurry up and come. 
                        People have been seeing her 
                        man...around, but you know leaving 
                        a man who cheats is like leaving a 
                        country because it rains. 

           Sallay’s deft fingers reach the end of the American girl’s 
           last braid.

                                 SALLAY  (CONT'D)
                        Finished sexy lady!

                                                              CUT TO:

           The American girl’s head is tilted back. Eyes closed. Steam 
           rises around her as Sallay dips the ends of her long braids 
           in scalding hot water. Each plait painstakingly immersed in 
           wetness like a braided baptism.

           EXT. AFRICAN HAIR BRAIDING SALON - DAY

           SALLAY’S BABY, a gurgling bundle of fat. Aisha bounces her on 
           her hip, cooing to her as Sallay pulls down a metal gate, 
           closing up shop with the strength of five men. 

           They pass the baby between hands and hug tightly, swaying 
           back and forth. 

                                 SALLAY
                        I just want you to be happy Aisha.

                                 AISHA 
                        I will be soon. Be safe. 

           The women part ways.

           EXT. NYC - DAY

           A series of restaurant storefronts. Aisha, in an existential 
           daze. Chloe, salivating as they pass each one. 

           Chloe spots an Ethiopian restaurant, tugging Aisha in that 
           direction. 

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s your food! I want some.

           Aisha humors Chloe, allowing her to drag her toward a menu 
           plastered to the window.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Aisha digs a tangerine from her bag and hands it to Chloe. 
           She shakes her head “No”. 

                                 AISHA
                        There’s food at home. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I don’t want that food. I want your 
                        food.

           Aisha pulls Chloe away from the window. 

           INT. CONDO - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY

           Aisha removes her shoes. Chloe squirms as Aisha takes her 
           shoes off. 

           Aisha helps Chloe wash her hands, sudsing Chloe’s small hands 
           in hers as they sing.

                          AISHA
                                                        CHLOE
                                            ...and bottoms. In between. 
                                            In between. Scrub them all 
                                            together. Scrub them all 
                                            together. Now we’re clean. 
                                            Kweeky clean.
           Tops and bottoms. Tops and 
           bottoms. In between. In 
           between. Scrub them all 
           together. Scrub them all 
           together. Now we’re clean. 
           Squeaky clean.

                                                              CUT TO:

           Aisha opens and peers into a sparse fridge. Sighs. 

           Eye’s ablaze, Chloe sees something behind Aisha. 

                                 CHLOE (CONT'D)
                        Daddy!

           Aisha turns to see Adam smiling at them. 

                                 ADAM
                        Hey piglet. You two hungry?

                                 CHLOE
                        Yes!

                                 ADAM
                        Aisha, what time are you off today?

           She glances at her phone never quite knowing when she’s free 
           to leave. 

                                 AISHA
                        I was going to ask...

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 ADAM
                        Let’s grab a quick bite. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Yay!

           Aisha barely has time to protest as Chloe leaps in her 
           father’s arms.

           INT. ETHIOPIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           The trio sits outside of the restaurant Aisha and Chloe 
           previously passed. A half eaten plate of doro wat among other 
           Ethiopian dishes in various states of having been eaten. 

           Chloe claps her hands--giddy. 

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t know what hex you put on 
                        this kid. She’s the pickiest eater 
                        in the world and now she wants to 
                        Anthony Bourdain her way through 
                        Africa. 

           Adam and Aisha watch Chloe as she eats a spoonful of the 
           dense stew. 

                                 AISHA
                        Bon Goût?

           Chloe nods exuberantly. 

                                 ADAM
                        What did you do...before you came 
                        here? 

                                 AISHA
                        I was in school...studied English 
                        and French. 

                                 ADAM
                        English. You want to be a writer?

           Aisha’s face warms with shame.

                                 AISHA
                        It was self indulgent, but I plan 
                        to go back to school here. America 
                        doesn’t acknowledge African 
                        degrees. It’s like I have nothing.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 ADAM
                        You definitely have something. 
                        You’re smart, Aisha. 

           He covers Chloe’s ears. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        I can tell you won’t be with us 
                        long. Much as I’d love to keep you. 

           Letting Chloe’s ears breathe, Adam offers a genuine smile. 
           Aisha glances at the precocious girl, lost in her ipad. Her 
           gaze returns to Adam.

           He mouths to THE WAITER. “The Bill”. The waiter nods, 
           scurrying away. 

                                 AISHA
                        Can I ask you a question... 

                                 ADAM
                        Shoot. 

                                 AISHA
                        The hours aren’t clear. Maybe Amy 
                        forgets, being a working mother, 
                        but I’ve started keeping track of 
                        overtime...

                                 ADAM
                        Want me to have a talk with her? I 
                        won’t say you brought it up. 

                                 AISHA
                        Sure. That would be great-- 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Adam is that you?!

           A MODELESQUE ASIAN AMERICAN WOMAN in form fitting yoga gear 
           approaches.

                                 ADAM
                        Christie?!

           Aisha looks on as Adam stands to embrace the woman, CHRISTIE 
           [mid 30’s]. Aisha notes the woman’s effervescent laugh, the 
           glide of Adam’s hand intimately pressed to the woman’s lower 
           back, the kisses on both cheeks that linger dangerously close 
           to the lips... 

           They talk closely, in whispers. Eyes locked on one another. 

           Aisha looks away, embarrassed, for what she’s not sure.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Christie squeals at the sight of Chloe. 

           She kneels beside the table to speak to her, close enough for 
           Aisha to smell her perfume. 

                                 CHRISTIE
                        Remember me, Chloe?! Oh my god, 
                        look at how big you are now. I saw 
                        you when you were just a teeny tiny 
                        thing. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Bonjour. 

                                 CHRISTIE
                        Ohmygawdsocute! Look at those 
                        lashes.

           The Woman unceremoniously turns to Aisha.

                                 CHRISTIE (CONT'D)
                        You are very pretty. 

           More a declarative statement than a compliment. Before Aisha 
           can respond, the Woman returns to Adam. Adam glances at Aisha 
           self consciously. 

           The waiter places the bill on the table. Adam blindly tosses 
           a credit card down.

                                 ADAM
                        You two go ahead. Aisha, don’t 
                        worry about it. I’ll talk to Amy...

           Aisha straps Chloe into her stroller, distracted by Adam’s 
           hand sliding down the small of Christie’s back.

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 

           Rows of children’s puffer coats hang like phantom toddlers. 
           Aisha studies a series of coats before settling on one with 
           sufficient thickness and warmth. She looks at the price tag. 
           Bites her lip. 

           AT THE REGISTER 

           Aisha pays in cash. She parts with each bill reluctantly. Her 
           fingers run along the coat’s stitching as reassurance.

           EXT. WEST HARLEM PIERS PARK - DAY 

           Aisha, settled on a bench, listens intently--the familiar 
           ring of an unanswered call--Her ear buds pressed in her ears. 

           REVELERS flit past, an endless sea of strangers moving in and 
           out of sight before the shoreline. 

                                 MARIATOU’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...Ha just kidding! You’ve reached 
                        Mariatou. Leave a message after the-

           Aisha ends the call. She eyes Kofi’s new coat, propped beside 
           her on the empty bench. 

           She removes her headphones and gazes out at the expanse of 
           water. Barely blinking, Aisha appears to be mesmerized by a 
           nebulous force pulling her attention to the dark murky water. 

           A PIERCING RING fills her ears along with the sound of WOMEN 
           WAILING--visceral cries of suffering. 

           CLOSE ON dark waves crashing into one another. 

           As she peers into the water, she sees a WOMAN...The Woman’s 
           head rises just above the water surrounded by a halo of 
           thick, black hair. The Woman’s sclera, the whites of her 
           eyes, are as black as her pupils, peering through Aisha with 
           an unnerving gaze.

           SOUND FILTERS AWAY as Aisha locks eyes with the creature...

           SUDDENLY A CHILD’S CRY jolts Aisha back to.

           A PASSERBY’S VOICE filters into auditory perception:

                                 PASSERBY
                        ...need help?...come down...not 
                        worth it, Miss...

           Aisha snaps to--mid climb, perched on the railing that 
           separates pedestrians from water. Unsure of how much time 
           passed, she jumps down, disoriented. 

           She exhales, unwittingly holding her breath. 

           Her phone buzzes alive. 

           A text: ‘Come grab dinner with ya boy. My treat.’

           She gazes at the body of water. Shaken.

           INT. AISHA'S ROOM - DAY

           Kneeling at the foot of her bed, head bowed, eyes closed, a 
           whisper of a prayer only she knows slips from Aisha’s lips.

           DING. 

           A text message. 

           Aisha glances at her phone.

           EXT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - EVENING

           Lips. Aisha’s. Glossed to perfection. 

           Her face is reflected in a compact mirror. Aisha eyes 
           herself, then puts the mirror away. 

           She’s casually dolled up as she lingers at the top of the 
           Brownstone steps. As she waits she takes in the menagerie of 
           plants in the Brownstone yard: an urban garden. 

           A CURTAIN PEELS BACK to reveal sage eyes of a BLACK WOMAN 
           peering at Aisha through glass. 

           The door opens unveiling KATHLEEN [65], well preserved, 
           dressed from head to toe in white with a steely expression 
           accented by motherly warmth.

                                 ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                        Hi Aisha. I’m Kathleen Karter. Come 
                        on in. He’ll be down in a second.

           INT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - PARLOR - EVENING

           Aisha takes in the welcoming space as she nestles into a 
           couch. The brownstone is a relic, a menagerie of African 
           artifacts and plants. 

           These are the types of preserved, protected Brownstones a 
           transplant could never discover; kept in the family. Passed 
           down. 

           She notes framed photographs: progressions of Malik 
           burgeoning from child to man. His son Bishop... 

           In Malik’s childhood pictures he’s flanked by a SMILING WOMAN 
           with empty eyes. 

           The woman is absent as Malik transitions from teen to Man.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Suddenly, Malik is alone in his portraits. His smile no 
           longer meeting his eyes.

                                 KATHLEEN (O.S.)
                        Tea? I have hibiscus, ginger 
                        turmeric, Lipton...

           Kathleen emerges with a platter of tea anyway. She places it 
           gingerly before Aisha. Aisha takes the offering, plucking a 
           choice from the array. 

           She can’t shake the feeling...

                                 AISHA
                        I feel like I’ve met you before. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        It’s very possible. 

           They study each other, two formerly acquainted spirits 
           reunited in this liminal space called life--the present. 

                                 KATHLEEN (CONT'D)
                        I learned about heart-ache in 
                        Dakar. Lived all over West Africa 
                        for 10 years. Fell in love with the 
                        continent. Unrivaled style and a 
                        certain--a certain pulsating 
                        vibrance I wish I could bottle and 
                        sell over here. A dash of Nigerian 
                        bravado with a sprinkle of Ghanaian 
                        pride and a heaping serving of 
                        Sierra Leonean humility...

                                 AISHA
                        I miss my country. Every day. The 
                        good parts. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Do tell about the bad parts?

           Aisha fiddles. Glances down at her tea. Unnerved by her 
           compulsive desire to tell unfettered truth in the presence of 
           this woman. 

                                 AISHA
                        We are supposed to make babies to 
                        settle--even for men who don’t want 
                        us, but some of us would rather 
                        make ourselves. 

           Kathleen takes Aisha in with an agreeable “hmm”.

           Aisha’s curiosity moves to a collage painting on vinyl. She 
           approaches the piece--losing herself in the image of a 
           grotesque but beautiful half woman half fish underwater 
           creature with bared teeth sharp as nails. 

           The Mer-woman’s claws sink into the head of a limp human 
           figure succumbing to the creature’s power...

           Kathleen’s voice cuts through like a salve.

                                 KATHLEEN 
                        One of my favorites. It’s called 
                        “Killing you softly” by Kenyan 
                        Arist: Wangechi Mutu. It’s an 
                        interpretation of Mami Wata, La 
                        Siréne, Yemayá, River 
                        Mamma...whatever name a culture 
                        chooses, they are genderless 
                        ancient water gods. Some believe 
                        the mermaid lures with sexuality, 
                        money and promises of fertility, 
                        but they can also be dangerous, 
                        unpredictable and impermanent. 
                        Enslaved West Africans brought 
                        tales of Mami Wata with them. 
                        They’re as unpredictable as the 
                        water that swallowed too many of us 
                        whole--or rather, liberated us... 

           Aisha faces Kathleen, worry etched in her face. 

                                 AISHA
                        I think I saw her...them. 

                                 KATHLEEN 
                        Mami Wata?

           Aisha nods, tears welling in her eyes. 

                                 AISHA
                        Am I sick? The kind you can’t see. 
                        Am I losing my mind? 

           Kathleen presses her hand to Aisha’s cheek as though 
           transferring strength into her body. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Oh no no no dear don’t cry. You’re 
                        perfectly fine. Mami Wata feeds on 
                        whatever you give--whether it’s 
                        fear or rage or vengeance. The 
                        spirits are calling you, trying to 
                        communicate something.

                                 AISHA
                        But, why me?

           Kathleen tilts her head, raises her shoulders - her eyes 
           searching Aisha’s with sympathy and a deep resignation.

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Ancestors remind women like us how 
                        to survive. It’s up to us to answer 
                        the call. 

           An omniscient glimmer in Kathleen’s eyes. Kathleen backs 
           away. Relaxes. Sips her tea. 

                                 KATHLEEN (CONT'D)
                        On to happier things. What’s your 
                        boy’s name?

                                 AISHA
                        How do you...

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Aisha, mothers know other mothers. 
                        Children are like ghosts, clinging 
                        to your body even when they’re not 
                        physically present. 

                                 MALIK (O.S.)
                        You two done with the intro course 
                        to African gods?

           Malik approaches the Women. All smiles. Oozing charisma. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Gram always asks too many 
                        questions. 

                                 AISHA
                        She asks them of all the Women who 
                        pass through?

           A nervous laugh from Malik. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Only the one’s with a story that 
                        piques my interest. There haven’t 
                        been many...

                                 AISHA
                        That pique your interest or--

                                 MALIK
                        Time to go.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Malik kisses Kathleen on the forehead, whisking Aisha away as 
           he hooks his arm in hers. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Love you Gram, stay outta trouble!

           Aisha turns back to Kathleen briefly. 

                                 AISHA
                        Kofi. 

           Kathleen closes the door behind them. She sighs a sigh bone 
           marrow deep, staring at the space Aisha inhabited. Her mind’s 
           fingers touch the intagible...The presence of life... The 
           coming of violence...

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Kofi.

           Kathleen grabs the tea tray and leaves, passing the haunting 
           Mami Wata painting, but we don’t pass with her. 

           We linger on the Mer-woman, pushing closer to her...

           EXT. HARLEM - EVENING

           Close on Aisha shaking her head disapprovingly. 

                                 AISHA
                        No. 

           We pull back to reveal Malik sitting on a motorcycle, 
           extending an extra helmet to Aisha. 

                                 MALIK
                        Come on. 

           Malik dismounts, approaches Aisha. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Stop being a scaredy cat. We not 
                        even goin far.
                            (Beat.)
                        I’ll go extra slow. 

           Aisha holds up her pinky finger. Malik hooks his pinky in 
           hers. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Trust me.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Aisha sighs, takes the helmet. Good thing she wore jeans. 
           Malik helps her. He clicks the strap of the helmet closed.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        You still fine. Even though your 
                        big ass head can’t fit in that 
                        helmet.  

           Aisha hits him playfully. Malik revs the engine as she mounts 
           behind him, visibly nervous. 

                                 AISHA
                        Slow. Ok?

                                 MALIK
                        All you gotta do is hold on to me. 
                        I got you. 

           Aisha nods. She adjusts her snug helmet then grips Malik for 
           dear life as they take off.

                                                              CUT TO:

           Aisha, hands wrapped around Malik’s waist. 

           Malik, looks back silently checking on her. 

           A slow motion symphony of movement as they snake their way 
           through Harlem streets.

           EXT. SYLVIA’S RESTAURANT - EVENING

           So tightly pressed against one another they seem to be one 
           body with four legs, Malik alights in front of the Soul Food 
           Restaurant.

           INT. SYLVIA'S RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Various warm shouts, nods, hand claps from WAITSTAFF as Malik 
           strolls into the restaurant--this convivial show in spite of 
           GENTRIFIED CLIENTELE.

                                 COOK
                        My boy!

                        Shit, can’t complain. Tryin to get

                        Man I’m trying to get like you. 
                        Heard you bought another 
                        Brownstone?! 

                                 COOK
                        How else we gonna keep what little 
                        we got?

                                 MALIK
                        Respect. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        Hey, handsome! Seat in the back?

                                 MALIK
                        You know me. 

           Aisha basks in the rapid fire exchanges between Malik and 
           people who clearly adore him. He extends his hand behind him, 
           reaching for her. She eyes his outstretched hand, placing her 
           hand in his as he guides her to the back of the restaurant. 

           Malik chooses a private nook. He pulls out Aisha’s chair for 
           her. She settles in.

                                                              CUT TO:

           We follow a waitress carrying a menagerie of cheesecake 
           making her way to Aisha and Malik. Malik grants the waitress 
           a silent thank you as she refills Aisha’s wine glass. 

                                 AISHA
                        Oh no. I can’t eat anymore. 

                                 MALIK
                        Just one bite. Best cheesecake on 
                        the East Coast.

           Malik helps himself. Aisha sips wine from a straw. 

                                 AISHA
                        Malik.

                                 MALIK
                        What’s up?

                                 AISHA
                        How did she know? How did your 
                        grandmother know?

                                 MALIK

                                 AISHA
                        I didn’t tell you I have a son. 

                                 MALIK
                        I mean everybody, all of us, were 
                        born with the ability to see. Most 
                        folks start to close those eyes to 
                        survive adulthood. 

                                 AISHA
                        She’s...a witch. 

           Malik almost chokes on his cheesecake. 

                                 MALIK
                        A witch?! Naw. She’s clairvoyant. A 
                        Priestess.  

                                 AISHA
                        Psychic?

                                 MALIK
                        Yeah but Gram prefers “Intuitive 
                        Consultant” I’m not gonna lie, 
                        gives me the heeby jeebies 
                        sometimes. Had to let her know I 
                        don’t wanna know. Let me live it as 
                        it comes. 

           A synaptic breach in Aisha’s belief system, crumbling before 
           our eyes, in real time.

                        Can I see little man?

           Aisha pulls out her phone, scrolling. She unveils a digital 
           image of Kofi smiling at the person behind the camera. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        That’s a lady killer right there--
                        or...whoever he wants to kill. 

           Aisha laughs. 

                                 AISHA
                        He’s coming soon. For his birthday. 
                        I haven’t seen him in almost a 
                        year.

                                 MALIK
                        That’s like forever for a kid.

                                 AISHA
                        I know...

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           The weight of time lost hangs in the air. Aisha inhales the 
           rest of her wine. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        And you?

                                 MALIK
                        And me.

                                 AISHA
                        You have how many kids?

                                 MALIK
                        Five. 

                                 AISHA
                        Really? Four plus Bishop?!

           Malik nods, pushing a morsel of cheesecake in his mouth. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        How many mothers?

                                 MALIK
                        Five. I don’t like to double dip. 

           A mischievous smile creeps over Malik’s face. Aisha punches 
           him in the shoulder. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Ow. Damn!

                                 AISHA
                        I knew you were lying. 

                                 MALIK
                        Just my knucklehead Bishop. You 
                        really thought I was a procreatin’ 
                        ass nigga out here with mad kids 
                        huh? Ain’t no Future here. Call me 
                        Present. 
                            (off Aisha’s oblivious 
                             look)
                        You know...the rapper...Future. 

           Aisha just stares at Malik. He shakes his head in mock 
           disappointment. 

                                 AISHA
                        I try not to judge. Don’t want 
                        people judging me. 

           Aisha and Malik lock eyes. Unspoken secrets lurk just behind 
           their gazes.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Is the woman in the pictures your 
                        mother?

           Malik clears his throat. His veneer of charisma falters for 
           the first time. He picks at his cheesecake.

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.

           That impenetrable grin again. 

                                 MALIK
                        What you sorry for? 

           Aisha notes Malik’s hand on the table. Places hers on his. He 
           pulls it away casually placing it on the back of his neck. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        My mom been talking to herself, 
                        laughing at the jokes in her head 
                        since I could remember. Used to 
                        hate when she came to pick me up 
                        from school. 

           He’s struck by the memory. Hell is a place of remembering. 

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Kids used to see her before I did. 
                        Pacing back and forth in the lobby 
                        in front of everybody. I dressed 
                        fly--started pumping weights so no 
                        one could say shit to my face about 
                        my schizophrenic Mamma. 

                                 AISHA
                        Is she--

                                 MALIK
                        Dead. Killed herself when I was 8. 
                        Pops been around as much as he 
                        could, still is, but Grams raised 
                        me.  

           At this Malik looks Aisha straight in her eyes, devoid of his 
           cape of humor--naked without his shield of comedy. 

           Aisha moves food around her plate. 

                                 AISHA
                        I was 12 when my mother died. 

                                 MALIK
                        What happened? 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 AISHA
                        She kept her sickness from us for 
                        as long as she could. She got 
                        thinner and thinner, stopped 
                        eating. Then one day she couldn’t 
                        walk. Cancer...

           Aisha trails off. This time Malik holds her hand. She takes a 
           good look at this man--his wet, rueful eyes...the sharp edge 
           of desire cuts through her like a knife. 

           Strangers inexorably linked by loss.  

           EXT. HARLEM STREETS - NIGHT

           Aisha grips Malik tightly as his Motorcycle rips through the 
           darkness. 

           He pushes faster this time. Aisha lets him.

           INT. REGGAE CLUB - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

           Bodies writhe under flashing colored lights as sumptuous 
           Reggae/Afrofusion music fills the air. Something like 
           Koffee’s TOAST pulsates.

           Aisha and Malik press themselves against each other as they 
           move to the music, intoxicated by lust and libation.

           EXT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 

           Giggles in the darkness as they enter the Brownstone. Malik 
           shushes her with the gravity of the left-in-charge eldest 
           child trying hard not to laugh. 

           They stumble and fumble like teenagers.

           INT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - MALIK’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Aisha and Malik, both naked, face each other as they lie in 
           bed...His eyes closed...Aisha’s open. She watches him for 
           some time before pressing her lips to his. 

           He opens his eyes. Looks at her. 

           She kisses him again. 

           Harder. 

           Pushes him onto his back as she straddles him. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           He stops her, breathing hard. She grips him harder with her 
           thighs. 

                                 MALIK
                        You sure?

           She takes his hand, guiding it under her top to the skin of 
           her breasts. 

           He squeezes. 

           She moans. 

           He moves his hands down her stomach, tugging at her waist 
           beads, threatening to rip them off. 

           This time she stops him. 

           He fingers the beads curiously then flips Aisha on her back, 
           taking control, climbing in between her legs, inside of her, 
           her mouth contorting in gasps of muted pleasure... 

           She holds onto him moaning a prayer to ecstacy. 

           FAMILY CENTER WAITING AREA - MANHATTAN - DAY

           Aisha. Anxious. She clutches a folder with paperwork. One of 
           many BLACK AND BROWN WOMEN lingering in the waiting area--
           some try to quiet their restless children, some await their 
           fate lost in far away thoughts...

           A COUNSELOR peeks her head out of an office. 

                                 COUNSELOR 
                        Aisha Bâ! Aisha--

           Aisha scrambles, grabbing her belongings.

           INT. FAMILY CENTER OFFICE - MANHATTAN - DAY

           Aisha watches the Counselor rifle through her paperwork, 
           pulling various documents from a folder. The Counselor’s eyes 
           dart between a computer screen and documents.

                                 COUNSELOR
                        So last time I think I said you 
                        don’t need a green card or a Social 
                        Security number to register Kofi. 

                                 AISHA
                        I was so happy to hear that. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 COUNSELOR
                        You brought proof of address but 
                        your child must live in the city 
                        before you can register. Is he a 
                        resident yet?

                                 AISHA
                        Not yet, but he’ll be here very 
                        soon. 

                                 COUNSELOR 
                        Come back once he gets here. For 
                        now, I’ll bump you up the waitlist.  

           The counselor slides Aisha’s folder of paperwork back across 
           the table. 

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you.

                                 KOFI (PRELAP)
                        Hi Mummy. Don’t worry. I’m fine. I 
                        will see you soon!

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Aisha removes her shoes, pressing her phone to her ear. She 
           plays the voicemail from Kofi again. 

                                 KOFI (O.S.)
                        Hi Mummy. Don’t worry. I’m fine. I 
                        will see you soon!

           As soon as she takes Chloe’s shoes off, the girl slips 
           through her fingers, darting into the condo. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Dad? Daddy are you here?!

                                 AISHA
                        Chloe!

           Aisha runs after Chloe but loses her as she disappears into a 
           nearby room.

           INT/EXT. CONDO - ADAM’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Aisha pauses at the door’s threshold. Light cascades from the 
           room and the sound of ADAM’S VOICE intimates a very important 
           phone call. 

           Aisha knocks. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 ADAM
                        Come in.

           Aisha steps in to see Chloe bouncing on her father’s lap. 

                                 AISHA
                            (re: Chloe)
                        She’s tired.

                                 ADAM
                        Wanna nap, piglet

           Chloe shakes her head no but her weary eyes betray her.

           Adam hands Chloe to Aisha’s outstretched arms.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Before I forget...

           Adam rifles through paperwork. Finds it. Hands a white 
           envelope to Aisha.  

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Amy’s working late but I know today 
                        is supposed to be payday? 

                                 AISHA
                        Yes. Thank you.

           She balances Chloe in one hand and the envelope in the other. 

           INT. CONDO - CHLOE'S ROOM - LATER

           Chloe fights sleep. She reaches for Aisha, wrapping her arms 
           around her neck. Aisha hugs back but Chloe won’t let her go. 

                                 CHLOE
                        No. Lie down with me!

                                 AISHA
                        Chloe I can’t. It’s not my nap 
                        time. C'est ton temps de sieste

           Her face turning beet red, Chloe starts to cry. Aisha 
           relents, curling up beside her. Chloe clings to Aisha, 
           nestling into her as though trying to climb into her skin. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Chloe...

           The child ignores her, pulling at Aisha, fingers ripping at 
           skin. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Ow. Stop that!

           She peels Chloe off her. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        What is the matter with you?

           Chloe rolls on her side. Defiant, but sleepy. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Je ne veux you to leave me for him.

                                 AISHA
                        For who? I’m here now.

           Desperate for Chloe to sleep,  Aisha whisper sings the 
           familiar native lullaby to Chloe, stroking the girl’s cheek.

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                            (Wolof)
                        Oh my baby, my little baby, who can 
                        calm you down? Oh my baby, my 
                        little baby who can calm you down 
                        and bring you to Saloum...

           Chloe finally drifts to sleep. Aisha takes the moment to 
           herself to rifle through the envelope. She shakes her head in 
           disbelief. 

           Her pay is short. 

           INT. CONDO - HALLWAY

           Aisha and Adam collide in the dark hallway. He catches her. 
           Their proximity tense.

                          AISHA
           Sorry...
                                                        ADAM
                                            I was just about to come get 
                                            you. Hungry?

           INT. CONDO - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           A feast. Thai food beckons from the counter. Aisha’s stomach 
           growls.

                                 ADAM
                        Can’t finish this all myself. 

                                 AISHA
                        Are you sure?

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 ADAM
                        Eat. Please. 

           They stand-eat, neither getting too comfortable. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Got it extra spicy. Amy swears 
                        spicy food is bad. “Dulls the 
                        tastebuds.”

                                 AISHA
                        Adam...

           Adam stops mid chew to look at Aisha. 

                                 ADAM
                        Uh oh. Why does it sound like I’m 
                        in trouble? 

                                 AISHA
                        Were you able to talk to Amy? She’s 
                        hard to get a hold of. 

                                 ADAM
                        What is it? 

           Aisha moves food around the plate--her appetite waning. She 
           reveals her work binder. Flips to her meticulous note taking: 
           hours of overtime unaccounted for. 

                                 AISHA
                        The thing is...I need the rest of 
                        the money to bring my son here. 

           Adam stops eating mid chew. 

                                 ADAM
                        Your son? 

                                 AISHA
                        His name is Kofi.

                                 ADAM
                        Holy shit. What else don’t we know 
                        about you?

                                 AISHA
                        He will be 7 in a few days. 

           Aisha studies Adam. Defiant. Fearless. 

           Adam rubs his jaw. Thinks.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 ADAM
                        Tell you what, I’ll advance you 
                        some of the money until we figure 
                        this out. Things have been a little 
                        tight...for everyone. 

           Aisha beams as Adam momentarily disappears. She catches her 
           reflection in a nearby mirror. Studies herself.  

           Adam returns with cash. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        I could go to the ATM but this is a 
                        start...

           Aisha hesitates, takes the cash. Without thinking she hugs 
           Adam. He hugs her back. 

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you. Thank you. You have no 
                        idea...

           They part too slowly. Adam seizes the opportunity, leans in 
           for a long desired kiss, pressing his lips to Aisha’s. 

           Stunned, Aisha let’s him for a few seconds, but something 
           overtakes her--

           Adam pulls away sharply, touching his lip. She bit him. Hard. 

                                 ADAM
                        Shit. I guess I deserved that, huh?
                            (beat)
                        You can’t tell Amy about this...the 
                        money. She’s a little too by the 
                        book sometimes. Might complicate 
                        things for you.

           A PHONE RINGS. Aisha instinctively checks hers but it’s 
           Adam’s. He presses the phone to his ear, seamlessly falling 
           into work mode, unfazed. He sucks the soreness of his bottom 
           lip.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Hey Scott. Yeah. The exhibit would 
                        be a huge step...

           Searching for Nanny Cams, Aisha steals the opportunity to 
           leave.

           INT. CONDO - MOVING ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Hands count money. Aisha mouths the amount as she flips 
           through the bills. 

           She smiles to herself, closer to her goal. 

           Aisha stares at her reflection. Her face fractured by the 
           elevator mirrors. She wipes the residue of guilt off her 
           mouth.

           INT. YMCA POOL - DAY

           Swimming lessons for BABIES.

           Aisha participates hands on. She trails through the water, 
           behind Chloe’s SWIMMING TEACHER, snaking their way among 
           OTHER SWIMMERS. 

           Chloe’s small legs kick in and out of the water. 

           Momentarily distracted, Aisha drifts away. Compelled to be 
           underwater, she sinks lower in the pool until her eyes are 
           all we see above water. 

           Looking out at the disjointed world: fractured by a slice of 
           water, Aisha submerges herself fully-- pushing herself to the 
           bottom of the pool.

           She holds her breath for as long as she can, then thrusts 
           herself up--EXPLODING OUT OF WATER. As she sucks in air.

           She Turns 360 degrees, realizing she’s suddenly alone in the 
           blue water of the pool.  

           A MURKY FIGURE appears behind her. Aisha turns to face it. 
           Finally recognizing her in all her glory: 

           MAMI WATA. 

           Closer now. 

           The Mer-Woman’s amphibious EYES kick back light, like a 
           coyote caught in headlights.

           Aisha closes her eyes, wills herself to control her 
           breathing. 

           She opens them again, startled to see a monstrous but eerily 
           beautiful mirror reflection of herself peering back at her 
           with those telltale, wet alien eyes.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           She tries to keep one eye on the Mer-Woman’s dark, iridescent 
           tail snaking beneath the water. 

           The mermaid woman leans in closer to Aisha, as though she’s 
           about to kiss her. 

           Unable to move, Aisha looks in horror at the nictitating 
           membrane that flicks across the creature’s eye as it blinks.

           The Mer-woman wraps her tale around Aisha’s legs, SUDDENLY 
           RIPPING HER BENEATH THE WATER’S SURFACE. 

           Two bodies. Intertwined. Jolted underwater. Descending to the 
           bottom of a depthless sea, the creature’s tail envelopes 
           Aisha, like an anaconda squeezing life from her body. 

           Bubbles rise to the surface as Aisha screams, being dragged 
           deeper and deeper and deeper...

           QUICK POP:

           Aisha curled in fetal position in a clawfoot tub.

           QUICK POP:

           A full brown stomach marked with the a black line from navel 
           to vagina--the pregnant belly of a woman half immersed in 
           water. 

           QUICK POP:

           A PLUMP BROWN BABY, fat wrists and ankles adorned with gold 
           bracelets that ring out with every jerk of her new movements. 

           The baby yawns and stretches with life.

                                                              CUT TO:

           Aisha jolts up from the clammy cement of the poolside, 
           desperately coughing up water. A LIFEGUARD leans away from 
           her. His work done. He breathes a sigh of relief.  

           Disoriented, catching her breath, unsure of how much time 
           passed, her searching eyes find Chloe, shivering under a 
           strangers towel. 

           Chloe mouths to Aisha, “I won’t tell.” She holds up her wet 
           pinky finger. 

           EXT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - DAY

           Gloved fingers delicately wrap plant bulbs with chicken wire.

           Kathleen, though strong, exerts some effort to stand. She 
           appraises her work of keeping squirrels from destroying her 
           plants. An old lady in her personal urban jungle.

           Sensing something, Kathleen turns to find Aisha lingering at 
           her Brownstone gate. 

           INT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Aisha raises a glass of ice cold water to her lips. She 
           drinks for some time surprised at the magnitude of her own 
           thirst. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Anansi, Mami Wata--They are figures 
                        of survival and resistance for 
                        oppressed people. They challenge 
                        the dominant order, subverting it 
                        through chaos, anarchy...creative 
                        energy. They refuse to be ruled by 
                        the human or the divine and operate 
                        on the boundaries between two 
                        worlds, refusing to submit to the 
                        laws of either...

                                 AISHA
                        I just...wish I knew what they 
                        wanted from me. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        That, my dear, I can’t tell you.
                            (beat)
                        I had to learn the hard way. 

           Aisha glances at a photograph of MALIK’S MOTHER/KATHLEEN’S 
           DAUGHTER. Kathleen follows Aisha’s gaze. 

                                 AISHA
                        She was beautiful. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Losing her almost broke me, but I 
                        had to forgive myself. I didn’t 
                        fail her. The system did. She 
                        wasn’t meant to be held down here. 
                        She was meant to fly...

           Kathleen knows Aisha wants more, needs to hear more...

                                 KATHLEEN (CONT'D)
                        She started threatening to hurt 
                        others, herself. A manic episode 
                        like I’d never seen.

                        I wasn’t so much scared for myself. 
                        I was scared for Malik. He was just 
                        a small boy then. 

           Kathleen swallows. 

                                 KATHLEEN (CONT'D)
                        So, I called the police... 

           Aisha’s presence no longer registering, Kathleen’s mind slips 
           into the cave mouths of memory.

                                 KATHLEEN (CONT'D)
                        Cops didn’t ask questions, didn’t 
                        care. Stormed in with their 
                        preconceived notions ready to rage. 
                        Slammed Gloria down like a rabid 
                        animal, exposed her body. 
                        Handcuffed her. Started to tase her 
                        so I threw myself between them. 
                        Tried to use my body as a shield. 
                            (beat)
                        As they drove off in that car, in 
                        her eyes I saw something had 
                        shifted that was never coming back.

           Tears in Aisha’s eyes, little fragments of diamond.

                                 AISHA
                        I’m sorry Kathleen. I am so sorry. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        The spirits can equip us with 
                        resilience...escape...

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           Perched on a park bench, Aisha stares straight as Chloe rides 
           a scooter back and forth--in and out of Aisha’s field of 
           vision. 

           Chloe’s mouth opens but sound doesn’t emanate. 

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        ...but the spirits’ tools aren’t 
                        always kind. 

           Everything moves in slow motion, Aisha’s gaze fixed across 
           the street as she studies...

                        Sometimes they want blood...

           Ceramic filled molars gleam in the sun as red glossed lips 
           part, revealing full teeth. We peer into the open mouths of a 
           table of LAUGHING UPPER CLASS WOMEN. 

           Sunglass covered eyes twinkle, reveling in privilege.  

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           CLOSE ON AISHA. 

                                 KATHLEEN (V.O.)
                        One can never really define good 
                        and evil. Sometimes good looks like 
                        evil; sometimes evil looks like 
                        good. You never really know what it 
                        is. It depends on what uses you put 
                        it to. My question for you, Aisha: 
                        How do you use your rage? 

           We dance on Aisha’s empty eyes. Fermented scorn turning to

           Aisha peers into a sparse fridge. Chloe by her side. 

                                 AISHA
                        Que Voulez-vous manger? Tell me 
                        what you want to eat?

                                 CHLOE
                        Chebu jën!

           Aisha shakes her head, closing the fridge. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           Aisha pulls her African food out of the oven. Chloe can’t 
           contain her excitement as she bangs her fork on the counter.

                                 CHLOE (CONT'D)
                        Manger! Manger! 

           Aisha blows on a steaming spoonful of rice before hovering it 
           before Chloe’s mouth. Chloe opens wide, happily cleaning the 
           spoon. 

           Drained of color, Chloe stops chewing. She stares at 
           something, someone behind Aisha. 

           Aisha turns behind her to see what Chloe sees...

           AMY.

           Puffy, bloodshot eyes. Amy’s made up face can’t hide the fact 
           that she’s been crying. 

                                 AMY
                        What are you feeding her?

           Aisha, unable to hide her surprise, is momentarily frozen. 

                                 AISHA
                        I didn’t know you were here. 

                                 AMY
                        That’s not what I asked you, Aisha. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I like it, Mommy. 

           Chloe innocently holds up a heaping spoonful of rice. Amy 
           snatches the spoon from Chloe’s hand, sending rice flying 
           everywhere. 

                                 AMY
                        One of the few times I’m home sick 
                        and I find you feeding my daughter 
                        food that is one: way too spicy for 
                        her tummy and two: blowing germs on 
                        her food? What is in this? What if 
                        she’s allergic? How long has this 
                        been going on? When you have your 
                        own kids you can feed them whatever 
                        you want!

           Aisha stares at Amy.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Say something!

           Instead of saying anything Aisha wrenches open the empty 
           fridge and yanks out molded blueberries, wilted kale, a 
           bottle of Gluten Free Kids Multivitamins...

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

                                 AISHA
                        Should I feed her this, or this, or 
                        this...?

           Amy opens her mouth to speak but stops. Aisha rifles through 
           her purse and pulls out a small stack of receipts paper 
           clipped together. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Since I started I’ve been buying 
                        her food or giving her some of my 
                        own. Didn’t you ever wonder how 
                        your child was eating or you were 
                        too busy to care? 

           Amy crouches down to Chloe’s eye level. 

                                 AMY
                        Go pick a book for Mommy to read to 
                        you. Any country you want. 

           Chloe looks at Aisha for reassurance. The sting of this is 
           not lost on Amy. 

                                 AISHA
                        Va dans ta chambre. Let Mommy and I 
                        talk. 

           Chloe nods, scooping up her ipad. The women wait for Chloe to 
           disappear. 

                                 AMY
                        Look, sorry if I offended you but 
                        the implication that I’m not a good 
                        mother is too much--

                                 AISHA
                        I didn’t say that.

           Amy hurls Aisha’s food into a nearby trash can.  

                                 AMY
                        No more of this shit in my house--

           As Amy turns to unleash on Aisha, Aisha slaps her. The sting 
           echoes. Amy gasps, holding her cheek. 

           She transitions from shock, to humor--giggling then outright 
           laughing in Aisha’s face. 

           Unhinged.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Aisha watches her, on guard as Amy plops down on a nearby 
           couch. She stares into space, still laughing, tears stinging 
           her cheeks. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        That was brave of you. 

           Aisha pulls out her work binder. 

                                 AISHA
                        Since I have your attention, I’ve 
                        documented all my overtime hours-- 

                                 AMY
                        Did you subtract the hours you 
                        spent having lunch and dinner with 
                        my husband?

           Aisha closes the binder, instinctively searching for 
           cameras...

                                 AISHA
                        My time is not free, you know. 

                                 AMY
                        We’ll work something out--

                                 AISHA
                        You keep saying that. I have a 
                        child too. A son. Kofi. 

           Amy really looks at Aisha. Lucid. Truly sees her. 

                                 AMY
                        I knew you did, from the moment I 
                        met you.

                        This is my third miscarriage in two 
                        years.

           Amy smiles broadly. Hopeful.  

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe it’s a sign, telling me to 
                        get out while I can. 

                                 AISHA
                        I don’t know what you want me to 
                        say. 

                                 AMY
                        Say you’ll do an overnight for me 
                        tomorrow. I need to get away.

                        Can’t think clearly in this fucking 
                        overpriced shoebox.  

           Aisha shakes her head no, at the end of her rope...

                                 AISHA
                        I can’t.

                                 AMY
                        Tomorrow night. Seven to seven. Two 
                        hundred flat rate is very 
                        reasonable.

                                 AISHA
                        Three hundred. Plus the overtime. 

           Amy stares off into space. 

                                 AMY
                        You drive a hard bargain my lady. 

                                 AISHA
                            (emboldened)
                        In advance. 

           Amy scoffs. 

                                 AMY
                        You think we just have cash laying 
                        around. I’ll withdraw money for 
                        Adam to pay you in the morning. It 
                        all comes from me, anyway. Pinky 
                        swear. 

           Amy holds up her little finger. Aisha, impassive, but she 
           obliges, hooking her finger in Amy’s. 

           Aisha slides into her shoes, unceremoniously. Amy stares 
           ahead vacantly. 

           Chloe explodes from nowhere, as if she was lurking in the 
           shadows. She clings to Aisha’s leg. Holding on for dear life. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        That’s enough, Clo. Come here to 
                        Mommy. 

                                 CHLOE
                        NO!

           Aisha nudges Chloe towards her mother. 

                                 AISHA
                        I’ll be back Chloe. Écoute ta mère

                        Come to Mommy please! Don’t you 
                        want me to take you to the

                        me! He can’t have you!

           Chloe clings to Aisha defiantly. Aisha tries to pry the child 
           off but she won’t let go. Amy finally wrenches Chloe off 
           Aisha as the child kicks and punches her mother. She’s 
           throwing a full blown tantrum unlike any we’ve seen before. 
           Tears stream down her red face.

                        I don’t want you! I want Aisha! I 
                        want grandmaaaaa...

           Aisha cringes, sliding into the...

           EXT. CONDO - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Closing the door behind her. 

           She lingers, shutting her eyes--inhales and exhales sharply 
           as she listens to Chloe’s cries echoing. Aisha speed walks 
           towards the elevators. 

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - AISHA’S ROOM - EVENING

           Aisha packs an overnight bag. She stops, frozen in her tracks 
           by Kofi’s framed photo resting among his gifts--his face 
           mysteriously water stained beyond recognition.

           INT. HARLEM APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Aisha, earphones in her ear. The call rings endlessly...

                        Wow, Mari! I didn’t think you’d 
                        pick up. I’ve been trying to call 
                        you.

                        Where is Kofi?

           Silence. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

                                 MARI (O.S.)
                        I’m here. You never ask about me, 
                        you know that. Never. Anyway, he’s 
                        with Musa. He wanted to spend the 
                        night. 

                                 AISHA
                        Sorry...Are you ok?

                                 MARI (O.S.)
                        I’m fine. 

                                 AISHA
                        I don’t really like him sleeping 
                        out--

                                 MARI (O.S.)
                        ...he said...call you...

           Static overtakes the call. 

                                 AISHA
                        Hello...Mari...

           EXT. BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Outside of the illuminated Brownstone, peer through a window 
           to see Kathleen leading Aisha, Malik and Bishop through an 
           intricate dance routine mirrored on a large screen video game 
           console. 

           Malik gyrates his hips hitting every beat as the foursome 
           basks in momentary joy, playing in their peaceful familial 
           microcosm. 

           INT. BROWNSTONE - MALIK’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Malik. Deep in sleep. Aisha wide awake. Restless. 

           She stares at the back of Malik’s head, then at his still 
           chest, searching for indicators of life. She hovers her hand 
           in front of his mouth as he exhales, feeling his breath on 
           her hand.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           She turns away from him draped in the relentlessness of 
           insomnia. 

           She closes her eyes, willing sleep. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           The CREAK of a door. Aisha’s eyes dart open, unsure of how 
           long she slept. 

           Aisha stares at Malik’s bedroom entrance, fixating on the 
           door...it doesn’t move. 

           Aisha’s petrified gaze follows the direction of a sick 
           CRUNCHING SOUND. She glides sheets off her body. 

           She makes to scream but can’t muster a sound as a SNAKE COILS 
           AROUND HER THIGH, CURLING BETWEEN HER LEGS as it SHEDS its 
           SKIN. 

           An aborted gasp dissipates as tears stream down her face.

           She turns to Malik--reaching. A silent plea for help, but 
           stops short... 

           In lieu of Malik’s body is a writhing mass of hair-like 
           tendrils: brimming, throbbing. The mass gives way to unveil 
           daddy long leg spiders, running over one another--toppling 
           onto the bed, climbing over Aisha’s skin... 

           Aisha kicks at the spiders, fighting air as she falls 
           backwards off the bed. 

                                 MALIK (O.S.)
                        Hey! Hey!

           INT. MALIK’S ROOM - DAY 

           Malik leans over the edge of his bed looking down at Aisha on 
           the floor still scrambling backwards, shoving invisible 
           spiders off her.  

           He grips her wrists, fists still balled. 

           Aisha comes to, breathless. Tears stream down her face. 

           Malik stands her upright, hugging her tightly. 

                                 MALIK
                        Shh. It’s ok. You’re good. Your 
                        feet are on the ground...ten toes 
                        on the floor. Say it.

                            (sucking air)
                        Ten...toes...on the floor. 

                                 MALIK
                        Not gonna lie. You got me pretty 
                        good, Ali.

           Malik notes bruises on Aisha’s inner thighs--visible in the 
           sunlight streaming into his room.

           INT. MALIK’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Aisha’s fingers hover over Malik’s cosmetics: shaving cream, 
           pomade, brushes, coconut oil.

           A KNOCK at the door. 

           Malik hands Aisha a towel. 

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you. 

                                 MALIK
                        Let me know if you need anything 
                        else.

           INT. MALIK’S BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

           Aisha revels in the hot water cascading against her skin. She 
           exhales, taking her time in the shower for once.

           INT/EXT. CONDO - DAY

           From inside the condo, the JANGLE of KEYS resonates--condo 
           entrance being unlocked. Aisha pushes the door open, 
           surveying the eerily quiet space.  

           Shoes robotically peel off feet. Aisha braces herself for the 
           night ahead. 

           INT. CONDO - GUEST ROOM - DAY

           Light flickers on. Greeted by the sparse room, showing no 
           history of her inhabitance, Aisha drops her overnight bag and 
           flops down on the immaculately made bed. 

           She eyes the ceiling. Black specks of mold now surround the 
           web-like water stain like encroaching ants.

           INT. CONDO - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY

           The work binder flips open. Aisha scrolls through pages, 
           finally landing on one demarcated by Amy. Aisha scans the 
           evening to-do list. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           Aisha washes a small pile of dishes, mindlessly humming to 
           herself.  

           She scrubs marble countertops meticulously. 

           Aisha loads laundry into a drier. She lingers before the 
           machine, staring at her reflection in the spinning abyss of 
           strangers’ clothes. 

           INT. CONDO GUEST ROOM - DAY

           Aisha falls back on the bed, closing her eyes momentarily--
           her body salient against white sheets.

           The ceiling water stain actively snakes its way along the 
           plaster, sprawling outwards like a web. Black mold throbs as 
           a lone spider crawls from the mass, ambling its way down the 
           wall towards Aisha’s sleeping body. 

           The spider creeps over Aisha’s face, crawling into Aisha’s 
           open mouth. 

           Aisha darts awake choking as small arms wrap around Aisha’s 
           neck too tightly. Chloe clings to her, seemingly leaping from 
           no where.  

                                 CHLOE 
                        Aisha! 

           Aisha pries Chloe off her. Instantly looking to the ceiling. 

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        That’s enough Clo! Let Aisha 
                        breathe for a sec. 

           Chloe releases her grasp, plopping down beside Aisha. Adam 
           lingers in the doorway of the guest room. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Yeah. That’s getting pretty bad. 

                                 AISHA
                        You see it right?

                                 ADAM
                        The mold. Yeah. Sorry about that. 
                        Didn’t realize it had gotten that 
                        bad. It comes and goes. Totally get 
                        if you want to sleep on the couch 
                        tonight? Gonna have someone look at 
                        it tomorrow.

                                 AISHA
                        I might do that. 

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll lay out some sheets for you. 
                        Gonna run some errands.

           Adam makes to leave, but backtracks. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        By any chance, did Amy mention 
                        where she was going?

                                 AISHA
                        She didn’t tell me. 

           A perfunctory smile from Adam. He leaves without speaking, 
           moving in the liquid way that is his custom.

                                 CHLOE
                        J’ai faim, Aisha!

           Aisha, exhausted, faces the small child beside her.

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Socked feet slide back and forth on bamboo hardwood floors.  
           Chloe SCREAMS at the top of her lungs--her shrill yells 
           battling with COMMERCIALS BLARING on TV as she sprints.

           INT. CONDO - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Freshly boiled red lentil pasta trickles into a kiddie bowl.

                                 CHLOE 
                        LAAAA LAAAAA LAAAAAA!

           Aisha pours homemade tomato sauce on top of the slimy 
           fusilli. She rubs her temple, eyeing Chloe sliding back and 
           forth...

           Aisha turns her attention to a detailed note clipped to the 
           fridge. She grabs a box of nutritional yeast and sprinkles it 
           on top of the concoction. 

           Steam rises from the slop. 

           Chloe turns the volume up even higher.

                                                              CUT TO:

           AISHA GRIPS THE TV REMOTE, HER STERN GAZE TRAINED ON CHLOE. 

           Chloe hovers a spoon of pasta to her face. She sniffs it, 
           pursing her lips in disdain.

                                 CHLOE
                        Je ne veux--

                                 AISHA
                        This is what your Mommy wants you 
                        to eat tonight. This is what you’re 
                        eating. Pas de dispute.

                            (whiny)
                        But I want your food!

                                 AISHA
                        Please.

                                 CHLOE
                        No!

                                 AISHA
                        Chloe you have to--

           Chloe shoves the bowl of food, sending it crashing to the 
           floor, sending morsels of red slop splattering on Aisha’s 
           face like viscous blood.  

           Aisha gasps. Chloe just stares at her. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Pick it up!

           Chloe folds her arms, defiant. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Pick it up now! I am not your maid.

           Aisha extends a rag. Chloe turns her back to Aisha. Rage 
           simmering to the surface, Aisha reaches out to grab Chloe but 
           stops herself--hands hovering in a liminal space of 
           indecision. 

           Aisha scans the space for visible Nanny cams. 

           Weary, impatient, Aisha takes Chloe’s hand, forcing her to 
           grasp the rag. She controls Chloe like a puppeteer, using her 
           limbs to manually clean the mess...

           SOUND OF RUNNING WATER. 

           INT. CONDO - GUEST BATHROOM - EVENING

           Chloe, wrapped in her kiddie bathrobe, quietly sulks as she 
           watches Aisha run her bath. 

           BENEATH THE WATER’S SURFACE: Aisha’s hand submerges. Her 
           fingers graze the bottom of the tub, testing the temperature. 

                                 AISHA
                        Ok, Chloe time for...

           Aisha turns to find Chloe gone. 

           Behind Aisha, an oversized arthropod leg curls from the tub, 
           gripping ceramic...

           INT. CONDO VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS

           Aisha searches for Chloe, progressively getting more frantic. 

                                 AISHA
                        Chloe!

           She rifles through Chloe’s room, tossing stuffed animals 
           aside. Aisha peeks into various rooms. She rips open 
           cabinets. 

           EXT. CONDO - NIGHT

           Rising panic, Aisha stares into empty hallways.

           A CHILD’S MEWLING CRY stops Aisha in her tracks. Sends her 
           hurtling back into...

           INT. CONDO - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           Aisha grabs a knife, terror riding her face.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           She creeps towards the child’s cry emanating from--

           ADAM’S OFFICE. 

                                 CHILD
                        Help...me. Help me! Helllp...I 
                        can’t breathe...can’t...

           It sounds like Chloe’s voice, at first... 

           INT. CONDO - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Chest heaving, knife outstretched, Aisha walks in the 
           direction of the child’s pleas. 

                                 AISHA
                        Chloe?

           The pleas rise to a deafening crescendo, morphing into a 
           sickening symphony of sound. 

           An INHUMAN VOICE ECHOES, singing THE FAMILIAR AFRICAN 
           LULLABY...like a vintage record player.

                                 VOICE
                        Oh my baby-baby, my little baaaaby-
                        baby, who can calm you dowwwwwn-

                        baaaaaaaby who can calm you down 
                        and bring you back hooooooome...

           The timbre of the voice gets deeper, melting into a haunting 
           baritone... 

                                 VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Oh my baby-baby, my little baby-
                        baby, who can calm you down-down 
                        down...

           Aisha forces herself to breathe as she creeps closer to the 
           door.

           INT./EXT. ADAM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Steeling herself Aisha touches the knob...turning it ever so 
           slightly. Knife still clenched in her other hand. 

           The door creaks open as she slides into the room. 

                                 AISHA
                        (a whisper)

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Aisha’s gaze hones in on the ominous photo of the BLACK TEEN 
           PROTESTOR surrounding by a halo of fire--his arms 
           outstretched as though nailed to an invisible cross. 

           An intangible thread pulls her closer to the image. 

           The TEEN is drenched in sweat and moon, unwavering, 
           ascendant, all movement and muscle--fearless. 

           His mouth is contorted in a soundless battle cry. 

           A NETWORK OF OTHERWORLDLY BLOOD CURDLING SCREAMS DEAFEN AISHA 

           Hypnotized, Aisha stares at the still image, her face 
           contorted in torment. 

           We hold on the eerie image. Fire dances in Aisha’s eyes--
           reflected back at her. Flames leap from the still image 
           breaking the fourth wall. 

           Blood drips at Aisha’s feet, snapping her out of this waking 
           nightmare. 

           She looks down to see her hand wrapped around the blade of 
           the knife, the softness of her palm sliced by sharpness.

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        No...no...no...

           Aisha runs out of Adam’s office, slipping on overflowing 
           water trickling out of the...

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           FALLING HARD against the wet tile floor.

                                                              CUT TO:

           Surroundings gradually fade into focus. Aisha props herself 
           up--remembering. Water overflows onto the bathroom floor, 
           pooling around her feet.

           Aisha approaches the brimming tub. Turns off the water.

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        What...do you want? WHAT DO YOU 
                        WANT FROM ME?!

           A crimson viscus of blood at the bottom of the tub catches 
           Aisha’s eye.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           An UNSEEN FORCE sucks her into water’s surface, thrusting 
           Aisha’ head beneath the water. She screams underwater, 
           sending bubbles rising in a suffocating frenzy. 

           The force yanks her head up, allowing her to suck in oxygen. 

           She spots the bloody knife on the floor. Grabs it, before 
           being plunged underneath again. 

           Aisha flails, raising the knife. 

           Her CELL PHONE RINGS SHRILLY from another room, snapping her 
           to. The INCESSENT RING TONE grants a gift of lucidity.

           Teeth chattering, body shivering, Aisha holds the knife mid 
           air. A drop of water pools at the blade’s sharp tip hovering 
           just above...

           CHLOE.

           Whimpering. In a corner of the tub. Directly in the knife’s 
           path. 

           Aisha drops the knife, scooping Chloe out of the tub. 

           She turns off the tub.

           She studies Chloe desperately. Chloe peers back at her, 
           surprisingly fearless. Aisha spins her around, touches her 
           face. She’s unharmed. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m ok. 

           Aisha chokes back tears, cocooning Chloe in a warm towel. She 
           hugs the small child.  

                                 AISHA
                        I’m sorry Chloe. I don’t know what 
                        happened...

           Aisha holds Chloe, rocking back and forth, unsure if she’s 
           consoling the child or herself. 

           INT. CHLOE’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Sleep chasing her, Chloe’s small chest rises and falls. Aisha 
           watches her intently. 

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s not your fault. He’s just 
                        jealous.

                                 AISHA
                        Who is jealous?

                                 CHLOE
                        Kofi. 

           Chloe’s eyes become tiny slits. She’s falling asleep. 

                                 AISHA
                        Who told you about Kofi? Did Daddy 
                        tell you about him?

           Chloe shakes her head, No.

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Who told you, Chloe?

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m sleepy, Aisha. 

           Aisha let’s Chloe sleep--allows her to shut her eyes, leaving 
           Aisha alone with a myriad swirling questions. 

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Her cell phone the sole source of light, Aisha stares up at 
           the condo ceiling, sleeplessness tormenting her. Her bandaged 
           hand hangs off the couch. 

                                 AISHA (V.O.)
                        Oh my baby-baby, my little baaaaby- 
                        baby,Aja, who can calm you dowwwwwn- 
                        down down? Oh my baby, my little 
                        baaaaaaaby Ajaaaa who can calm you 
                        down and bring you back 
                        hooooooome...

           Aisha’s eyelids gradually draw closed. 

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM  - MORNING

           Aggressive sunlight pervades the curtain-less, window 
           ensconced room.  Aisha sits up. Stretches and yawns. Lingers 
           on the edge of the couch for some time, remembering... 

           A long EERIE SILENCE broken by the buzz of an incoming text 
           message. Aisha reads it. 

           ADAM: “Took piglet to breakfast. Didn’t want to wake you.”

           INT. CONDO - KITCHEN - MORNING

           A white envelope and a letter linger on the kitchen counter. 

           ON CASH as Aisha rifles through the envelope. She counts out 
           money. Beams in triumph. 

           Overnight bag in hand, Aisha wrangles the condo keys out of 
           her pocket, placing them on the counter decisively. 

           Her eyes search the room, landing on a Nanny cam. She stares 
           directly into it. We see her pixelated image from the 
           camera’s POV. 

           She leaves the frame. 

           INT. WESTERN UNION

           Long acrylic nails click clack against one another as they 
           count out hundred dollar bills. 

           Nikki the Teller smiles at Aisha through the glass. 

                                 NIKKI
                        You good, girl! 

           Giddy, Aisha skips out of the Western Union. 

           EXT. HARLEM STREETS - DAY

           On Malik’s bike, Aisha grips him tightly as they ride in slow 
           motion. 

           We hear the following conversation in Voice Over. 

                                 AISHA
                        Is there anything else you need. 

                                 MARI
                        No. Tickets are booked...Kofi 
                        wanted to speak to you but he’s 
                        napping now. 

                                 AISHA
                        Don’t wake him. Call before you 
                        take off. 

                                 MARIATOU
                        I will try. 

                                 AISHA

                        Yes?

                        See you soon. 

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - EVENING

           Malik flanks Aisha.

           She clutches Kofi’s thick bubble coat, lingering at the gate 
           where Kofi and Mariatou are expected to arrive. 

           She looks on as families greet loved ones with perishable 
           gifts and nostalgic embraces. 

           She waits. 

           And waits. 

           Malik paces, helping her search for Mariatou and Kofi in the 
           crowd. 

           Finally her gaze lands on a child in the crowd who resembles 
           Kofi. 

           As she darts through a mass of people dread washes over her 
           as she realizes it’s not him. 

           She looks on as the boy is scooped away by his mother. 

           Evening turns to night. Aisha listens to her call ring 
           endlessly-- 

                                 MARIATOU (O.S.)
                        Hi, how are you...

                                 AISHA
                        Mari--

                                 MARIATOU (O.S.)
                        Ha just kidding! You’ve reached 
                        Mariatou. Leave a message after the-

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - VARIOUS - DAY 

           Aisha approaches a series of AIRPORT WORKERS. She shows them 
           pictures of Kofi on her phone. They all grant her various 
           renditions of unknowing.

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - DAY 

           Aisha paces as an AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE types information 
           into a computer.

                                 AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
                        The flight arrived on time. Some of 
                        the luggage was delayed so there 
                        might be some stragglers but 
                        everyone was cleared. No one was 
                        detained. 

                                 AISHA
                        But my son and my cousin were on 
                        the flight...

                                 AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
                        Miss, there’s not much else I can 
                        do. Is there any other family--

           Aisha grabs her bag and storms out of the office. Malik runs 
           behind her, quietly thanking the representative. 

           EXT. JFK AIRPORT - AIRTRAIN - NIGHT

           Aisha stares into space. Malik beside her, unsure of what to 
           say or do. A quiet urge overcomes her. 

           She tries Mariatou again, pressing the phone to her ear. 
           Listening. 

           The sound of a phone ringing nearby arrests her attention.

           Instinctively Aisha stands up, floating towards the ring. 
           Eyes searching. The distinct ring stops suddenly. just as 
           Mari’s familiar voicemail sings out-- 

                                 MARIATOU (V.O.)
                        Hi, how are you...Ha just kidding! 
                        You’ve reached Mariatou. Leave a 
                        message...

           But Aisha has already dropped the phone away from her ear. 
           Eyes widening in disbelief--impossibility roaring through her 
           mind.

           Her gaze lands on MARIATOU. In the flesh. Rueful but real. 
           The woman we’ve come to recognize in Aisha’s phone, a chimera 
           materialized--the very personification of Aisha’s past 
           colliding with her present.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Mariatou is too busy struggling with her oversized suitcase 
           to notice Aisha breathlessly approaching her. She locks eyes 
           with Aisha just as an Airtrain approaches, thrumming closer.  

           Palpable fear etched in Mariatou’s face as she stands to face 
           Aisha, close enough to touch her... 

                                 AISHA
                        Where is he? 

           Mariatou tries to back away, her gargantuan suitcase impeding 
           her path. 

                                 MARIATOU
                        Aisha...I...

           Desperation plucks at both women.

                                 AISHA
                        Mari, where is he? Where is Kofi?

           Tears stream down Mariatou’s face. Aisha lost in a colorless 
           rage grabs Mariatou by the collar of her flimsy jacket.  

                                 MARIATOU
                        Please!...Aisha...wanted to tell 
                        you...

                                 AISHA
                        WHERE IS HE?

           Mariatou drops to her knees before Aisha. Begging for 
           forgiveness. 

                                 MARIATOU
                        We looked away only for a little 
                        time...

           QUICK POP:

           Soundlessness. 

           Aisha, pressing BABY KOFI’s head against her chest, sunlight 
           drenching them in a veil of protection. Baby Kofi coos in 
           response to his mother’s loving touch. 

           QUICK POP:

           Aisha’s hands loosening their grasp on Mariatou. Looking up. 
           The canopy of sky above them staggering. 

           Mariatou. Breathless. Wet with tears, sputtering words...

                        Beach...waves were too

                        him...

           QUICK POP:

           Soundlessness.

           Bath water trickles from Aisha’s fingertips onto Baby Kofi’s 
           glowing face. He gifts his mother the most loving of smiles. 
           She kisses his escarpment of cheeks, like plots of land. 

           QUICK POP: 

           Life teeming around her dissipates to noiselessness--Mariatou 
           seemingly in a faraway place still pleads as Aisha floats 
           away. 

           A synaptic breach of the soul. 

           Aisha collapses on the Airtrain platform.

                                                        CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. MALIK’S ROOM - DAY

           Aisha groggily opens her eyes, remembering. She hears a soft 
           susurrus of whispers. Real or imagined, she’s not sure. She 
           drifts back to sleep, clutching Kofi’s winter coat against 
           her chest. 

                                 AISHA (PRELAP) 
                        I just need some air.

           INT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - PARLOR - DAY

           Aisha drinks tea. Puffy, mournful eyes betray her attempt at 
           a consoling smile. Kathleen studies her before sharing a 
           concerned look with Malik. 

                                 KATHLEEN
                        What you need is rest. 

                                 AISHA
                        After this walk. I promise. 

           Aisha places the tea down. Malik and Kathleen on her heels as 
           she makes her way to the door.

           Malik makes to go with her, but Aisha firmly presses her hand 
           to his chest. 

                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        Please. 

           Malik concedes, lingering on brownstone steps. Aisha turns 
           back to grant an affirming smile.

           Kathleen watches her through glass. 

           EXT. HARLEM STREETS - DAY

           Aisha takes in the air. Stares up at burnt orange and red NYC 
           leaves ushering in winter. 

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Aisha opens her eyes. A HERD OF COMMUTERS trample towards 
           her. Some make contact, shoulder bumping her. Unforgiving of 
           her stasis. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           Barreling through a tunnel, wheels spinning, a train flies 
           into the station whooshing inches from--

           Aisha--as she stares into space. Her feet linger at the edge 
           of the train platform. 

           The train slows to a stop. She steps on board. 

           EXT. WEST HARLEM PIERS PARK - DAY

           Bucolic, expansive water. Lenticular clouds roll through a 
           blue sky.

           Aisha: eyes closed, a backpack strapped to her back, steps 
           off a ledge. Her body collides with water, fracturing its 
           surface. 

           A WOMAN SCREAMS. 

           Sunlight refracts off bubbles forming just above the water’s 
           surface as Aisha sinks...

           INT. UNDERWATER - DAY

           Aisha descends, her hair dancing weightlessly around her. 
           Whispers rise to a crescendo as she looks down into endless 
           blackness. 

           Something grazes her face. She looks up. Kofi gazes back at 
           her hovering above her but beneath the water like an aqua 
           angel. 

           He extends a small hand. She reaches for his hand, gripping 
           it with every fiber of her being. She wriggles her body out 
           of the heavy backpack sending it falling to the water’s 
           depths...

           Aisha EXPLODES FROM THE WATER’S SURFACE, gripping a hand that 
           belongs to KATHLEEN: teeth gritted, gripping Aisha by the 
           skin of her clothes. Kathleen struggles with Aisha’s weight. 
           Malik helps guide her drenched body onto land as MEDICS 
           surround Aisha...

                                 KATHLEEN
                        She’s pregnant, please be 
                        careful... 

           Aisha sobs into Kathleen’s chest, gasping for air, as animal 
           cries erupt from her soul.

                                 KATHLEEN (CONT'D)
                        Shhhh...Forgive Yourself. Forgive 
                        yourself...They wanted vengeance, 
                        but they also wanted to tell you he 
                        was gone...

                                                       FADE TO WHITE.

           INT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - DAY 

           LAUGHTER emanates as we snake through the Brownstone, past 
           balloons, streamers...landing on an INTIMATE CROWD of FRIENDS 
           AND FAMILY, including Kathleen, Malik, Sallay.

           They surround Aisha as she rips open baby shower gifts. She 
           looks to be in her third trimester. 

           Sallay claps giddily on the sidelines as Aisha holds up a 
           gift. 

                                 SALLAY
                        That’s me!

                                 AISHA
                        Thank you Sallay.

                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Feeling a bit dizzy, Aisha excuses herself from the 
           celebration, reassuring Malik as she makes her way... 

           EXT. HARLEM BROWNSTONE - DAY

           ...outside, settling at the bottom of her Brownstone steps.

           Aisha exhales deeply, holding her belly. A CAR DOOR SLAM, 
           draws her attention as she studies an INTERRACIAL WHITE/ASIAN 
           COUPLE [30’s] moving into the Brownstone next door.  

           Her gaze lands on a THIN BLACK WOMAN [mid 20’s] trailing 
           behind them. A pale, biracial child [3] is draped over her 
           shoulder, his arms wrapped tightly around her neck. 

           The woman locks eyes with Aisha. Aisha waves warmly in return 
           as the woman slows to a stop before her. 

           Aisha notes a BLACK BOY walking just inches behind the woman.

           Aisha extends her hand. The woman shakes it. 

                                 AISHA
                        Aisha. 

                                 THIN BLACK WOMAN 
                        Yasmine. 

                                 AISHA
                        How old is he?

           Yasmine eyes the sleeping toddler. His pale lids fluttering 
           with dreams. 

                                 YASMINE
                        Timothy is three now.  

                                 AISHA
                        No, your son?

           Yasmine furrows her brow, confused. The black boy smiles at 
           Aisha.

                                 YASMINE
                        How do you know? He’s in Haiti. 
                        Stanley is 8 today. 

                                 AISHA
                        Happy birthday to Stanley. If you 
                        ever need anything, Yasmine, Feel 
                        free to ring our bell. I’m here. 
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)
                                 Cherry Rev. (7/18/20)

           Timothy’s mother calls out for Yasmine. Yasmine grants Aisha 
           a warm but befuddled smile as she re-joins the family. 

           Stanley trails behind Yasmine and Timothy directly in a 
           passing car’s path, dissipating into a puddle as the car 
           passes. 

           Aisha takes a deep breath, cradling her stomach as she 
           alights the brownstone steps. A diaphanous affirmation lurks 
           behind her gaze.

                                 THE END
