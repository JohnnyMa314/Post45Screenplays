           Our movie begins like all movies should. 

           With “Nothing Compares 2 U” by Prince (not Sinéad O'Connor) 
           over black.

                        It's been 7 hours and 13 days

                        Since you took your love away

                        I go out every night and sleep all 
                        day

                        Since you took your love away
           INT. HOLLYWOOD FLOWER SHOP - EVENING (1993)

           PAUL DUERSON futzes with shit at the counter and can’t seem 
           to keep still. Like a kid waiting for the bathroom.

           He’s in his early 40s with stringy, sweaty, brown hair.

           The FLORIST hands him a cheap bouquet. Duerson hangs for a 
           beat too long, smiling, nose breathing. It’s off putting. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD FLOWER SHOP - EVENING

           Duerson walks to his car. The ground is damp, there’s a 
           little drizzle. 

           EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT

           “Nothing Compares 2 U” continues as Duerson drives a tan 
           Buick too fast up Mulholland.

           EST. SOFIA’S ESTATE - NIGHT

           A 1920’s MANSION towers over a massive estate with a long, 
           winding driveway that leads down to the main road. The 
           mansion has a tremendous view of Hollywood and sticks out 
           like a sore thumb.

           The neighbors fucking hate it and for good reason.

           From bird’s eye, we see an atrium in the center of the 
           mansion. It’s a beautiful, open-roofed garden with statues 
           and a pissing cherub fountain at the center.  

           The grounds aren’t as secure as we’d like them to be. No 
           wall, no gate. Anyone could just roll up and kill you.

           INT. DINING ROOM - SOFIA’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Close on a JIGSAW PUZZLE BOX of people on the beach in Maui. 
           A thousand loose pieces next to it on the dining room table. 

           WILLIAM BELL (40s, white, broad) sifts for corners.

           Bell’s got a packed lip and a tin of Skoal beside him. We 
           also notice a NCAA Football championship ring on his finger 
           and a GUN on his belt. 

           A phone rings distantly. 
           INT. BELL’S OFFICE - SOFIA’S MANSION - SECONDS LATER

           A monitor sits on the desk with a live feed of the front 
           steps. Bell enters his crammed office and moves some papers 
           to find the phone. Picks up--

                                 BELL
                        This is Bell.

           INT. BELL’S KITCHEN - INTERCUT

           ABBY (11, black, Bell’s self-assured daughter) sits at the 
           kitchen table with the phone to her ear. She’s got a 
           Pittsburgh Pirates ball cap on backwards. 

                                 ABBY
                        Two scientists walk into a bar... 

           Bell smiles then checks his watch.  

                                 BELL
                        You should be in bed. Where’s Mrs. 
                        Baxter? 

           Behind Abby, MRS. BAXTER (Abby’s 4,000-year-old babysitter) 
           is passed out on a LA-Z-BOY.

                                 ABBY
                        She could be dead. Two scientists 
                        walk into--

                                 BELL
                        What is the point of even having a 
                        babysitter if she’s going to sleep 
                        the whole time?

                                 ABBY
                        I’ve been saying that for years. 
                        It’s not like I’m going to sneak 
                        out. You kinda need friends for 
                        sneaking out to be less lonely than 
                        staying at home.

                                 BELL
                        You have friends. 

                                 ABBY
                        Name them.

                                 BELL
                        Gary and Bob.
                                 ABBY
                        Your football buddies? 

                                 BELL
                        Our football buddies. 

                                 ABBY
                        They don’t count. Can I tell my 
                        joke?

                                 BELL
                        But you get along. 

                                 ABBY
                        It’s not like I’m going to invite 
                        Gary and Bob to my birthday party. 

                                 BELL
                        What birthday party?

                                 ABBY
                        Hypothetical. 

                                 BELL
                        Well, I think they’d be pretty hurt 
                        by that, Abby.

                                 ABBY
                        Dad. 

                                 BELL
                             (smiling)
                        Tell your joke then bed. 

                                 ABBY
                        Two scientists walk into a bar. One 
                        says, “I’ll have H2O, please” and 
                        the other goes, “I’ll have H2O, 
                        too.” The Bartender, who is also a 
                        scientist, gives them their drinks. 
                        Well, dad, I’m sorry to say but the 
                        second scientist died.

           Beat. 

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        The second scientist said “H2O, 
                        too,” dad. H2o2. Hydrogen peroxide. 
                        If you drink it, you die. 

                                 BELL
                        Why is the bartender also a 
                        scientist? 
                                 ABBY
                        Specificity?

                                 BELL
                        Wouldn’t he have a job at a lab or 
                        something? 

                                 ABBY
                        You suck, dad. 

                                 BELL
                        Don’t say “suck.”

           The doorbell rings and it’s startling. 

                                 ABBY
                        Never? In any context?

           END INTERCUT.

           INT. BELL’S OFFICE - SOFIA’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Bell looks at the security monitor and his expression turns 
           serious when he sees Duerson at the door. 

                                 ABBY (ON PHONE)
                        Dad?

           He hangs up. Then, realizing he just hung up on Abby, he 
           quickly picks up-- 

                                 BELL
                        Hello? Shit.

           Oh well. Bell grabs a black windbreaker from the back of the 
           desk chair. It reads “The Depraved Tour” in red cursive on 
           the front and “SECURITY” in block yellow on the back. 

           SLO-MO: HE THROWS IT ON LIKE A FUCKING CAPE

           INT. HALLWAY - SOFIA’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Bell passes a long line of framed movie, album, and concert 
           posters in the hallway. All with the same young woman, Sofia 
           (to be introduced properly soon), front and center:

           . “Sofia Benoit is Medusa” and “Benoit is Joan of Arc” 

           . “Sofia: Depraved Tour” and

           . “Lu’s On First: Baseball’s First Female” [A romcom co-
           starring Kevin Costner.]
           INT. FRONT DOOR - SOFIA’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Upon entering the mansion, you’d first notice the massive 
           “Daddy Warbucks” master staircase with golden railings. 

           The spindles on the stairs are compiled of little stacked 
           golden heads, made to look like Sofia, each with her 
           trademark high ponytail.

           Bell enters from the back quarters. He unlocks one measly 
           lock on the door and opens it to find--

           Duerson holding the flowers. 

           A beat.

                                 DUERSON
                        So... what do you think? 

           Duerson shows off his suit and twirls.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Brand new duds. 
                             (then)
                        William. You look white. Can I come 
                        in?

           Bell’s serious. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        She didn’t tell you I was coming? 
                        Doggone space cadet. Well, 
                        tonight’s the night, William. She 
                        thinks I’m cooking dinner but...
                             (leans in, whispers)
                        I’m proposing.

                                 BELL
                        I told you the next time you came 
                        around here I’m calling the police. 

           Duerson continues to smile without breaking eye contact. 

                                 DUERSON
                        You know, we’ve been meaning to 
                        talk to you about something. 

                                 BELL
                        Who?

                                 DUERSON
                        Me and Sofia. You know... my 
                        girlfriend, who you work for. 
                                 BELL
                        She’s not your girlfriend, Paul.

                                 DUERSON
                             (not hearing him)
                        --I know you’re a lonely guy since 
                        your wife died. And Sofia has a lot 
                        of patience for you because of it. 
                        And you deserve patience. A wife 
                        dying is no small thing. And your 
                        poor daughter, growing up with no 
                        female influence. It’s not right. 
                        And that’s why Sofia does those 
                        puzzles with you. Because she feels 
                        bad that your wife died in a 
                        cycling accident and you don’t have 
                        anyone to do puzzles with anymore. 

                                 BELL
                        How do you know about the puzzles?

           The drizzle turns to rain.

                                 DUERSON
                        Sofia doesn’t have much of a 
                        relationship with her father -- we 
                        have that in common, we bond over 
                        that -- So she sees a dad in you. 
                        She’s got a certain love for you. 
                        But not the kind you want. You 
                        can’t control who she loves. You 
                        can’t control who she marries. 

                                 BELL
                        I really don’t want to call the 
                        cops, man. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Is she here?

                                 BELL
                        You know I can’t tell you that.

                                 DUERSON
                        I don’t want to hurt you, William. 

           This doesn’t worry Bell. He’s much bigger than Duerson and, 
           remember, he’s also got that gun. 

                                 BELL
                        Please leave.

           Long beat. Then Duerson nods. We relax.
                                 DUERSON
                        Okay. High five.  

           Duerson raises his hand for a high five. 

           Bell breathes, completes it, and shuts the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - SOFIA’S MANSION - SECONDS LATER

           Bell makes his way back to his office but doesn’t get far 
           when he hears the doorbell chime again. 

                                 BELL
                        Goddammit.

           INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - SOFIA’S MANSION - SECONDS LATER

           Bell opens the door--

                                 BELL
                        I’m not fucking around here--

           His face falls. 

           We flip around to see--

           Duerson              with a knife          to his own throat. 

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        Hey. Hey. Easy.

           Duerson’s eyes are glossy. He’s not looking at Bell as much 
           as through him.

                                 DUERSON
                        I’m ready to give you everything. 

                                 BELL
                        Take it easy.

                                 DUERSON
                        You make me so happy. I can’t 
                        believe this is real life. We’re 
                        actually in love. 

                                 BELL
                        You’re confused. You don’t know 
                        her.

                                 DUERSON
                        You’re wrong. 
                                 BELL
                        Okay, okay. You know her.

                                 DUERSON
                        You. 

                                 BELL
                        What?

                                 DUERSON
                        You’re Sofia. 

           Bell takes a step in. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Don’t.

                                 BELL
                        We’ll get you some help. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Say you’re Sofia.

           The knife dimples Duerson’s neck. Not quite breaking skin.

                                 BELL
                        I’m Sofia.

                                 DUERSON
                        And you love me. 

                                 BELL
                             (small step, careful)
                        I’m Sofia and I love you.

                                 DUERSON
                        I have a ring. It was my mama’s. 

                                 BELL
                             (another step)
                        That’s really nice of you. 

           Duerson reaches into his breast pocket. The rings not in 
           there. He worries for a moment that he lost it. Then feels 
           his pants pocket and, relieved, he pulls out 

           AN INVISIBLE RING. 

           Duerson mimes holding it in his fingers, looking at it like 
           it’s worth a million bucks. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Baby... 
           Duerson holds it out to Bell... “Take it.”

                                 BELL
                        I--

                                 DUERSON
                        Put it on. 

           Duerson presses the knife further into his neck. 

           Bell takes the invisible ring and slips it on.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                             (real and loving)
                        It’s perfect, baby. 

                                 BELL

           Duerson softly sings the lyrics to a Sofia song.

                                 DUERSON
                        I am broken 
                        But my heart has spoken 
                        you are broken too.
                        I’ve been saved
                        know I’m depraved 
                        But no one’s depraved like you. 
                             (smiles)
                        Marry me. Make me the happiest man 
                        in the world. 

           Bell notices the knife has pierced Duerson’s neck. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Say yes.  

           Blood drips down Duerson’s hand and wrist. He wipes tears 
           from his eyes and laughs a little. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Shoot. Look at me. I can be a big 
                        pussy sometimes. Come on, sweetie, 
                        you can’t keep a guy waiting this 
                        long for an answer.

           Bell looks at Duerson with true compassion and sadness. 

                                 BELL
                        Okay. 

           Duerson stops smiling briefly.
                                 DUERSON
                        Really? You love me?

                                 BELL
                        Yes. Please give me the knife.

           Duerson smiles again and lowers the knife. Bell exhales. 

           Then

           FFT-FFT-FFT

           Bell’s eyes go wide and looks down to see

           DUERSON STABBED HIM IN THE GUT.

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        Who should we tell first? My family 
                        or yours?

           Bell collapses to the ground. 

           It’s really raining now.

           Duerson steps over him. 

           Bell grabs his leg but Duerson shakes him off easily. 

           He takes off his shoes before he enters the house. 

           On the ground

           Bell summons the strength... unholsters his gun. 

           He aims it at Duerson’s head. 

           His finger hovers over the trigger.

           It’s getting blurry but he’s got a good shot. But

           He doesn’t shoot. 

           He looks up to the stars. 

           And passes out. 

           Now

           Hit me with that Prince again, baby.

                                 PRINCE
                        It's been seven hours and thirteen 
                        days...
                        Since you took your love away...
           INT. KARAOKE BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Duerson passionately serenades a Hollywood Karaoke dive. Wet 
           from the rain, jacket off, tie flung over his shoulder.

                                 DUERSON
                        I go out every night and sleep all 
                        day...
                        Since you took your love away...

           A few PATRONS watch as he sings. Some confused, some amused.

           A WOMAN notices something that seems a bit off about him. She 
           leans over the bar and whispers something to the BARTENDER. 

           The Bartender looks over at Duerson as he sings. Scan down 
           Duerson’s right sleeve.

           IT’S SOAKED IN BLOOD 

           He finishes the performance.

           One person claps then stops immediately.

           Duerson steps off and makes eye contact with the bartender. 

           Then he looks to the door as 

           Cops enter. 

           FADE TO BLACK

                                   ...six months later

           EXT. SOFIA’S ESTATE - EVENING (1994)

           The grounds are fortified with a tall, steel gate. There’s 
           now a small security booth at the entrance. They’re not 
           fucking around after that shit with Duerson.

           We hear some giggles and a pre-lapped conversation:

                                 WOMAN (V.O)
                        DeVante Rhodes is the best 
                        rebounder to ever play the game of 
                        basketball... 
                             (wait)
                        Let me do that again. 

                                 MAN (V.O)
                        Why?

           A Camry pulls up to the security booth. 
                                 WOMAN (V.O)
                        The cap is still on. 

           The gate opens. The Camry pulls in.

                                 MAN (V.O)
                        It’s recording. The red light’s 
                        blinking. 

                                 WOMAN (V.O)
                        Ok but the cap’s on.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MANSION - EVENING

           We hear some shuffling, the lens cap is removed and we enter

           HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV to find the woman from those posters:

           SOFIA BENOIT

           [Affectedly pronounced “Ben-wa”... but “Ben-oyt” by anyone 
           who knew her before the fame.]

           She’s 28 and white with a blonde high pony. She sits on the 
           couch, wearing an open silk bathrobe over a tank and shorts. 
           She’s calm and cool, much more herself on this couch than 
           Letterman’s or Arsenio Hall’s. Entitled but she worked her 
           ass off for it. She earned everything and fuck if she’ll let 
           anyone take that from her. Seeing her like this is intimate. 
           A rare glimpse at Sofia the person and not *SOFIA* if that 
           makes sense.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Ok. Who is DeVante Rhodes? 

                                 SOFIA
                        DeVante Rhodes is the best 
                        rebounder ever to play the game of 
                        basketball.

           EXT. SOFIA’S MANSION - EVENING

           The Camry stops in front of the mansion. A man exits and it’s 
           not long before we realize 

           IT’S BELL 

           He’s alive and standing in the same spot he was stabbed six 
           months earlier. He looks down at the gravel and digs his heel 
           in. Fuck this spot. 
           INT. BELL’S OFFICE - MANSION - LATER

           Bell waits inside his old office. It’s now well organized 
           with a brand new surveillance monitor on the desk. Much more 
           high-tech and involved than six months ago.  

           KAYLOR (25) bounds in. She’s Sofia’s wholesome, nervous, and 
           over-caffeinated personal assistant.  

                                 KAYLOR
                        So sorry to keep you waiting. I’m 
                        Kaylor. Gloria’s replacement.

                                 BELL
                        Nice to meet you. 

           An awkward beat.

                                 KAYLOR
                        I’m so lucky to have this job. I 
                        love it. I love working here.

                                 BELL
                        Yeah? That’s good. 

           An unenthusiastic response that Kaylor takes as a green light 
           to elaborate:

                                 KAYLOR
                        I mean, she’s Sofia Benoit for 
                        crapsakes. She’s perfect. You know 
                        she gets up at 5AM everyday? Every 
                        frickin’ day. And anyone who knows 
                        Kaylor, knows Kaylor’s a runner. 
                        I’m a shell of myself if I don’t 
                        get my miles in. So I’ve been 
                        getting up at 3:30 so I can get 
                        here in time to bring her a Green 
                        Goblin smoothie when she wakes up. 
                        Makes for a heck of a long day. 

                                 BELL
                        You live nearby?

                                 KAYLOR
                        West Hollywood. 

                                 BELL
                        Just run here and shower in the 
                        guest house. Sleep in a little 
                        more. Gloria used to do that.
                                 KAYLOR
                             (smiles)
                        She said you looked out for people. 

           INT. SOFIA’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Back to Sofia on the couch in CAMCORDER POV. (We can safely 
           assume it’s DeVante Rhodes’ voice behind camera.) 

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        Where’d you hear that? That I’m the 
                        best rebounder ever.

                                 SOFIA
                        Overheard a guy on the bus. 

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        You don’t take the bus.

                                 SOFIA
                        Tour bus. 

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        Is that why you had your people 
                        call me yesterday? Because of 
                        rebounding?

                                 SOFIA
                        I don’t even know what a rebound 
                        is.

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        What else he say?

           Sofia lights a cig and takes a drag. Intentionally dramatic. 

           IN QUICKIES, we’re briefly introduced to DEVANTE RHODES. 

           . Highlights of Rhodes, a power forward, playing basketball.

           . He throws a chair across the court, punches a coach in the 
           stomach.

           . He gets called for a technical foul and gets ejected. He 
           kisses the REF on the lips and takes off his shirt.

           END QUICKIES as Sofia exhales. 

                                 SOFIA
                        He said you’re on the Trailblazers. 

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        I was traded to the Nuggets.
           Sofia snickers. 

                                 RHODES (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 SOFIA
                        Silly name for a basketball team. 
                        Where do The Nuggets play?

                                 RHODES
                        Denver. 

           Sofia snorts. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Sorry. Sorry. It’s just so stupid. 
                        “Denver Nuggets.” You’re a Nugget. 
                        I’ve never been out with a Nugget 
                        before.   

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        You call me up to make fun of me?

                                 SOFIA
                        I saw your picture in The Times. 
                        The one of you kissing that referee 
                        during a game and thought it was 
                        the sexiest fucking thing I’d seen 
                        in just about ever. And I don’t 
                        often get turned on by newspapers 
                        so... thought I’d see it through.

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        That’s not really me. It’s an act, 
                        you know?

                                 SOFIA
                        Too bad. You seemed like fun and I 
                        like to have fun.

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        Is that why you wrote that song? I 
                        like that one.

                                 SOFIA
                        What song? 

           INT. BELL’S OFFICE - SAME

           Bell looks at the security monitor.
                                 KAYLOR
                        They updated everything after 
                        you... you know. He should’ve 
                        gotten the death penalty if you ask 
                        me. Frickin’ savage piece of bunk. 

           Suddenly

           THE LIGHTS GO OUT. 

                                 KAYLOR  (CONT'D)
                        Crap. 

           INT. SOFIA’S BEDROOM - SAME

           The lights go out in here as well. 

                                 SOFIA (O.S.)
                        Shit. 

           INT. BELL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 KAYLOR (O.S.)
                        Keeps happening. Surges from all 
                        this new stuff. One sec, Waylon 
                        will get them back--

           The lights turn back on. 

                                 KAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        SO, Monday sound good for you to 
                        start back up again? 

                                 BELL
                        Yeah. Great. 

                                 KAYLOR
                        Stick around for a minute. She 
                        wanted to say hi. 

           INT. SOFIA’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           HANDHELD POV: Sofia wrestles the camera away and flips it 
           around and we finally get a look at

           DEVANTE RHODES 

           Black. 30, 6’8”. No shirt, sweats. He’s got a short, blonde 
           mohawk. He’s more nervous with a camera pointed at him than 
           he would be with a gun. Shy, blushing, hand over his face. 
                                 SOFIA (O.S.)
                        Tell our viewers at home what we 
                        did today. 

                                 RHODES
                        You gave me a mohawk. 

           Sofia points the camera down to the hair on the floor. Back 
           up to Rhodes, who smiles--

                                 SOFIA (O.S.)
                        Now we look the same. 

                                 RHODES
                        We don’t look the same. 

                                 SOFIA (O.S.)
                        We’re both blonde. Move your hand.

           He does. She zooms in on his face. He’s self-conscious.

                                 SOFIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I heard something else about you. 

                                 RHODES
                        Yeah?

           Sofia turns off the camera and we END HANDHELD POV. 

           We finally see the two of them together. Their hands are 
           intertwined. 

                                 SOFIA
                        You like to wear women’s clothes. 

                                 RHODES
                        My sisters used to dress me up. 
                        Happens to boys with sisters. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I heard it’s deeper than that.

           Rhodes smirks.

                                 RHODES
                        Nah.

                                 SOFIA 
                        Yeah it does. Wanna try some shit 
                        on? I got some big fucking skirts 
                        from the 80s.

                                 RHODES
                        Maybe.
                                 SOFIA
                        Enough about you. What do you know 
                        about Sofia?

                                 RHODES
                        I know you’re a singer. 

                                 SOFIA
                        And actor. 

                                 RHODES
                        And I know what I’ve seen on TV. 
                        But I don’t like people thinking I 
                        am what I am from the television, 
                        so I don’t wanna pretend I know 
                        you. 

           That’s too deep of an answer for Sofia so she’ll just respond 
           to the first part.  

                                 SOFIA
                        What’s your favorite song of mine?

                                 RHODES
                        I told you. “Girls Just Want to 
                        Have Fun.”

                                 SOFIA
                        Yeah, you’re confusing your white 
                        singers. That’s Cyndi Lauper. 

                                 RHODES
                        “Like a Prayer”?

                                 SOFIA
                        Jesus Christ. 

                                 RHODES
                        I guess I don’t know any then. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I’ve won two Grammys and have more 
                        number one hits than any female 
                        artist and you can’t name one 
                        fucking song? How about “Depraved”?

                                 RHODES
                        No.

                                 SOFIA
                        “Perfume for no one”?

                                 RHODES
                        Nope.
                                 SOFIA
                             (hmph)
                        You’re a shit.

           KNOCK-KNOCK

                                 KAYLOR (O.S.)
                             (meek, outside the door)
                        Ms. Benoit? It’s Kaylor.

                                 SOFIA
                        Sofia’s fine. 

                                 KAYLOR (O.S.)
                        Ok. Sofia. It’s Kaylor...
                        Your new personal assistant.

                                 SOFIA
                        I know who you are, Kaylor. What is 
                        it? 

                                 KAYLOR (O.S.)
                        William’s here. 

           Sofia’s face lights up. She ties her robe, and throws Rhodes’ 
           shirt at his face. 

                                 RHODES
                        Who’s William?

                                 SOFIA
                        He goes by Bell. 

                                 RHODES
                        That doesn’t answer my question.

                                 SOFIA
                             (shouts)
                        I’ll come down in a sec. Does he 
                        seem okay to you? 

           No answer. 

                                 KAYLOR (O.S.)
                        Oh, you’re talking to me? What do 
                        you mean?

                                 SOFIA
                        You know, healthy. Mentally. 

                                 KAYLOR (O.S.)
                        You mean, like, is he twitchy?
                                 SOFIA
                        Sure.

           Sofia opens the door, surprised to find Bell standing in the 
           hallway with Kaylor. 

           Kaylor looks Bell up and down.

                                 KAYLOR
                        He seems fine. 
                             (to Bell)
                        You twitchy?

                                 BELL
                        Hey, Sof.

           Sofia wraps Bell in a hug. She exhales in his arms -- safe.

                                 SOFIA
                        How’s Abby? 

                                 BELL
                        Good, thanks. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Good to have you back. Come on. I 
                        want to show you something. 
                             (pointing back)
                        That’s Rhodes. 

                                 BELL
                        From the Blazers?

                                 SOFIA
                        He’s a Nugget now. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Sofia, Rhodes, Bell, and Kaylor enter.

           Bell smiles when he notices the Maui puzzle completed on the 
           dining room table. 

                                 BELL
                        Look at that. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Took me every bit of the six months 
                        you were gone, too. 

           Kaylor hands Sofia a puzzle. Sofia gives it to Bell without 
           looking at it. 
                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        And here’s our next challenge. 

           The puzzle is the poster for the movie “JUNIOR” where Arnold 
           Schwarzenegger gets pregnant and Danny DeVito is his doctor.

           Sofia sees it and looks at Kaylor -- really?

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        You said I could choose.

           Bell smiles. 

                                 BELL
                        I have something for you too. Abby 
                        and I were at the record store and 
                        she found these.  

           Bell hands Sofia a STICKER BOOKLET of her album covers.  

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        She’s worried it’s weird to give 
                        you stickers of your own albums but 
                        I told her--

                                 SOFIA
                        I love them.

           Sofia puts them in her robe. There’s a ton of mutual respect 
           and love here. They’ve been through a lot together. 

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        There’s a piece missing. 

           They turn. Rhodes looks over the puzzle. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I know. Driving me nuts. I looked 
                        everywhere. 

           Zoom in on the open spot with a piece missing: a sunbathing 
           woman is missing her head.

           INT. BELLS CAR - SUNSET

           Bell waves to the security guard, WAYLON (60s, cowboy hat), 
           as he pulls out of the estate. 

           EXT. BELL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bell pulls into his driveway. 
           INT. BELL’S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 

           Bell shows Mrs. Baxter (the babysitter) to the door. 

                                 MRS. BAXTER
                        That man called again today.

           Shit.

                                 BELL
                        Does Abby know?

                                 MRS. BAXTER
                        Who do you think talked to him?

           She leaves. 

           Bell walks to a kitchen cabinet and looks at the liquor for a 
           moment before moving to the fridge for a beer. 

           EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

           A gigantic man in overalls named J.H. CALHOUN (50s) exits a 
           halfway facility in East Hollywood.  

           He walks across the road to a parking structure. 

           A few moments later, he pulls out in a pickup truck. 

           INT. STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT

           J.H. smashes a crowbar down onto a combination lock. He 
           misses left twice then he finally breaks it open. 

           FLIP AROUND to notice 

           J.H. is missing his right eye. 

           Might be why his aim is off. He doesn’t bother with a patch 
           so we see it’s scarred over with some dried puss and eye 
           boogers accumulating around the edges. 

           Inside the unit is a bunch of creepy, odd shit. We 
           immediately notice a cot and

           A LARGE RED TRUNK with a golden phoenix painted on the side.

           There’s a framed photo on the floor. He picks it up: It’s of 
           two boys, arms wrapped around each other, smiling. 

           He removes the photo from the frame. Folds it. Pockets it.
           INT. ABBY’S ROOM - BELL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bell opens the door to check on Abby but she’s not there. 

                                 BELL
                        Abs? 

           He sees her window is open -- leading out to the fire escape. 
           This doesn’t worry him.

           EXT. BELL’S ROOF - NIGHT

           Bell climbs up the fire escape to find Abby on the roof with 
           a telescope. He holds his beer and a bottle of Coke. 

                                 BELL
                        I’m boarding up that window when 
                        you get to high school.  

           Abby doesn’t respond. 

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        Figured I’d get the silent 
                        treatment. But I came with 
                        reinforcements. 

           He pops her coke open using his beer and holds it out to her.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m not supposed to drink coke this 
                        late.  

                                 BELL
                        Says who?

                                 ABBY
                        You. 

                                 BELL
                        I won’t tell if you don’t.

           Abby barely smiles and takes it. 

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        Ready?

           She nods. 

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        Ok... Let’s see. You’re upset 
                        because... the Pirates lost their 
                        third straight today. 
           Abby says nothing. 

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        Not about the Buccos, huh? Hm. Oh, 
                        then it must be because I’m going 
                        back to work. 

           Abby takes a sip.

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        And you were looking forward to 
                        spending time with me this summer.

                                 ABBY
                        You’re not that cool. 

                                 BELL
                             (pause, serious now)
                        You’re worried I could get hurt 
                        again. 

           Beat. Abby takes a sip of coke. It’s her turn.

                                 ABBY
                        You’ve been seeing someone. 

           Bell takes a sip of beer.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        I knew it! 
                             (then)
                        You like her.

           Bell takes a sip of beer. Abby smiles a little. 

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Your turn but say this: 

           Abby whispers something in her dad’s ear. Bell smiles. 

                                 BELL
                        You just want me to be happy. 

           Abby takes a sip of coke. Bell smiles.

                                 ABBY
                        That guy who’s been calling. It’s 
                        him isn’t it? Paul Duerson.

           QUICKIE: Red alarm lights flash against the white walls of a 
           corridor.

                                 BELL
                        I think.
                                 ABBY
                        Why does he keep calling?

           QUICKIE: Guards burst through doors and run through the 
           corridor toward camera.

                                 BELL
                        I don’t know.

           QUICKIE: Officers and canines search the woods.

           Bell looks at Abby deeply.

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        You’re more like her every day, you 
                        know.

                                 ABBY
                        If that’s true then I feel it’s my 
                        duty to tell you something very 
                        important. 

                                 BELL
                        What’s that?

                                 ABBY
                        You need to shave your ears. 

                                 BELL
                        Time for bed.

                                 ABBY
                        What the heck is going on with 
                        those things? Have you been 
                        watering them?

                                 BELL
                        Bed.

           EXT. ALLEY - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           A line of RAVERS outside a door with no sign in an alley. A 
           few of them turn and we needle drop something hot...

           IN SLO-MO, Sofia and Rhodes cross the street toward the 
           alley, holding hands. 

           They’re in matching sunglasses and pink wigs.

           And they’re both wearing skirts.
           INT. RAVE - NIGHT

           Strobe lights flash on clubbers dancing, drinking, kissing, 
           tripping. This is a gay rave and it’s awesome. 

           On the second floor, a VIP entrance opens and Sofia and 
           Rhodes enter. They remove their wigs and sunglasses and throw 
           them off the balcony.   

           They both look fucking amazing.

           They walk down the stairs and onto the dance floor.

           No one here gives a shit who they are. Everyone’s just there 
           to party.

           Rhodes gets comfortable.

           Sofia’s in the zone. They make out.

           The music unce-unces. Strobe lights pulse.

           INT. BATHROOM - RAVE - NIGHT

           Sofia slams Rhodes against the bathroom wall. She takes off 
           his shirt. We can guess what happens from here.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BELL’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Quiet. A muted television reflects off of a family photo: 
           Bell, Abby (then 9), and her late MOTHER (happy, gorgeous, 
           black). 

           Bell sleeps in a chair with the tin of Skoal on his chest.

           Then, in jarring bursts: RED ALARM LIGHTS FLASH.

           EXT. FOREST NEAR PSYCH FACILITY - NIGHT

           Helicopters above. 

                                 DOGS (O.S.)
                        Woof. Woof.

           EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT

           J.H. pulls the truck over. The red trunk sits in the bed. 
           INT. J.H.’S PICKUP - CONTINUOUS

           Duerson gets into the front seat. J.H. lights up. 

                                 DUERSON
                        James Harold. You got the trunk. 
                        See? Knew you could do it all by 
                        yourself. 

                                 J.H. 
                        I f-forgot the combination, Paul. 
                        Had to smash the lock. I’m sorry.

           Duerson gets a good look at J.H.’s eye. He forgot how 
           disgusting it was.

                                 DUERSON
                        Do you want to...

                                 J.H.
                        Sorry.

           J.H. puts his hand over his missing eye and it remains there 
           for the rest of the scene. His voice is deep and his hand is 
           gigantic... like Richard Kiel or Michael Clarke Duncan.

                                 DUERSON
                        I told you to write the combination 
                        down. 

                                 J.H.
                        I copied it wrong. I had to smash 
                        it. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Long as you got the trunk. Drop me 
                        off first, would you?

           J.H. nods. 

           PENNY PASCAL (female, french, 30s) gets in the back. 

                                 J.H.
                             (confused)
                        Paul... there’s a woman.

           Penny sneezes. 

                                 DUERSON
                        That’s Penny. We met on the inside. 
                        She’s good people. Wants to help. 

                                 J.H.
                        She’s part of the mission?
                                 PENNY
                             (French accent)
                        I am just along for the ride. 

           J.H. starts the car and pulls away. 

                                 DUERSON
                        You’re drifting, J.H. 

                                 PENNY
                        What happen to your eye?

                                 J.H.
                        I lost it in a sword fight. 

                                 DUERSON
                        You can tell her the truth. She’s a 
                        friend.

           J.H. doesn’t say anything. Duerson turns back to Penny.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        He had a parasite. A worm.

                                 PENNY
                        “Asticots” where I am from.  

                                 J.H.
                        Where is that?

                                 PENNY
                        Nice. In France.

                                 DUERSON
                        Spelled like “nice.”

                                 J.H.
                        That’s stupid.

           J.H. continues to drive with his hand over his eye.

           INT. BELL’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The phone rings and it startles Bell awake. He looks at his 
           watch. It’s late. Good phone calls don’t come this late. 

                                 BELL
                             (answering phone)
                        Yeah.
           EXT. RAVE - NIGHT

           Rhodes and Sofia leave the rave, holding hands. They get into 
           the back of a Lincoln Nav. 

           INT. BELL’S CAMRY - NIGHT

           Bell drives with purpose. He’s worried but not the type of 
           person who ever shows it. Years of working as a bodyguard 
           will teach you that.

           Abby is beside him in galaxy pajamas and her Pirates hat. She 
           looks at her dad, concerned. He just looks at the road with a 
           packed lip. He spits into a water bottle.   

           They pull up to an apartment building to find

           ELEANOR (30, black), waiting outside. 

                                 ABBY
                        Wait, who’s that? Is that your-- 
                        Goddamnit, William.  

                                 BELL
                        Don’t say “Goddamnit.” Her name is 
                        Eleanor. 

                                 ABBY
                        No way I’m going with Eleanor. 

                                 BELL
                        Would you rather Mrs. Baxter?

           That’s what I thought. Bell rolls down the window. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Hey.

                                 BELL
                        Hey.

                                 ABBY
                        Gross.

                                 BELL
                        Sorry it’s so late.

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s fine. Do they know where he-

           Bell looks at her. Not in front of Abby. 

           Abby gets out with an overnight bag.
                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        You must be Abby.
                             (to Bell)
                        We’ll be fine.

                                 BELL
                        Be good. 

                                 ABBY
                        You be good.

           They watch as Bell pulls away. 

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        You’re my dad’s new girlfriend. Amy 
                        is it? You’re a doctor right?

                                 ELEANOR
                        No, I--

           Eleanor realizes Abby is messing with her. 

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Nice try. 

           Down the street, they watch as Bell dumps his tobacco filled 
           water bottle out the window. 

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Nasty habit. 

                                 ABBY
                        The worst.

           EXT. SOFIA ESTATE - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

           Bell waves to Waylon and he opens the gate.

           A squad car is parked in the driveway outside the mansion.

           EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

           Bell exits his car. He’s greeted by OFFICER PARKER (60s).

                                 OFFICER PARKER
                        We’re doing everything we can.

                                 BELL
                        She inside?

                                 OFFICER PARKER
                        Waylon said she went out. 
                                 BELL
                        Alone?

                                 OFFICER PARKER
                        With her driver. And some guy.

                                 BELL
                        DeVante Rhodes.

                                 OFFICER PARKER
                        The basketball player?

           EXT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Headlights reflect off Parker’s face. Bell turns. 

           The Lincoln Navigator pulls through the gate and rolls to a 
           stop in front of Bell. 

           The back door opens. Out walk Sofia and Rhodes. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Hey, I thought you went home. 

           Sofia finally registers Officer Parker’s presence. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        What happened?

                                 BELL
                        Let’s get you inside.

                                 SOFIA
                        Bell. 

           Beat. 

                                 BELL
                        It’s Duerson. 

           Bell’s mouth moves but we only hear a pitched ring. And it 
           hits Sofia like a punch to the nose. 

           She straightens up and walks into the house. 

           INT. ELEANOR’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Eleanor flips a grilled cheese sandwich onto a plate and sets 
           it in front of Abby at the counter. 

           Abby inspects it. 
                                 ABBY
                        Cheese is well melted. Fairly even 
                        distribution. Oozing but I can 
                        probably get through it with one 
                        napkin. Bread is perfectly 
                        browned... Not bad, woman. But 
                        there’s one thing missing. 

           Eleanor slides the hot sauce across the table, right into 
           Abby’s open hand.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        You’re good. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I am the absolute best. 

           Abby takes a bite. It’s good but she tries to hide it. 

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        So?

                                 ABBY
                        Eh. 

           A BLACK LAB crawls out of the bedroom and sits next to Abby. 
           Good doggo. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        That’s Barry.

                                 ABBY
                        Ugh.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        What?

                                 ABBY
                        I think I like you a little bit.

           Abby flips her Pirates hat backwards and goes back to her 
           grilled cheese. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        You always wear that hat? 

                                 ABBY
                             (mouth full)
                        It’s my good luck charm. 

           Eleanor moves over the counter and gently removes the hat. 
                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        My dad doesn’t know how to do my 
                        kind of hair. 

           Abby picks up her cup of water and sips it. She can feel 
           Eleanor’s gaze. She fights the urge to make eye-contact but 
           loses the battle. And for the first time, Abby’s without 
           confidence.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I doubt your dad knows how to do 
                        any kind of hair. Want some help? 

           Abby sets down her water and

           PRELAP a knock at the door.

           EXT. TIM’S HOME - LATER

           A spry grandpa, TIM (70s, sweater, khakis), opens the door. 

                                 TIM
                        Can I help you?

           Penny stands on the steps. She notices a crucifix on the wall 
           behind him. 

                                 PENNY
                        Hello. My car broke. Do you mind if 
                        I use the phone?

                                 TIM
                        I’m pretty good with cars. Why 
                        don’t I take a look?

           Penny nods. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SOFIA’S SECURITY CAMERAS:

           FRONT DOOR CAM: Coast is clear. 

           FOYER CAM: All is quiet.

           SECURITY BOOTH / GATE CAM: Officer Parker pulls out. Waylon 
           closes the gate, gives a thumbs up to the camera.
           INT. BELL’S OFFICE - MANSION - NIGHT

           Bell opens the closet to find some stacked boxes. He grabs 
           one and rummages through it on the floor.

           Rhodes knocks on the open door, still wearing a skirt.

                                 BELL
                        How’s she doing?

                                 RHODES
                        Sleeping.

           Bell grabs another box and digs through it. 

                                 BELL
                        There should be some sweats in the 
                        guest room closet if you want to 
                        change. 

           Rhodes nods.

                                 RHODES
                        Lot of guys roll through here?

                                 BELL
                        No.

           Bell’s no snitch. 

           Rhodes notices his NCAA Championship ring. 

                                 RHODES
                        What position? 

                                 BELL
                        Fullback. You woulda been a hell of 
                        a tight-end if you didn’t choose 
                        basketball. 

                                 RHODES
                        We had to buy our own equipment and 
                        the old man wouldn’t pony up for 
                        it. But no problem spending money 
                        on women and bar tabs.

                                 BELL
                        Sounds like we had the same father.

                                 RHODES
                        I had to share the same pair of 
                        sneakers with my older sisters.

                        They decorated them and shit with 
                        marker and glitter just to mess 
                        with me. I was still 5’6” senior 
                        year. But God didn’t want me to be 
                        my pops so that summer--

           Rhodes whistles and twirls his finger to the ceiling. 

                                 RHODES (CONT'D)
                        I got my shoes for free after that. 

                                 BELL
                        Five-six. No shit?

                                 RHODES
                        Lonely ass prom night. 

                                 BELL
                        You and me both.  

                                 RHODES
                        You can tell a lot about a person 
                        based on if they had a good prom 
                        night. 

           INT. ELEANOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Eleanor closes the door to her bedroom and sits by the window 
           with a book. She bends over and takes her shoes off and when 
           she sits back up, through the window, we see

           J.H. Calhoun 

           Standing on the street below with no expression. 

           Just looking up at her. 

           Eleanor reads. Turns a page. Then senses him.

           She turns and almost jumps out of her skin when she sees him 
           just fucking glaring at her from the street. 

           INT. BELL’S OFFICE - MANSION - NIGHT

           Bell finds a first-aid kit, sets it on the desk, and goes 
           back to looking for whatever it is he’s looking for.

                                 RHODES
                        You try for pro?
                                 BELL
                        I used to tell people I blew out my 
                        knee but I just didn’t have it to 
                        be honest. 

                                 RHODES
                        My roommate in JuCo was from 
                        Pittsburgh. Funny accent. What’s it 
                        called? “Pittsbese”?

                                 BELL
                        “Pittsburghese.” 

                                 RHODES
                        That’s it. Like Chinese but for 
                        people from Pittsburgh. He always 
                        used to say “ovader.” Like, “pass 
                        me the clicker ovader.” 

           Bell finally finds what he’s looking for -- his “Depraved 
           Tour” Security jacket. 

                                 RHODES (CONT'D)
                        What’s that?

           Bell throws it on like a cape. Then

           The phone rings. 

           Again, it’s late for phone calls. They both look at it for a 
           beat before Bell reaches for it.

                                 BELL
                        Yeah.
                             (then)
                        What? Slow down.

           INT. ELEANOR’S APARTMENT - INTERCUT

           Eleanor’s on the phone, frightened. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        My apartment. He’s just... standing 
                        outside. 

           She pulls back the curtain but 

           J.H is no longer there. 

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Or he was. He’s not there anymore.
                                 BELL
                        What does he look like?

                                 ELEANOR
                        I don’t know. I couldn’t tell. 

                                 BELL
                        Call the police. I’m coming.  

           Bell hangs up and exits. Rhodes follows. 

                                 RHODES
                        What’s going on?

           Slowly zoom in on the gun he left on the desk. 

           Oh, Bell. You dumb bitch. 

           After a beat, he comes back in and grabs it. 

           Ok, you’re not a dumb bitch. 

           INT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Bell hustles to the door, Rhodes behind. 

           We notice there are now many different PARANOIA LOCKS on the 
           door (chains, bolts, latches). Bell unlocks them.

                                 BELL
                        Lock these behind me. 

                                 RHODES
                        Where you going?

           But Bell’s out. 

           Rhodes closes the door and locks the SLIDE LATCH LOCK at the 
           top of the door. 

           EXT. SECURITY GATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bell speeds through the gate. Waylon shuts it behind him.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MANSION - NIGHT

           Rhodes grabs a pair of sweatpants out of the drawer.

           He begins to exit when he notices the window by the bed is 
           open. It’s silent and black outside. 
           Push in on the darkness

           For a brief moment, we think maybe we see something. Movement 
           or the shimmer in the eye of someone outside. 

           Rhodes shuts the window. 

           Fingers crossed it was nothing.

           INT. SOFIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sofia sleeps in all of her clothes on top of the bed. 

           Flip around to find Rhodes at the door. The sweatpants are 
           far too small and barely reach his calves. 

           The vanity drawer is open. He notices a scrap book inside. He 
           looks at Sofia, she’s fast asleep. 

           He opens the book to find it’s full of polaroids, photo booth 
           pics, newspaper and tabloid clippings of 

           Sofia’s relationship history: 

           . Keanu

           . Michael Douglas

           . Oliver Stone

           . Robert Smith from The Cure

           . Laurence Fishburne

           The book crackles with every turn of the page until Rhodes’s 
           had enough. He shuts it. 

           He shouldn’t have snooped. He didn’t like that at all. He 
           feels gross. Used. Like what they shared wasn’t as unique for 
           her as it was for him. 

                                 SOFIA (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Rhodes sets the book down inside the drawer and slowly turns. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

           He shuts the drawer with his ass as he casually leans back on 
           the dresser.
                                 RHODES
                        Just um--

                                 SOFIA
                        Those sweatpants look ridiculous. 

                                 RHODES
                        I know. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Sorry if you’re bored. Don’t feel 
                        obligated to stay. 

           Confirmation to Rhodes that this was a one night stand and 
           he’ll end up like the rest of the trophies in that book. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        Bell’s here and Waylon’s up front 
                        so I’ll be fine.

                                 RHODES
                        Bell left. 

                                 SOFIA
                        What? Where’d the fuck did he go?

           EXT. HILLS - NIGHT

           Bell races through the hills in his car. 

           INT. ELEANOR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Abby’s asleep in bed with a scarf over her hair. Eleanor 
           gently wakes her.

                                 ABBY
                        Second time I’ve been woken up 
                        tonight. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s okay. Your dad’s coming, can 
                        you grab your things?

           Eleanor pulls back the curtain and looks outside again.

                                 ABBY
                        What’s going on? 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Nothing. 
                                 ABBY
                        It’s him, isn’t it?

           Then, there’s a knock at the door. 

           Eleanor gets up. 

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t.

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s okay. 

           INT. ELEANOR’S FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Eleanor looks through the peep hole to find OFFICER CARTER 
           (35, male, not stoked). 

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        Yellooo. Got a call.

           She opens the door. Carter straightens up a bit when he gets 
           a good look at Eleanor.

                                 OFFICER CARTER (CONT'D)
                             (clears throat, lower)
                        Got a call. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yes, there’s a strange man here. 

           Carter reaches for his gun. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        Inside? 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Outside. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        So, there’s not a man here here 
                        then?  

                                 ELEANOR
                        No. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        Is that out of the ordinary? For a 
                        man to be outside? 

                                 ELEANOR
                        No.
                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        This seems to be a fairly busy 
                        block. People walk. People stroll. 
                        Ms...?

                                 ELEANOR
                        The guy was creepy, alright? And 
                        it’s late. I don’t call the police 
                        willy-nilly. 

           Abby peeks out of Eleanor’s room. Carter sees her. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        That him?

                                 ELEANOR
                        What?

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        Is that the man who was outside?

                                 ABBY
                        I’m not a man.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You think this is funny?

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        No. Look, I’ll hang out here with 
                        you. Make sure you’re safe. Wanna 
                        put on some coffee? 

           Beat. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        We’d feel safer if you protected us 
                        from your car outside.

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        Bicycle. 

           Abby chuckles. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 ABBY
                        Nothing.

           INT. SECURITY BOOTH - SOFIA’S ESTATE - NIGHT

           A bowl of chili spins in the microwave. 
           The security guard, Waylon, leans back in a swivel chair in 
           the cramped booth. He’s got his cowboy boots crossed on the 
           desk next to a photo of his wife.  

           He tosses a baseball in the air above his head. He’s got a 
           taser on his belt.

           The microwave beeps. Waylon places the ball on the desk and 
           retrieves the chili. He sticks a bag of popcorn in next, sets 
           it to five minutes and presses start.

           He looks for a spoon but can only find a fork. He eats the 
           chili. Fuck, that’s some good chili. His wife made it for him 
           and she’s a great fucking cook. 

           The sound of a car’s squeaky breaks interrupts his meal.

           He gets up.

           INT. KITCHEN - MANSION - SAME TIME

           The kettle whistles and Sofia fixes herself some tea.

           INT. DINING ROOM - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Rhodes stands in the dining room. He stares at the Maui beach 
           jigsaw puzzle and the brand new “Junior” puzzle on the edge 
           of the table. Stewing over that fucking scrap book.

           Sofia enters. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Something wrong?

                                 RHODES
                        No. 

                                 SOFIA
                        What is it?

                                 RHODES
                        ...You worked so hard on it and 
                        we’re just gonna clean it up.  

                                 SOFIA
                        That’s how it works. We’ll start 
                        the new one.

           Rhodes looks at the puzzle. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        Are you... crying?
           Barely but, yeah, he is.

                                 RHODES
                        Nah.

                                 SOFIA
                        Yeah, you are. You’re crying. 

           A long beat. 

           Then, he looks up at her with a profound realization: 

                                 RHODES
                        I’m a puzzle.

                                 SOFIA
                        Excuse me?

                                 RHODES
                        You built me up for a minute. Made 
                        me feel nice and whole and 
                        comfortable. Told me it was cool to 
                        dress like a girl. Now you’re 
                        finished with me. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I didn’t say we were finished.

                                 RHODES
                        Yeah, but we’re finished. I can 
                        tell. Put me back in my box. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I’m not sure what this is but you 
                        got some stuff to deal with, man.

                                 RHODES
                        Nah. You’re just not used to people 
                        speaking their mind to you.

           That’s kinda true.

           EXT. SECURITY GATE - SOFIA ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Waylon scans with a heavy-duty flashlight with a long handle. 

                                 WAYLON
                        Hello?

           He shines the light through the gate. There’s no car but he 
           does see...

           The red trunk with a golden phoenix painted on the side. 
           He opens the gate and approaches it -- what the heck?

           He hears a sneeze, whips the flashlight but sees nobody.

           Then, THE LIGHTS GO out on the property.

           INT. MICROWAVE - SAME TIME

           The microwave loses power. The popcorn stops popping.

           INT. DINING ROOM - MANSION - SAME TIME

           The lights go out in here as well, leaving Sofia and Rhodes 
           in the dark. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Fantastic. 

           EXT. SECURITY GATE - CONTINUOUS

           Waylon knows that when the power goes out, the gate 
           automatically closes and locks. He makes for it and just 
           barely slips in before it closes. 

                                 WAYLON
                        Christ.

           INT. DINING ROOM - MANSION - SAME

           In almost complete darkness:

                                 SOFIA
                        They were supposed to fix this shit 
                        weeks ago.   

           We hear some rummaging around then the flip of a zippo. 

                                 RHODES
                        Who is “they”?

           Flick-spark. Nothing.    

                                 SOFIA
                        The light people, I don’t know. 

           Flick-spark. Nope.   

                                 RHODES
                        Where’s the circuit breaker? 
           Flick-spark. Zilch.

                                 SOFIA
                        I don’t know. 

           Then, finally: Flick-spark-FLAME. 

           Sofia lights a cigarette first with a PINK ZIPPO then lights 
           a few candles.

                                 RHODES
                        You don’t know where the circuit 
                        breaker is? 

                                 SOFIA
                        Do you know where the circuit 
                        breaker is? 

                                 RHODES
                        This is your house. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I have many houses and many circuit 
                        breakers. 

                                 RHODES
                             (PSH)

                                 SOFIA
                        What?

                                 RHODES
                        That was such a Sofia thing to say.  

                                 SOFIA
                        Excuse me?

                                 RHODES
                        Talking about how many circuit 
                        breakers you have is a rich person 
                        thing to say. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I’m pretty sure it’s not. Plus, 
                        you’re rich so don’t talk. 

                                 RHODES
                        It’s not about money. Rich is a 
                        state of mind. 

                                 SOFIA
                        What the fuck does that mean?

           Rhodes grabs the candle and exits. 
                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

           INT. ENTRANCE - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Rhodes bends down next to the staircase and puts the candle 
           to one of those golden Sofia head spindles.  

                                 RHODES
                        Like these creepy golden faces for 
                        example. 

                                 SOFIA
                        You think I bought those? They were 
                        a gift from Liberace. 

           The candles cast their shadows on the walls behind them. 
           Sofia’s is much larger than his. 

                                 RHODES
                        I didn’t even know people gave 
                        these little staircase legs as 
                        gifts. But I guess fancy clothing 
                        designers do. 

                                 SOFIA
                        They’re called spindles and 
                        Liberace was a pianist. You’re 
                        thinking of Versace. 

                                 RHODES
                        Again, a very Sofia thing to say. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I’m beginning to realize you’re a 
                        fuck. Frankly I’m getting annoyed 
                        by it. It’s annoying and kinda 
                        weird for someone like you to be 
                        so... UGH. 

                                 RHODES
                        A black guy you mean? 

                                 SOFIA
                        Please. You’re not like what they 
                        say about you. You’re more of a--   
                             (should she say it?)
                        You know what? Yeah. You’re a 
                        little bitch. Crying over puzzles 
                        or whatever that was. 

           Rhodes stands up, now his shadow is much larger than hers.
                                 RHODES
                        I told you that was an act. You 
                        were deaf to it because you just 
                        want to have your fun. But not with 
                        the same type of guys you usually 
                        go out with. This time you wanted a 
                        different flavor. You’re not 
                        looking for anything real. You just 
                        want to have sex.

                                 SOFIA
                        Don’t tell me what I want but, 
                        yeah, maybe I want a screw. SO 
                        WHAT. Burn me at the stake. I die 
                        through you. 

                                 RHODES
                        That’s just how it is with you. 
                        People exist for Sofia. I’m here 
                        for your pleasure. Fuck my 
                        feelings, right? 

                                 SOFIA
                        I have other things to consider 
                        right now. Like the fact that the 
                        man who tried to kill me is on the 
                        loose. 

                                 RHODES
                        He tried to kill Bell. You weren’t 
                        even home. 

           That pisses her off. 

                                 SOFIA
                        You asshole. He’s delusional! He 
                        gets confused but that doesn’t 
                        change the fact that he thought he 
                        was stabbing me. He wanted me dead. 
                        Why are you still here? I don’t 
                        need you to protect me. 

                                 RHODES
                        Yeah because you already got armed 
                        guards, a twenty foot wall, and a 
                        security system from the future. 

                                 SOFIA
                        GET OUT.  

           EXT. SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

           Waylon walks back to the security booth, breathing heavy. 
           INT. SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

           Waylon enters the dark booth. 

           He stops when he hears it: the sound a baseball makes when 
           you toss it up and catch it in your hand. 

           Toss 

           Catch     

           Toss      

           Catch    

           He slowly pans the torch to the corner of the room... 

           Toss

           And the flashlight picks up glimpses of the baseball flying 
           towards him --

           CRACK 

                                 WAYLON
                        SHIT!

           Waylon gets nailed right in the fucking face. 

           He drops to his knees and holds his nose. 

           The flashlight falls to the floor 

           and it rolls to her feet. 

           Penny’s feet. 

           She picks it up and shines it on Waylon: 

           His hands to his gushing nose. It looks like he’s squeezing a 
           jelly donut into his face.  

           INT. FOYER - MANSION

           Sofia shows Rhodes out. He unlocks the door’s many locks. 

                                 RHODES
                        It was fun while it lasted.  

                                 SOFIA
                        It wasn’t that fun.
                                 RHODES
                        I was just being nice.

           Rhodes leaves and Sofia closes the door. She slides a stool 
           over, steps up, and bolts the lock at the top of the door. 

           Suddenly

           SNAP

           The stool’s leg breaks and Sofia falls to the ground. 

                                 SOFIA
                        OWSHIT.

           She lies there for a beat then begins to laugh at how 
           hilariously ungraceful -- how un-Sofia -- that was.

           INT. SECURITY BOOTH - SAME TIME

           Penny approaches Whimpering Waylon. She takes his cowboy hat 
           off, then grabs the taser from his belt.

                                 PENNY
                        I enjoy this American hat. 

           She puts it on then

           She zaps him in the neck. 

           He spazzes out and knocks the bowl of chili off the desk. 

           Penny negotiates his jaw open with her hand. 

                                 PENNY (CONT'D)
                        Open the sesame. 

           He doesn’t. 

           She electrocutes him again. 

           He does.  

           She slides the butt of the flashlight into his mouth.

                                 WAYLON
                        No. No. N---

           It’s a big fucking flashlight and it doesn’t go in easily.
           EXT. SOFIA’S DRIVEWAY - SAME

           Rhodes walks up the driveway toward the front gate, mumbling 
           to himself.

           INT. SECURITY BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Waylon’s nose blood drips onto Penny’s hands. His teeth 
           rattling against the thick, steel handle of the flashlight as 
           Penny pushes it further and further into his mouth. 

           His eyes bulge as the handle enters the top of his throat. 
           Like a snake eating a mouse.

                                 PENNY
                        Down hatch. Glug-glug-glug.

           Waylon chokes on the flashlight. Gagging and gurgling.  

           But wait. Oh shit... No, please no. Not the chili. 

           WAYLON THROWS UP HIS WIFE’S DELICIOUS CHILI 

           Beans, meat, and melted cheese seep through the corners of 
           his mouth onto the flashlight and Penny’s hands.

           It doesn’t gross her out at all. Penny likey.

           Waylon no likey. But Waylon is a cowboy. He’s not going down 
           without a fight. He reaches around and

           finds the fork from the floor and

           STABS PENNY IN THE FOOT

                                 PENNY (CONT'D)
                        MERDE!!

           He pulls the flashlight out of his throat and drills her in 
           the knee cap with it. 

           He drops the flashlight to the floor. It rolls and stops.

           SPOTLIGHTING THEM:

           Waylon pulls Penny to the ground. He straddles her and hits 
           her in the face and tits and stomach. Over and over and over 
           and over and over and over again.

           Pieces of chili hang from his mustache like dingleberries. 

           As Waylon wails on her, she starts to lose consciousness. 
           Or so he thinks. Because actually, her hand has grabbed hold 
           of a cable...

           Follow that cable up the wall, leading to the microwave that 
           sits on the shelf just above them. 

           Yank. The microwave falls and

           NAILS WAYLON IN THE HEAD. 

           She kicks him off her and reverses positions. 

           Who’s the cowboy now, bitch. 

           EXT. FRONT GATE - NIGHT

           Rhodes shakes the gate but it’s locked. He looks at the 
           security booth and walks towards it.

           INT. SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

           Straddling Waylon, Penny picks up the flashlight and...

           SHOVES THAT HANDLE BACK INTO HIS MOUTH AND PUSHES IT IN. 

           SLOWWWWLLLLLY PENETRATING HIS THROAT AGAIN. 

           WAYLON POV: The flashlight shines on Penny’s face. She looks 
           fucking nuts. She lifts the microwave above her head and...

           BRINGS IT DOWN ON THE FLASHLIGHT. 

           The flashlight goes out and we hear a... 

           CRACK-CRUNCH 

           END POV. 

           [That was fucked. I’ll warn you next time.]

           Now, the booth is completely dark again just as Rhodes pokes 
           his head in.

                                 RHODES
                        Hey man, can you open the gate?

           Penny’s on the floor with the dead cowboy, completely still. 

           Rhodes flips the light a few times. Nothing.

                                 RHODES (CONT'D)
                        Waylon? Hello.
           No answer. Rhodes leaves. 

           Penny puts the microwave back on the shelf.

           INT. ELEANOR’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Eleanor’s by the window watching Officer Carter sit on the 
           curb next to his bicycle. Her mind is somewhere else.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Have you met Sofia before?

           Abby’s scarf is off and we see her hair is now braided. She 
           grabs a soda from the fridge. 

                                 ABBY
                        We’re very close. Best friends, you 
                        could say.

           Abby plops down on the couch and grabs the remote. 

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Why do you ask? 

           Eleanor doesn’t answer.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        He loves her. But not in love. 
                        Besides, he only dates black women 
                        and she’s the furthest thing from 
                        black. 

           Eleanor laughs and grabs Abby’s hand and takes the coke. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        You’ll never fall asleep.

           Eleanor takes a sip.

                                 ABBY
                        Did you know I was in the “Father 
                        May I” music video? 

           Eleanor looks at her.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        With the choir. I was in it. I’ve 
                        been on MTV like a million times. 
                        I bet it comes on within the hour.

           Abby turns the TV on and takes the coke back. Eleanor takes a 
           seat next to her. 
           INT. BELL’S CAMRY - NIGHT

           Bell sits in traffic on Hollywood Blvd. A movie production is 
           blocking traffic. 

                                 BELL
                        I hate LA. 

           He makes an illegal U-turn, drives for a second on the 
           sidewalk, and pulls out onto a side street. Takes off.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MANSION - NIGHT

           Sofia lights candles. She hears commotion and stops. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Hello?

           INT. DINING ROOM - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

                                 SOFIA
                        Rhodes?

           Nothing. She imagined it.  

           She lights the candelabra on the dining room table and it 
           brings light to the puzzle.  

           She looks at it for a long moment, rehashing her conversation 
           with Rhodes in her head. 

           Then, she notices the missing piece of the woman’s head on 
           the beach is now in its spot. 

           The puzzle is now complete. 

           Her breaths shorten as her mind begins to race: Who found it? 
           And when? Was it there when she and Rhodes were just 
           discussing it? Is... is someone in her house? 

           Then, movement behind her. 

           Yeah. Someone’s in her house. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        WHO’S THERE!?

           She walks into the kitchen, candle in hand like Geppetto. 
           EXT. GARAGE - MANSION - NIGHT

           Rhodes approaches the garage attached to the house. He tries 
           the door but it’s locked. He sees a window, slightly open. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MANSION - NIGHT

           Sofia enters the kitchen. She hears movement, turns around 
           quickly and 

           her candle goes out. 

           It’s dark again. There’s a lot of dark in this movie. 

           Sofia flips open her pink zippo:

           Flick-spark. Nothing. She does it again. This time, in the 
           brief spark, we catch a glimpse of 

           SOMEONE BEHIND HER 

           But the flame dies before we can confirm who.

           The flame finally catches and she lights the candle again but 

           nobody is there. 

           She sees the refrigerator is open. Another weird thing. She 
           walks around the island and closes it but

           The breeze from the door blows her candle out again. 

           Here we go again with this shitty fucking zippo: 

           Flick-spark. Nothing. This lighter sucks. 

           INT. GARAGE - MANSION - SAME

           Meanwhile, Rhodes walks through the dark garage. Finally 
           finding the fuse box. He flips a few switches and

           Lights turn on one by one. Each one spotlighting a different 
           VINTAGE CAR.

           INT. MICROWAVE - SAME

           The damaged microwave starts back up. The popcorn spins.
           INT. KITCHEN - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Still dark in the kitchen, Sofia keeps working the lighter. 

           Flick-spark. Nothing.              

           Flick-spark-- 

           THE HOUSE LIGHTS TURN ON AND

           DUERSON’S RIGHT BEHIND HER. 

           She doesn’t notice him. But we fucking do. That fucker is 
           smiling and breathing and having trouble containing his 
           excitement. It’s too much for him and

           he squeaks a little...? Like something you’d hear out of a 
           mouse or an improvisationalist trying not to break on stage. 

           And now she knows he’s there without needing to look. She 
           shuts her eyes and swallows. If she stays completely still, 
           maybe she could   just    fucking    will him away.

           He blows on the back of her neck. We can almost hear her 
           goosebumps erupt. 

           Is it really him? 

                                 DUERSON
                        Hey, puddin’.

           Yep. 

           He gently puts his hands around her waist and onto her 
           stomach. He rests his head on her back. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        I missed you a lot a lot a lot.

           She slowwwwwlllyyy turns around to face him. Every therapist 
           and family member said he was locked away for good but she 
           knew he would come back. Those fucking idiots.

           She holds her breath. Don’t breathe. Breathing makes it real. 

           Finally, she opens her mouth... but nothing comes out. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        I owe you an apology. I’m so sorry 
                        for leaving, honey.

           She still has no words, slowly backing away.
                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        What’s wrong? 

           She backs up faster. Opening drawers between them. He closes 
           them as he moves toward her. He reaches his hand out.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        I missed you.

                                 SOFIA
                        DON’T TOUCH ME. 

           Duerson’s hurt. 

                                 DUERSON
                        I... I don’t understand. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Don’t come any closer.

           She grabs two hanging pans from above the stove and...

           BANG BANG BANG BANG

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        HELP!!! HELP!!!

           Duerson covers his ears and closes his eyes. Confused.  

           INT. GARAGE - MANSION - SAME

           Rhodes sits in the driver’s seat of the BABY BLUE 1978 
           VOLKSWAGEN VAN.

           Then, he hears the banging. 

           He gets out and runs to the door that leads into the house. 

           LOCKED. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Sofia screams for help and runs out of the kitchen. 

           Duerson still covers his ears, eyes closed.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - MANSION - NIGHT

           Rhodes reaches the front door.  
           Through the window in the door, he sees Sofia, pot and pan in 
           hands, running toward him. Screaming. 

                                 RHODES
                        What’s wrong?!

           He jiggles the door. 

                                 SOFIA
                             (shouting shit through 
                              window, muffled!!) 

                                 RHODES
                        Open the door!

           INT. FRONT DOOR - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Sofia unlocks the locks fast as she can but there are so 
           many. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MANSION - SAME 

           Duerson finally releases his ears and opens his eyes. 

           They’re glossy again. 

           That same gloss from when he stabbed Bell.

           INT. FRONT DOOR - MANSION - SAME

           Sofia turns the last lock, pulls the knob. It doesn’t budge. 
           She forgot about the slide latch at the top of the door.

                                 SOFIA
                        SHIT. 

                                 RHODES
                             (muffled through door!!)

           She instinctively reaches for the stool but -- oh yeah -- the 
           leg snapped before.

           She gets on her tiptoes and reaches for it. Her finger tips 
           just        barely       reach       the       bolt. 

                                 SOFIA
                        F U C K I N G  T H I N G. 
           EXT. FRONT DOOR - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

                                 RHODES
                        Come on!

           AND

           CRACK! Sofia’s forehead hits the window in the door. The 
           window spiders. She falls to the ground out of frame. 

           Duerson stands behind her. 

           Rhodes looks into Duerson’s glazed-over eyes. 

           He sees there’s a little Sofia blood left on the glass. 

           He licks his thumb and scrubs it off. It makes an inane 
           squeegee noise. 

           INT. SECURITY BOOTH - SAME

           Penny, bloodied and bruised, eats popcorn with her feet up on 
           the desk and watches this all go down on the monitor.

           EXT. ELEANOR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bell turns the corner and double parks outside Eleanor’s 
           apartment. 

           PRELAP: knock-knock-knock-knock.

           INT. ELEANOR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Eleanor opens the door for Bell. 

                                 BELL
                        Hey, you alright?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yeah. The cop might have scared him 
                        off. 

                                 BELL
                        So the cops came? Good.

                                 ABBY
                        Just one cop. If you could even 
                        call him that. He was on a bike. 

           Abby stands at the bedroom door.
                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Feel for him though. I bet he 
                        arrived on the first day of duty 
                        like “Hell yes. This is gonna be 
                        awesome.” Then they give him a 
                        bike. He 100% lies to his friends 
                        about it. 

           Bell and Eleanor look at Abby. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Your daughter is--

                                 BELL
                        --I know.

                                 ABBY
                        Dad, what the shit is going on?

                                 BELL
                        Don’t cuss. 

                                 ABBY
                        I’m crisis cussing. Figured it was 
                        okay.

                                 BELL
                        Did the cop on a bike leave?

                                 ELEANOR
                        He’s out there. 

                                 ABBY
                        Eleanor made him wait outside.

                                 BELL
                        I didn’t see anyone out there. 

           Eleanor walks over to the window and looks outside but 
           Officer Carter is NO LONGER THERE. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        He was supposed to be keeping an 
                        eye out. 

                                 BELL
                        He left?

           Bell goes into the bedroom and grabs Abby’s backpack.

                                 ABBY
                        He was a bit of a shit. 
                                 BELL
                        Ok. No more crisis cussing.

           Bell grabs Abby’s hand. 

                                 BELL (CONT'D)
                        Come on. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Where we going?

                                 BELL
                        Police station.

           Eleanor looks out the window, down to the curb.

                                 ELEANOR
                        He was just there.

           Crane down from the window and...

           SUPER: 10 minutes earlier

           EXT. ELEANOR’S APARTMENT - 10 MINS EARLIER

           Camera finds Officer Carter standing on the curb. 

           He’s bored, singing softly to himself. Sort of tap dancing, 
           channeling Gene Kelly. Subtle enough that if someone saw him, 
           he could be pretending to do something else.

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        Well, the bottle was spilled 
                        on the barroom floor 
                        and the bar was closed for the 
                        night.
                        When out of his hole 
                        came a little brown mouse 
                        and he sat in the pale moonlight.

           He stops, looks up to Eleanor’s window. Everything seems 
           cool. He continues, getting more into it. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER (CONT'D)
                        Heeee... lapped up the bottle on 
                        the barroom floor 
                        and on his haunches, he sat.
                        And all through the night 
                        you could hear him shouuuut...
                             (jazz hands)
                        Bring on the God damned cat!
           That was weirdly kind of amazing. He chuckles to himself then 
           looks at his bike and notices

           The chain is broken. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

           When did that happen? He flips the bike over and works it.

                                 J.H. (O.S.)
                        Need some help, Officer?

           Carter turns his head and looks up at 

           J.H. Calhoun and his one eye.

           Carter knows this could be the guy Eleanor called about, he 
           proceeds with care. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        I got it. Thank you. 

                                 J.H.
                        I really liked your song. Are you 
                        professional? 

           Carter slyly unbuttons his gun holster. 

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        No. I used to dance.

                                 J.H.
                        Well you’re really great at it.

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        Thank you. 

                                 J.H.
                        What are you doing out here?

           Carter cloaks his fear as J.H. stands just behind him.  

                                 OFFICER CARTER
                        I’m a cop. Just following orders. 

           Carter reaches for his belt but 

           J.H. beats him to it.

                                 J.H.
                        Me too.

           J.H. takes the gun and tosses it into the bushes. 
           Then, he grabs the bicycle. 

           It doesn’t weigh much to him. 

           He lifts it up over his head and swings down but misses left. 

           He lifts it again and

           [WARNING: If you don’t like this sort of thing, skip ahead to 
           the big X]

           ABSOLUTELY FUCKING LEVELS OFFICER CARTER WITH IT.

           Carter didn’t even have a chance to scream. The bike’s rear 
           strobe light switches on. 

           QUICKIES IN FLASHES: J.H. rips off the chain and wraps it 
           around Carter’s neck. He pulls tighter and tighter. Carter’s 
           neck is covered in grease and blood. One final squeeze and 

           CRACK. 

           Carter dies real quick. 
                                           X

           J.H. looks down at his work... 

           The bike is as mangled as the cop.

           He puts his hand on the wheel and it stops spinning. Then:

           HEADLIGHTS 

           Bell’s car pulls around the block as J.H. drags the cop and 
           the bike into the alley.

           Bell gets out of the car and enters Eleanor’s building. 

           A FEW MINUTES LATER:

           Bell exits with Abby and Eleanor. 

           INT. BELL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The three pile into the car. Abby’s in back. Bell puts the 
           car in drive when 

           VIRGIL (homeless, 30s) trips out into the road and falls in 
           front of the car. 
                                 ABBY
                        Dad! Look out!

           Bell slams on the breaks.

                                 VIRGIL
                        WHAT THE FUCK. 

           Virgil crab-walks away from the alley. Trying to catch his 
           breath as Bell rolls down the window.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT'D)
                             (hysterical)
                        I--I’m gonna-- I can’t get-- I 
                        can’t go down for that. This shit’s 
                        not good. 

                                 BELL
                        It’s okay. Just slow down.

                          VIRGIL
           I can’t--
                                                          BELL (CONT'D)
                                              Slow down. What happened?

           Virgil breathes. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT'D)
                        A cop. He... he... I don’t know, 
                        man. He’s not great.

           Eleanor looks at Abby.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Was he a young guy?

                                 VIRGIL
                        Like a baby.

                                 ABBY
                        Is he dead?

                                 VIRGIL
                        I don’t know for sure. He looked 
                        pretty fucking dead, little girl. 

                                 BELL
                        You see anybody else?

                                 VIRGIL
                        I didn’t kill him. I promise--

           Virgil runs away.

           Bell looks to the alley to see the bicycle leaning against 
           the dumpster. He gets out. 
                                 ELEANOR
                        Don’t. Let’s just go. 

                                 BELL
                        I have to see if he’s alive. Leave 
                        the car on and just drive if 
                        anything happens.

           Eleanor climbs over to the driver’s seat and hits the wipers.

                                 ELEANOR
                        This windshield is filthy.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Bell walks down the alley with his gun out. 

           He sees: The cop’s legs dangling out of the top of a shopping 
           cart. Bell checks him. He’s pretty fucking dead.

           EXT. ELEANOR’S STREET - NIGHT

           Bell walks back to his car. He can see Eleanor through the 
           glass of the windshield. 

           The wipers go back and forth. 

           As he moves closer, the wipers stop. 

           And he registers Eleanor’s expression: horror.

           Then, backseat light is switched on and we see

           J.H. -- in the back-middle seat, covering one eye. 

           Bell approaches the passenger’s side. J.H. removes his hand 
           from his eye and rolls down the window a few inches. We get 
           another great look at that fucking thing. 

                                 J.H.
                        Can I please have that gun?

           Bell looks at Abby, J.H.’s left hand around her neck.

                                 ABBY
                        His hand is cold, dad.

                                 J.H.
                        Let go of her.

           J.H. does. Bell hands him the gun then gets in the 
           passenger’s seat. 
           INT. BELL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 J.H.
                        Ma’am, please drive us to Sofia’s 
                        house. 

           Eleanor looks at Bell and he nods. She puts the car in drive.

                                 BELL
                        You work for Paul Duerson? 

                                 J.H.
                        We are brothers sort of.

                                 ELEANOR
                        How did he know where I lived, 
                        William?

                                 J.H.
                        I’ve been following you guys around 
                        for ages. I saw that you like to 
                        cook, ma’am. I really love to cook 
                        too... Oh, oops. 

           J.H. covers his eye again. 

                                 J.H. (CONT'D)
                             (to Abby)
                        It’s okay. Don’t be scared.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m not scared. My dad’s here. Can 
                        you move over? There’s so much room 
                        on your side.

           EXT. SOFIA ESTATE - NIGHT

           Rhodes hides his massive body behind a tree and watches as 
           Penny drags the red trunk across the front yard. 

           She turns, he hides.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - MANSION - NIGHT

           We’re inside Sofia’s awesome home recording studio.

           There’s a switchboard, a few couches, and a kitchenette 
           outside of a LONDON RED TELEPHONE BOOTH that’s been 
           retrofitted into a RECORDING BOOTH. 

           Sofia’s inside it, unconscious. 
           INT. BELL’S CAMRY - NIGHT

           Eleanor drives up Mulholland. Bell’s next to her. Abby and 
           J.H. are in the back. 

                                 BELL
                        What are we doing? 

                                 J.H.
                        I’m not supposed to talk much. Paul 
                        is such a great planner he doesn’t 
                        want me to ruin anything. 

                                 BELL
                        Just let them out. Please. 

                                 J.H.
                        Pull over here. 

           Eleanor does. Bell’s relieved. 

                                 J.H. (CONT'D)
                        Get out. 

                                 BELL
                        Thank you. 

           J.H. puts the gun to the back of Bell’s neck. 

                                 J.H.
                        You get out.

                                 ABBY
                        Dad.

                                 BELL
                        It’s okay. 

           Bell gets out of the car.

           EXT. ROAD SIDE - CONTINUOUS

           J.H. gets out and easily tosses Bell to the ground. 

                                 J.H.
                        On your knees. 

           Bell does as he’s instructed. 

                                 ABBY
                        Dad, no!

           Abby gets out, but Eleanor grabs her. 
                                 J.H.
                        No closer.

                                 BELL
                        Get back in the car, Sweetheart.
                             (to J.H.)
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 J.H.
                        He doesn’t want you screwing 
                        tonight up for him.

           J.H. puts the gun to Bell’s head. Execution style.

                                 BELL
                        Abby, turn around. Can you do that 
                        for me? I love you.

           Abby and Eleanor slowly turn around. 

           We stay on Abby’s face. Tears flood and

           BANG.

           Bell drops to the ground in the background. 

           Abby turns and attacks J.H., screaming as he carries her back 
           in the car. 

           INT. BELL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Abby screams and smacks J.H. in the face. He lets her.  

                                 J.H.
                        Sofia’s house please. 

           Abby looks out the back window, crying, as they pull away. 

           INT. RECORDING BOOTH - MANSION - LATER

           Sofia’s chin to chest and slowly comes to. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Wh-- OW. Shit.

           She touches her forehead and we see her injury has been 
           kindly tended. She tries to push the door open. Won’t budge. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        HELLO!?
           She grabs the mic stand and slams it against the window but 
           it just bounces off. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        HELLO! LET ME OUT!

           INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           In the studio, Sofia’s screams are muted through the glass.

           INT. RECORDING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

                                 SOFIA
                        Help! Someone! 

           Suddenly, the door in the studio opens and in walks Duerson, 
           holding frozen peas. He starts to speak but Sofia can’t hear 
           a thing inside the booth. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        I can’t hear you. 

           Sofia slides open a slat on the door of the booth, about the 
           size of a mail slot.

                                 DUERSON
                        Did you catch any of that?

                                 SOFIA
                        No. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Should I start over?

                                 SOFIA
                        Are those for me?

           Duerson holds the peas up.

                                 DUERSON
                        Yes. 

           Duerson slides the peas through the slat. Sofia puts them to 
           her head.   

                                 SOFIA
                        Thank you.

                                 DUERSON
                        I figured you’d still be napping. 
                                 SOFIA
                        I wasn’t napping. You knocked me 
                        out, Paul. 

                                 DUERSON
                        I love it when you call me by my 
                        name. 

                                 SOFIA
                        You haven’t done anything wrong 
                        yet. 

           Lol.

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        We can still walk away from this.

                                 DUERSON
                        Together?

                                 SOFIA
                        What?

                                 DUERSON
                        You want to walk away from this 
                        together? 

           Sofia doesn’t respond. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        I know you’re mad that I left you 
                        but I really needed some time to 
                        focus on me before I could focus on 
                        us. But now I’m ready to be with 
                        you forever. If you could just let 
                        bygones be bygones... Tonight’s a 
                        clean slate.

           Sofia contemplates the best path forward. 

                                 SOFIA
                        You really want things to go back 
                        to the way they were? 

                                 DUERSON
                             (not angrily)
                        That’s what I’ve been trying to 
                        tell you! 

                                 SOFIA
                        Okay then. Let’s be together, Paul. 
                        Let me out. 
                             (Duerson’s unsure)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        So we’re going to spend the rest of 
                        our lives together but, what, 
                        you’ll just keep me in this box? 
                        Come on, Paul. Let me out and I’ll 
                        give you a tour of the house. I’ll 
                        show you the jacuzzi. 

                                 DUERSON
                        You’re hilarious, Sofia. Like I 
                        don’t know where the jacuzzi is. 
                        I’ve been here a bazillion times. 

           That’s terrifying. 

           Then, a bloody Penny enters, carrying a suit bag. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        This is Penny. We met on the 
                        inside. Don’t worry, we’re not 
                        together. She’s from Nice in 
                        France. It’s spelled like “nice.”

                                 SOFIA
                        Nice. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Hilarious again, Sofia. Truly. Now, 
                        time to get ready.

           Sofia watches Duerson leave. She locks eyes with Penny. 

           MONTAGE: Cue “Borderline” by the Flaming Lips with Stardeath 
           and White Dwarfs. [A cover of the Madonna song. Pull it up.]

           . Duerson carries chairs out of the dining room. Then he 
           drags the red trunk down the hallway.  

           . Eleanor looks at a devastated Abby in the rearview.  

           . Duerson blows bubbles out of his hands in the jacuzzi. 

           . Penny slowly unzips the suit bag in the recording studio. 

           . Duerson shaves in Sofia’s sink using her pink razor. A drop 
           of blood hits the faucet. He doesn’t notice. More blood falls 
           from Duerson’s face as he ties his tie in the mirror. The 
           sink covered in blood. Same with the towels.

           . Duerson exits Sofia’s room just as... The balcony door 
           opens and Rhodes climbs in. Rhodes walks into the bathroom 
           and sees the blood soaked counter. 

           . Duerson buzzes the gate open from Bell’s office and the 
           camry drives through. The camry pulls up to the mansion. 
           . Penny unzips the bag revealing... A WEDDING DRESS. 

                                 SOFIA
                             (”what the fuck?”)

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. ATRIUM - MANSION - NIGHT

           The open-roofed atrium is located in the center of the 
           mansion. There’s a cherub fountain in the center of a 
           beautiful garden. Mismatched chairs from around the house 
           face the fountain. 

           Patent leather shoes enter frame. Climb up the legs to reveal 
           Duerson in full tuxedo. His face patched up from his terrible 
           shave job.

           INT. MASTER STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Rhodes sneaks down the stairs from Sofia’s bedroom. He stops 
           when he hears the front door open. 

           RHODES POV: Abby and Eleanor enter, holding hands. J.H. is 
           behind them with the gun.

                                 DUERSON (O.S.)
                        Welcome! 

           INT. ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Duerson greats them from down the hall. He sees J.H.’s gun.

                                 DUERSON
                        Put that away. What kind of way is 
                        that to treat our guests?

                                 J.H.
                        I killed a cop with his bicycle. 
                        And her dad with this gun here. 

           Abby wants to burst into tears. She holds it together.

                                 DUERSON
                        Just put it away. Now... 

           Duerson bows. Eleanor and Abby grip each other’s hands.

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Duerson leads them through the corridor with many doors to 
           different rooms. He opens the door to the recording studio. 

                                 DUERSON
                        T-minus five? 

           Inside, Penny nods. 

           Abby and Sofia make eye-contact just as the door closes.

           INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Rhodes checks every room down the hall, searching for Sofia.  

           INT. TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rhodes enters a self-congratulatory trophy room. Inside are 
           framed records, some grammys, and other shit. No time to 
           admire it, he turns to leave when something catches his eye: 

           A large display case with a mannequin wearing Sofia’s 
           baseball player outfit from “Lu’s on First.” Like something 
           you’d see at the Arclight. Rhodes opens the case and reaches 
           for A BASEBALL BAT. 

           Dope. Weapons.

           It has “Love, Kevin Costner” carved into the barrel. 

           Dope. Kevin Costner weapons.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

           Penny walks the wedding dress to Sofia in the booth. She 
           opens the door just a crack and slides the dress in. 

                                 PENNY
                        You have a wonderful skin and body. 
                        You will be pretty for Paul in this 
                        dress. 

           Sofia grabs the dress. Penny’s about to close the door...

                                 SOFIA
                        Wait... Can you-- grab my makeup? 
                        It’s in the master bath, left of 
                        the sink. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        I need my makeup to be pretty for 
                        Paul.

           Penny thinks, nods, and shuts the booth door.

           She walks to the door but turns back--

                                 PENNY
                        I am excitement to live here with 
                        you and Paul. With some small 
                        change, this can be my room.

           Penny exits. 

           Sofia waits. Then opens the booth door and 

           peels off an album sticker that she taped over the lock. 

           She did good.

           She sheds her robe and slaps the sticker proudly on her tank. 

           She grabs an ELECTRIC GUITAR from a stand. 

           Dope. Music weapons.

           She waits for Penny.

                                 SOFIA
                        Let’s go. Come on. 

           She sees a shadow on the other side of the door. 

           Sofia grips the guitar. The door opens slowly and 

           SHE SWINGS

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        AHH!

           CRACK!

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        No!

           We hear the sound of a bat hitting the tile. 

           Turn around and

           RHODES FALLS TO THE FLOOR. 

           He’s out cold, wearing that silly “Lu’s on First” cap. 
                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        FUCK! 

           EXT. ATRIUM - MANSION - NIGHT

           Eleanor is tied to a chair with rope and a duct taped mouth. 

           We notice a small table with CHAMPAGNE AND GLASSES set up. 
           The FIRST AID KIT sits below it on the floor. 

           Duerson and Abby drag the red trunk down the make-shift aisle 
           and place it at the fountain.

                                 DUERSON
                        Thanks for your help. 

                                 ABBY
                        You’re the one who keeps calling 
                        me.

                                 DUERSON
                        Yes. 

                                 ABBY
                        Why?

                                 DUERSON
                        I wanted to ask you to be the 
                        flower girl. 

           Abby looks at Eleanor -- Just do what he says.

                                 ABBY
                        Okay. I’ll be your flower girl. 

           Then, we hear muffled crying.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        What is that? 

           Abby searches for the source as the crying continues.  

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Paul? 

                                 DUERSON
                        Yes, flower girl? 

                                 ABBY
                        Is someone... in the trunk? 

                                 DUERSON
                        Yes, flower girl. 
                                 ABBY
                        Can-- can we let him out?

                                 DUERSON
                        Of course.  

           Duerson bends down and unlocks the trunk, opening it to 
           reveal the spry grandpa... 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Tim! Welcome!

           It’s Tim. (The old man that Penny asked for help) 

           He’s got a plastic bag around his neck and some dried blood 
           on his nose. Duerson comes into focus. 

                                 TIM
                        Paul?

           QUICKIES (FLASHBACK):

           . Penny stands outside as Tim opens the door, looks at the 
           crucifix on the wall. (The scene we saw before.) 

           . Penny and Tim walk toward J.H.’s pickup truck, parked on 
           the street.

           . Penny throws a plastic grocery bag over Tim’s head and 
           pulls it tight. He struggles but she’s got him. He sucks in 
           plastic a few times. 

           . Penny punches Tim in the face. His nose bleeds in the bag. 

           END QUICKIES.

                                 DUERSON
                        Tim! You made it! 

           Abby approaches the trunk and looks at Tim, who is absolutely 
           fucking horrified. She helps him out and he immediately falls 
           to the floor. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        I want you to meet Tim Lutzer from 
                        Saint Clement Church in La Cañada.

           Duerson smiles. 

                                 EVERYONE ELSE
                                 DUERSON
                             (to Tim)
                        Please help yourself to champagne 
                        and first aid.

                                 ABBY
                        You... put a Priest in a box?

                                 DUERSON
                        No. I put a Minister in a box. Tim 
                        was my Minister growing up. He also 
                        coached the church’s softball team.  
                        Isn’t that right Tim?  

           Abby helps Tim to his feet. 

                                 TIM
                        This is insane. 

                                 ABBY
                        You have no idea, man.

                                 DUERSON
                        Let’s get started. Where’s the 
                        bride? 

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

           Rhodes is passed out. Sofia lightly slaps his cheeks. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Come on. Wake up. Wake up. 

           Rhodes eye’s flutter open. Sofia comes into focus.  

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        Hey. 

                                 RHODES
                        I’m sorry I left you. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I’m sorry I hit you in the face 
                        with a guitar. 

                                 RHODES
                        Was it on purpose?

                                 SOFIA
                        No.
                                 RHODES
                        We’re probably both going to die 
                        tonight. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I know. 

           Then, Rhodes violently shoves Sofia off of him just in time 
           to protect her from the Kevin Costner baseball bat that’s 
           barreling toward them.  

           Penny swings it like a golf club and

           NAILS RHODES IN THE JAW. 

           He’s out cold again.

           Penny swings at Sofia. She dodges then kicks Penny in the 
           chest. Sending her falling back

           onto the piano. 

           Her ass inadvertently plays a chord. It is undeniably the 
           first chord of the intro to Billy Joel’s “Piano Man.” 

           They pause. 

           Sofia approaches the Piano 

           and finishes the intro...?

           Then, they duet the entire song. Sofia sings beautifully. 
           Penny ain’t bad herself.

                                 PENNY
                        La la la, di da da!

                                 SOFIA
                        La la, di da da da dum!

           Rhodes comes to on the floor and watches this go down. Is 
           this really happening? Probably not. 

           He passes out again. 

           Then

           SOFIA LAUNCHES AT PENNY. 

           They fall through a blackout window shade and break glass--

           Landing outside on the second floor deck.
           EXT. SECOND FLOOR DECK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           They roll around on top of each other... swapping advantages 
           a few times... then, Sofia kicks Penny off and crawls toward 
           the charcoal grill. 

           She grabs a FORK THERMOMETER from the grill to protect 
           herself. This doesn’t worry Penny. She attacks without a 
           weapon and sure enough...

           SOFIA STABS PENNY IN THE GUT. 

           Sofia lets go. She can’t believe she just did that. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Holy shit. 

           Penny looks down at the fork thermometer in her gut. 

           It reads 80°F. Cold blooded I guess. She leaves it in. 

           Then punches Sofia in the face. 

           Sofia hits the floor, trying to shake it off but that was a 
           powerful blow. 

           PENNY DOUSES SOFIA IN LIQUID. 

           It not until Sofia tastes it that she realizes it’s not 
           water. 

           IT’S LIGHTER FLUID.

           A lot of it. It creates a pool around her. 

           She tries to get up but Penny sends her back down. She climbs 
           on top of her -- MATCHBOOK in hand. 

           She lights a match but Sofia blows it out. She lights another 
           but Sofia blows it out again. 

           Sofia looks at Penny’s stomach then... sits up with all she 
           has and pulls Penny’s torso toward hers... driving the fork 
           thermometer even further inside the frenchwoman’s tummy.  

           PENNY HOWLS IN PAIN. 

           She falls off Sofia, into the pool of lighter fluid. She 
           tries to remove the thermometer but it’s fucking deep and far 
           too painful. Penny looks up.

           Sofia douses her in lighter fluid and holds up her zippo.
           She thinks for a long ass time about whether to set this 
           fucking asshole on fire. 

                                 PENNY
                        Do it. 

           But, no. That’s not her. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Sofia doesn’t light people on fire. 

           So she leaves her there to bleed out instead.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER 

           Sofia limps in. She turns around to check on Penny through 
           the broken window... still lying on the deck in pain. 

           Sofia returns to Rhodes. He’s breathing but not moving. She 
           props him up against the wall. She turns around to check on 
           Penny once more but... 

           PENNY’S GONE. 

                                 SOFIA
                        What the f--

           She turns back to Rhodes and

                                 PENNY
                        AHHHHH!

           Penny’s standing behind her. She puts Sofia into a headlock 
           and drags her into the recording booth.  

           INT. RECORDING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Penny’s still got that fork thermometer in her gut. 

           They exchange blows and take turns slamming each other’s 
           faces into the booth walls. 

           Penny straddles Sofia, choking her out until

           Penny sneezes and blood explodes from her nose and paints 
           Sofia’s face. Penny’s about the sneeze again when

           Sofia kicks her off.

           And uses the mic stand to choke Penny out.

           It’s working.
           Penny gasps for breath as Sofia pushes harder and harder. 

           And again, considers if she’s a murderer or not. 

           She’s not. 

           She lets go and Penny falls to the floor, holding her neck. 

           Sofia climbs out of the booth, slides the baseball bat into 
           the door and locks Penny in.  

           INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Sofia and Penny stare at each other for a beat before Penny 
           starts hysterically laughing. Blood seeps through her teeth 
           and dark red bubbles percolate from her nose.

           Once again, Sofia considers the type of person she is: 

           To murder or not to murder? 

           And this time... 

           SOFIA CHOOSES MURDER!!! 

           Sofia grabs the “Lu’s on First” hat from the floor and 
           retrieves the pink zippo from her pocket. 

           And this time, that fucker lights first try.

           SHE SETS THE HAT ON FIRE. 

           She walks it over to the booth and slips the flaming 
           production swag through the slat, shuts it, and holds it 
           closed. 

           INT. RECORDING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           The hat falls to the floor of the booth but it doesn’t have 
           quite the desired effect. 

           Penny laughs at the impotent flame. Then

           FLAME

           The hat catches on some errant lighter fluid and makes its 
           way to Penny’s legs. Oh shit. Penny stands up. 

                                 PENNY
                        Out! Out!

           Her shoe catches fire first. 
                                 PENNY (CONT'D)
                        NO!

           The fire crawls up her leg. The fork thermometer temperature 
           climbs rapidly and...

           PENNY’S COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN FLAMES. 

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           This is way more fucked up than Sofia expected but she can’t 
           hear Penny’s screams in the booth so I guess that’s good.

           Sofia grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER from the closet... then waits 
           about three Mississippis for Penny to die. She’s not taking 
           any chances. Then, finally

           PENNY DIES 

           Sofia places the hose through the slat and extinguishes the 
           remaining flames. 

           Another three Mississippis and

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                        Fuuuucccckkkkk. 

           Sofia drops the extinguisher and runs over to Rhodes who just 
           watched that whole thing. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Hey, you okay? 
                             (then)
                        It was me or her. 

                                 RHODES
                        Yeah, cool.

                                 SOFIA
                        Seriously, she’s a psycho. 

                                 RHODES
                        I said cool. Let’s get out of here. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I have to get Abby.

           Sofia gets up.

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        Meet me outside. 
           EXT. ATRIUM - MANSION - NIGHT

           Duerson’s antsy by the fountain next to Tim, Abby, and J.H.

           Abby stares daggers at her father’s murderer. She looks at 
           the champagne table then to the first aid kit where she sees 

           HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H202!)

           Duerson checks his watch even though he’s not wearing one.

                                 DUERSON
                        She’s very late. What do you think 
                        she’s doing? She’s not having 
                        seconds thoughts you don’t think. 
                        She loves me. We’re going to be 
                        together. 

           Abby notices his eyes are glossy. 

                                 J.H.
                        I’ll get her. 

                                 DUERSON
                        No. She needs me.  

           Duerson exits. 

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Rhodes’s finally made it to his feet after two brutal blows 
           to the head. 

                                 DUERSON (O.S.)
                        Honey, are you ready?

           Duerson enters with glossy eyes and finds Rhodes. 

           Rhodes looks at the baseball bat lodged in the booth door.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        You’re not having second thoughts 
                        are you?

           Duerson’s got a knife in his hand. Rhodes clocks it.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        I know it’s scary to take this 
                        leap. But it’s a leap of faith. I 
                        love you Sofia.

           Wait...
           THIS MOTHERFUCKER THINKS RHODES IS SOFIA. 

           So Rhodes decides to play the part.

                                 RHODES
                        I’m... nervous?

           Duerson tenderly approaches Rhodes.

                                 DUERSON
                        No need to be scared, baby. 

           He rubs Rhodes’s hand. What the fuck. 

           EXT. ATRIUM - EARLY MORNING

           Abby pours champagne into a glass. While J.H. isn’t looking, 
           she slowly pours the hydrogen peroxide into the glass and 
           swirls it around.  

           Sofia enters the atrium and runs straight for Abby. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Abby! Are you okay?

           Abby’s eyes are trained on J.H.

           Sofia wraps her in a hug and Abby tries not to spill the 
           champagne peroxide. 

           J.H. steps forward.

                                 J.H.
                        Shouldn’t you be getting ready? 
                        Where’s Paul?

                                 SOFIA
                        Who are you?

                                 J.H.
                        I’m the best man. 

                                 SOFIA
                             (then, noticing 
                              everything)
                        He really thought we were getting 
                        married?

                                 ABBY
                        He put a Minister in a box, Sofia. 

           Abby points at Tim. 
                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        That’s Tim. 

           Tim waves.

                                 SOFIA
                        Where’s your dad?

           Abby doesn’t answer. 

                                 SOFIA (CONT'D)
                        What happened to your father?

           Abby tears up. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROADSIDE - EARLY MORNING

           Find Bell motionless on the side of the road. 

           Suddenly

           Movement. 

           He slowly climbs to his feet, holding the left side of his 
           head. He looks at his fingers and sees blood. 

           J.H. missed left but 

           He shot Bell’s ear clean off. 

           Then, we hear barking as a woman, CAT (60s, pink tracksuit, 
           Angelyne-type) approaches walking her dog. 

                                 CAT
                        Tori, quiet!
                             (noticing)
                        Are you ok? Looks like someone 
                        clipped you pretty good. People 
                        drive like freaking maniacs up 
                        here.

           EXT. ATRIUM - EARLY MORNING

           Abby eyes J.H., who waits patiently at the altar for the 
           ceremony to begin. She slowly walks toward him with the 
           Champagne Peroxide in hand. 

                                 ABBY
                        Champagne while we wait?
           J.H. looks at Abby then to the champagne. 

           He slowly reaches for it. Then, he chucks the glass and it 
           smashes to bits on the Cherub statue. 

                                 J.H.
                        I don’t drink anymore. You’d know 
                        that if we could just get to my 
                        speech already.

           Shit.

                                 ABBY
                        Coulda just said no. 

           Duerson enters. 

                                 DUERSON
                        OK! She’s coming!

           Duerson and Sofia make eye contact. 

           But he doesn’t see her as Sofia anymore. 

           Rhodes is his Sofia now. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Take a seat. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I--

                                 DUERSON
                        You’re a guest. Today’s not about 
                        you. 

           OK... Sofia takes a seat next to Eleanor. Then removes the 
           duct tape from her mouth.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Thank you. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Who are you?

                                 DUERSON
                        Places! Give me a thumbs up when 
                        you’re all set flower girl. 

           Abby’s now at the other end of the aisle. She gives him a 
           thumbs up. 

           Duerson’s got a gigantic smile on his face. He presses play 
           on a small radio and it plays a processional song. 
           EXT. CAT’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Bell and Cat run up the hill, arriving at Cat’s house with a 
           PINK COVETTE parked outside. Bell gets in passenger-side. 

           INT. CAT’S PINK CORVETTE - CONTINUOUS

           Bell picks up the CAR PHONE that sits in the center console 
           and has gigantic buttons. He dials 911.

                                 CAT
                             (getting in)
                        Car needs to be on for that to 
                        work. 

           Cat starts the car and revs the engine. Bell dials 911 and 
           puts the phone to his half-blown off ear. He winces.

                                 CAT (CONT'D)
                        Want me to get you some ice for 
                        that?

                                 BELL
                        Do you have a gun?

                                 CAT
                        No? 

           EXT. ATRIUM - EARLY MORNING

           The processional music continues as Abby slowly walks down 
           the aisle. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Drop the flowers please. 

           Abby mimes dropping flowers then takes a seat next to Sofia 
           and Eleanor. 

           The music changes to “Here Comes the Bride”

           Everyone turns as

           RHODES APPEARS AT THE DOOR. 

           He’s wearing the wedding dress. It’s wayyy too small, tearing 
           in multiple parts. A veil covers his face. 

           Duerson swoons. 

           Tim the Minister thinks he’s just about seen it all. 
           Same with Eleanor and Abby and Sofia.

           J.H. is confused. 

           Rhodes walks slowly down the aisle.

           INT. CAT’S PINK CORVETTE - EARLY MORNING

           Cat drives Bell in a PINK CORVETTE up Mulholland.

           Cat puts a cig in her lips. 

                                 CAT
                        Would you?

           Bell leans over and grabs the car cigarette lighter and 
           lights Cat up. 

           EXT. ATRIUM - EARLY MORNING

           Rhodes finally reaches Duerson and Tim at the fountain. 

           J.H. tries to wrap his mind around what’s happening.

           Duerson removes Rhodes’s veil and nudges Tim to start.

                                 TIM
                        ... Do you, Paul, take... 

           Tim looks at Rhodes. 

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Your name?

           Beat.

                                 RHODES
                        Sofia.

                                 TIM
                        Sofia? 

                                 J.H.
                        Hey, uh, Paul. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Shush down, J.H.

                                 J.H.
                        I think you’re confused, Paul. 
                        That’s not Sofia.
                                 DUERSON
                        What are you talking about?
                             (then, to Rhodes)
                        You are Sofia, right? 

                                 RHODES
                        Yes.

                                 J.H.
                        That’s a black man. He’s like seven 
                        feet tall. 

           Duerson’s getting confused. 

                                 J.H. (CONT'D)
                        That’s Sofia.

           J.H. points over to the real Sofia. Duerson looks--

           Sofia avoids eye-contact.

                                 DUERSON
                        Her?

           Rhodes grabs Duerson’s hand.

                                 RHODES
                        Come on, baby. It’s me. 

           Beat.

                                 DUERSON
                        ... No.

           Fuck. 

           Duerson walks toward the real Sofia. 

           Then:

                                 RHODES (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                        Disarm you with a smile... 

           Duerson turns back to Rhodes. He’s standing up straight at 
           the altar. He’s found some confidence. 

           A long beat as everyone turns their attention to him.

           He continues:
                                 RHODES (CONT'D)
                        And leave you like they left me 
                        here 
                        To wither in denial 
                        The bitterness of one who's left 
                        alone
                        Ooh, the years burn
                        Ooh, the years burn

           Duerson turns to the real Sofia then back to Rhodes. 

           But now, in DUERSON POV, he sees...

           SOFIA AT THE ALTAR

           IN A WEDDING DRESS

           SINGING BEAUTIFULLY WITH STRING ACCOMPANIMENT 

                                 SOFIA (DELUSION)
                        I used to be a little girl 
                        So old in my shoes 
                        And what I choose is my choice 
                        What's a girl supposed to do? 

           Duerson begins to cry. This moment means everything in the 
           world to him. 

                                 SOFIA (DELUSION) (CONT'D)
                        The killer in me is the killer in 
                        you
                        My love
                        I send this smile over to you.

           [FYI, that’s The Smashing Pumpkins’ “Disarm.” We’ll use it 
           until we find someone to write an original.] 

           END POV.

           This is truly weird but everyone is slightly moved? Rhodes is 
           Rhodes again as Duerson approaches him at the altar. 

                                 DUERSON
                        Tim. You may begin again.

                                 TIM
                        Do you Paul take... Sofia... to be 
                        your lawfully wedded wife?

                                 DUERSON
                        I do.
                                 TIM
                        Do you Sofia take Paul to be your 
                        lawfully wedded husband?

                                 RHODES
                        I do.

           EXT. SOFIA’S ESTATE - EARLY MORNING

           Bell and Cat sit in her pink Corvette outside of the gate. 

           THREE SQUAD CARS PULL UP. No sirens, no lights. 

           EXT. ATRIUM - EARLY MORNING

                                 TIM
                        By the power vested in me...

           INT. FOYER - EARLY MORNING

           The door is open. Bell and six OFFICERS quietly walk into the 
           Sofia’s house. An officer hands Bell and gun.

           EXT. ATRIUM - EARLY MORNING

                                 TIM
                        ... and as witnessed by friends and 
                        family, I now pronounce you husband 
                        and wife. You may kiss the bride.

           And then DUERSON KISSES RHODES 

                                 EVERYONE

                                 ELEANOR
                        Shouldn’t we do something?

                                 SOFIA
                        This is all he wanted. 

           INT. CORRIDOR (LEADING TO ATRIUM) - EARLY MORNING

           Guns drawn, Bell and the officers count to three and burst 
           into the atrium but...

           NOBODY’S THERE. The trunk, radio, and chairs are there but 
           the wedding is gone. 
           SUPER: 10 MINUTES EARLIER

           Off Bell, we FLIP AROUND to find --

           Duerson and Rhodes at the fountain with Tim. Duerson grabs 
           Rhodes’s hand and holds it in the air.

                                 DUERSON
                        Ladies and Gentleman, for the first 
                        time ever. Mr. and Mrs. Paul 
                        Duerson!

           J.H. is the only one who claps.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Now, if you’ll all follow me. We’ll 
                        take the bus to the after party 
                        then Sofia and I will consummate. 

                                 RHODES
                             (low)
                        For fuck’s sake.

           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Cans are now tied to the bumper of the baby blue 1978 
           Volkswagen van. 

           The wedding party piles in. 

                                 ELEANOR
                             (to Abby)
                        Buckle your seatbelt. 

           The garage door opens. J.H. stomps on the gas. 

           EXT. CAT’S PINK CORVETTE - JUST EARLIER

           Back to the scene we saw earlier from a different angle. Cat 
           puts a cig in her lips. 

                                 CAT
                        Would you?

           Just as Bell leans over to grab the lighter, through the 
           window, in the distance, we see...

           The baby blue 1978 Volkswagen Van turn around a corner at 
           blistering speed. 

           Bell lights Cat’s cig without noticing. 
           EXT. GATE - EARLY MORNING

           We’re all caught up now. 

           The four squad cars pull out of Sofia’s. Sirens and lights on 
           full blast. 

           EXT. MULHOLLAND - EARLY MORNING

           It’s around 4:30AM. And we know that because Kaylor (Sofia’s 
           assistant) is jogging up Mulholland. She’s carrying a green 
           goblin smoothie, trying not to spill.

           EXT. MULHOLLAND - OTHER 

           The VW wobbles a little as it careens around a corner at top 
           speed. 

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN VAN - CONTINUOUS

                                 SOFIA
                        Slow down! 

           Then, through the windshield, they see 

           Kaylor

           Oh, shit. 

                                 EVERYONE 
                        Watch out!

           J.H. SLAMS ON THE BREAKS. 

           EXT. MULHOLLAND - CONTINUOUS

           Before reaching Kaylor, the van tailspins and flips.  

           THE VAN ROLLS OVER 

           MULTIPLE TIMES

           BARRELING TOWARD HER. 

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN VAN - SAME

           Everyone holds on for dear life. Eleanor holds Abby tight.
           EXT. MULHOLLAND - CONTINUOUS

           The van flips upside-down, spins, and CLIPS KAYLOR. The 
           smoothie goes flying. So does Kaylor. She hits a tree, and 
           her neck is impaled on a branch lands facedown in the dirt. 
           She’s dead. She’ll be okay. Then--

           Bell arrives in a squad car and gets out. The cop goes to 
           check on Kaylor. Bell runs to the van.

                                 BELL
                        Abby?! Can you hear me? Abby are 
                        you okay?

           INT. FLIPPED VOLKSWAGEN - SAME

           Abby comes to.

           Then, she hears it.

           It’s the sound of her father’s voice. She thought she’d never 
           hear it again.  

                                 ABBY
                        Dad. DAD!

           She pulls herself out with Eleanor’s help.

           EXT. FLIPPED VOLKSWAGEN - CONTINUOUS

           Abby and Eleanor spill out. 

                                 ABBY
                        Dad! You’re alive.

           She wraps him in a hug and holds him tight. Tears rolling 
           down her cheek. 

                                 BELL
                        Are you hurt?!

                                 ABBY
                        Eleanor protected me.

           Sofia struggles to climb out. Bell helps her. Then Rhodes and 
           Tim the minister. 

                                 BELL
                        Everyone okay?

                                 RHODES
                        He’s still in there. 
           Bell nods. He kicks in a window and climbs inside. 

           INT. FLIPPED VOLKSWAGEN - CONTINUOUS

           There’s glass and blood everywhere and

           J.H. IS DEAD IN THE FRONT SEAT.

           Then... Meekly...

                                 DUERSON (O.S.)
                        William.

           Bell sees Duerson. He’s trapped but alive. Covered in blood.  

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        You missed the wedding. 

           SCAN DOWN to Bell’s waste, where his gun is tucked. Bell 
           reaches for it... but instead pulls out a handkerchief. 

           Bell wipes Duerson’s face then unbuckles him. 

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        Best night of my life. You should  
                        have seen her, William. Most 
                        gorgeous bride in the world. 

           Duerson shivers. 

           Bell takes off his “Depraved” jacket and wraps it around him. 
           Kindness for the man who has caused so much chaos. 

                                 BELL
                        Let’s go, Paul. 

           EXT. MULHOLLAND - MORNING

           Bell carries Duerson out of the van as more cop cars and 
           ambulances arrive on the scene. Sirens, lights, helicopters 
           and we CUT TO...

           LATER

           Duerson gets loaded into the back of an ambulance. 

                                 DUERSON
                        A limousine? You shouldn’t have. 
                        What a fantastic gift.

           A PARAMEDIC closes the door. And the ambulance takes off.
           Bell stands with Abby and Eleanor nearby.

                                 ABBY
                        Dad. Permission to crisis cuss? 

                                 BELL
                        Sure, baby.

                                 ABBY
                        That was the craziest fucking thing 
                        I’ve ever seen. And I know I’m only 
                        13 but I’m pretty sure it the 
                        craziest thing I’ll ever see. 

                                 BELL
                        Let’s hope. 

                                 ABBY
                        Fucking shitting nuts, dad. 

                                 BELL
                        Okay. Enough.

           CUE: “Borderline” by Tommy Emmanuel and feat. Amanda Shires.

           Bell smirks and hugs his daughter. 

           He opens his embrace and Eleanor joins them. 

           Unit.

           INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING - MORNING

           Duerson lies in the gurney and speaks to the paramedic. 

                                 DUERSON
                        You can drop us at the Hilton. We 
                        got a penthouse suite with a view 
                        of the city. Then off to Maui 
                        tomorrow.... What a night.

           Duerson leans back, closes his eyes, and smiles.

           The cue continues. It’s got a happy and content feel to it. 

           And Duerson’s got a happy and content feel to him.

                                 DUERSON (CONT'D)
                        What a night.
           EXT. MULHOLLAND - MORNING

           Rhodes, still in the wedding dress, sits with his back to a 
           tree. Sofia approaches.  

                                 SOFIA
                        You look good in a dress.

                                 RHODES
                        I know. 

                                 SOFIA
                        I murdered tonight. 

                                 RHODES
                        Yeah. 

           Sofia takes a seat next to him. Beat.

                                 SOFIA
                        I knew you knew my music. You’re 
                        clearly a huge Sofia fan... Can’t 
                        sing for shit though. 

                                 RHODES
                        I sing good enough to convince him 
                        I was you. So maybe you can’t sing 
                        for shit.

           Smiles.

                                 SOFIA
                        What do you think, should we give 
                        this a shot? You and me?

           Rhodes shrugs -- I don’t know. Sofia moves closer to him. He 
           turns his head... 

           AND THEY KISS. 

                                 RHODES
                        This’ll never work out. 

                                 SOFIA
                        Why not? 

                                 RHODES
                        I’m a married man.

           Sofia laughs and they kiss again. 

           The end.
