           EXT. UNKNOWN SPACE - DAY

           Water. At first it looks like the deep expanse of an ocean 
           but as we PULL OUT we see that it’s a single raindrop 
           falling.

           It hits TESS (30s), face tilted upwards, directly in the 
           middle of her forehead.

           The raindrop melts down her face. 

           CLOSE ON each of her features as it goes...

           EYES...

           NOSE...

           MOUTH...

           Until it drops off her chin and into a tiny bottle she has 
           waiting to catch it.

           She smiles as she puts a cork in the bottle and keeps going 
           in the rain. 

           She approaches a bus stop and notices, lying under the bench, 
           a BROKEN, BRIGHT BLUE umbrella. 

           She picks it up, un-rumples it, carefully admiring all of 
           it’s bright folds and tucks it under her arm.

           Now we see that every one of Tess’s pockets is stuffed with 
           various objects. As she walks she has the appearance of an 
           open suitcase, spilling down the street. 

           INT. TESS AND ADAM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tess enters, hiding the broken umbrella behind her back. 

           ADAM (30s), wearing a Mets jersey, jumps into the hallway 
           with a disheveled, goofy charm. 

                                 ADAM
                        We’re free! We’re officially on 
                        vacation.

                                 TESS
                        I have to finish packing.

                                 ADAM
                        I know I know but...

           As he comes close, she sees his hands covered in bandaids.
                                 TESS
                        Adam, pleeease wear gloves in the 
                        wood shop...

           She puts his hands on her face.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        I need these things in tact. What 
                        would I do without them?

                                 ADAM
                        Well I finished the last built-in  
                        for the new house on Sycamore, 
                        which means I’m done! No more cuts 
                        or bruises or-

           She kisses him.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Mmmm you know what? For that kiss, 
                        I’m gonna make lasagna. 

                                 TESS
                        Ooo too slow, I already made it 
                        last night. It’s in the freezer.

                                 ADAM
                        Damn, this is serious...I think I 
                        might love you more than the Mets.

           He kisses her.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        And just think, by tomorrow this 
                        time we will be on a beautiful, 
                        sunny beach.

           He wraps his arms around her...and feels the umbrella in her 
           hand.  

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        What’s that?

                                 TESS
                        ...nothing?

           She tentatively shows him the blue umbrella.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        It’s a good one.

           He looks at the way she’s looking at it and can’t help but 
           smile. 
                                 ADAM
                           (from Jaws)
                        “We’re gonna need a bigger boat.”

           Then he pulls a folded up sticky note out of his pocket.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Look what I found...

           Tess smiles mischievously.

                                 TESS
                        I have no idea what that is.

                                 ADAM
                        Interesting. I found it folded up 
                        in a pair of my winter socks.

           He reads:

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Dear Adam, your feet look like 
                        hobbit feet. Do you even need to 
                        wear socks? 

                                 TESS
                        Fascinating observation.

                                 ADAM
                        Who do you think wrote me that?

           She shrugs and kisses him.

                                 TESS
                        You’re never gonna find them all.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes I will.

                                 TESS
                        Just when you think you’ve found 
                        the last love note-that’s when I’ll 
                        strike again...

                                 ADAM
                        I’m not sure telling me I have 
                        hobbit feet counts as a love note.

           She backs down the hallway.

                                 TESS
                        Shows how much you know.

           She smiles at him.
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be done soon.

           He sees her full pockets....

                                 ADAM
                        By soon you mean midnight.

                                 TESS
                        No, I’m almost done. Really.

                                 ADAM
                        Well I might have finished building 
                        something new in there for you...

                                 TESS
                        The umbrella stand??

           He smiles coyly. 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        This is serious, I think I might 
                        love you more than lasagna.

           He smiles as Tess opens the door to--

           INT. TESS’S OFFICE - DAY

           ...her home office. All at once we see how Tess sees the 
           world: it is a collector’s wonderland. 

           Colorful stacks, impossibly long rows and carefully organized 
           heaps. Every inch of space is used. Next to each pile are 
           drawings of the items inside it. 

           For example, one wall is covered in every pair of converse 
           Tess ever owned, labeled by year. And there are drawings of 
           Tess at different ages, wearing each pair of converse. 

           Along the walls are also Tess’s professional accolades. From 
           framed magazine covers she drew- the New Yorker, etc- to 
           children’s book covers she illustrated.

           There are all of her father’s watches; ancient packs of Hubba 
           Bubba, and among other things... a rainbow pile of forgotten 
           umbrellas. But now, beside the pile, is a freshly built 
           umbrella stand. She runs her hand over the wood: it’s 
           perfect. We see now that all of her objects have a beautiful 
           wood container of some kind or another, built by Adam.

           She sits down at a drafting table and sketches the umbrella. 
           Simply. Beautifully. She dates it, kisses it and pins it on 
           the wall next to many other umbrella drawings.
           She takes out the tiny bottle and does the same thing- 
           sketches it, dates it, labels it “First drop of rain in June” 
           and then kisses it before opening a drawer where many other 
           tiny bottles live with similar labels.

           Beside them is a small velvet box. She takes it out and 
           brings it over to a bench (also built by Adam) where two 
           suitcases sit open.

           One of them is half packed with beach clothes.  She puts the 
           box on top of them. She thinks better of it and puts it in 
           her pocket, where it’s safe. 

           She takes a deep breath as we CUT TO--

           INT. TESS AND ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tess lies next to Adam watching him snore. His snore is very 
           particular. It’s not offensive, it’s distractingly cute. She 
           quietly sits up and sneaks out of bed.

           INT. TESS AND ADAM’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Tess scribbles on a piece of paper:

           Dear Adam, you snore like a baby elephant. I will never buy 
           you that sleep apnea machine.

           She folds it up and pulls a worn Italian cookbook from a 
           shelf. She opens to a page with a lasagna recipe. She kisses 
           the note, tucks it inside and closes the book. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. AIRPORT - MORNING

           Tess and Adam stand at the check-in desk. 

                                 AIRLINE AGENT
                        How many bags will you be checking?

                                 TESS
                        Two.

           Adam smiles as Tess puts an empty suitcase on the scale. He’s 
           seen her do this before and he loves it.

                                 AIRLINE AGENT
                        Is there anything inside?
                                 TESS
                        No but there will be.

           She turns to Adam:

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                           (quietly)
                        Imagine everything I’m going to 
                        find. We’re going SNORKELING. It’s 
                        better than fucking Christmas.

           The AIRLINE AGENT looks at Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        You heard the lady. Happy holidays.

           Off Tess’s beaming face we CUT TO-

           INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - DAY

           Tess peaks out the airplane bathroom door to see Adam dozing 
           in his seat before shutting it.

           She reaches into her pocket. She takes out the small box we 
           saw earlier and opens it. In the slot where an engagement 
           ring would typically sit is a chrome washer, the tool used in 
           building that resembles a simple silver ring. 

                                                         FLASH TO:

           EXT. PARK - DAY - YEARS EARLIER

           Tess sits down on a park bench with her sketch pad. As she 
           takes out her pencils, she notices an old tool box under her 
           feet. She picks it up and opens it, looking at all the 
           different parts and tools inside. It’s a treasure trove to 
           her.

                                 ADAM
                        See anything good in there?

           She looks up and sees Adam smiling at her.

                                 TESS
                        Hi... is this yours?

                                 ADAM
                        Yep. I’m always leaving things 
                        behind. Sorry to disturb you.

                                 TESS
                        Oh no, it’s beautiful.
                                 ADAM
                        It’s a box full of rusty old tools.

                                 TESS
                        Were you fixing this bench?

                                 ADAM
                        I was. I built it last year and-

                                 TESS
                           (very intrigued)
                        You built this bench?

           He nods. She looks around the park.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Wait...did you build all of these 
                        benches?

                                 ADAM
                        I didn’t design them or anything I 
                        just-

                                 TESS
                        That’s incredible!

                                 ADAM
                        You’re very easily impressed.

           She smiles.

                                 TESS
                        I’m Tess.

                                 ADAM
                        Adam.

           He puts his hand out to shake. She sees that it’s covered in 
           cuts and bruises. 

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, comes with the job. I mean 
                        it doesn’t necessarily, I’m just 
                        incredibly clumsy.

           While still shaking his hand:

                                 TESS
                        Do you eat lunch?
                        I mean... would you like to have 
                        lunch... with me?

           He’s surprised and delighted by her forthrightness.
                                 ADAM
                        Right now? 

           She looks at the old leather watch on her wrist.

                                 TESS
                        I guess it would be more like an 
                        early dinner.

                                 ADAM
                        We could pretend we’re an old, 
                        retired couple.

           A moment of connection as they imagine it.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Great watch, by the way.

                                 TESS
                        Thanks, it was my dad’s.

           He leans down to take a closer look and sees her tiny wrist 
           weighed down by this huge watch and finds it very sweet. 

                                 ADAM
                        Great wrists too.

           Her heart starts to race, his face right in front of hers 
           now:

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        How do you feel about lasagna?

           Tess seemingly inhales his words, then gathers her things and 
           gets up. 

                                 TESS
                        I feel really good about it.

           As they start to walk away we see clasped in her hand that 
           she has STOLEN a chrome washer from his toolbox.

                                                          BACK TO:

           INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - DAY

           Tess looks at the washer hardly able to contain her 
           excitement.

           INT. AIRPLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Tess comes back to the seats. Adam wakes up.
                                 TESS
                        Did you remember to pack our 
                        snorkeling masks?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes...or...I might have forgotten them.

                                 TESS
                        Adam! We got those on our first 
                        trip together. They’re special.

                                 ADAM
                        I know but we can rent masks. It 
                        doesn’t matter. 

                                 TESS
                        It does matter.

                                 ADAM
                        We’re allowed to use new objects 
                        sometimes, Tess. 

           Tess exhales, trying to stay calm.

                                 TESS
                        I just want everything to be
                        perfect.

           He takes her hand.

                                 ADAM
                        It already is. Hey...

           He comes closer to her and starts to sing into her ear.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                           (singing quietly)
                        Come a little bit closer...

           Tess cracks a smile.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                           (singing)
                        Hear what I have to say Just like 
                        children sleepin’ We could dream 
                        this night away....

           He kisses her ear.

                                 ADAM/TESS
                           (both singing quietly)
                        Because I’m still in love with 
                        you...I want to see you dance 
                        again...
           “Harvest Moon” by Neil Young comes in under them singing...

                                 ADAM/TESS (CONT'D)
                           (singing)
                        Because I’m still in love with 
                        you...on this Harvest Moon...

           The song continues as we PULL BACK from the plane and into 
           the sky until we DISSOLVE TO-

           EXT. CAYMAN ISLANDS- NEXT DAY

           Beautiful sunshine and sand. Tess and Adam walk along the 
           beach carrying flippers and snorkel masks. Adam proudly wears 
           his METS bathing suit. Tess looks at him, loving him for it.

           CLOSE ON Tess’s hand subtly checking to make sure the ring is 
           in tucked in her bathing suit strap.

           They reach a beautiful, secluded spot with bright blue water.

                                 ADAM
                        How about here?

                                 TESS
                        Perfect.

           Tess puts her flippers on without hesitation and wades into 
           the ocean, waving Adam to follow.

           EXT. OCEAN BAY- DAY

           Tess and Adam swim and snorkel. 

           Tess finds a shiny green bottle cap in the sand underwater 
           and puts it in her sack. She comes up for air, beaming. 

                                 ADAM
                        Find anything?

                                 TESS
                        Hmm yes. Yes I did.

           They’re treading water as Tess takes his hand.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Adam. Some people might think it’s 
                        a little odd that I keep all of the 
                        retainers I’ve ever owned in a 
                        drawer in our bathroom but you 
                        BUILT me the extra drawer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        You never make me feel crazy for 
                        what I do, instead you build 
                        beautiful homes for the things I 
                        care about-

                                 ADAM
                        Oh my god are you proposing?

                                 TESS
                        And I am certain you are the home 
                        that was built for me.... 

                                 ADAM
                        Of course you beat me to it! 

           Tess smiles and keeps going.

                                 TESS
                        My heart fits so perfectly into 
                        your hands- your cracked, scarred, 
                        beautiful hands. You’re beautiful, 
                        Adam. And I want to be a home for 
                        you in every way that I can, for as 
                        long as I can.

           A large wave interrupts them...

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        So Adam...

           CLOSE ON Tess’s hand reaching under the strap of her bathing 
           suit. The ring’s not there. Shit.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

                                 ADAM
                        What?

           She searches her entire bathing suit, then looks down into 
           the water.

                                 TESS
                        Hang on...

           She dives down into the water then quickly comes back up. 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        I had a ring. Well not a ring, a 
                        washer from your toolbox that I stole 
                        on the first day we met and I was 
                        going to say it was buried treasure, 
                        I had a whole thing...I think it fell 
                        out of my bathing suit!
                                 ADAM
                        You kept a washer from my toolbox 
                        all this time?

                                 TESS
                        I’ve been saving it for this 
                        moment. We need to find it!

           She dives down, frantically looking for the ring. 

           She pops up again and sees that Adam hasn’t moved. He has 
           tears in his eyes.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god, are you crying? I’ve 
                        never seen you cry. Ever.

                                 ADAM
                           (through tears)
                        Screw the washer. I want to marry 
                        you. I love that you kept that old 
                        thing. I love that you find and 
                        keep what no one else wants. You 
                        found me when I was damaged and 
                        lost… and you took me in and kept 
                        me. So Tess, will you-

                                 TESS
                        Waaait wait wait- we need the ring!

                                 ADAM
                        Why??

                                 TESS
                        It’s a symbol. For the entire 
                        marriage. We’ve got to find it.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s just an object-

                                 TESS
                        How could you say that? It’s our 
                        HISTORY! 

                                 ADAM
                           (looking around, knowing 
                           it’s gone)
                        I think it is history, yes.
                        We’ve looked everywhere.

                                 TESS
                        No we haven’t! You go back to the 
                        shore and look on the beach. I’ll 
                        keep looking here.
                                 ADAM
                        Tess. I love you. We don’t need it.

                                 TESS
                        I love you too but please. It means 
                        something to me.

           Heartbroken, Adam starts to swim to shore. She watches him 
           for a moment. He crawls back onto the beach looking through 
           the sand.

           Tess puts her mask back on and dives down...

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           She swims and swims until eventually she sees something shiny 
           in the sand.

           She hears her muffled name being screamed from the shore in 
           the distance...Tess! Tess! but she ignores it.

           She swims towards the object. It glints, the sun hitting it 
           through the water, until suddenly a DARKNESS comes over her.

           She pops her head out of the water and sees Adam waving 
           frantically at her from the beach and running into the waves 
           just as... SOMETHING HUGE CHOMPS DOWN ON HER.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. UNKNOWN SPACE - UNKNOWN TIME

           BRIGHT LIGHT. Darkness.

           Light...darkness. 

           Light...darkness. 

           We realize we are looking out from behind Tess’s eyelids 
           opening and closing.

           Tess’s eyes settle onto a bright screen. Then they slowly 
           start to move closer together.

           Tess looks at her own morphing reflection with amazement. She 
           leans in to stare at the newly improved reflection of 
           herself, mesmerized, until she KNOCKS into her own forehead.

                                 RICHARD
                        Oops.
           Tess looks up at RICHARD, 50s, think Steve Carell, stylishly 
           dressed and holding a clipboard.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry, happens a lot. Won’t 
                        leave a mark.

                                 TESS
                        What’s happening? Where am I?

                                 RICHARD
                        Heaven.

                                 TESS
                        Heaven?!

                                 RICHARD
                        Heaven! Hooray!

                                 TESS
                        Where’s Adam?

                                 RICHARD
                        Adam is still alive. He’s standing 
                        on the shore in shock.

                                 TESS
                        What happened?

                                 RICHARD
                        You got eaten by a crocodile.

                                 TESS
                        What?!

                                 RICHARD
                        I personally think it’s a fantastic 
                        way to go. So much drama!  

                                 TESS
                        I don’t understand...

                                 RICHARD
                        You were so busy looking for that 
                        ring, you didn’t feel a giant 
                        amphibian swimming up behind you.

           He laughs. He gets a real kick out of her death.

                                 TESS
                        Who are you? Are we in... LAX?
                                 RICHARD
                        We make receiving look a lot like an 
                        airport. We’ve found that most people 
                        are comfortably uncomfortable in an 
                        airport space and there’s also a 
                        sense of having GOTTEN somewhere- I 
                        apologize. I should’ve introduced 
                        myself immediately. I’m Richard. I’m 
                        your processor. 

                                 TESS
                        What does that mean?

                                 RICHARD
                        It means I’m here to help you 
                        through this entire process.

                                 TESS
                        It’s a process?

                                 RICHARD
                        Life is a process, death is a 
                        process...it’s why I have a job. 

                                 TESS
                        And you’re sure Adam’s not here?

                                 RICHARD
                        Tess. It’s good that he’s still 
                        alive. Don’t you want him to be?

           Before she can answer, he is back to the task at hand.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Do you need more time to decide on 
                        the details of your face? You get 
                        to choose your face when you die, 
                        it’s a big perk. 

           She looks at herself.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Feel free to take your time but be 
                        warned that time functions 
                        differently here. What may seem 
                        like one hour may actually be more 
                        like ten or twenty or twenty-four. 

           Tess looks around at other people looking at their 
           reflections and notices they all seem to be around her age.

                                 TESS
                        Is this the section for people who 
                        die young?
                                 RICHARD
                        Young? Oh no, no no no no. In heaven, 
                        no matter if you die as a small child 
                        or in your 90s, everyone is aged to 
                        33 and smokin’ hot.

           Tess watches a FIVE YEAR OLD BOY suddenly morph into a studly 
           33 year old. He looks around at everything totally confused. 
           He presses a button on the screen, accidentally making his 
           forehead enormous and bursts into tears.

           They see TONY, 40s, another well dressed man with a 
           clipboard, laughing at the boy.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                           (rolling his eyes)
                        Ignore him, that’s Tony. He’s a 
                        lower level processor and not the 
                        brightest bulb.

           Tony glares at Richard. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry, you’re very lucky. I’m 
                        the best there is. I run the whole 
                        department.

           Richard puts his hands on Tess’s shoulders and turns her back 
           towards the mirror.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Now. I know this is overwhelming, but 
                        just try to focus on yourself... pick 
                        annnything that makes you happy.

           Tess looks at herself in a daze of sadness. She feels her 
           stomach and lifts up her shirt, confused. She has perfect 
           abs. She turns to Richard...

                                 TESS
                        These are not my abs.

                                 RICHARD
                        Everyone’s body is their own 
                        version of a 10. It’s the face you 
                        can really have fun with.

           Tess looks at her face. 

                                 TESS
                        I’m fine.

                                 RICHARD
                        What now?
                                 TESS
                        I’m not gonna change my face!

                                 RICHARD
                        At all? You don’t want to change 
                        anything?

           Tess shakes her head. Richard looks at her with new 
           fascination. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Only about 1 in a 100 people keep 
                        their face exactly the way it was 
                        and we’re talkin’ Marilyn Monroe, 
                        Paul Newman- 

                                 TESS
                        If I change my face how would 
                        anyone recognize me? How would I 
                        recognize me? How would Adam even 
                        know who I am when he gets here?? 
                        I just lost the person I love and 
                        you think giving me a new nose is 
                        gonna make me feel better??

                                 RICHARD
                        Okay, let’s just take a breath. 
                        Most people lose someone, Tess. 
                        But... sometimes people with 
                        traumatic deaths have a harder time 
                        adjusting and that’s OKAY.

           Before she can speak, he leads her towards the door.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        You’re about to get a lot of 
                        information okay? But I’m gonna be 
                        right here. 

                                 TESS
                        You really don’t seem like an 
                        angel.

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s because I’m not. I’m your 
                        worst nightmare... kidding! Lighten 
                        up! You’re dead.

           As he pats her back a little too hard we CUT TO--

           INT. SMALL THEATER- HEAVEN INTRO SESSION - DAY

           Tess sits in a group of hot, dead, 33 year olds all wearing 
           name tags. 
           SUSAN, 50s, a comforting mom-like figure stands in front of 
           the group.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hello everyone. Welcome to heaven. 
                        I’m sure you all have a lot of 
                        questions so just sit back, relax 
                        and watch this introduction to 
                        where you are. And please, enjoy 
                        the coffee. We’ve found it makes 
                        people who were recently alive much 
                        more comfortable.

           A coffee cart stops at her row and another KIND, MOTHERLY 
           WOMAN hands Tess a to-go cup of coffee.

                                 TESS
                           (whispering)
                        Do you have any cream?

                                 COFFEE WOMAN
                        You don’t need it, dear.

           Tess reluctantly takes a sip. Fuck. This is the best fucking 
           coffee she’s ever tried.

                                 TESS
                        Holy shit.

                                 COFFEE WOMAN
                        Yes, dear.

           The coffee woman keeps going as the LIGHTS GO DOWN.

           The video starts. In it people look calm, happy and drop dead 
           gorgeous. Over various beautiful images, a voiceover comes 
           in:

                                 HEAVEN VOICE OVER
                        Look around... it’s beautiful. 
                        YOU’RE beautiful. But despite the 
                        popular held belief that heaven is 
                        the last stop-it’s actually more of 
                        an in between space, an in between 
                        time- to prepare you to move ahead 
                        to... 

           A beautiful sunrise comes onto the screen.

                                 HEAVEN VOICE OVER (CONT'D)
                        ...becoming light. 

           The light grows and grows until it seems like it is bouncing 
           off the screen and filling the entire room.
                                 HEAVEN VOICE OVER (CONT'D)
                        When you become light you are no 
                        longer someone, somewhere. You’re 
                        everywhere.

           Sunlight, starlight, EUPHORIC MUSIC...

                                 HEAVEN VOICE OVER (CONT'D)
                        Reaching this state... is the 
                        ULTIMATE GOAL.

           The video returns to normal heaven images.

                        Now, take a look at your name tags.
                        Underneath your name is a number.

           Tess looks down and reads: “50” under her name.

                                 HEAVEN VOICE OVER (CONT'D)
                        This is the number of years you can 
                        spend in heaven before you must have 
                        your light ceremony. The amount of 
                        years directly corresponds to the 
                        amount of joy you experienced when 
                        you were alive. For instance, when a 
                        baby dies, they are automatically 
                        given 100 years in heaven because 
                        they never got to experience 
                        anything. Or, if someone dies at 90, 
                        they might only get 1 year, because 
                        they lived a full and joyful life. 
                        We’ll explain more about this on the 
                        tour.

           Tess looks at the various numbers under people’s name tags as 
           we CUT TO-

           EXT. HEAVEN - DAY

           A lush, green field. Tess stands in the middle of the huge 
           expanse with the rest of her tour group. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Before we set out, you are each 
                        being given a pair of running 
                        shoes.

           Shoes are handed to each of them.

                        shoes you will ever experience.

           Tess puts hers on and takes a couple of steps...these are the 
           best fucking sneakers she’s ever walked in.

           This place looks a lot like earth, but earth 2.0. Everything  
           has a slightly incandescent quality. 

                                 SUSAN 
                        We’re going to see lots of bright 
                        color and lots of beaches- two 
                        things that the majority of 
                        humanity enjoys. Other fun facts: 
                        the moon is a different shade every 
                        night. The ocean waves make music. 
                        The sun is always shining but the 
                        air smells like snow... go ahead, 
                        take a deep breath in...

           People breathe in and break out in giggles...

           INT. TESS AND ADAM'S APARTMENT- DAY- WHEN TESS WAS ALIVE

           Tess and Adam lie in bed facing each other. Tess opens her 
           mouth and breathes in as Adam blows into it gently.

                                 TESS
                        If you blindfolded me and lined up 
                        50 men, I’d know it’s you from your 
                        breath alone.

           Adam hides his mouth with the sheet.

                                 ADAM 
                           (muffled)
                        Thank you?

           She pulls the sheet down and smushes her face into his.

                                 TESS
                        I would bottle it if I could.
                                 ADAM
                        You would bottle everything if you 
                        could...

           She pulls back and looks at his face.

                                 TESS
                        Do you have your final order?

                                 ADAM
                        I do. 

           Adam pushes her hair behind her ears.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        I’d still have to start with your 
                        earlobes...tiny lightbulbs. They 
                        ruin me.

           He kisses them.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Earlobes...

           He takes her wrist.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Wrists...

           He kisses it.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Laugh.

           He kisses the smile that forms on her lips.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        That’s my final order.

           We PULL OUT to see that this was Adam’s memory, not Tess’s. 
           He stands at Tess’s grave, devastated.

           INT. TESS & ADAM’S APARTMENT - EARTH 

           Still in his suit from the funeral, Adam pulls out a lasagna 
           from the freezer. He can’t bear to eat it. As he puts it back 
           a sticky note falls off it. He unfolds it and reads: 
           “Dear Adam, you always overtip the taxi driver. Makes me want 
           to tip you over...onto the bed. Get it?”

           He looks like someone shot him in the gut.

           INT. TESS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - EARTH

           Adam walks into Tess’s office and looks at all the objects. 
           He sees that Tess hadn’t loaded the umbrellas into the stand 
           he built for her yet. CLOSE ON the empty container- which is 
           exactly how he feels. Adam’s knees give and he sinks down 
           into the pile of broken umbrellas. 

                                                          BACK TO:

           EXT. HEAVEN - DAY

           Tess is lagging behind the group, incredibly sad. She catches 
           up and notices that everyone else seems happy to be here, 
           happy to be dead. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Each neighborhood corresponds to 
                        the number of years. The 100s are 
                        housed in beachfront properties 
                        where they can choose the weather 
                        over their individual homes.

           The group passes through different patches of weather 
           attached to each stunning house- from warm and sunny to a 
           rainstorm with rainbows covering only that small patch of 
           sky.

           They turn onto the MAIN STREET with welcoming storefront 
           classrooms labeled with signs like “HOW TO FORGET”...     
           They peek into “BODIES & RELEASE” with people doing what 
           looks like a form of Tai Chi. 

           When they reach the end of the street Susan stops and takes 
           on a serious tone.

                        At first, some humans try to hold onto 
                        the details of their life... but that 
                        has consequences. The only pain that 
                        exists in heaven is emotional pain. So 
                        the more you remember, the more pain 
                        you’ll be in. Think of your memories 
                        like strings, tethering you to the 
                        ground. If you don’t cut them all by 
                        the time your number is up, you will 
                        NOT turn into light.

                        Instead, you will turn into ORGANIC 
                        MATTER. Which is essentially 
                        fertilizer... a door handle, a table 
                        leg. It’s the universe’s recycling 
                        bin. But! We’ve developed a system of 
                        steps to make forgetting the details 
                        of your life smooth and easy which 
                        every human must go through before 
                        they can turn into light. 

           Tess raises her hand.

                                 TESS
                        Excuse me? What are the steps?

                                 SUSAN
                        The steps will be explained in 
                        detail to you by your processors. 

           A group of non 33 year old normal looking people wave from 
           off to the side, one of them being Richard.

                        Daily living in heaven is also 
                        designed to support a pleasure filled, 
                        easy experience. There is a schedule. 
                        Sticking to that will help you on your 
                        way. A bell will ding...

           A bell DINGS.

                        ...when it’s time to move on to 
                        your next activity. All 
                        accommodations are spare, without 
                        objects that could trigger memories 
                        from life. Again, the more you 
                        forget, the happier you’ll be.  

           Tess’s eyes widen.

                        Some newcomers opt to have their 
                        memories erased immediately for a 
                        fuller, happier experience of heaven. 
                        Not only does it speed up your entire 
                        process, propelling you far ahead of 
                        those who chose not to, but right after 
                        it’s done you can go straight to your 
                        first fun filled activity! It’s quick, 
                        painless and highly recommended. If 
                        you’re interested in doing that now- 
                        please step forward.
           About 70% of the group steps forward. 

           At this point Tess looks over at HOLLY, 33, smokin’ hot, who 
           is the only other person in the group that looks horrified. 
           They make eye contact and drift to the back of the group.

                        The rest of you can go to lunch.

           Tess and Holly look at each other as we CUT TO--

           INT. HEAVEN RESTAURANT - DAY

           Tess and Holly sit at a perfect booth. A huge plate of 
           doughnuts immediately arrives in front of Holly while a 
           mountain of lasagna lands in front of Tess.

                                 TESS
                           (to the server)
                        I didn’t order this.

                                 SERVER
                        On 37 occasions in your life when 
                        someone asked you what your 
                        favorite food was, or, “if you 
                        could only choose one food to eat 
                        for the rest of your life” you 
                        chose lasagna. So lasagna is your 
                        designated heaven food. 
                            (To Holly) 
                        Yours is doughnuts. Enjoy.

           The server walks away. They both take bites...

                                 HOLLY
                           (loudly)
                        Mmm incredible!

                           (performative)
                        Best lasagna I’ve ever had!

           Tess leans in conspiratorially...

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                           (hushed)
                        Erasing your memory is crazy, 
                        right? 

                                 HOLLY
                        Yes! What’s so bad about 
                        remembering life? I had a good one.

           An obscenely perfect woman walks by. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Have you noticed that a lot of the 
                        women here look like zombies on a 
                        steady diet of Vicodin and botox? 
                        These are the exact people I tried 
                        to avoid when I was alive.

                                 TESS
                        I know, me too!

                                 HOLLY
                        Wait, I don’t look like that do I? 
                        I gave myself cheekbones and 
                        eyelashes but that’s it. 

           She pokes at her face.

                                 TESS
                        You look good. You look real.

           Holly looks at Tess’s number on her name tag.

                                 HOLLY
                        How did you die?

                                 TESS
                        I was on vacation with my boyfriend 
                        Adam and... a crocodile ate my face 
                        just as I was proposing.

                                 HOLLY
                        Yeah that’s bad. 

                                 TESS
                        I’m just not ready to let him go 
                        yet.

                                 HOLLY
                        I hear you. You deserve all 50 of 
                        those years. Violent tearing apart 
                        of two lovers...literally....

           Tess looks at Holly’s number which is 35.

                                 TESS
                        How did you die?
                                 HOLLY
                        I was in a park with my two girls, 
                        Jenny and Jasmine. I ran into the 
                        street to 
                        get some other kid’s ball and 
                        WHACK! 
                        some guy on a motorcycle hit me.

                                 TESS
                        Oof. I’m sorry.

                                 HOLLY
                        Didn’t feel a thing....but...I 
                        worry. I was a single mother so it 
                        was just me raising those girls and 
                        they are awesome humans. I don’t 
                        WANT to forget them.  

                                 TESS
                        I don’t want to forget anything. 

           Just then, PERRY, a 90 year old in a 33 year old bod, sits 
           down next to them.

           He throws his head back and laughs, thoroughly enjoying his 
           own joke. A plate with a HUGE stack of pancakes immediately 
           appears in front of him.

                        fence me in!

           He laughs again and digs into his heaven food.

                        Perry, I’m Holly and this is Tess 
                        and we were in the middle of a 
                        conversation.

                                 PERRY
                        Great! What are we talking about?

           Holly and Tess exchange a look.

                                 PERRY (CONT'D)
                        Looks serious. 
                                 TESS
                        How do you feel about the whole 
                        forgetting your life aspect of this 
                        place?

                                 PERRY
                        Questioning authority already. I 
                        love it.

                                 TESS
                        Don’t you think there’s something 
                        strange about it?

                                 PERRY
                        Not really. Life was hard. I went 
                        through enough...fought in a war, 4 
                        marriages, 4 divorces, cataracts, 
                        emphysema...lotta pain. But right 
                        now I don’t feel ANY pain! It’s 
                        incredible! And I’m going to enjoy 
                        every moment of this place. I died 
                        at 90 so I’ve only got 5 years and 
                        if you haven’t noticed, we happen 
                        to have landed in paradise. So 
                        cheer up dum dums. Party at my 
                        place tonight!

           DING. He gets up with his pancakes and saunters away.

           Holly takes a schedule out of her pocket.

                                 HOLLY
                        I have to go to my processor’s 
                        office for my first session. Then I 
                        have racquetball- oo I love 
                        racquetball!

           Tess looks at her own schedule.

                                 TESS
                        I have my first session and then... 
                        art class? This is like camp... 
                        that’s probably how they get you- 
                        they distract you. 

           DING. Holly stands.

                                 HOLLY
                        They won’t distract us. Find me 
                        after. Until then I’ll focus on my 
                        kids and you focus on remembering 
                        something about your boyfriend, 
                        anything...
                                 TESS
                        Right...he loved baseball. He loved 
                        the--what’s the team with the...ya 
                        know the blue?

           She looks at Holly panicked.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        It’s already happening!

                                 HOLLY
                        It’s okay. Minor detail...
                        Don’t worry. We’re not botox 
                        zombies. We’re gonna figure this 
                        place out, okay?

                                 TESS
                           (scared)
                        Okay.

           Holly walks away, double fisting doughnuts. Tess looks down 
           at her lasagna, which just makes her more depressed. 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                           (to herself)
                        The Mules...no, the Mugs?

           How could she forget that already? She starts to put her 
           lasagna in a white to-go container but has a better idea 
           instead...she folds up the container and puts it in her 
           pocket.

           EXT. RICHARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tess is about to walk into Richard’s office when she notices 
           a display table of hoodies that say: “Fuggedaboudit!” with a 
           picture of Richard in sunglasses, gold chains and a leather 
           jacket. There’s a sign next to them saying they are the most 
           popular clothing item in heaven, next to running shoes.

           INT. RICHARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tess sits across from Richard at his desk, defensive. It has 
           a long filing cabinet next to it that seems to go on forever.

                                 RICHARD
                        You made a friend!

                                 TESS
                        Were you watching me?
                                 RICHARD
                        Don’t think of it like that. 

                                 TESS
                        I’m not a child.

                                 RICHARD
                        But why not BE childlike! Let go! 
                        Fuggedaboudit!

           Tess looks down, trying not to be upset.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                           (reading her)
                        It’s natural to miss your 
                        significant other at first.

                                 TESS
                        At first?

                                 RICHARD
                        Trying to hold onto him is not 
                        smart. And you’re smart, Tess. But 
                        you did get 50 years here. Now why 
                        do you think that is?

                                 TESS
                        I-

                                 RICHARD
                        Because you spent most of your life 
                        valuing what was already gone, 
                        which robbed you of joy.

           He opens his filing cabinet and pulls it out for what seems 
           like a mile until he gets to Tess’s file. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Let’s see. You were scheduled to 
                        die at... 92! But instead you’re 
                        here now because you were more 
                        consumed by making a memory of a 
                        moment than actually being inside 
                        of it. 

                                 TESS
                        Hold on...

                                 RICHARD
                        Adam was so caught up in his love 
                        for you he said, forget the ring, I 
                        want to marry you!  
                                 TESS
                        And I wanted to marry him!

                                 RICHARD
                        So what was stopping you?

                                 TESS
                        The ring!

                                 RICHARD
                        Adam showed up for you 
                        consistently, didn’t he. Again and 
                        again. He wasn’t like most of the 
                        people in your life.

                                 TESS
                        That’s right.

                                 RICHARD
                        And in the one moment, arguably the 
                        most important moment, when he 
                        needed you to meet him half 
                        way...you didn’t show up for him. 

           This hits Tess hard.

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god. It’s my fault. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Meh you’ll forget that very soon, 
                        that’s the beauty of being here! 
                        The point is that this is your 
                        chance to BE IN THE MOMENT!

                                 TESS
                        I don’t want to forget that it’s my 
                        fault. Maybe I don’t deserve to be 
                        here at all.

           He looks up at her.

                                 RICHARD
                        I can’t remember the last time 
                        someone questioned if they belonged 
                        here...

                                 TESS
                        Really?

                                 RICHARD
                        Most people are just relieved. They 
                        don’t question it. 
                                 TESS
                        I question everything.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes, I’m learning that. It’s good 
                        for the ol’ noodle to have a bit of 
                        a challenge on my hands.

           Tess’s attention goes to her file.

                                 TESS
                           (reaching out)
                        Can I see that?

           He closes the file and puts it away.

                                 RICHARD
                        No.

                                 TESS
                        Why not? It’s my life.

                                 RICHARD
                        It WAS your life. It’s not good for 
                        you to look at.

                                 TESS
                        What if I don’t care what’s good 
                        for me?

                                 RICHARD
                        There you go again with the 
                        questions! How enjoyable!

           But Tess’s attention lingers on the filing cabinet.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        So. We’ll begin the steps tomorrow. 
                        With each step, we go through 
                        events in your life, working 
                        through them, and then letting them 
                        go. Then they will leave your 
                        memory.

                                 TESS
                        Forever?

                                 RICHARD
                        Adorable. Yes. 

           Richard refers to a chart behind him of stick figures going 
           through various stages of sad face to happy face...
                                 RICHARD.
                        After every step, you’ll feel a 
                        great sense of relief. The more 
                        steps we do, the lighter you’ll 
                        feel. So that by the time we reach 
                        your last step- the most important 
                        step- you’ll be fully ready to 
                        process that and turn into light.

           Richard looks at her. But her attention is still on the 
           filing cabinet.

                                 RICHARD
                        Did you hear me?

                                 TESS
                        Sounds great...uh do you think I 
                        could get one of those hoodies you 
                        had on display outside?

           Richard lights up.

                                 RICHARD
                        Of course! Let me grab one for you. 
                        It will be the most comfortable 
                        thing you’ve ever worn...except for 
                        the shoes.

           The moment Richard starts to exit, Tess quickly goes to the 
           filing cabinet and pulls it open. 

           She scans through it, pulls out a file and stuffs it down the 
           back of her pants. 

           She gets back to her seat JUST as Richard comes back in 
           holding up the “FUGGEDABOUDIT!” hoodie next to his face: 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                           (chuckling)
                        Gets me every time.

           Tess starts to fake laugh too.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        I designed these. As head of the 
                        department I got to choose what 
                        goes on them.

                                 TESS
                        Oh... nice.

           He hands it to her.
                                 RICHARD
                        Go ahead and put it on.

           She does, careful not to move and show the stolen file in the 
           back of her pants.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        It’s like wearing self-esteem 
                        right?

                                 TESS
                        Very comfortable. And stylish.

                                 RICHARD
                        Thank you. It’ll help you remember 
                        to... 

                                 RICHARD/TESS

                        ...fuggedaboudit!

           DING.

           EXT. PROCESSING OFFICES - DAY

           Tess comes out of Richard’s office, turns the corner and 
           tries to catch her breath after what she’s just done. 

           She sees Holly walk out of her processor’s office across the 
           way.

                                 TESS
                           (whisper scream)
                        Holly!

           Holly runs over to her. 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        I did something. Something bad. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Go on...

           Tess pulls Holly behind a tree as people walk by them. She 
           pulls the file out of her pants. Holly gasps.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Is that your file??

                                 TESS
                        No. It’s Adam’s.
                                 HOLLY
                        What? Why would Adam have a file? 
                        Wouldn’t that mean he’s dead?

                                 TESS
                        No! I think they have files on 
                        everyone who’s ever existed. And 
                        it’ll tell me what happens to him 
                        after I died.

           Tess starts to open the file but Holly stops her:

                                 HOLLY
                        Wait. Are you sure you want to 
                        know?  What if he marries an 
                        asshole? Or joins a cult?

           Tess opens it. As she reads, her face drops.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

           She takes out a graph with Adam’s lifeline on it. It plummets 
           after her death and it doesn’t seem to go back up. Page after 
           page, it keeps going down...

                                 TESS
                        I ruined his life.

                                 HOLLY
                        The line’s gotta go back up at some 
                        point...

           Tess keeps flipping through the pages until she gets to the 
           last one where the lifeline stops and it says...  ADAM DIED.

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god...

           Tess looks at Holly, eyes wide.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        He’s dead.

                                 HOLLY
                        ...yeah, I don’t want to say I told 
                        you so but....

           Tess reads...
                                 TESS
                        He was in a car accident. He was 
                        driving and felt something hitting 
                        the back of his foot so he reached 
                        under the carseat, found a broken 
                        umbrella....I can’t finish this.

           Holly gently takes the file for Tess and reads...

                                 HOLLY
                        He was so overcome by the thought 
                        of you that he swerved off the road 
                        and into a tree...I’m so sorry, 
                        Tess.

                                 TESS
                        It’s...this is 
                        actually...incredible! I mean- it’s 
                        terrible, I basically killed him- 
                        but this means he’s HERE. This 
                        means I can find him!

           DING! People are now running to get to their next activities. 
           They start to take notice of Tess and Holly. Tess stuffs the 
           file back in her pants.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Shit. I have to go to that art 
                        class.

                                 HOLLY
                        But Tess, think about it...he could 
                        BE at that art class!

           Tess suddenly looks hopeful for the first time in heaven.

           INT. ART CLASS - DAY

           As Tess walks in she checks the file shoved in her pants, 
           grateful to be wearing the hoodie to help cover it. There are 
           at least fifty men in the room. How will she know it’s him?

           As she moves through them, all sorts of beautiful men smile 
           at her and say hello. She stops at one and not so subtly 
           waves her wrists in front of him...

                                 TESS
                        Do you... like my wrists?

           He looks at her like she’s crazy.

                                 GUY #1
                        Are you... a cutter?
           She keeps moving, making sure to push her hair behind her 
           ears so that her earlobes are on full display. With her 
           wrists out and head swaying she’s more dancing than walking. 
           She looks a little nuts. And no one seems to recognize her...

           An ART TEACHER with a whispery voice speaks to the group:

                                 ART TEACHER
                        Welcome everyone.

           Tess sits down at an easel and picks up a paintbrush. 

                                 ART TEACHER (CONT'D)
                        Think of this as your quiet place 
                        to just...(she exhales). You’ll 
                        notice that the paint you use here 
                        looks clear in the pots but comes 
                        out in the perfect color on the 
                        canvas. It will show up exactly as 
                        you want it to... 

           Tess dips her paintbrush in the pot, delighting in the 
           familiarity of it. 

           She starts to paint Adam’s face...the teacher was right, the 
           coloring is absolutely perfect. Tess paints swiftly, 
           precisely, down to the crinkle in his forehead. 

           The teacher is suddenly at her side:

                                 TESS
                           (proudly)
                        I’m an artist so I might be a little 
                        ahead of the rest of the class.

                                 ART TEACHER
                           (in a whisper)
                        It’s very literal.

                                 TESS
                        It’s a portrait.

                                 ART TEACHER
                        Yes I can see that. Take a look 
                        around the walls...

           Tess does. The art displayed on the walls is all splashes of 
           color and indistinct shapes

                                 ART TEACHER (CONT'D)
                        Detail is discouraged. Allow 
                        yourself to think more abstractly.
                                 TESS
                        Okay but-

                                 ART TEACHER
                        Shhhhhhh.

           Tess tries to concentrate again. She closes her eyes and 
           begins to hear...

           The sound of WAVES.

           But Tess is pulled out of the memory as someone KNOCKS into 
           her. She stumbles and paints a line through Adam’s face.

                                 TESS
                        What the-?

           She turns around and it’s... CHRIS EVANS (or some other 
           handsome, awesome actor).

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Oops.

           All the women in the room perk up. But Tess is pissed.

                                 TESS
                        Oops? You just ruined my painting.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Eh, he had a weak chin...

           He smiles at her but Tess is not amused. She tries to fix it.

           Chris Evans takes a seat behind her, making all sorts of 
           noise.  Tess tries to ignore him. But then- 

                                 ART TEACHER
                           (to Chris Evans)
                        That is EXCELLENT. Really special 
                        work!

           Tess turns around and sees his very basic drawing of a long 
           oval attached to a square. She rolls her eyes.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I was thinking of giving it a 
                        little more detail.

                                 ART TEACHER
                        Oh no I think you’re done here. We’ll 
                        put it right up on the wall of fame.

           Chris Evans looks over at Tess’s painting, sees how 
           meticulous she’s being... 
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You’re overthinking it.

                                 TESS
                        Excuse me?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Mine was hung on the wall of fame 
                        and it was not good at all so. 

           Tess’s gaze is pulled to Chris Evan’s hands. Chris Evans 
           catches it...

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        You like what you see?

                                 TESS
                        Excuse me?

           He shows off his hands.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Those hands are a dime a dozen 
                        here.

           She keeps painting. Chris Evans appears at her side, trying 
           to speak in a sexy voice.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You wanna make our own art?

                                 TESS
                        What?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        We could get outta here and... (he 
                        makes humping motions)

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god what is your problem?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I don’t have a problem. In fact, I 
                        have no problems whatsoever! I just 
                        fuggedaboudit!

                                 TESS
                        You must have Richard too.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Great guy.

                                 TESS
                        Uh huh. Please leave me alone.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I just arrived here this afternoon 
                        so I’m a little new at this but... 
                        everyone else here seems really 
                        happy. You don’t. 

           Tess tries to ignores this.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        I had them wipe everything on the 
                        tour. You didn’t do that, did you.

                                 TESS
                        No.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Mistake. 

                                 TESS
                        Mistake? I still have my wits about 
                        me unlike you, you half-human, half-
                        gorilla. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Gorillas are very intelligent. Our 
                        wits and their wits are-

                                 TESS
                        Look, I just want to finish this...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        And I just want to have fun! Just 
                        sail right through the steps into 
                        the light. Sail sail sail...
                        More lone wolf than gorilla. On a 
                        sail boat... 

           He suddenly HOWLS. Everyone smiles warmly and chuckles. Even 
           the Art Teacher is charmed by his loud disruption.

                                 TESS
                        If you keep howling like an idiot I  
                        doubt you’ll have any problems 
                        being alone.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                           (leaning in)
                        Oh yeah? I’ve had sex two times with 
                        two different people since I’ve been 
                        here and it’s been like an hour.

                                 TESS
                        Bleh.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Bleh? Did you die at 10 years old 
                        or something? We’re supposed to 
                        enjoy ourselves here.

                                 TESS
                        No one’s stopping you, beauty 
                        queen. Whore it up!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You know what? You’re mean. You’re 
                        the first mean person I’ve met 
                        here.

                                 TESS
                        Well lucky for you there are plenty 
                        of other seats in this class.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I like this seat.

                                 TESS
                        Then shhhhhh. I beg you.

           He starts to paint the same thing again, a long oval attached 
           to a square. He turns- 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Are you really not going to sleep 
                        with anyone while you’re here?

           She points at her painting, exasperated:

                                 TESS
                        I’m taken, okay? I have someone. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Explain that to me because no one 
                        here ‘has someone’.

                                 TESS
                        I died and my boyfriend died too. I 
                        know he’s here somewhere, I just 
                        haven’t found him yet.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Why would you do that to yourself?

                                 TESS
                        What do you mean?
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        We’re not supposed to look for 
                        anyone from life. You’re just gonna 
                        cause yourself pain.

                                 TESS
                        You don’t know what you’re talking about.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I do actually. Which is why I’m 
                        gonna get to the light as soon as 
                        possible. I’m not gonna let 
                        anything stop me and if you had 
                        your wits about you, you’d do the 
                        same-

           Just then the file falls out from her pants. Chris Evans sees 
           it. Tess jumps up and quickly stuffs it back in.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                           (whispering)
                        Whatcha got there?

                                 TESS
                        Nothing.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Doesn’t look like nothing.

           Tess holds the back of her pants.

                                 TESS
                        I... have a medical condition that 
                        I...needed...information on.

           Chris Evans raises his eyebrows, amused.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Medical condition in heaven. Huh. 

                                 TESS
                           (panicking)
                        Um...(She announces to the class) 
                        I’m gonna, I have to go early. I 
                        just...I really, really have to go 
                        to the bathroom! 

           Backing out... Tess HOWLS, trying to elicit the same kind of 
           reaction that Chris Evans got-

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Awooooooo! 

           -but nobody reacts. She keeps backing out...
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Okay then, see you all soon! Great 
                        class! Woo!

           She backs right into OTIS, 33 smokin hot, kind eyes.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Oh! I’m sorry.

                                 OTIS
                        No, I’m sorry. 

           He looks at her.

                                 OTIS (CONT'D)
                        Do I... know you?

           She is taken aback. This guy is dreamy...could it be? Tess 
           leans in closer to him.

                                 TESS
                        ...I- I don’t know...does the name 
                        Tess sound familiar?

                                 OTIS
                        Tess... 

           But the art teacher appears at her side, annoyed.

                                 ART TEACHER
                        Class, let’s move on from this 
                        disruption!

           The whole class is staring at Tess, including Chris Evans.

                                 TESS
                           (to Otis, quickly)
                        Are you... going to Perry’s party 
                        later?

                                 OTIS
                        Yeah.

                                 TESS
                        Great! I’ll see you there...

           Chris Evans watches, amused, as Tess tries to leave 
           seductively while still holding the back of her pants. Then 
           he and looks up at her painting of Adam’s face...he begins to 
           hear the sound of waves. He flinches as a deep pain suddenly 
           moves through him. A tear falls down his face. What was that. 

                                                           CUT TO:
           INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - EVENING

           Tess runs into the racquetball court and sees Holly in full 
           gear: sweatband, crop top, short shorts. 

           Holly points at the MUSCULAR DUDE she’s playing against.

                                 HOLLY
                        You. Out.

                                 MUSCULAR DUDE
                        But we’re not done-

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m up by eighty. We’re done.

           He walks out, scowling. Holly turns to Tess and hands her a 
           racquet.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        C’mon, they don’t let you stay in 
                        here unless you’re playing.

           Tess takes the file out of her pants, carefully sets it on 
           the ground and they start to play.

                                 TESS
                        I think I might have found him.

                                 HOLLY
                        You did?? In art class?

                                 TESS
                        I mean, maybe. I’m not sure yet...

                                 HOLLY
                        Well I hope so because you need to 
                        find him before you forget him. My 
                        processor said it can happen really 
                        fast.

                                 TESS
                        Yeah but I have the ultimate cheat 
                        sheet- his file! It has every 
                        detail about Adam ever. So even if 
                        I forget things, I can just look at 
                        it and I’ll remember. 

           Holly scores. She leaps into the air and does a split.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        ...although a really annoying guy 
                        in my art class saw that I had the 
                        file-
                                 HOLLY
                        How?

                                 TESS
                        It fell out of my pants. So I said 
                        I was having a bathroom emergency 
                        and ran out...

                                 HOLLY
                        Pretend diarrhea. Works every time.

                                 TESS
                        But he doesn’t seem very bright so 
                        I’m not too worried... the 
                        important thing is we have to go to 
                        Perry’s party because this guy is 
                        going to be there.

           Holly scores another point.

                                 HOLLY
                        Suck on that!

                                 TESS
                        Are you okay? 

                                 HOLLY
                        Sorry, I get really competitive when 
                        I play. I figured something out 
                        though... Muscle memory. I LOVED 
                        racquetball when I was alive. I 
                        taught my girls to play. I figure if 
                        I play I’ll remember I loved it and 
                        therefore I’ll remember my girls. AND 
                        I can make use of this bangin’ body. 
                        Never wore a crop top when I was 
                        alive. Wanna wear one every day I’m 
                        here.

                                 TESS
                        That’s brilliant.

                                 HOLLY
                        I know. Come on, let’s finish this 
                        game and then...

           Holly looks at Tess in her shlubby hoodie.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        ...then you need to go home and 
                        change into something cute because 
                        we’re gonna find your man tonight.
                                 TESS
                        Yes!

                                 HOLLY
                        Serve, bitch.

                                 TESS
                        Whoa.

                                 HOLLY
                        I know, I’m sorry...

           INT. TESS’S COTTAGE - EVENING

           Tess enters and looks around her sweet little cottage. It’s 
           lovely but it’s basically empty. She walks over to the simple 
           desk, takes the file out of her pants and quickly hides it in 
           her bottom desk drawer and smiles.

           She goes to the closet. First she pulls out a sexy black 
           dress...is it a dress or a bathing suit? No. Then some 
           overalls...no. Finally she chooses a white cotton dress. 

           She throws the clothes she was wearing onto the bed and 
           changes into the dress- as she zips it up, she instantly 
           looks gorgeous. It’s just right for her. 

           She sees the to-go container she took earlier peeking out of 
           the pants pocket on the bed.  She takes it over to the desk, 
           sits down and rips off a piece of it.

           She picks up a pen and takes a breath.

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        Dear Adam, I never told you my 
                        final order. Your hands. Your 
                        breath. Your hobbit feet- I’m lying 
                        about the last one. I was trying to 
                        be funny but really it’s your eyes. 
                        Of course it’s your eyes what am I, 
                        a monster?

           FLASH TO--

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT - WHEN TESS WAS ALIVE

           A younger Tess and Adam are in the middle of a huge fight.

                                 ADAM
                        Forget it! Sometimes you can be a 
                        real monster, you know that?
                                 TESS
                        Adam-

                                 ADAM
                        You hesitated. You clearly don’t 
                        want me to move in.

                                 TESS
                        That’s not true! I was just surprised.

                                 ADAM
                        Why?

                                 TESS
                        I just thought you liked having 
                        your own space-

                                 ADAM
                        No that’s YOU. You don’t want to 
                        have to move any of your precious 
                        objects to share the space with me.

                                 TESS
                        I was surprised because you don’t 
                        always make your feelings known! 
                        I’ve never even seen you CRY!

                                 ADAM
                        Well you’re sensitive enough for 
                        the both of us so...

                                 TESS
                        Wow.

                                 ADAM
                        Just because I don’t keep every gum 
                        wrapper I’ve ever had doesn’t mean 
                        I have no feelings!

           He gathers his stuff and heads for the door.

                                 TESS
                        Adam...

           He opens it.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        You can’t leave!

                                 ADAM
                        Why not? You have all your junk to 
                        keep you company!
           He slams the door behind him, which turns into A KNOCK at 
           Tess’s door- jolting her out of the memory.

           Tess looks down at the note, kisses it and quickly tucks it 
           under her mattress. 

           She opens her door; it’s Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        So which would you rather?
                        A place mat? A door bell? A push 
                        pin, maybe? Because the way you’re 
                        acting, you’re headed straight for 
                        Organic Matter missy!

           Richard pushes past her into the cottage. But Tess is still 
           very distracted by her memory:

                                 TESS
                        Do you think I’m a monster?

                                 RICHARD
                        Very possibly, yes. I-

                                 TESS
                        I think I may have been very 
                        difficult to be in a relationship 
                        with. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Tess, I’m trying to make a dramatic 
                        entrance- 

                                 TESS
                        Here I was thinking I knew what 
                        love was and that I was soooo good 
                        at it but maybe I sucked at it. 

                                 RICHARD
                        See THIS is why memories are 
                        dangerous! They make people do 
                        crazy things!

           He goes straight to her desk and removes Adam’s file.

                                 TESS
                        ...I can explain. 

                                 RICHARD
                           (holding up the file 
                           dramatically)
                        Did you really think I wouldn’t 
                        catch this?
                                 TESS
                        Please, I just want to find him... 
                        I don’t understand why that’s a 
                        problem.

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s not the way we do things.

                                 TESS
                        And has NO ONE ever questioned that?

                                 RICHARD
                        What people normally do is trust 
                        our system. Our well oiled, tried 
                        and true system. Why would they 
                        question it?

                                 TESS
                        Because they miss their loved ones 
                        and want to remember them!

                                 RICHARD
                        How do you feel right now?

                                 TESS
                        Bad!

                                 RICHARD
                        Correct! Your memory is not your 
                        friend. It will make you unhappy. 

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god what is so wrong with 
                        feeling unhappy? 

           Richard is intrigued by this.

                                 RICHARD
                        Why would anyone want that?

                                 TESS
                        There’s a whole rainbow of emotions 
                        we get to feel, not just happiness! 
                        Do you remember what it felt like 
                        to have a good cry?

                                 RICHARD
                        ...no.

                                 TESS
                        It can be pretty fucking great.

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s...no one wants to cry.
                                 TESS
                        How do you know? Maybe they do! 
                        Maybe everyone in heaven would be 
                        ten times HAPPIER if you let them 
                        feel a little sadness once in 
                        awhile! 

                                 RICHARD
                        What you’re describing is LIFE. The 
                        complexity of being alive.

           She sits down on the bed, deflated.

                                 TESS
                        ...yeah I know.

                                 RICHARD
                        And for the vast majority of 
                        people, life is hard. By the time 
                        they die, they’re pretty tired of 
                        having to try so hard all the time.  

           She looks up at him.

                                 TESS
                        I have to try. I need to find him- 
                        Wait. If no one ever steals things 
                        here than how DID you catch that 
                        the file was missing?

                                 RICHARD
                        Fuggedaboudit.

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god the art class guy narc’d 
                        me out!

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m not naming names.

                                 TESS
                        You don’t have to, that guy’s a 
                        rat. A sneaky little rat with 
                        perfect bone structure.

                                 RICHARD
                        He’s not the one who broke the 
                        rules, Tess.

                                 TESS
                        According to you, no one breaks the 
                        rules...

           She looks at him and takes a step closer to him.
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        So does that mean I scare you?

           He laughs.

                                 RICHARD
                        No.

                                 TESS
                        I do, don’t I? 

           He doesn’t answer her. She turns to start to leave.

                                 RICHARD
                        Where do you think you’re going?

                                 TESS
                        A party.

                                 RICHARD
                        I can’t let you do that.

                                 TESS
                        Why?

                                 RICHARD
                        You won’t even have FUN! You’ll be 
                        looking for him the whole time! 

                                 TESS
                        Richard. Haven’t you ever been in 
                        love?

           Emotion spreads across Richard’s face for just a moment and 
           then it’s gone.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ve been here for a long time.

                                 TESS
                        You didn’t answer my question.

                                 RICHARD
                        No I didn’t.

                                 TESS
                        Look, you may understand a lot more 
                        about the universe than I do but 
                        you clearly don’t understand this.

           She turns to go. He runs and blocks the door.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Move.
                                 RICHARD
                        No.

                                 TESS
                        Then I’ll...I’ll tell that Tony guy 
                        you screwed up. That you lost a file!

                                 RICHARD
                        You wouldn’t dare.

                                 TESS
                        I would dare. And Tony seems like a 
                        real go getter. Maybe he’ll tell 
                        your boss and then Tony will get 
                        your job that you love so much. 
                        Maybe Tony will get to design the 
                        sweatshirts.

           Richard reads her face.

                                 RICHARD
                        You would really do anything, 
                        wouldn’t you.

                                 TESS
                        Yes.

                                 RICHARD
                        Even if it meant turning to Organic 
                        Matter.

                                 TESS
                        Even if.

           There’s something about her determination that charms him.

                                 RICHARD
                        Alright...I’ll allow you to look 
                        for him, you’re really only wasting 
                        your own time.

                                 TESS
                        I’m okay with that.

                                 RICHARD
                        But if I hear that you so much as 
                        breathe a word of this to Tony I will 
                        make it my mission to see that you 
                        get turned into the tackiest piece of 
                        tchotchke art that ever was.

                                 TESS
                        Fine.
                                 RICHARD
                        Alright then. Go ahead.

                                 TESS
                        Great! I’m gonna find him.

                                 RICHARD
                        You won’t find him. You’re 
                        forgetting him as we speak... 

           He holds up the file:

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Tell me, what was his name again?

           Tess starts to answer him but cannot. 

                                 TESS
                        It’s--it’s....

           She stands there with her mouth open, horrified that she 
           can’t recall. 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                           (to herself)
                        What the-

                                 RICHARD
                        I told you, time moves differently 
                        here and things can start to go 
                        like (he snaps) that.  

            She looks him square in the eyes.

                                 TESS
                           (resolute)
                        I will find him. And when I do your 
                        whole system is going to change.

                                 RICHARD
                        No human can change heaven.

                                 TESS
                        No human has ever tried.

                                 RICHARD
                        I dislike you.

                                 TESS
                        No you don’t. I’m the first bit of 
                        excitement you’ve had in a long time. 

           She flings open the door and runs out.
           INT. PERRY’S CONDO- NIGHT

           Perry opens the door to a swinging bachelor pad. As Tess 
           walks in she sees a large crowd of people in 1960s clothing.

                                 PERRY
                        Come on in, sister! Welcome to the 
                        center of the universe... 

           Tess looks down at herself and sees that she is now suddenly 
           wearing 60s clothing.

                                 TESS
                        What’s happening?

                                 PERRY
                        I have a button I can press and 
                        everything looks like it did from 
                        my happiest decade.

                                 TESS
                        Isn’t that against the rules? Won’t 
                        that mean you’ll remember your 
                        happiest decade?

                                 PERRY
                        Are you kidding? I was so high the 
                        whole time I don’t remember 
                        anything about it! 

           As Perry leads her through the party, Tess inspects every man 
           that they pass by. She tries to spot any hints of Adam... 
           Perry leads her to a couch where Holly is sitting swaying to 
           the music, already very drunk. 

                                 PERRY (CONT'D)
                           (to Holly)
                        Ha-cha-cha. The 60s is really 
                        working for you, doll.

           Holly flips her sixties hair and sees Tess.

                                 HOLLY
                           (drunk)
                        Tess! What took you so long? So 
                        many groovy babes to detective...

                                 TESS
                        Perry, Holly and I need some girl 
                        talk for just a minute.

                                 PERRY
                        You got it. I’ll be back with some 
                        of my famous intergalactic punch.
                                 HOLLY
                        Hey girl...

                                 TESS
                           (quietly)
                        Richard has the file. He caught me.

                                 HOLLY
                        What? How?

                                 TESS
                        That art class guy told on me.

                                 HOLLY
                        Motherf- we hate that art class guy! 

                                 TESS
                        So now I don’t have the file AND I 
                        can’t remember my boyfriend’s name!

                                 HOLLY
                        What?? Okay lemme think, 
                        it’s...Alan? Or...Dane, maybe?

                                 TESS
                        Dane? 

                                 HOLLY
                        I can’t remember either!

                                 TESS
                        See? I have to try to find him 
                        before I forget anything else.

           And just like that she bumps right into OTIS. Again. 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Hi...

           Immediate spark.

                                 OTIS
                        Hi. I’ve been looking for you ...I 
                        think I know where I know you from.

                                 TESS
                        ...I think I know where I know YOU 
                        from.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
           Are you... my boyfriend?
                                                      OTIS
                                          Did you go to camp Tomahawk 
                                          in West Virginia?
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        What? No.

                                 OTIS
                        Damn, thought that was it. 
                        But are you from West Virginia?

                                 TESS
                        No.

                                 OTIS
                        Huh. Then I guess it’s impossible 
                        that I know you because I was born, 
                        raised and died there.

           Tess is so disappointed.

                                 TESS
                        Right. Okay...

                                 OTIS
                        You sure are pretty though.
                        You wanna dance?

                                 TESS
                        ...no thank you. But, thanks for 
                        asking. You seem like a nice guy, Otis.

                                 OTIS
                        Sure thing.

           He winks at her as he disappears back into the crowd of 
           strangers. Tess is crestfallen. She can’t move. Holly arrives 
           at her side just as she hears a familiar voice behind her:

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You’re blocking the view, mean girl.  

           Tess sees that Chris Evans is referring to a gaggle of 
           beautiful women dancing with each other and rolls her eyes. 

                                 TESS
                        Ugh, who invited you?

           Perry returns with two giant glasses of punch.

                                 PERRY
                           (to Chris Evans)
                        Hey buddy! You should see this guy 
                        at the batting cages, he can really 
                        knock it out of the park. 
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        And then I knocked it out again 
                        with that blonde!

           They both laugh. Off Tess’s face, Perry leans in and says:

                                 PERRY
                        You know STDs don’t exist here, right? 

                                 TESS
                           (loudly)
                        He’s a traitor.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        How so?

                                 TESS
                        Oh you know exactly how so.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Are you talking about your “medical 
                        condition”? 

                                 HOLLY
                           (loudly, still drunk)
                        Hey how bout I give your face a 
                        medical condition! And she’s not 
                        mean she’s just veryyyyyy sad.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You know why that is, don’t you?

                                 TESS
                        Here we go...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Because memories are painful. But you 
                        know what’s not painful? Making out.

                                 TESS
                        I’m not going to make out with you, 
                        you narc.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I wasn’t saying I wanna make out with 
                        you and I narc’d for your own good! 

           A HOT PLASTIC WOMAN attacks Chris Evans and starts sucking 
           the side of his face.
                                 TESS
                        Yeah can’t unsee that...hate to 
                        break it to you but a woman sucking 
                        your face just proves you’re trying 
                        to distract yourself with the 
                        lowest hanging fruit until your 
                        time’s up.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        So?

                                 TESS
                        So it’s empty. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Yes it is! I’m not seeing the 
                        problem here-

                                 TESS
                        You can’t fuck your way to the 
                        light!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        And why would I listen to you? 
                        You’re pathetic!

           Tess throws her glass of punch in his face. Some lands on the 
           HOT PLASTIC WOMAN. 

                                 TESS
                        Oops.

           Chris Evans throws his drink right back in her face. Everyone 
           at the party has turned to watch at this point.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        What the- who raised you?? 
                        Oh that’s right you can’t remember!

                                 PERRY
                        Okay, let’s all calm-

           Tess grabs both Holly and Perry’s drinks-throws them on him.

           Chris Evans suddenly grabs his head in pain-

           He FLASHES TO:

           The ocean. Splashing. Arms going under.

           He swings around, takes the punch bowl and tosses the entire 
           thing at Tess hulk-style, which gets all over everything and 
           everyone.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Gaaaaaaahhhhhh!

                                 TESS
                        You big dumb animal! If it weren’t 
                        for you I might’ve found my 
                        boyfriend tonight!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        He’s probably hiding from you! 

                                 TESS
                        You have no idea what kind of a man 
                        he is.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Oh yeah?
                         (To the room:) 
                        Hey everyone! Do any of you 
                        recognize this terrible person as 
                        your girlfriend?

           Murmuring in the crowd. No one comes forward.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        There you have it. 

           Ouch.

                                 TESS
                        Hey all you lovely ladies! How many 
                        of you are sleeping with this 
                        Beauty Queen right now?

           Pretty much the entire party raises their hands. The women 
           look around, shocked and angry. They all start fighting with 
           each other... 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Suck on that.

           Women start climbing on furniture. Men start punching each 
           other for no reason. 

                                 PERRY
                        Shhhiitt....

           The groovy vibe of the party has turned to utter chaos. 
           Everybody has devolved into the worst versions of themselves.

           Another shooting pain moves through Chris Evans. He closes 
           his eyes, hoping it will pass.

           DING. 
           Chris Evans immediately turns to leave.

                                 TESS
                        Where are you going?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        To bed. When I hear the ding I go 
                        to the next thing. Unlike you, I 
                        follow the rules. 
                            (he sighs) 
                        Because I want this to work.

           His sadness disarms her for a moment but she can’t let the 
           fight go.

                                 TESS
                        Yeah, go get your beauty sleep, 
                        beauty queen!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Stop calling me that! 
                            (his eyes well up)                     
                        My name’s Adam.

           Not knowing the love of her life is standing in front of her, 
           she lets him turn and walk away from her.

           Just then a woman smashes a light over Tess’s head and 
           everything goes black.

           INT. TESS’S COTTAGE - MORNING

           Tess sits up like a shot in bed. She immediately goes to her 
           desk and starts ripping the rest of that to-go box into 
           pieces and starts writing...

           EXT. HEAVEN - MONTAGE 

           Tess hides notes she’s written under different park benches 
           around heaven...

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        Dear...person who’s name I wish I 
                        could remember,

           ...at a bench by gardens with huge beautiful flowers

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        I know you’re out there. If you 
                        find this maybe it will spark 
                        something...
           ...at a bench by people drinking piña coladas and walking in 
           the rain

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        Maybe it will remind you of who we 
                        were and where we started...

           ...at a bench underneath a huge, permanent rainbow in the 
           sky, etc

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. BENCH BY A RIVER- DAY

           Tess approaches another bench by the edge of a river and sees 
           Chris Evans already sitting there, looking awful. 

           She watches as he smiles at a beautiful woman walking by...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hey Vanessa!

           Vanessa HISSES at him. He looks utterly dejected.         
           Tess plops down next to him, enjoying his discomfort.

                                 TESS
                        Tough morning?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You could say that.

           He rubs his eyes and when he looks up, he’s crying.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry I told Richard about the file. 

           He’s sincere. Not what she was expecting.

                                 TESS
                        Are you crying?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                           (through tears)
                        No. Allergies.

                                 TESS
                        “Allergies” in heaven?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                           (through tears)
                        Okay fine. I can’t explain it, it’s been 
                        happening a lot lately. Just ignore it.
                                 TESS
                           (reluctantly)
                        Um, thank you, for the apology.

           She gets up. This is awkward.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hey, what’s your name?

                                 TESS
                        Tess.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Tess...I think I had a dog named 
                        Tess. Or maybe it was Jess....

           He puts out his perfectly smooth hand...

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Nice to actually meet you. 

           She shakes it and sees the bags under his eyes.

                                 TESS
                        God you look like you’re in worse 
                        shape than me.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I don’t understand it. I’m doing 
                        everything right. I’ve been 
                        following all the rules and doing 
                        all the steps...yet lately the more 
                        sex with random people I have, the 
                        more sad I feel.

           She stares at him.

                                 TESS
                        And what does that tell you?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I have no idea.

                                 TESS
                        Maybe you’re still hung up on 
                        someone. From life.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Nope that’s not it.

                                 TESS
                        Well you’re running from something. 
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I’m running towards something: the 
                        light. You’re running towards 
                        someONE. Which is trouble.

                                 TESS
                        Ohhhhh I get it. You hate love.

           Chris Evans rubs his eyes, shaking a thought away.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Are you having memories? Is that 
                        why you’re in pain?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        All I’ve wanted since I got here 
                        was to leave pain behind. And now 
                        look at me...

                                 TESS
                        So wait you don’t hate love, you’re 
                        still IN love, THAT’S your problem!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I just keep getting these flashes 
                        of water...and then I’m 
                        panicked...and someone is there 
                        but... I don’t know-

                                 TESS
                        You lucky son of a- I can’t even 
                        remember my boyfriend’s name. It’s 
                        miserable.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        And yet you love love.

                                 TESS
                        One hundred percent.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Then we are two sides of the same 
                        destructive coin, Tess.

           He gets up and starts to walk away...

                                 TESS
                        The bell didn’t ding yet. I thought 
                        you didn’t break the rules.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Yeah well I need a drink and 
                        there’s this stupid bar I heard 
                        about where all the sad people 
                        go...it’s the only one where you 
                        can day drink...you wanna come? 

           She looks down at the note in her hands.

                                 TESS
                        All the sad people, huh?

           She tucks the note in the bench and joins him.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Tess and Chris Evans make their way through a wooded area. 
           Then, suddenly, they come upon a dive bar in the middle of 
           nowhere. A neon sign flashes: ROMANTICS. 

           INT. ROMANTICS BAR - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the bar and it is the best of all dive bars. 

           It’s rustic with the perfect amount of dim light so that 
           everyone looks attractive. It’s just dirty enough to feel 
           authentic but it’s not gross. Marker scribbled lines from 
           people’s memories are all over the walls. Initials are carved 
           into booths, etc.. 

           There’s a SAD MAN on the small stage singing karaoke...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Did we just walk into hell?

                                 TESS
                           (loving it)
                        No it’s great!

           SAD KARAOKE MAN is actually only singing like every fifth 
           word because that’s all he can remember. It sounds 
           ridiculous.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        There’re no screens with the words. 
                        How are people supposed to do karaoke 
                        if no one remembers the songs?

           As they make their way to the bar, Tess cranes her neck all 
           around the place looking for Adam.
           They land next to a SKINNY GUY, think Timothée Chalamet, who 
           even though he’s 33 and hot, his skin looks sallow and his 
           hair unwashed. He sits slumped over a glowing, purple drink.  

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        What are you drinking?

                                 KEATS
                        My heart aches, and a drowsy 
                        numbness pains my sense, as though 
                        of hemlock I had drunk...

                                 TESS
                        That’s very beautiful.

                                 KEATS
                        It’s the only stanza I’ve got left. 
                        I’ve spent the entirety of heaven 
                        sitting in this bar, remembering 
                        that stanza of poetry.

           He takes a drink. 

                                 KEATS (CONT'D)
                        Well that and “here I sit empty 
                        hearted, I came to shit but only 
                        farted.”

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Now that I like.

                                 KEATS
                        It’s on the men’s room wall.

                                 TESS
                        How long have you been here?

                                 KEATS
                        Nearly 200 years. I had a very 
                        short, very...tragic life. But I 
                        had love. And I won’t forget that. 
                        Love is the only light I need.

                                 TESS
                           (moved)
                        Me too.

           Keats lifts Tess’s hand and kisses it.

                                 KEATS
                        Keats. John Keats.

           Chris Evans rolls his eyes.
                                 TESS
                        The John Keats?

                                 KEATS
                        Increasingly. Let me give you some 
                        advice. If you want to remember, 
                        don’t wash your hair. Don’t take a 
                        shower. Don’t go in the ocean. The 
                        water here washes it all away.

           At this Chris Evans interrupts- 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Tess, can you grab us that booth 
                        over there?

           Tess is gazing at Keats in awe as Chris Evans practically 
           shoves her towards the booth. He turns to Keats.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Funny you should mention the ocean, 
                        I keep having flashes of it.

                                 KEATS
                        Well that’s probably where you left  
                        your heart, mate.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                           (not buying it)
                        Right...my heart.

           He picks up an armful of drinks and heads over to the booth 
           but before he even finishes sitting down across from Tess, 
           they hear another group talking in the booth behind them.

                                 ROMANTIC #1
                        Life was so hard. So tragic. 

                                 ROMANTIC #2
                        I miss pain. Do your remember pain?

           Chris Evans pretends to puke.

                                 TESS
                        Come on. What’s so wrong with 
                        liking life?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        These people aren’t like “Gee, 
                        wasn’t life great?” They’re 
                        addicted to the struggle!

           He takes a big sip of his drink, dribbling down his chin.
                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want any struggle.

           He wipes his mouth, crumples up his napkin and is about to 
           throw it on the floor when Tess grabs it from him, and folds 
           it neatly in front of her.

                                 TESS
                        Does nothing matter to you?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        It’s a napkin. And yeah, if you 
                        haven’t noticed, nothing matters 
                        here. Which is just the way I like 
                        it. 

           He finishes his drink and starts another. She looks around 
           the bar for Adam, when she doesn’t see him, she starts 
           writing something on the napkin. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS  (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 TESS
                        Well, I used to write my boyfriend 
                        notes and leave them around the 
                        house, in the car, in his 
                        clothes... it was a way I could 
                        tell him I’m always thinking about 
                        him, even when we’re not together. 

           She folds up the note.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        So I’ve been leaving him notes 
                        around heaven in places I think 
                        he’ll go. I’m hoping he’ll find at 
                        least one. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Like where?

                                 TESS
                        I’m starting with park benches 
                        because that’s where we met.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Heaven is basically one big park. 
                        There are hundreds of benches here.

                                 TESS
                        I know. I’m just...writing little things 
                        on each one that only he would get.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hmmm...

           He reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a note...

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        You mean like: “Dear bandaid hands, 
                        I will kiss each cut and bruise-”?

                                 TESS
                        Hey! 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You’re not the only one who likes 
                        to sit on a bench.

                                 TESS
                        Give it back!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Nope. What, was your guy a burn 
                        victim or something?

                                 TESS
                        No, I told you, you wouldn’t get it.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        That’s your whole plan? Notes?

                                 TESS
                        No I’m going to look for him too!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        How will you know it’s him?

                                 TESS
                        I have an idea... but you’ll 
                        probably think it’s crazy.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Oh I definitely will.

                                 TESS
                        If I think it might be him... I’m 
                        going to lean in and smell his breath.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I’m sorry, his breath?

                                 TESS
                        Yeah. You can change your face but 
                        you can’t change your breath and 
                        I’d know his anywhere.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Huh. 

           There’s a small moment between them, but Tess deflects.

                                 TESS
                        So what about your person? Do you 
                        ever wonder if she’s here?

           Chris Evans takes a quick, sharp breath, holding back tears.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        She’s not my person anymore. And I 
                        don’t want to talk about it, I want 
                        to drink. We’re in a bar. 

           He downs another. 

                                 TESS
                        Woof. You are in bad shape. 

           She gets up...

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna go take a lap and hide 
                        another note, pace yourself.

           But as she starts to go Tess hears the first notes to a 
           familiar song coming on the karaoke. 

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        This song...I feel like I know 
                        it... fuck it, I’m going up there.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Oh god I’m gonna pretend I don’t 
                        know you.

           He shrinks down in his seat as she gets on the small stage 
           and grabs a mic.

                                 TESS
                           (to the sad crowd)
                        Hey everyone! I’m gonna sing this 
                        song for you because I think I might 
                        remember it... but I’m gonna need 
                        some help from my friend over here!

           On Chris Evans:

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        No no no no.

           She waves him up, speaking into the mic:
                                 TESS
                        C’mon! You like distraction right? 
                        Well you just have to keep your 
                        clothes on during this distraction. 

           Laughs from the audience. Then they start cheering for him to 
           come up. Finally Chris Evans reluctantly comes to the 
           stage...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                           (to Tess)
                        I’m never gonna forgive you for this.

                                 TESS
                        I’m okay with that.

           The verse starts...

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                           (singing tentatively)
                        Come a little bit closer...Hear 
                        what I have to say...

           Chris Evans clearly doesn’t know it. He echoes:

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Say...

                                 TESS
                        Just hmm hm hm hm... 
                        We could dream this night away

           Chris Evans laughs at her. But he echoes again and starts to 
           sway:

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Away...

           The crowd cheers.

                                 TESS
                        But there’s a full moon hm hm... 
                        Let’s go dancin’ in the light

           He twirls her out as he repeats:

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        The light, the light, the light

           Tess laughs as the disco ball above them spins...

                                 TESS
                        We know where the hmm hmm hmm 
                        Let’s go hm hm hm hm hmmm
           She can’t remember the next line, but Chris Evans comes in:

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Because I’m still in love with 
                        you...

           He surprises himself, Tess’s eyes widen with joy.

                                 TESS
                        I wanna see you dance again! 

           CLOSE ON Chris Evans watching her as she closes her eyes and 
           really feels it as she sings the next line.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Because I’m still in love with 
                        you...

           It hits him like a truck how lovely she is and the crowd is 
           LOVING IT. She opens her eyes, they look at each other and 
           instinctively harmonize:

                                 TESS/CHRIS EVANS
                        On this harvest moon...

           Tess yells into the mic in celebration:

                                 TESS
                        We remembered the words!

           But at this point, they look out but there’s only Keats, the 
           bartender and a couple of stragglers left. Where did 
           everybody go?

           EXT. BAR - LATE NIGHT INTO DAWN

           They stumble out into the colored moonlight, still drunk. 
           Light is bleeding into the sky. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        God that was GOOD!

                                 TESS
                        What time is it?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        What day is it?

                                 TESS
                        No no no, days cannot have passed.
           Tess trips over her own feet and falls. He laughs and pulls 
           her off the ground until they are face to face. There’s a 
           tense moment of chemistry between them. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        That’s the best I’ve felt since 
                        I’ve been here.

           Almost against her will Tess leans in and subtly smells his 
           breath...

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

           She waves her hand in front of her nose.

                                 TESS
                        Jesus did you drink all the alcohol 
                        they had in there?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I am the perfect amount of drunk.

           He instinctively pushes her hair behind her ear. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Has anyone ever told you you have 
                        great ears? The shape of your 
                        earlobes, they’re like tiny light 
                        bulbs.

           Tess lights up, not knowing why. But then, realizing she’s 
           feeling something for Chris Evans, she panics.

                                 TESS
                        I...I have to go.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Wait, I know it’s weird but I think 
                        something’s happening here.

                                 TESS
                        Nope. Nothing’s happening. I should 
                        go-

           She runs off. He runs and quickly catches up to her. As they 
           run:

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        So are we going to your place 
                        or...?

                                 TESS
                        This isn’t funny.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hey Karaoke actually worked! I was 
                        fully distracted and it felt better 
                        than sex! Who cares how much time 
                        has passed?

                                 TESS
                        Me! I have to find my boyfriend. I 
                        can’t be singing in bars all night 
                        with you...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Admit it, you had fun.

           She stops.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t care about fun! Did you 
                        hear nothing I said all night?

           Tess starts to run again. He follows.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Fine. Then let me come with you. 
                        I’ll help you look! 

                                 TESS
                        Why?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Not focusing on myself helps me not 
                        feel pain!

                                 TESS
                        And how would you help?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I could help you cover more ground 
                        in less time...you could give me a 
                        bunch of those little notes, I’ll 
                        hit more spots. I’ll find 
                        candidates and bring them to you. 
                        I’ll line ‘em up and you can sniff 
                        ‘em out!

           Tess considers this.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Look, if I play by all the rules I’m 
                        guaranteed to be on the express train 
                        to the light so you won’t have to put 
                        up with me for long anyway. 

           She opens her mouth to speak but-
                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry- I won’t try to sleep 
                        with you, I won’t try anything- 
                        I’ll just help. 

           He pushes her. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        You’re not THAT attractive, you 
                        know.

           She pushes him back, smiling in spite of herself.

                                 TESS
                        Spoken like a true beauty queen.

           We PULL BACK to see Richard watching them flirt from nearby, 
           looking very concerned. 

           EXT. HEAVEN - EARLY MORNING

           Tess and Holly are running together.

                                 HOLLY
                        It’s not against the rules to have 
                        fun while you look. 

                                 TESS
                        I just...I don’t want him to get 
                        the wrong idea.

                                 HOLLY
                        You were at that bar with him for a 
                        long time. 

                                 TESS
                        How long?

                                 HOLLY
                        Like two years?

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god!

                                 HOLLY
                        And you’re sure it’s not him?

                                 TESS
                        It’s not, I smelled his breath. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Well... maybe you like this guy too.
                                 TESS
                        No! I mean...he’s not as bad as I 
                        initially thought...but No.

                                 HOLLY
                        Then there’s no problem. Take the 
                        help. You need it. 

           Off Tess’s face knowing she’s right we CUT TO--

           INT. TESS’S COTTAGE - MORNING

           Tess tearing off a piece of napkin and writing... 

                                 TESS
                               (V.O.)
                        Dear person I love... I remember 
                        you less but I feel you more.

           She folds it up and we see that there is a whole stack of 
           notes she has written on various scraps of people’s garbage 
           she’s collected beside it on the desk.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. CHRIS EVANS’S CONDO - MORNING

           A sleepy Chris Evans opens his door to find Tess holding two 
           cups of coffee.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        What do we have here...

                                 TESS
                        Drink this. Let’s get moving.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Great. We just have to stick to the 
                        ding schedule okay? We can go all over 
                        heaven to whichever activities you 
                        think you might find him at, I just 
                        need to do it in a timely fashion.

                                 TESS
                        Back on track I see... 

           She hears a small TV from inside his condo. She can see that 
           it’s playing a METS game.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        You have a TV?
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Yeah, when the Mets play on this TV 
                        they win every championship- isn’t 
                        that awesome?

           Something about this feels familiar to Tess...

                                 TESS
                        Yeah...awesome...

           She shakes it off. She has to focus.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        I have a bunch of notes for you to 
                        hide...

           She stuffs them into his pocket.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Someone is amped up.

                                 TESS
                        This is my fifth cup of coffee. 
                        Ding. Let’s go. Ding ding.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Okay, calm down, you’re not the 
                        ruler of heaven.

                                 TESS
                        Yet. 

           As they walk away from Chris Evans’ condo they run into 
           Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hey guys!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hey Richard! 

           Tess immediately starts to drag Chris Evans away.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Looking forward to our session later.

                                 RICHARD
                        Me too. Uh Tess, can I talk to you 
                        for a moment?

                                 TESS
                        I would love to but-

           Tess keeps dragging Chris Evans away.
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        -but we gotta get going. Busy day.

                                 RICHARD
                        Well... we’re overdue for a session.

           They’re getting further and further.

                                 TESS
                        Mm...mmhmm....

           They’re now far away from him.

                                 RICHARD
                           (yelling to her)
                        You haven’t done a single one yet!

                                 TESS
                        What? Can’t hear you? Oops so sorry 
                        byyye...

           Off Richard’s look of concern watching them walk away 
           together...

           EXT. HEAVEN - MONTAGE

           Chris Evans and Tess hide notes in various places in heaven. 
           A baseball stadium, a horse barn, a men’s bathroom... DING.

           Chris Evans leads FIVE GUYS to stand in front of Tess. 

           She inspects different parts of them, smells their breath 
           etc. She shakes her head nope, none of them are Adam. DING.

           They look for Adam at a carnival...and end up on a ride.  
           DING.

           They look at a dance class...and up dancing. DING.

           They look at a packed ice skating rink...and end up skating. 
           DING.

           DING. DING. DING.

           EXT. DRIVE-IN - EVENING

           Tess and Chris Evans pull into a drive-in in a convertible. 
           The 1943 version of “Heaven Can Wait” is playing in  
           Technicolor. At this drive-in everything is in technicolor, 
           not just the screen. Even Chris Evans and Tess. 
           Chris Evans turns off the engine and it looks like they’re 
           about to settle in to watch the movie but that’s not what 
           they’re there for. Tess turns to him.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Ready?

                                 TESS
                        Yep. Remember, just think about the 
                        opposite of you and look for that.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Got it. I’ll take the right half, 
                        you take the left. Meet back here.

           They both get out of the car as the movie plays and start 
           knocking on the windows of about a hundred parked cars.

           We PULL BACK and watch as they weave in and out between the 
           steamed up windows until Tess comes back to the car, empty 
           handed.

           But she sees THREE MEN standing next to Chris Evans at the 
           car. One of them is in his underwear- Chris Evans clearly 
           pulled him out of something hot and heavy.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Do any of these guys look familiar?  
                        They seem like they have that nice, 
                        harmless guy thing.

           Tess looks at the first one. Nope. She walks to the second- 
           underwear guy- definitely not. 

           Then she stops in front of the third. She looks up at him, he 
           smiles at her. She gets very close to his mouth, almost as if 
           she’s going to kiss him, and takes a deep breath in.

           Chris Evans, watching this, gets nervous that she’s found 
           him.

           But after a moment she shakes her head, no.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Okay thanks guys- sorry for pulling 
                        you away from your dates...

           They get back in the car. He can see she’s upset.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry. There’s still more ground 
                        to cover. Heaven is a big place.
                                 TESS
                        Right.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        In the meantime...

           Chris Evans leans over and opens the glove compartment. He 
           pulls out a large covered tray.

                                 TESS
                        What’s this?

           He opens the cover. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Lasagna. They serve it for 
                        breakfast, lunch and dinner for me. 

                                 TESS
                        That’s my heaven food too!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        What a coincidence...

           They eat. She looks at him, does he look different?

                                 TESS
                        You seem to be doing much better.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Thanks to you. I haven’t had one 
                        memory pang since before karaoke 
                        night so...I’m flying pretty high 
                        right now. Richard said I’m doing 
                        so well I could have my light 
                        ceremony this week!

                                 TESS
                           (trying to hide 
                           disappointment)
                        This week...wow...that’s so quick. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        What about you? Now that you’ve 
                        tried out most of the activities 
                        heaven has to offer, which will you 
                        do with your boyfriend when you 
                        find him?

           Pause.

                                 TESS
                        None of them.
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Whaaat? Think of all the cool stuff 
                        we’ve been doing.

                                 TESS
                        Yeah, it might sound stupid 
                        but...there’s really only one thing 
                        I want to do. I want to have a 
                        wedding ceremony.
                        I know you think it’s dumb. Two 
                        dead people getting married...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        It’s not dumb. I uh...I actually 
                        like the idea of marriage. Just not 
                        rings.

                                 TESS
                        ...I wouldn’t even need someone to 
                        marry us, I’d want to do it Quaker 
                        style. At least I think it’s 
                        Quaker...

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        What’s that?

                                 TESS
                        You just look into each other’s 
                        eyes for however long it takes, and 
                        when you both feel it...you’re 
                        married.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Huh. What if you start laughing?

                                 TESS
                        You don’t. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I dunno, you might mess up the most 
                        important moment of your 
                        life/death...

                                 TESS
                        Don’t make me nervous!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Let’s practice.

                                 TESS
                        Practice a quaker wedding?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Just pretend I’m him.
           She squints at him.

                                 TESS
                        That’s too weird.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hey I just pulled a half naked guy 
                        out of a car to come be inspected by 
                        you, nothing seems weird right now. 

                                 TESS
                        Okay. But don’t make me laugh-

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I’m totally serious. 

           They turn to face each other. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        So we just look at each other.

                                 TESS
                        Yep. And when we feel married, we 
                        stop.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Awesome, I’ll try not to make fart 
                        sounds.

                                 TESS
                        I thought you wanted to help me!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Sorry, sorry. Okay I’m ready...

           They start looking at each other. They’re both smiling. 

           But eventually his smile fades as he focuses on HER EYES...

           She focuses on HIS EYES...They’re staring at each other very 
           intensely and after a moment we actually feel that they are 
           almost...maybe... DING!

           It breaks the moment. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        ...hey, you didn’t laugh.

                                 TESS
                        Nope.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You’ll be great. When you do it for 
                        real.
           Tess looks down, upset.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        That’s...what you want, right?

           She looks up at him- is that what she wants? DING.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                           (quickly)
                        I’ve gotta go to my next session 
                        with Richard but I’ll see you at 
                        that restaurant you think Mr. 
                        Perfect would like tomorrow night, 
                        right? 

           Tess nods as he runs out of the car. She feels completely 
           lost. She looks down and sees he left a note behind on the 
           seat. She unfolds and reads: 

           “Dear person, you’re the only one for me.”

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. TESS’S COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Tess furiously writes on a scrap of paper.

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        Dear... I won’t give up.

           She looks up, tears in her eyes. She goes over to her bed, 
           lies down and stares at the ceiling. She gets under her 
           covers and pulls them up over her head.

           INT. DINER - MORNING

           Tess comes into breakfast on a mission. Perry and Holly are 
           waiting for her, with their respective pancakes and doughnuts 
           in front of them.

                                 PERRY
                        Good morning darlin’.

           A plate of lasagna is immediately put in front of Tess. She 
           pushes it aside.

                                 TESS
                        Thanks for meeting me. 
                           (to Holly)
                        ...did you get botox??
                                 HOLLY
                        Me? No...no I just relaxed a little.

                                 TESS
                        Okay, um, I have a problem... 
                        I like beauty queen.

                                 HOLLY
                        I knew it!

                                 PERRY
                        That’s great! 

                                 TESS
                        But he’s distracting me from what I 
                        know I really want. I can’t just 
                        give up on the love of my life 
                        because of someone new and shiny... 

                                 HOLLY
                        Are you sure that’s what you want?

                                 TESS
                        I was up all night thinking about 
                        it. I’m sure... I told him I’d have 
                        dinner with him tonight but I 
                        can’t. No more dinners. No more 
                        anything. I don’t wan’t to leave 
                        him hanging but... 

                                 PERRY
                        So send someone else.

                                 TESS
                        What do you mean, like set him up?

                                 PERRY
                        Yeah, with someone irresistible so 
                        he’ll forget all about you. 

                                 TESS
                        ...Perry you’re a genius. All he 
                        wants is to be distracted so I’ll 
                        just set him up with someone VERY 
                        distracting.

                                 PERRY
                        There ya go, a real catch. A real 
                        looker with huuuuge-

                                 HOLLY
                           (elbowing Perry)
                        She gets it.
                                 TESS
                        I get it. (beat) Thank you!

           Tess gets up and starts to leave.

                                 PERRY
                        Tess?

                                 TESS
                        Yeah.

                                 PERRY
                        My light ceremony is tonight.

                                 TESS
                        What??

                                 PERRY
                        Yeah my time’s up-

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god I feel terrible. All I’ve 
                        been thinking about is my own timeline!

                                 PERRY
                        Not to worry darlin, I’m ready.

                                 TESS
                        You are?

                                 PERRY
                        I am. So come to my party tonight. 
                        It’s in the main field and it’s 
                        gonna be epic.

           She takes his hand and squeezes.

           INT. FANCY ITLALIAN RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Chris Evans waits at a candlelit table. He is wearing a suit 
           and tie and looks nervous. Suddenly he sees Tess and smiles- 
           but then sees she’s walking with a BEAUTIFUL MODEL WOMAN.

                                 TESS
                           (overly enthusiastic)
                        Heyyyyy Adam! This is my new friend 
                        Cindy. She just got here and wiped 
                        her memory too! Cindy, this is 
                        Adam. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL MODEL CINDY
                        She wasn’t lying when she called 
                        you a beauty.
                                 TESS
                        Something else you two have in 
                        common!

           Tess and Cindy both laugh.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hi...uh...what’s happening?

                                 TESS
                        I’ve gotta run but Cindy here is 
                        going to join you instead, if 
                        that’s okay with you?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        But I thought-

                                 TESS
                        Great! Have an awesome time guys! 

           Beautiful Model Cindy sits down.

                                 BEAUTIFUL MODEL CINDY
                        Look, I just want something easy 
                        and uncomplicated and Tess said 
                        you’re a sure thing. She thinks 
                        we’d be perfect together. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Tess said I’m uncomplicated? 

                                 BEAUTIFUL MODEL CINDY
                           (smiling)
                        Yeah, she said nothing matters to 
                        you.

           Ouch. He reaches into his jacket pocket and looks at a note 
           he wrote: “Dear mean girl, I hope this note makes you smile. 
           You don’t look mean at all when you smile.”

                                 BEAUTIFUL MODEL CINDY (CONT'D)
                        Everything okay?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Yeah. Yep. I’m fine. Want some 
                        lasagna?

           INT. TESS'S COTTAGE - EVENING

           Tess sits on her bed but she can’t sit still. Her foot is 
           tapping uncontrollably. She’s biting her nails. She tries to 
           distract herself but there’s nothing to distract herself 
           with.
           She starts to make her bed but then ends up kicking it. She  
           tears off the covers in frustration and throws the mattress 
           off it’s springs. A note flies out from under it. 

           She crouches down and grabs it. It’s the first note she 
           tucked under the mattress. She forgot about it. She looks at 
           it, the first line is: 

           Dear Adam, I never told you my final order..

                                 TESS
                        Adam...

           Tess stands. It can’t be.    

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                           (quietly, heart racing)
                        Adam? 

           EXT. PERRY’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Perry opens the door, half naked. 

                                 PERRY
                        Hey Tessie.

           Holly appears behind him, also half naked. 

                                 TESS
                        What the--

           Holly looks so much more relaxed, that Tess feels betrayed.

                                 HOLLY
                        It’s not a big deal.

                                 PERRY
                        It certainly is a BIG deal.

           Holly pushes him back:

                                 HOLLY
                        Okay Tarzan go inside. 

           He does, Holly rolls her eyes.

                                 TESS
                        You had sex with Perry?! And your 
                        forehead is smooth! You gave into 
                        heaven!

                                 HOLLY
                        How? Sex is a distraction. 
                                 TESS
                        Exactly!

                                 HOLLY
                        Excuse me, you were full on DATING 
                        Beauty Queen!

                                 TESS
                        That’s why I’m here! Beauty Queen 
                        is Adam! My Adam, my love, from 
                        life!

                                 HOLLY
                        What?? I thought you smelled his 
                        breath and said it wasn’t him.

                                 TESS
                        Yeah but he was basically a 
                        distillery at that point we were 
                        drinking so much. I found the first 
                        note I wrote before I forgot his 
                        name and it says Dear Adam and I’ve 
                        been feeling all these things that 
                        I couldn’t explain and...I 
                        think...Beauty Queen is Adam! 

           Pause.

                                 HOLLY
                        So you’ve been cheating on Adam 
                        ...with Adam?

           Holly breaks into laughter. 

                                 TESS
                        I wasn’t cheating.

                                 HOLLY
                        No, not technically! This is too much.

           She keeps laughing.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        You have to admit, that’s awesome.

                                 TESS
                        It’s not! What do I do?? He’s on a 
                        date with a beautiful model right 
                        now that I sent him on! They’re 
                        probably having sex already- 
                        apparently everyone is! 
                                 HOLLY
                        Tess please don’t judge me. Part of 
                        what I loved about being a mom was 
                        playing, was getting to be a kid 
                        again. Isn’t sex just a form of 
                        remembering that? Plus I’ve barely 
                        seen you at all lately because 
                        you’ve been spending all your time 
                        with Beauty Queen. Who turns out to 
                        be the love of your life! So what 
                        are you still doing here? 

                                 TESS
                        Right...right! But what if he’s 
                        having a great time? What if he 
                        wants to be with her?

                                 HOLLY
                        Then stop him! By any means 
                        necessary!

                                 PERRY
                        Yeehaw! Go get your man! And bring 
                        him to the party! 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Tess rushes into the restaurant which is now packed with 
           couples at candlelit tables. She sees Adam and Cindy 
           laughing, seemingly enjoying themselves and starts running 
           towards them.

           Just as she’s about to get to the table, Richard appears and 
           body blocks her. She bounces off the back of him.

                                 RICHARD
                        Well hey Adam!

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hey...

           Tess tries to get around Richard, but cant.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        ... Tess? 

                                 RICHARD
                        So how’s this date going, huh? Pretty 
                        sure I can feel the sparks flying!

           Tess is now jumping up from behind Richard:
                                 TESS
                        Adam! I have to talk to you!

           She cuts over to the side of the restaurant, yelling:

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Adam you’ll never guess- you’re Adam!

           Richard chases her.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                           (totally confused)
                        What?

                                 RICHARD
                        And I’m Richard! And that’s Cindy!

           Richard blocks her path again but Tess kicks him in the shins 
           this time. He goes down in pain but Tess falls backwards from 
           the force of her own kick, knocking over a table full of 
           Italian food and candles.  

           The bottom of a curtain catches fire. 

           Tess tries to stand but slips in all the spilled pasta sauce.

           The fire starts to spread quickly. People see it and start to 
           scream and rush out. Smoke is filling the room but Tess spots 
           Cindy clinging to Adam like a damsel in distress. She starts 
           crawling towards them, covered in food...but then Richard 
           scoops her up from behind and drags her kicking and screaming 
           out of the burning restaurant.

                                 TESS
                           (screaming)
                        Stop! Let me go! You’re 
                        surprisingly strong... Adam!

           But they disappear into the smoke....

           EXT. FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Richard and Tess emerge from the smoke, gasping and coughing, 
           the restaurant in flames behind them. 

           She tries to run back in but Richard stops her. 

                                 TESS
                        What are you doing? Adam’s in there!

                                 RICHARD
                        He’ll be fine, no one will get 
                        hurt, this is heaven!
           He pulls out a flask and takes a swig.

                                 TESS
                        Are you drinking?

                                 RICHARD
                        Am I drinking? Yes, Tess. Yes I am.

           He takes another sip.

                                 TESS
                        There’s a burning building behind you!

                                 RICHARD
                        I know! 

           He starts laughing hysterically and then sinks down to the 
           ground...

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                           (through laughter)
                        You’re...ruining...me.

           He keeps laughing.

                                 TESS
                        Me? What about you?
                        That’s Adam, isn’t it. My Adam.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...yes.

                                 TESS
                        Why didn’t you just tell me?

                                 RICHARD
                        We haven’t had a situation like 
                        this before- 

                                 TESS
                        But you KNOW that finding him is 
                        all I’ve been wanting! Aren’t you 
                        supposed to be here to help me?! 

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s not all about you, Tess! Adam 
                        is my client too- I’m not trying to 
                        take away your happiness, I’m 
                        trying to give him his. All he 
                        wanted when he arrived was peace. I 
                        was trying to protect you both. I 
                        thought I could handle you both but 
                        this is way too complicated- even 
                        for me. 
           He takes another big swig.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        I’m probably going to lose my job. 

           She sits down next to him.

                                 TESS
                        I’m not gonna tell Tony.

                                 RICHARD
                        Tony? Who gives a piece of Organic 
                        Matter about Tony? It’s you! You 
                        come in here with all the “haven’t 
                        you ever been in love? I’d do 
                        anything for love...love love love 
                        bla bla...” I haven’t thought about 
                        that in a long, long, long...

           He turns to her.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Would you believe that I was once a 
                        prince?

           He starts laughing. So does Tess.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        I know it’s hard to picture but I 
                        was. It’s the last thing I remember 
                        about myself. At least I think I 
                        was the prince, it’s possible I was 
                        the horse the prince rode on.

           His eyes start to fill.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        But I never... I never thought I 
                        would stop knowing how to love. I 
                        think I just took it for granted 
                        that it would always be there, 
                        memory or no memory. But if you 
                        don’t love...you forget love.

           Tess puts her hand on his shoulder. Then she starts to get 
           up.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 TESS
                        I have to tell him I’m me. That 
                        he’s him.
           He stumbles to his feet. 

                                 RICHARD
                        This is terrible.

                                 TESS
                        I know but I can fix it.

                                 RICHARD
                        No you don’t understand. If you 
                        tell Adam, it will change things 
                        for him. He's so close to the end 
                        of his steps, he's so close to 
                        turning into light but now he’s 
                        fallen in love with you. You were 
                        the one thing in his life that he 
                        could never let go of- and now he’s 
                        in danger of not being able to let 
                        go of you here- telling him could 
                        undo all the progress he's made. He 
                        could end up turning to Organic 
                        Matter. 

                                 TESS
                        That won’t happen.

                                 RICHARD
                        It might. The question is, who 
                        would you really be telling him 
                        for? For him or for you? If you 
                        really love him, don’t cause him 
                        any more pain than you already 
                        have. You may not have a chance at 
                        everlasting peace but he does. 

           The gravity of what he’s saying hits Tess hard...

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. PERRY’S LIGHT CEREMONY - NIGHT

           Tess stands in front of a crowded dance floor under the 
           stars. Everyone is dressed in 19th century gowns and suits. 
           As she steps onto the dance floor, Tess is no longer wearing 
           her food stained, smoke covered clothes but is suddenly in a 
           beautiful 19th century dress. She is stunning. 

           She watches Perry and Holly dance as if they don’t have a 
           care in the world. Perry sees Tess and blows her a kiss just 
           as Chris Evans appears beside her.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Hey.
           He’s suddenly wearing a 19th century suit. He looks very 
           handsome.

                                 TESS
                        Hey.

           Silence. A lot of tension between them.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Do you want to dance?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        ...okay.

           They walk out into the field among the dancing couples under 
           the stars and begin to move to the music.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        So... you burned down that restaurant.

                                 TESS
                        I know, I feel terrible-

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Everybody got out... I think.     

                                 TESS
                        What about Cindy?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Cindy’s fine.

                                 TESS
                        Did you like her?

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Uh, well, her heaven food was pigs 
                        in a blanket. She kept pulling them 
                        out of her purse which was 
                        unsettling.

           Tess cracks a smile.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        But apparently you thought she was 
                        perfect for me...

           She looks down.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        You set me up and then you stormed 
                        in and torched the place. What were 
                        you trying to tell me?
                                 TESS
                        Nothing.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Nothing? 
                        Were you jealous?

                                 TESS
                        I don’t know.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I think you do know.  

           She doesn’t say anything.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Well I wanted you to be jealous. 

           She still doesn’t say anything.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        But you’re not gonna tell me 
                        anything now. God you’re 
                        frustrating. 

           Tess looks up at him. She loves him so much.

                                 TESS
                        You don’t understand.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        I do understand. But no matter 
                        where your boyfriend is, I’m 
                        telling you that I’m here. Now. And 
                        this is special. I can’t explain it 
                        but I feel...full... when I’m with 
                        you. We have the best time together 
                        even when we’re doing stuff I hate, 
                        and you’re notes! Your stupid 
                        notes! I love your notes! I love 
                        you...

           He stops for a moment, looking at her.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        And I think you love me too. 

           She takes a deep breath.

                                 TESS
                           (barely getting the lie 
                           out)
                        I don’t. 
                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        You’re lying.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t want you. I never have. 

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Tess-

           She steps back from him, steeling herself.

                                 TESS
                        I only spent time with you because 
                        I thought you could help me- the 
                        only reason you feel full when 
                        you’re with me is because you had 
                        nothing inside of you to begin 
                        with. You’re empty.

           He looks at her, gutted. The huge moon seems to hang directly 
           over them.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        ...right. 

           He looks down.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Then there’s nothing keeping me here.

           She can’t speak.

                                 CHRIS EVANS (CONT'D)
                        My light ceremony will be tomorrow 
                        night. I do the last step and if I 
                        can get through that, then that’s 
                        it...
                        Goodbye Tess.

           He turns to go-

                                 TESS
                           (shakey)
                        Adam... could you... say that one 
                        more time but come closer?

           He doesn’t move for a long moment...then he turns and walks 
           right up to her getting so close they’re just an inch apart.

                                 CHRIS EVANS
                        Goodbye Tess...

           She closes her eyes, inhaling his breath. 
           She opens her eyes. He looks at her. They are so in love. 
           They’re about to kiss when...BOOM!

           Fireworks everywhere. Perry has turned into light. 

           It’s beautiful. Tess watches Chris Evans take it in 
           longingly.

           When he turns back to look at her, she’s gone.

           INT. ROMANTICS - NIGHT

           Tess sits at the bar drowning herself in liquor. Keats sidles 
           up next to her. 

                                 KEATS
                        What are you doing?

                                 TESS
                        I’m going to drink until I black 
                        out. People did that in life all 
                        the time, right? I never did 
                        because I never wanted to forget 
                        anything. But now I want to forget 
                        everything. Especially the pain.

           She holds up her glass:

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Here’s to oblivion.

           He clinks glasses with her.

                                 KEATS
                        Beautiful but it won’t work.

                                 TESS
                        Why not.

                                 KEATS
                        Why do you think alcoholics exist? 
                        No matter how much they drink it 
                        doesn’t make the pain go away.

                                 TESS
                        I think I finally agree with 
                        heaven. Memories are pain machines. 

                                 KEATS
                        There’s nothing machine like about 
                        memories. They’re slippery. 
                        Constantly shifting.

                        That’s why it’s so absurd for this 
                        place to try to take them away... 
                        we’re reconstructing our memories 
                        all the time, thereby 
                        reconstructing ourselves. To 
                        remember is to be human.

                                 TESS
                        But what if all they do is hurt 
                        you?

                                 KEATS
                        I believe there is a very thin line 
                        between pain and pleasure, the ugly 
                        and the beautiful. In fact it may 
                        not be a line at all. The longer 
                        I’m here the more I understand 
                        there are no lines- not straight 
                        ones at least.

           Tess looks at him drunkenly.

                                 TESS
                        Yes. But there are lines that we 
                        should not cross. And tonight, I 
                        didn’t cross one. In the name of 
                        love.

                                 KEATS
                        Doesn’t it usually go the other 
                        way? 

                                 TESS
                        Not always. Sometimes we have to 
                        make lines where there are no lines 
                        to save each other.

           He looks at her.

                                 KEATS
                        Are you a poet?

                                 TESS
                        God no.

                                 KEATS
                        This is the best conversation I’ve 
                        had in here for probably 50 years.

                                 TESS
                        Thank you.
                                 KEATS
                        Thank you. 
                        You know if you really want to 
                        forget, try the ocean.

                                 TESS
                        Right! Yes! The ocean... You are a 
                        brilliant person. I love you. I see 
                        why we all love you.

                                 KEATS
                        We all?

                                 TESS
                        Yes. Humans. You were one of our 
                        best.

           He smiles humbly, but his eyes are shining as we CUT TO-

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Tess swims out into the ocean. She starts to hear music as 
           the waves come to the shore. She lets herself float. She 
           looks up at the colored moon, the endless sky...

                                 TESS
                        Please.

           She starts to sink... 

           Underwater the music is even better, even louder. She gives 
           herself over to it as she starts to lose consciousness. She 
           sinks and sinks into the darkness until she looks like 
           another rock or object curled up at the bottom of the ocean.

           Until an arm pulls her out of the water...

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           Holly, who has been carrying Tess, sets her down on the 
           court. She’s still dripping wet.

                                 HOLLY
                        Hey!

           No response.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Tess!
           No response. Holly SLAPS her. Tess comes to...

                                 TESS
                        What happened?

                                 HOLLY
                        You tried to drown yourself in the 
                        ocean. You can’t kill yourself once 
                        your already dead!

                                 TESS
                        I wasn’t trying to kill myself.

                                 HOLLY
                        Then what were you doing?

           Tess covers her face, remembering.

                                 TESS
                        Ugghhh trying to forget Adam.

                                 HOLLY
                        Why?

           Tess sits up.

                                 TESS
                        Richard told me that if I tell him 
                        who I am...his chances of turning 
                        into light will probably be 
                        destroyed. So I...I let him go.

           She gets up.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        He’s supposed to turn into light 
                        tomorrow night. I have to let him 
                        go right? 

                                 HOLLY
                        Oh Tess...

                                 TESS
                        He wants to turn into light. That’s 
                        all he’s wanted since he got here. 

                                 HOLLY
                        But what do YOU want?

                                 TESS
                        I don’t know anymore! I spent my 
                        whole life caring about the past, 
                        never really valuing what was right 
                        in front of me.

                        And I spent most of my death doing 
                        the same thing- until I fell for 
                        new Adam...but I was still holding 
                        onto old Adam at the same time 
                        so... I’m a hypocrite. I’ve been 
                        distracting myself with old and new 
                        Adam and avoiding the fact that 
                        there doesn’t seem to be an old and 
                        new me- there’s just me...and who 
                        is that? 

                                 HOLLY
                        I think when you figure that out, 
                        you’ll know what to do.

                                 TESS
                        How do I figure that out?

                                 HOLLY
                        All I know is that spending time with 
                        Perry, watching him embrace this 
                        process with his own style- it 
                        inspired me. I started to do the 
                        steps that felt right to me. I was 
                        someone who always did what felt 
                        right in my gut when I was alive, 
                        even if it went against the grain. 
                        Even if society said I was wrong. I 
                        tried to teach my kids to live that 
                        way too. So if letting go of that 
                        life, letting go of my kids even, 
                        feels right to me I’m going to do it. 

                                 TESS
                        So when I saw you at breakfast-? 

                                 HOLLY
                        I was already doing the steps.

                                 TESS
                        Which is why your face looks 
                        amazing.

                                 HOLLY
                        I have to say it’s actually been 
                        sort of incredible. Heaven works, 
                        if you let it. 

                                 TESS
                        This is so crazy- I have so many 
                        questions- 

                                 HOLLY
                        Tess-
                                 TESS
                        Yeah.

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m turning into light.

                                 TESS
                        What?

                                 HOLLY
                        This game that we’re about to play 
                        is my light ceremony.

                                 TESS
                        What do you mean? You still have 
                        years and years left!

                                 HOLLY
                        I sped up my process. I was ready. 

           Tess starts to cry.

                                 TESS
                        But you’re all I have.

                                 HOLLY
                        That’s not true. And if you think 
                        about it, you actually got what you 
                        wanted. You found Adam and you 
                        spent a LOT of time with him.

                                 TESS
                        I guess... I’m glad I spent time 
                        with you- thank god I met you. You 
                        deserve to turn into light.

                                 HOLLY
                        So do you, if that’s what you want.

                                 TESS
                        Well I’m basically guaranteed to turn 
                        to Organic Matter at this point.

                                 HOLLY
                        Are you sure about that? 

                                 TESS
                        I stole a file, set a building on 
                        fire, rejected their whole system- 
                        yeah I think I’m toast.
                                 HOLLY
                        I don’t know, sounds like you’re 
                        describing the actions of someone 
                        pretty powerful. Someone who did 
                        all that in the name of love.

           Holly grabs Tess by the shoulders.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Repeat after me: I am not a botox 
                        zombie sheep.

                                 TESS
                        I am not a botox zombie sheep.

           Holly looks at her, smiling.

                                 HOLLY
                        I wish you could see what I see...
                        Okay grab a racquet and let’s go.

           Tess nods and grabs a racquet, really fighting tears now. 
           They position themselves to start playing.

                                 TESS
                        Holly?

                                 HOLLY
                        Yeah.

                                 TESS
                        I love you.

                                 HOLLY
                        I love you too.

                        And Holly?

                                 HOLLY
                        Yeah.

                                 TESS
                        You look smokin’ hot in that crop 
                        top.

                                 HOLLY
                           (smiling)
                        Thanks.

                                 TESS
                        Now serve, bitch.
           And they start to play. Tess lets out all her frustration on 
           the court until suddenly...Tess has beaten Holly. Neither of 
           them can believe it. But Holly smiles...

           And as they walk outside the court they are suddenly in...

           EXT. PARK FROM HOLLY’S LIFE - CONTINUOUS

           The park from Holly’s last day of life.

                                 HOLLY
                        This looks familiar...

           She sees her GIRLS run by giggling. Holly’s eyes fill with 
           tears of joy.

                                 TESS
                        Holly...

           Holly turns to Tess, starting to glow.

                                 HOLLY
                        I remember.
                        They’re beautiful, aren’t they?

           She takes a deep breath and steps into the street and 
           suddenly there is a loud WOOSH... Holly becomes light. 

           Tess closes her eyes letting the light wash over her.

           EXT. HEAVEN - DAWN

           When Tess walks out of Holly’s last step she sees that time 
           has once again jumped forward. It’s dawn and the sun is 
           coming up. She doesn’t have much time.

           She starts to run. She runs and runs through the grounds of 
           heaven, taking it all in until she...

           INT. RICHARD'S OFFICE - MORNING

           ...bursts through the door and sees Richard sitting behind 
           his desk.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t want to be cabinetry! 
                        I want to turn into light!

           Richard drops his head into his hands.
                                 RICHARD
                        No no you did the right thing with 
                        Adam.

                                 TESS
                        I know I did. But I want to turn 
                        into light. For me. What do I do?

                                 RICHARD
                        This is not how it works.

                                 TESS
                        Why not? Holly did it. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Holly was ready.

                                 TESS
                        Well, I’m ready. I’m ready now.

                                 RICHARD
                        Even if I believed that- it’s a 
                        process.

                                 TESS
                        Well my process has been different. 
                        But I know I want to face what’s in 
                        front of me and see what happens. 
                        Couldn’t I just speed up the steps 
                        like triple-time and-

                                 RICHARD
                        At this point you’d have to go 
                        directly to your final step and 
                        you’re not ready for that.

                                 TESS
                        How do you know?

                                 RICHARD
                        You’ve never even had ONE session 
                        with me in here.

                                 TESS
                        Fine...

           She sits down.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Let’s do it right now. Ask me 
                        anything you want. 

                                 RICHARD
                        If we do that, you’ll forget.
                                 TESS
                        I said I was ready.

           Richard leans back in his chair and considers this. He looks 
           at her for a long moment.

                                 RICHARD
                        Alright...what do you remember? What’s 
                        the clearest thing you have left?

           Tess closes her eyes.

                                 TESS
                        My father.

                                 RICHARD
                        And he died when you were...

                                 TESS
                        ...ten.

           Tess has a hazy FLASH of herself at ten years old...

                                 RICHARD
                        Tell me what you remember about that.

           Tess takes a moment.

                                 TESS
                        I remember...it happened very 
                        suddenly. 

                                 RICHARD
                        He had a heart attack.

                                 TESS
                        Yes, and my mother was destroyed... 
                        her reaction was to immediately give 
                        away everything he ever touched. 

           Richard gently guides her through the memory.

                                 RICHARD
                        But not everything right?

                                 TESS
                        Right... I was able to sneak into 
                        their room and save his watches- he 
                        kept all the watches he ever owned. 
                        And I took them and I hid them all 
                        under my bed. 

           Hazy FLASH TO Tess under the bed holding all the watches...
                                 RICHARD
                        And then what?

                                 TESS
                        And then my mother sent me to live 
                        with my aunt.

                                 RICHARD
                        Because...?

                                 TESS
                           (getting emotional)
                        Because she couldn’t... I was too 
                        much like him.

                                 RICHARD
                        So you were sent away because you 
                        reminded her of him. 

                                 TESS
                        She would come and visit every now 
                        and then but...she eventually 
                        remarried and had another child. 

                                 RICHARD
                        And how did that make you feel?

           CLOSE ON Tess as she opens her eyes...

                                 TESS
                        ...replaceable. 

           She looks down at her wrist.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        But I wore my dad’s watches for the 
                        rest of my life. 

           FLASH TO Tess’s wrists through the years wearing her dad’s 
           watches...

                                 RICHARD
                        And that helped?

                                 TESS
                        It made me feel connected to him 
                        somehow. Like he would know I was 
                        wearing them... but now being 
                        here...I know that’s not true.

                                 RICHARD
                        And that’s where your irrational 
                        attachment to objects began.
                                 TESS
                        I don’t think that’s irrational.

           FLASH TO Tess’s office, allll the objects...

                                 RICHARD
                        Do you have any doubt that your 
                        father adored you?

                                 TESS
                        No. He loved me.

                                 RICHARD
                        So did you actually need those 
                        watches?

                                 TESS
                        Maybe not but...they helped me 
                        remember that someone really loved 
                        me once.

           There is a tinge of sympathy in Richard’s eyes. 

           DING.

                                 RICHARD
                        How do you feel?

           Tess exhales.

                                 TESS
                           (tears in her eyes)
                        Lighter. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Come with me...

           EXT. HEAVEN - EVENING

           Richard stands across from Tess in a beautiful field lined 
           with beautiful trees.

                                 RICHARD
                        I want to be clear that I don’t 
                        know what kind of effect skipping 
                        to the final step will have. 

                                 TESS
                        I know the risk.
                                 RICHARD
                        When you go through to the other 
                        side of those trees, you will be in 
                        your final step. 

                                 TESS
                        What is my final step?

                                 RICHARD
                        We put you back into the moment 
                        your life ended. So you can 
                        experience it again as a lighter 
                        being and let it go. People find it 
                        to be the hardest step, which is 
                        why we save it for last. 

                                 TESS
                        And then what?

                                 RICHARD
                        Either you’ll turn into light or 
                        you won’t.

           Tess takes this in.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Or we might have created a glitch 
                        in the system with all of this and 
                        it will go completely haywire.

                                 TESS
                        Is Adam doing his final step right 
                        now too?

                                 RICHARD
                        ...yes he is. 

                                 TESS
                        Is he going to make it?

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s up to him.
                        Are you ready?

                                 TESS
                        Yes.

                                 RICHARD
                        Then just walk through those trees 
                        over there...

           Tess looks to the trees.
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Tess... your will is...impressive.

                                 TESS
                        What if it doesn’t work?

                                 RICHARD
                        Then I’m afraid your fate is to be 
                        organic matter. And if that’s the 
                        case... I’ll make sure you’re the 
                        classiest candlestick on earth.  

           She steels herself.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        For what it’s worth... I hope it 
                        does work.

                                 TESS
                        Oh reallllly? Guess you don’t 
                        dislike me that much.

                                 RICHARD
                        You reminded me why I fell in love 
                        with humanity. That’s how I’ll 
                        remember, I’ll just keep loving 
                        them. 

           She starts to go and then turns back.

                                 TESS
                        Richard? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes.

                                 TESS
                        Thank you.       

                                 RICHARD
                           (in his best mobster)
                        ...fuggedaboutit.

           Tess smiles as she turns towards the trees. Richard watches 
           her walk into them until he can no longer see her.

           EXT. FOREST OF TREES - CONTINUOUS

           As Tess carefully moves through the cover of trees, sunlight 
           shines through the leaves in flashes. Then she takes a step 
           and suddenly finds no ground beneath her.
           She is in the ocean, swimming under a nearly blinding sun. 
           She’s wearing the same bathing suit she did on the day she 
           died. And she’s wearing a snorkel mask.

           But the sun quickly begins to disappear behind clouds and the 
           sky begins to get dark. 

                                 TESS
                        What’s happening?

           A voice calls to her from the shore: 

                                 VOICE
                           (from a distance)
                        Tess!

           She looks up and there’s a figure on the shore waving for her 
           to come in but she can’t quite make him out...

           The sky gets darker and it starts to rain. Just then Tees 
           sees something bright, shining under the water. She puts her 
           mask on and dives down...

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Tess swims through rough water towards the shiny, ethereal 
           ring. It glints. It’s so beautiful, while everything else is 
           dark around her.

           Then she hears her muffled name being screamed again...this 
           time she decides to swim towards the voice instead...

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           She breaks through the surface coming up for air JUST in time 
           to see a crocodile approaching her. She looks to the shore 
           and starts to swim towards the figure as fast as she can. 

           The waves crash over her and rain is pouring down as she 
           swims with all her strength. 

           She finally runs through the shallow water until Adam’s arms 
           pull her out the final few feet and they fall onto the beach. 

           The crocodile is gone. The rain stops.

           Tess and Adam are lying on the beach, out of breath.

                                 ADAM
                        Mean girl...you’re here.
           Tess looks at his face, but doesn’t know him. It’s the 
           original Adam.

                                 TESS
                        How do you know that name? 

                                 ADAM
                        It’s me, Beauty Queen.

                                 TESS
                           (so happy)
                        Beauty queen! But you’re face is... 
                        different.

           She looks into his eyes- he’s scared.

                                 ADAM
                        It seems like I’ve been on this 
                        beach forever and I can’t seem to 
                        get off it. 

                                 TESS
                        But this can’t be your final step-
                        it’s my final step. Didn’t you die 
                        in a car accident?

                                 ADAM
                        I did...but this is where my life 
                        stopped.

           Thunder booms.

                                 TESS
                        Oh my god.

                                 ADAM
                        What’s happening? 

                                 TESS
                        Don’t worry. You’re gonna turn into 
                        light.

           Another boom.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Actually I don’t know if that’s 
                        true. I don’t know what’s gonna 
                        happen. But I’m so glad you’re here 
                        because I need to tell you 
                        something. I don’t care which Adam 
                        you are, which nose or which hands 
                        you have- I don’t have a final 
                        order. I don’t need one.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        I don’t need umbrellas, or 
                        retainers or rings...I’m just 
                        here...with you... right now.

           She kisses him. Deeply, passionately. This is a kiss to end 
           all kisses.

           When he opens his eyes and looks at her a wave of recognition 
           washes over his face. He starts crying.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Tess...

           A beautiful light starts to surround them. Tess knows their 
           time is running out. She sits up and gets on one knee. 

                                 TESS
                        Adam...beauty queen...will you 
                        marry me?

                                 ADAM
                        YES.

           They begin to stare into each other’s eyes. The light starts 
           to grow and surround them.

                                 TESS
                        I love you. 

           The light is now all encompassing and warm and beautiful and 
           blinding...

           For a moment it flashes so bright we can’t see either of 
           them.

           Then, as the light clears, we see the “engagement ring” roll 
           up onto the shore....

           ...right in front of Tess, who is lying there alone on the 
           beach with her eyes shut.

           She opens her eyes. No Adam. But she’s still there. She’s not 
           a cabinet. She looks up at the sky, at the beautiful light 
           she feels on her skin...and smiles.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. LAX - MORNING

           A TERRIFIED WOMAN blinks her eyes.

                                 WOMAN
                        What’s happening? Where am I?
           The woman turns around and sees Tess, holding a clipboard.

                                 TESS
                        Welcome to heaven. Everything is 
                        going to be okay.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m dead?

           Richard pops up.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes! Isn’t it wonderful?
                        I’m Richard, the head of processing 
                        and this is my protégé, Tess.

                                 TESS
                           (proudly)
                        I updated the system. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Updated the what? What the fuck is 
                        going on?

                                 RICHARD
                        Tess took Tony’s place. He got 
                        moved to another department.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who the fuck is Tony?

                                 RICHARD
                        The point is that you’re in good 
                        hands. Tess is great with humans.

           Tess steps in front of Richard and takes the woman’s hand.

                                 TESS
                        You’ve been through a lot. And I’m 
                        going to be here with you to help 
                        you understand every step of the 
                        way.

                                 WOMAN
                        Is my husband here?

                                 TESS
                        Yes, he’s been waiting for you.

                                 WOMAN
                           (overcome with joy)
                        Ohhh Harold! 
           She takes the woman by the shoulders and looks at her 
           reflection with her.

                                 TESS
                        That’s right. You get to see 
                        Harold. You’ll see plenty of him. 
                        But first, I want you to take a 
                        good look at yourself. 

           They both look at themselves.

                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Take your time. 

           EXT. BEACH IN HEAVEN - DAY

           Tess sits on the beach with a stack of files beside her. She 
           takes out a sheet of paper and begins to write...

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        Here’s what I know: someone in my 
                        past mattered a lot to me. We had a 
                        beautiful, irreplaceable 
                        relationship that was one in a 
                        million. Sometimes I write that 
                        person a note. 

           A cloud parts and the sun shines down on the paper she writes 
           on, bright and warm and perfect. As she breathes it in-

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        “My dear you”, I start it.

           SMASH TO WHITE
