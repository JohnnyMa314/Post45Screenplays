           The uplifting “BIRDIES” THEME. A catchy pop anthem.

                        YOU MAY NOT HAVE OUR EYES! 
                        YOU MAY NOT HAVE OUR SMILE! 
                        BUT YOU HAVE OUR HEART! 
                        YOU HAVE OUR HEART!

                                 CUT TO:

           MAMA BIRD (30s), Instagram chic and style for days. Flowy 
           white things draped on her body. Countered and highlighted to 
           precision. She vibrates with loving kindness. A good mother.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Hi Bird Watchers! Welcome to our 
                        channel! I’m Mama Bird! 

           WHIP PAN TO REVEAL -- PAPA BIRD (40s). Kind eyes, and 
           chiseled features. A good father.

                                 PAPA BIRD
               (Swedish accent)
                        I’m Papa Bird! 

           They stand back-to-back, arms folded.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        And these are our Birdies. 

                                 CUT TO:

           THEIR FIVE ADOPTED CHILDREN -- all different ethnicities. 

           The Birdie Family poses before a SLEEK MANSION, dressed in 
           matching autumnal J-Crew earth tones. The boys have spiky 
           hair like DAD. The girls have baby bangs like MOM.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        If you think our hands are full, 
                        you should see our hearts!

           They all hug on the lawn. They love each other so much. 

                                 CUT TO:

           VARIOUS SHOTS. The Birdies take us on a tour of their 
           mansion. The kids have giant rooms filled with toys and video 
           games and everything a child could ever want.
                                 THE BIRDIES
               (singing)
                        We’re the Birdie family, we are a 
                        gift from God! But we’re not just a 
                        family, we are a Birdie SQUAD!

                                 CUT TO:

           The Birdie Family is dancing around a ten foot tall BIRDCAGE 
           in the backyard. An indulgent prop. They perform an elaborate 
           dance that involves flapping their wings...

                                 THE BIRDIES (CONT’D)
                        We’ll flap our wings and we will fly 
                        into the bright blue birdie sky!

           GZZTTT!!! The video GLITCHES and makes us jump.  

           A pixel dies and deforms their little faces. A jarring video 
           hiccup. Finally, the video resumes in fast motion, and then 
           catches up with itself. WE SLOWLY WIDEN TO REVEAL --

           A CRACKED TABLET SCREEN THAT PLAYS THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO.

           We’re in a DARK ROOM. Pitch black, but for the warm glow of 
           THE VIDEO lighting up TABITHA’S face, and reflecting in her 
           big brown eyes. She’s 13-year-old. The barrage of garish 
           colors highlighting another acne outbreak. Transfixed by the 
           screen. It reflects in her dilated pupils.

                                 TABITHA
               (sighs)
                        ...Squad goals.

           She has a fragile whisper of a voice.

           ON THE SCREEN: 

              SUPER SECRET SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT!!!

           Tabitha’s eyes light-up. She clicks it. 

           Mama and her Birdies are gathered around the hearth.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Are you one of the half million 
                        children currently in the foster 
                        care system looking for the love 
                        and security that only a forever 
                        family can provide? 

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Then today’s video is for you.
                                 TABITHA
                        Ohmygod.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Drum roll please--

           THE SMILING BIRDIES drum on their pants. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        The Birdie Family is proud to 
                        announce, in association with the 
                        Department of Child and Family 
                        Services, the first annual--

           Suddenly -- THE VIDEO ABRUPTLY CUTS TO AN AD FOR BEST BUY. 
           Showing off a hoard of brand new iPads and iPhones.

                                 TABITHA
                        Crap... C’mon, c’mon!

           Her leg bounces as she waits the mandatory five seconds, and 
           then hits -- SKIP AD.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                         --”OPEN NEST CHALLENGE!”

           Tabitha leans in, until she’s face to face with Mama Bird.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        The most frequent comment we 
                        receive in our comments section is 
                        “I wish I was a Birdie.” Well, that 
                        dream will become a reality for one 
                        very lucky foster child. 

                                 TABITHA
                        What?

           She drops the tablet, gasps, snaps it back up -- eyes peeled. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Since our eldest Birdie, 
                        Nightingale, has left our adopted 
                        nest to pursue her dream of living 
                        “off the Grid” in the Alaskan 
                        Wilderness last month--

           QUICK CUT TO: A short video of NIGHTINGALE (18), a spritely 
           young lady with soulful eyes, and a kind smile, waving at the 
           camera from shore. No make-up, dressed in flannel with a 
           rucksack. The soaring white Denali Mountains behind her. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        This is Nightingale, singing off!

           Nightingale turns the camera off.
           GZT! The video GLITCHES again. Tabitha gives it a hard whack. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        --We once again have the time and 
                        resources necessary to dedicate to 
                        a placement in need..

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        That’s right, we’re opening our 
                        doors! A new Birdie will soon be 
                        coming home to roost. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Ohmygodohmy--

           A HUSKY VOICE outside Tabitha’s door --

                                 MISS KETCHUM (O.S.)
                        Tabitha?!!

           Tabitha gasps. Quickly locks the door. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        To raise awareness for World 
                        Adoption Day, we’ll be welcoming 
                        YOU, one our very loyal Birders, 
                        into our adopted nest! 

                                 THE BIRDIES
                        From Birder to Birdie!

           Tabitha covers her mouth in disbelief. 

                                 MISS KETCHUM (O.S.)
                        Tabitha?! Where are you?! You 
                        didn’t do your chore!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        We hope this will inspire our vast 
                        network of Birders who are 
                        considering becoming adoptive 
                        parents to do the same.  

           The video WHIP PANS to LARK (12), a Latinx Girl with a cute 
           speech impediment. She has spinal bifida and crutches.

           --The video is interrupted by AN AD FOR GRAMMARLY! “Great

           Tabitha groans.

                        Are you in the closet again?!

           The doorknob jiggles. Harder. KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! 

                                 MISS KETCHUM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT LOCKED DOORS?!

           Tabitha presses SKIP AD. The video resumes-- 

                                 LARK
                        --Upload your personal foster care

           ON SCREEN: FINCH (6), white, convulsing with Ritalin vibes.

                        How’d you end up in the system?! 
                        What are your hopes and 
                        dreeeeeams?!

                                 MISS KETCHUM (O.S.)
                        Tabitha!

           DOVE and HAWK (12) Cambodian twins. 

                                 HAWK

           Last is BUSTARD (11). A middle eastern boy with a slight 
           accent. He seems sad, not like the others. Trying his best.

                                 BUSTARD
                        Will you be the lucky bird? 

           --WHAM! WHAM! Miss Ketchum is pounding. The door bowing. 

                                 MISS KETCHUM (O.S.)
                        I’m not going to tell you again!

           Hemming and hawing and the JIGGLING OF A KEYRING. Tabitha 
           looks back at the SCREEN:

                                 THE BIRDIES
                        --SO YOU CAN BE A PART OF OUR 
                        AWESOME FAMILY!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        And now for the most important part--

           CLICK! -- THE CLOSET DOOR UNLOCKS!

           Tabitha quickly rips her headphones out and just as she 
           stuffs the tablet under a pile of clothes--

           WOOOSHH! The closet door flies open and the bright light of 
           morning spills in and stings her eyes. MISS KETCHUM (50) 
           looms above her. She’s a heavy woman with two bad hips, her 
           bloodshot eyes dancing with rage.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        Out. Now!

           Miss Ketchum grabs Tabitha by the hand, and pulls her into-- 

           THE BEDROOM.

           It’s tidy, but cramped. A lot of kids have come through these 
           doors, and you can tell. Wilting wallpaper, stained carpets. 
           Three sets of bunkbeds. No decorations. FOSTER KIDS yelling 
           in the HALLWAY. It’s a zoo.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        You were in there all night again 
                        weren’t you?! Watching those birds!

                                 TABITHA
                        ...No.

           KATIE (8) and NATE (10) sprint down the hallway. 

                                 KATIE
                        The Birdies are gonna adopt a kid!
                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        No running!
               (to Tabitha)
                        Alright, where’s the doo-dad?!

           Miss Ketchum goes on a hunt, spots the tablet sticking out 
           from under the clothes. She snatches it. Ah-ha!

                                 TABITHA
                        No! I need it to make my submission 
                        for the Birdies!

           She grabs after the tablet, but Miss Ketchum pulls it away. 
           Desperation pops out Tabitha’s eyes. It’s her lifeline.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        No screens for a week. Not until you 
                        learn how to use it responsibly!

           Tabitha is grabbing for it, and Miss Ketchum keeps it away.

                                 TABITHA
                        Give it to me! It’s mine!

           She turns rabid, grabs after it. A tug of war ensues. The 
           tablet slips from her grip, and flies across the room, 
           crashing against the bureau. Tabitha MOANS. Drops to her 
           knees before it. Another deep crack. Half the screen is just 
           dark blue streaks of color. 

           Tabitha stares at the broken screen. Sees her sad reflection. 
           MISS KETCHUM RIPS IT OUT OF HER HANDS. 

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        It’s like an extra limb with you.

           Suddenly, Tabitha jumps to her feet, pushes past Miss 
           Ketchum, and bolts out the door...

                                 MISS KETCHUM (CONT’D)
                        No running!

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Tabitha barrels down the hallway towards AN OFFICE where Nate 
           and Katie have joined TREVOR (15) and BOOTSIE (6), the 
           youngest, cute level: nuclear. They sit at a crusty PC. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (ON SCREEN)
                        ...And don’t forget the most 
                        important part. Make sure you end 
                        your video by singing your very 
                        favorite song.

           A title SMASHES IN: THE CLOCK STARTS NOW! 

           As the fosters CHEER, Tabitha dashes away.
           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           A panicked Tabitha pedals her bike like she’s being chased by 
           a rabid beast. Maneuvers through heavy honking traffic.

           EXT. BEST BUY - DAY

           Tabitha reaches the entrance. She wipes the sweat, pulls 
           herself together. 

           INT. BEST BUY - DAY

           Tabitha hurries past buzzing electronics to the Mac section. 
           She finds the iPad display. She picks one up and logs into 
           YOUTUBE. Clicks the RECORD ICON. Suddenly nervous. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Hi, Birdies! I’m Tabitha! I’m 
                        thirteen! And this is my submission 
                        for the open nest challenge. I’m 
                        basically your biggest fan in the 
                        whole world. I know a lot of people 
                        are gonna say that, but I actually 
                        am. Whenever I’m sad and scared I 
                        watch your videos so I watch them 
                        all the time pretty much.

           The high-strung, mustached MANAGER eyes her like a hawk.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        I been watching your channel since 
                        I was a small kid. And you’re the 
                        perfect family, even though you’re 
                        all different, you’re the same, cuz 
                        of how much you love each other, 
                        and that’s all that matters, and 
                        that’s all I ever wanted. I’ve been 
                        in the system my whole life and I 
                        never fit in. I’ve lived in ten 
                        different placements, and your 
                        channel is the only thing that got 
                        me through. All I want is a forever 
                        home, and they’re just gonna keep 
                        moving me and moving me until I age 
                        out. I’m thirteen now, and it’s ten 
                        times harder for teens to get 
                        adopted. I know I’m not very pretty 
                        like all of you, but I think I’m 
                        Birdie material deep down. If you 
                        could just please find it in your 
                        heart to give me a chance... you 
                        won’t regret it...
               (chokes up)
                        Mama Bird... even though we never 
                        met, you’ve already been more of a 
                        mom to me than anybody.
           She wipes the tears on her sleeve. She looks back at Manager 
           who disappears into the stock room. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and my favorite song... is the 
                        Birdie Theme Song..

           She closes her eyes. Like she’s channeling something. Opens 
           her eyes. And SINGS the Birdies theme... Softly at first, 
           fragilely. A beautiful whisper... 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        You may not have our eyes... 
                        You may not have our smile...
                        But you have our heart...
                        You have our heart...

           She sings a little louder. Her voice is a smooth whispery 
           wooze. Delicate, like Billie Eilish on Ambien.    

           The OLD LADY down the aisle smiles stupidly at her. Lulled 
           into a trance by the song. SHOPPERS gather. Drawn. Under her 
           spell. A LOVING FAMILY, shopping for TVs. Stops and listens.

           EMPLOYEES exchange looks. Cell phones rise and take aim. She 
           sings a little louder.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
               (sings)
                        We’re the Birdie family! We are a 
                        gift from God! But we’re not just a 
                        family, we are a Birdie Squad! We’ll 
                        flap our wings and we will fly into 
                        the bright blue birdie sky!

           The Geek Squad swoons.

                                 GEEK #1
                        Beautiful.

           The Manager comes out of the STOCK ROOM. Sees the commotion. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Oh hell no. Hey! Hey you!

                                 TABITHA
               (quickly)
                        If you’re not already subscribed to 
                        our channel, make sure you RING 
                        THAT BELL and turn on our post 
                        notifications! And please let me be 
                        a part of your amazing family! I 
                        love you Mama Bird!

           He starts jogging over. Tabitha thinks fast. Looks down at 
           her face on the video screen. Smiles.
           SHE RIPS THE IPAD OFF ITS CHAIN AND RUNS! Shoppers GASP. 

                                 MANAGER
                        HEY! HEY! SECURITY!

           Tabitha blasts down the aisle, hugging the iPad, as 
           overweight SECURITY GUARDS chase after her.

           She hits UPLOAD on the iPad. THE PROGRESS BAR BEGINS -- 3% 

           A GUARD JUMPS OUT OF NOWHERE -- snatches after her. She  
           ducks under the Geek Squad table, and doubles back the other 
           way, throws the rolling step ladder in their path. 

           Tabitha loses her balance, and crashes into a display of 
           robot vacuum cleaners. A few of them turn on, and scatter 
           like mice. She checks the iPad -- 24%

           A Guard snatches at her, but she fakes him out, and darts 
           into the Magnolia HOME THEATER DISPLAY ROOM.

           70% -- Her eyes are bugging out of her head.  

                                 TABITHA
                        Hurry. Hurry!

           She ducks behind the plush leather sofa. A JAMES BOND movie  
           explodes in the background. Bullets flying. 

           93% -- The Guards spot her, and come running. She shakes the 
           iPad, but it doesn’t help.

           96% -- And as they bare down, A RED “X” cuts through the 
           progress bar. 

                  *upload failed* ERROR

           Tabitha’s world falls apart. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        NO!!!!

           The Manager comes out of nowhere and rips the iPad out of 
           Tabitha’s hands, and she collapses on the floor, destroyed. 
           The Guards have to pull her out of there, bucking and kicking 
           and screaming and slapping!!! 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        LET GO OF ME!!!!!!

           EXT. BEST BUY - AFTERNOON

           Tabitha sits in the back on the police cruiser, parked in the 
           driveway. COPS are talking to MISS KETCHUM outside of the 
           store.
           Tabitha glances at the mounted police computer up front, and 
           this triggers a -- 

           MEMORY FLASH: Baby Tabitha is three-years-old, sitting in the 
           back of a cop car. Screaming tears as blues and reds flash. 

           A DEAD BODY carried out of an old house on a stretcher.

           Tabitha sees a GLOWING COMPUTER SCREEN behind the bullet 
           proof barrier. She stops crying instantly. Slaps at the 
           glass. The wants that screen.

                                 BABY TABITHA
                        Birdie. Birdie. Birdie.

                                BACK TO:

           Tabitha takes her fidget spinner out of her pocket and starts 
           playing with it, mindlessly. Pushing away the thoughts.

           INT. MISS KETCHUM’S VAN - AFTERNOON

           A livid Miss Ketchum drives Tabitha home in the rusty, 
           sputtery van. Biting at her lip, muttering to herself. Tabitha 
           stares out the window, watching the world pass her by.  

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        Listen to me, there’s something we 
                        have to tal-- 

                                 TABITHA
                        --I’m going to another placement. 

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        I talked to Mrs. Bollinger. We’re 
                        gonna try and set you up someplace 
                        nice. Someplace you’ll... fit in a 
                        little better.

                                 TABITHA
                        How about Neptune.

           Tabitha just stares ahead, playing with a fidget spinner.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        We’ll make it as easy transition.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Microwavable dinners. Miss Ketchum sits at the head of the 
           table, riveted by People Magazine. The five foster kids stare 
           at screens. Tabitha, screenless, stares at her plate.

                                 BOOTSIE
                        My video already has 650 views!
                                 NATE
                        So? Mine has 723. And 57 Likes.

                                 BOOTSIE
                        Yeah, but you posted yours first. 
                        Oh! I just got another Like! And 
                        another one! I got two Likes!

           Tabitha watches all this from across the table, just a fly on 
           the wall, eavesdropping on the flurry of conversation. 
           Tablets and phones are passed around like dishes of food.

                                 NATE
                        That Pakistani girl with one arm 
                        got 100 Likes already.

                                 TREVOR
                        I bet she’d have 200 Likes if she 
                        had no arms.

                                 BOOTSIE
               (pouts)
                        I wish I had no arms.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        Enough! I’ve had it with the damn 
                        birds. It’s all a racket anyhow, 
                        parading their kids around on the 
                        net, and living off the proceeds.
                        They should be thrown in jail.

                                 NATE
                        No! The Birdies get to keep the 
                        money they make from their channels! 
                        Right, Tabitha?

                                 TABITHA
                        All their money goes into a trust 
                        until they turn eighteen. 

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        Then how do they afford that house?

                                 KATIE
                        Her make-up tutorials! Duh! Tell 
                        her, Tabitha!

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama Bird brings in thirty grand a 
                        week in ad sense alone, and that’s 
                        before promotions and sponsorships.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        ...for putting on make-up?
                                 TABITHA
                        YouTube is good! It gives the 
                        Birdies a chance in this life! 
                        Unlike us! We’re gonna age out and 
                        die alone with everything we own in 
                        a garbage bag!  

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        Well, someone drank the kool aid.

                                 BOOTSIE
                        There’s kool aid?

                                 KATIE
                        Oh my GOD! I just got a like from 
                        Mama Bird herself! Look!

           GASPS. The kids gather around the tablet. Tabitha is on the 
           outside, trying to weasel in to see.

                                 TREVOR
                        Did she leave a comment? Or just a 
                        like? She left a comment on One 
                        Arm’s page. See? 

                                 BOOTSIE
                        It’s her. See the blue check.

                                 KATIE
                        She loves me, I’m gonna win! 

                                 NATE
                        Tabitha only got one view.
                        From the District Attorney. 

           THEY LAUGH AT TABITHA! Bootsie doesn’t get it, so she laughs 
           loudest. Tabitha bolts out of the room, runs up the stairs.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        NO RUNNING!

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Blue moonlight punches through the blinds. A chorus of 
           snoring children, packed into bunkbeds. Tabitha is on the top 
           bunk, wide awake, staring at the cracks in the ceiling. Like 
           a giant, dead tablet screen. 

           INT. MISS KETCHUM’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Tabitha sits before the humming old dinosaur of a computer. 
           Clicks on the Birdie home page. She scans the BIRDIE 
           CHANNELS. Each with a THUMBNAIL IMAGE of the smiling Birdie:

           IN THE VIDEO: THE BEAUTY ROOM. All the make-up in the world. 
           The backdrop is sparkly and pink. Mama does Nightingale’s 
           make-up, applying eye shadow with the precision of a surgeon. 
           She’s a far cry from the crunchy, flanneled girl in Alaska.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        My beautiful Nightingale, is 
                        glamming out hard today with a Mama 
                        Bird Special! This was one of our 
                        most requested videos. Nothing 
                        makes me happier than doing make-up 
                        for someone I love. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        Remember, Birders, you are 
                        beautiful whether you choose to 
                        wear makeup or not. Don’t feel 
                        pressured to wear it just because 
                        we do. You do you, boo. 

           Mama Bird dips her brush in the pallet and gets to work. 
           Doing her make-up with love.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I like to say “Make-up doesn’t hide 
                        who you are, it highlights it.”  

           Tabitha peels away from the screen, and looks in the mirror. 

           Gazing at her acne covered face. Another outbreak. She sighs.

                                 CUT TO:

           Tabitha is asleep at the keyboard, her face sending a hundred 
           “Zs” into the Google search bar.

           INT. BEST BUY - NIGHT

           It’s late, and they are closing up shop. The GEEK SQUAD 
           employee from before is watching Tabitha’s recording on the 
           iPad. It makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up. A 
           dopey smile creeps across his face. It’s so beautiful. 

           He makes sure no one is looking, and hits UPLOAD.
           EXT. MISS KETCHUM'S HOUSE - DAWN

           A few days later. The lawn is littered with plastic toys. A 
           sun blenched Fisher Price graveyard.  

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Desperate, Tabitha pounds on the bathroom door. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Are you almost done, I have to pee!

           We hear THE BIRDIES THEME playing muffled inside.

                                 KATIE (O.S.)
                        Use the boy’s!

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Tabitha runs to the boy’s bathroom, doing the pee pee dance. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Hurry up! 

                                 NATE (O.S.)
                        I’m in here!

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Tabitha pees in the bushes. A bird CHIRPS. Staring at her 
           from its perch in the tree. The bird files away.

                                 BOOTSIE (O.S.)
                        Tabitha!

           She looks up and sees Bootsie hanging out the window, waving. 
           Squats down lower into the bushes.

                                 TABITHA
                        Can I have some privacy please?!

                                 BOOTSIE
                        You went viral!

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Tabitha and the foster kids are gathered around the laptop. 
           Trevor hits play and watch -- 

           Tabitha’s adoption plea, singing at Best Buy, stealing the 
           iPad. Running from the guards. It has 1,287,8476 views.

                                 NATE
                        Holy shit.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        ...language... 
           Tabitha takes out her fidget spinner and starts playing with 
           it, nervously.

                                 BOOTSIE
                        Is that really you singing?

                                 TABITHA
                        ...Yes.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re pretty good.

           She smiles. But not for long -- DING DONG! DING DONG! They 
           exchange looks.

                                 BOOTSIE
                        Who’s that?!

                                 TABITHA
                        Am I in trouble?

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        Probably!

           Miss Ketchum slaps the laptop shut, silencing the song. 
           Starts mindlessly cleaning up the clutter. But it’s no use, 
           so she gives up. DING DONG! DING DONG!

                                 MISS KETCHUM (CONT’D)
                        Hold your horses!
               (to the kids)
                        Alright, upstairs.

           They all hesitate. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! The kids bound upstairs 
           and gather at the landing.

           Miss Ketchum grabs her cane, and waddles down the hallway. 
           The kids grip the landing bannisters like baby prisoners, 
           trying to get a look at the obscured visitors. They see 
           movement at the door and hear Miss Ketchum hurling muffled 
           questions and insults. 

           FAMILIAR VOICES in the foyer.

                                 LARK (O.S.)
                        Hi, everybody! Welcome back to our 
                        channel! 

           The foster kids are shocked.

                                 TREVOR
                        Holy--

           They all sprint down the stairs to find --
           THE BIRDIE FAMILY FANNED OUT IN THE FOYER! They’re dressed in 
           similar clothes. Papa Bird holds the camera on a selfie 
           stick, capturing everything. Always. 

                                 TREVOR (CONT’D)
                        It’s really them. 

                                 BOOTSIE
                        They’re with the social worker!

           MRS. BOLLINGER, a severe looking social worker, behind them.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        What is this?

                                 LARK
                        We’re at an undisclosed location in 
                        the Golden State of California 
                        where we will introduce our Bird 
                        Watchers to the newest member of 
                        the Birdie Bunch! 

           Everyone is stunned. Miss Ketchum starts puffing up her hair 
           in the mirror. The camera making her nervous.

                                 TABITHA
                        ...what?

                                 TREVOR
                        The Birdies are in our living room.

           Bustard jumps into the frame, flapping his arms like wings.

           They turn to see -- MAMA BIRD! 

           Glowing, and trailed by an aura of motherliness. As she 
           enters, the room lights up somehow. 

                                 KATIE

                        It’s really you...

           Papa WHIPS the camera to capture Tabitha’s priceless 
           reaction. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Come here, kiddo. 

           Mama Bird opens her arms for a hug. Uncut joy breaks across 
           Tabitha’s face, as she winds up and runs at Mama Bird, 
           crashing into her arms for a deep and loving embrace. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        The moment I saw you, I knew I was 
                        yours. And you were mine. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Me?!

                                 KATIE
                        Her?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’ve won the open nest challenge!

           Tabitha nearly faints. Frozen in shock. Jaws drop all around. 

                                 NATE
                        Oh, wow!

           Mama touches Tabitha’s face, gently.

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama Bird...

                        Baby Bird. 

           Tabitha is at a loss for words. Choking up. The Birdies watch 
           keenly. Exchange looks. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        How’d you like to join our family?

           Papa lowers the camera. A spell is broken. The plastic smiles 
           fall from the Birdies’ faces. Mama’s eyes pop with anger.

              FINCH

                        Don’t touch that please.

                        Filming is allowed. We have special

                        ...Who?

                                 MRS. BOLLINGER
                        Judge Simmons. The Birdies are 
                        doing a great service. Adoption 
                        rates have skyrocketed since they 
                        started their channel. Do you 
                        watch, Jeanie?

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        No, Bollinger, I don’t.

                                 MRS. BOLLINGER
                        I’m a birder myself. 

           Mrs. Bollinger takes out an envelope and hands it to Miss 
           Ketchum who seems sad and small now.

                                 MRS. BOLLINGER (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the paperwork. Isn’t this 
                        wonderful? It’s so rare for a child 
                        in the system to find a happy 
                        ending, especially the older ones. 

           Papa starts filming again as Mama kneels down before Tabitha 
           and takes her hands. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Time to spread your wings and fly.

           She leans in and WHISPERS into Tabitha’s ear.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        You can cry now if you want to. 
                        They’ll love it.

           This permission breaks the logjam in her heart. Tabitha 
           bursts into tears. Horrible and happy. Everything she’s been 
           holding in for so long. Joy and rage and love.

                        This is the best day of my life.
                                 PAPA BIRD
                        The day ain’t over yet!!!

           INT. JAGUAR SUV - DAY

           Mama at the helm of the luxury vehicle, sipping her latte 
           through a metal straw. Papa twisting around in the front, 
           filming everything -- All the time -- No matter what, as 
           Tabitha, in the back by the window, rattles off her fangirl 
           love, like machine-gun fire. 

                                 TABITHA
                        --And, oh man, the sibling prank 
                        war videos are friggin’ hilarious! 
                        The time you put the green food 
                        coloring in Hawk’s toothbrush and 
                        turned his mouth green. That was so 
                        funny I literally almost peed.

                                 DOVE
                        Thanks. The trick is to be funny 
                        without being mean spirited. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I love your shopping hauls, Lark. 
                        And Finch’s toy reviews, too! And I 
                        even love Bustard’s gaming channel, 
                        even though I’m not a gamer--

                                 LARK
                        Hey... Where is Bustard?

           Mama Bird looks back. Her eyes bug out of her head. 

           Bustard is not in the car. She slams on the brakes, the KIDS 
           LURCH FORWARD.

           INT. MISS KETCHUM’S HOUSE - DAY

           The foster kids walk to the living room. They turn to see -- 

           Bustard hiding behind the couch. Peeking over, nervously. 
           They exchange looks. Miss Ketchum enters, punches her hips.

                                 MISS KETCHUM
                        What in the--

           DING DONG! The DOORBELL RINGS.

                                 CUT TO:

           Bootsie answers the door. It’s Mama. She smiles.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Where is that silly goose?

           Bustard shudders. 
           EXT. HIGHWAY - VARIOUS - DAY

           Driving fast. A blur of trees, pastures, and grazing cows. 

           Mama watches Bustard in the rearview. Tabitha smiles at him, 
           and hands him her fidget spinner. He takes it and plays with 
           it, and for the first time -- we see him crack a smile.

           DING! DING! DING! The entire family looks down at their Apple 
           watches to check their new notification. They all exchange 
           worried looks. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        We dipped again.

           A thick silence hangs over the car.

                                 CUT TO:

           LATER.

           Heavy honking traffic. A CATCHY POP riff plays. The Birdies 
           sway in their seats, and moving in unison as they sing. Papa 
           films. Tabitha beams.

                                 THE BIRDIES
                        A new Birdie’s coming home to nest! 
                        Our favorite Bird who we love best!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Take the solo, Tabitha--

                                 TABITHA
                        Our Birdie family’s a gift from 
                        God! We’re not just a family, we’re 
                        a squad--

           The hair on the back of Mama’s neck stands up. Pupils dilate. 
           Gooseflesh spreads down her arm. She shivers.

                                 HAWK
                        She sorta sounds like Nightingale.

                                 TABITHA
                        That’s where I learned to sing. 
                        Watching her.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Don’t stop, Tabitha. 

           Tabitha nods, and keeps singing --

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           The shiny SUV turns off on to an endless stretch of dirt 
           road. Thick forest squeezes it like a vice. 
                                 TABITHA (O.S.)
                        You may not have our skin! You may 
                        not have our hair! But you have our 
                        heart! You have our heart!

           Pop jumps out, and unlocks a rusty GATE that leads to an even 
           dirtier dirt road. Posted signs everywhere.

                  “PRIVATE PROPERTY.”

           INT. SUV - THE BIRDIE ESTATE - DAY

           They reach the end of the road and come to a stop before a 
           formidable wrought iron fence. An ornamental bird nest sits 
           on top of the gate. 

           Beyond the fence, up on a hill -- THE BIRDIE MANSION. A 
           sprawling Palladian-style estate, lit up magnificently. 

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s even bigger in real life.

           Papa presses a button, and the gates swing open, 
           dramatically. Tabitha takes in the new world as they pull up 
           to the house. The lawn is covered with toys and games. A 
           bouncy castle on the lawn. An infinity pool in the backyard. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Wow.

           Dove is sound asleep on Hawk’s shoulder. So he turns to  
           Papa’s lens, and puts a shooshing finger to his lips. 

                                 HAWK
               (whispers)
                        Sibling Prank War Initiated. 

           Hawk SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER right into Dove’s ear, jolting her 
           awake. She smacks her head against the window. Everyone 
           bursts out laughing, Mama clapping, and Tabitha loves it the 
           most, convulsing with laughter. 

                                 HAWK (CONT’D)
                        Hashtag Sibling Prank War!!!

                                 DOVE
                        Hey, Hawk. Guess what? You were 
                        adopted. 

           They all laugh. Papa gets it all on camera. The gates SMASH 
           CLOSED behind them. 

           EXT. THE BIRDIE ESTATE - DAY

           A SIGN HANGS OVER THE HOUSE -- WELCOME HOME, TABITHA!!!
           The kids hop out of the car, and jump around. Papa Bird is 
           always filming, like the camera is an extension of himself. 
           Mama takes Tabitha’s hand. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        It’s good to be home, isn’t it?

                                 TABITHA
                        This is the greatest thing ever.

           She smiles warmly, and touches her cheek. Tabitha shudders at 
           her loving touch. Hope flutters in her big brown eyes.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Go on in and get yourself settled.

                                 TABITHA
                        Okay, mama. Is it okay that I call 
                        you that?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I wouldn’t have it any other way.

                                 LARK
                        Rotten Egg challenge! Last one in 
                        has the least views! 

           They all run inside screaming with glee. Bustard is the last 
           one in, as usual. He kicks the ground. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Coming, my love?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Yes, yes. I’ll be right there.

           Papa goes inside. Mama just sits on the stoop. Stares at the 
           fiery sun, at the little fluttering birds. Mindlessly picking 
           the raw skin around her fingernails. 

                                 PAPA BIRD (O.S.)
                        Everything okay? 

           Papa levels the camera at her. She hides her hands.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Perfect.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Are you sure, love bird?

           He touches her gently, she recoils as if from a hot flame. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I just need a minute. Don’t miss 
                        her reaction shots please.
                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Jag älskar dig!

           He blows her a kiss, and films his way back into the house. 

           INT. BIRDIE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Tabitha enters, awe-stuck. Takes it all in. Papa Bird filming 
           her reactions. The house is big. Antiseptic luxury. The very 
           opposite of Miss Ketchum’s house. Looming over everything are 
           electronic leaderboards in the living room, above the 
           fireplace. 

                VIEW TOTALS: 12,574,756,7565

                 SUBSCRIBERS: 7,185,7657

           Ticktickticktickticktick-- The subs and views are plummeting. 
           Losing thousands at a time. 

           Underneath the leaderboard, there’s a mysterious RED BUTTON. 
           There’s a sign above it that reads: “THE FULL BIRD” 

           A photo of NIGHTINGALE hangs in a frame above a shrine. Webby 
           Awards. Shorty Award. Gold Status Creator Award. 

           So many PET BIRDS in elaborate cages peppered throughout the 
           house. Cockatiels, cockatoos, lovebirds, Budgerigars. A 
           constant barrage of tweets, chirps, and squawks.

           A YELLOW CANARY flies around the living room. 

           A GIANT ABSTRACT MURAL of the YouTube logo covers a wall. 
           Tabitha notices keno lights and bounces hanging from rafters 
           built into the ceiling. More like a film set than a home. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        Tell the Birders what you’re 
                        thinking right now!

           They all turn to Mama Bird, who is looming in the doorway. 
           Backlit against the setting sun. Papa sticks the camera in 
           Tabitha’s face and goes Dutch. 

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s like I’m living inside of 
                        YouTube!

           The all laugh. Papa Bird whips the camera around showing off 
           the space as he walks with Tabitha. They pass a wall-sized 
           aquarium filled with multi-colored tropical fish.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        That’s where Hawk took his first 
                        steps by the aquarium. That’s where 
                        Lark did her Back to School skit...
           As she moves through the house, Papa films. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Mama’s kitchen. Super Nacho Time! 
                        The floor is lava challenge, the 
                        mystery wheel of soda. And that’s 
                        where Hawk and Dove’s epic sibling 
                        prank war started when Hawk put the 
                        bird doo in Dove’s shoe, which is 
                        an all time Birdie classic.

           Suddenly, she stops. Gets a little somber...

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        This is where Nightingale said her 
                        goodbyes... right here. It was the 
                        saddest thing I ever saw...

           Mama Bird finally steps out of the shadows, and the smile 
           falls off her face. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (melancholy)
                        We don’t mention Gale on camera 
                        anymore.

                                 TABITHA
                        We don’t?

           Papa lowers the camera. Again, the spell is broken. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        It’s alright, you didn’t know. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        She emailed us this morning from 
                        Nome and she has asked us to 
                        refrain from mentioning her in our 
                        videos. She’s trying to stay 
                        anonymous out there in the boonies, 
                        and doesn’t want the extra 
                        attention. We respect her wishes.

           Mama stares at the painting. Wipes a pesky tear.

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh, okay. No problem.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Right, mama. 

           Papa starts filming again. Mama comes to life, jumps to her 
           feet a little too quickly.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What was your favorite Birdie 
                        moment this year, Tabitha?!

           Tabitha looks at the lens. Nods, and lays it on thick:

                                 TABITHA
                        I have so many great memories in 
                        this house! I feel like this is 
                        where I’ve always lived. Cuz I 
                        sorta aways have. I know this house 
                        by heart, cuz I come here every 
                        single day to see you. And now you 
                        see me, too. My whole life I felt 
                        homesick for a place I never really 
                        been ‘til right now.

           The yellow canary lands on her shoulder. They laugh. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Eric. Nice to finally meet 
                        you in person. Chirp chirp!

           ERIC flies away.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        That’s the moment right there.

                        She’s gonna get a billion Likes.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Let’s give Tabitha the FULL BIRD!

           The Birdies gasp. Jump to their feet, and stand at attention.  

           Mama runs over and -- WHAMM!!! Smashes the RED “FULL BIRD” 
           BUTTON and -- AROOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGAAAAAA!!!! AIRHORNS SCREAM as 
           all the lights die in the house! RED LIGHTS FLASH 
           DEMONICALLY. A BOOMING VOICE EXPLODES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE--

                                 DEEP VOICE
                        THE FULLLLL BIRD!

           AROOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGAAAAAA!!!! And then -- “SURFIN BIRD” blasts 
           on the soundsystem as the stage lights in the rafters WHIRRRR 
           TO LIFE for a brilliant neon light extravaganza in synch with 
           the song, and complete with lasers. 
             A-well-a everybody's heard about the bird!
             B-b-b-bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word!

           “THE FULL BIRD!” Flashes on all the flatscreen TVS. 

           Papa films as they break into an elaborate CHOREOGRAPHED 
           DANCE. Mama and her Birdies dance their hearts out, shaking 
           their tail feathers and flapping their wings. Tabitha 
           hesitates.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        C’mon, Tabitha! You know the moves!

           And she does. She joins in, never missing a beat, and dancing 
           her heart out.

                                 TABITHA
                        Woooooooo!

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (dancing)
                        I’m so HAPPY!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        That’s right, Mama!

           Caged birds SCREAM and SHRIEK and BEAT THEIR WINGS.

             B-b-b-bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word!

           And Mama dances like hell. The kiddos struggle to keep up, 
           all of them in-synch, like her little dancing clones, and as 
           she just works herself into a wild-eyed frenzy.

           The song ends, and they all pumps their fists in the air.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        NOW LET’S! CREATE! SOME! CONTENT!

                                 BIRDIES
                        Yayyyyyy!

           “SURFIN’ BIRD” continues over--

           VIDEO POV 

           -- The Birdies are running through the house, the camera 
           chasing them. Mama opens the door to the BALL PIT ROOM. She 
           does a backflip into the sea of neon balls and vanishes 
           below. The Birdies follow, Tabitha plugs her nose and dives 
           in. They erupt from below and play!

           -- “Mystery Wheel Swimming Challenge” at the pool, Tabitha 
           spins a wheel of fortune. Lands on “Cannon Ball.” SPLASH!!!

           -- The Birdies jump in the bouncy castle. Mama does a flip.
           -- The Birdies steer dune buggies across the estate. Pedal to 
           the metal, Tabitha tries like hell to catch up to Mama, 
           seizing with laughter. The sun falls behind the mountains.

           -- It’s night now. The Family is doing the limbo in the 
           living room. “How low can you go? How low can you go?” 
           Tabitha gets low and dances under the stick.

           DONG. DONG. DONG. A cuckoo clock strikes EIGHT. An ornamental 
           bird springs out of the little door -- CU-CKOO. CU-CKOO. 

           Papa lowers the camera, plunging us into--

           REALITY

           Everyone freezes. Finch knocks over the stick. Smiles falling 
           off their faces. Mama’s eyes flash with anxiety. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Mama. I’m sorry. That’s a wrap.  

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What? It can’t be eight already...

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        It’s eight, love bird. See?

           Mama deflates. The Birdies look nervous. Mama does too.

              DOVE
                              HAWK
           We can keep going!
                        I’m not tired!

                                 LARK
                        Me either!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        I have to get editing now. Remember 
                        what we talked about? Work life 
                        balance. We need to do better. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        But we were... we were just getting 
                        to the good part.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        You know how the Birders get if we 
                        miss our deadline. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (pathetically)
                        Ten more minutes?
                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Last time you told me... you said, 
                        “Papa Bird, I’m gonna ask for ten 
                        more minutes, and don’t you give in 
                        to me, you said, you say ‘no mama’ 
                        and you get up there and get 
                        editing.’ Don’t you give in. That’s 
                        what you said.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I was kidding. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Mama.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        But we have a new Birdie tonight. 
                        Pics or it didn’t happen.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        I’m sorry, Mama. That’s a wrap! 
                        Make sure you kiddos load all your 
                        content to Dropbox for Papa so he 
                        can edit you alllll up.

           Bustard fingers his fidget spinner. Tabitha watches as -- 
           Papa turns the camera off. It whirrs and dies, and so does 
           Mama, like the cap has been placed on the lens of her soul. 

                                 PAPA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, love bird. Kärleksfågel.

           He goes to her and wraps her up. Tries to kiss her, but she 
           recoils. He plants a kiss anyway. 

                                 PAPA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Such a kidder. Welcome home, 
                        Tabitha.

           He grabs his gear and hurries upstairs, a little too quickly.  

                                 TABITHA
                        Night, Papa! Thank you!

           He’s already gone. They’re alone with her. And now it’s 
           eggshells. Tabitha’s grin falls off her face when she sees 
           Mama. Something different about her now. The way she stands. 
           She seems smaller, naked without the loving look of the lens. 

           She plops down in her chair, suddenly completely spent. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Birdie cuddle. 

           She opens her arms, expectantly. The Birdies exchange worried 
           looks. And then they hug Mama. Bustard stands back. 
                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        How much do you love me, Birdies?

                                 BIRDIES
               (rote)
                        We love you more than all the 
                        “likes” in the world!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Yes. And what about you, Bustard? 
                        How much do you love me?

           He stands before her. She opens her arms to him.

                                 BUSTARD
                        Um, more than all the “likes” in 
                        the, uh, universe pretty much.

           She hugs him tight. A little too tight.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Is that all?

           She lets go of him abruptly. Her eyes turn cold. Spooked, he 
           drops his fidget spinner. The Pet Birds SHRIEK and CRY in 
           their cages. Getting louder.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        You gave me quite a scare back 
                        there, kiddo... 

                                 BUSTARD
                        I know that and I’m very sorry. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (darkening)
                        “A good birdie stays close to the 
                        flock.” 

           She circles him like a prize pony. 

                                 BUSTARD
                        I didn’t, uh, even realize you were 
                        even gone until it was too late.

           Tabitha narrows her brow. Her Birdie brothers and sisters 
           stare at their shoes. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What did you say to that old troll?

                                 BUSTARD
                        Nothing.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Nothing at all?
                                 BUSTARD
                        I didn’t say anything.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Haven’t I been a good mother?

                                 BUSTARD
                        You’re the best mother.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Don’t you like it here?

           He nods. She stares him down.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid there has to be a 
                        consequence.

           Bustard bows his head. The caged birds SCREECH and BEAT their 
           wings against the bars, like they’re some sort of avian 
           barometer for her mood. Tabitha senses the tension, steps in.

                                 TABITHA
                        He didn’t mean it, mama! You know, 
                        Bustard. He’s forgetful. Remember 
                        when he spun the chore wheel and 
                        had to clean the cages and he 
                        forgot to close them, and the birds 
                        got out? Remember what you said?

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (softening)
                        “He’d forget his head if it wasn’t 
                        screwed on his neck.” 

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s the adopted nest! Of course he 
                        likes it here, it’s the greatest 
                        place on planet earth!

           Mama takes a deep breath. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (to Bustard)
                        Just please be more mindful, dear. 
                        The world’s a dangerous place. 
                        You’re an influencer, and that 
                        makes you a target. If anything 
                        ever happened to you, I’d never 
                        forgive myself.

           She hugs him again. He breathes relieved.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I love you so much it kills me. 
                                 BUSTARD
                        I love you too, mama. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Now let’s get your views up, huh?

           Bustard nods. Mama looks up at the SUBSCRIBERS, dropping like 
           flies. Tickticktickticktickticktickticktick... She chews on 
           her bloody fingernail. Tries like hell not to.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        The Birdies will show you to your 
                        room, Tabitha. Goodnight, my loves. 
                        I’m so happy you’re home.

                                 TABITHA
                        Me too, Mama.

           She kisses her on the head. Birds SQUAAAAK!!!! Mama walks 
           down the long dark hallway to her bedroom, a little dazed. 
           Slams the door.

           All at once, the Birdies breathe a sigh of relief.

                                 LARK
                        C’mon! Let’s get you oriented!

           INT. STAIRS - NIGHT

           The Birdies move up the grand staircase like little soldiers. 
           Lark rides in the stair lift, her crutches in her lap. 
           Upstairs, the walls are lined with framed family photos. 

           Tabitha watches Bustard branch off. He shoots her a look, and 
           then sulks into his own bedroom.

           INT. TABITHA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           It’s a teen girl’s dream. Everything pink and fluffy and 
           matching. Cool art on the wall. A Peloton bike. A massive 
           flat screen. A vanity, and high tech vlogging set up -- green 
           screen and movie lights before a Macbook Pro on a sleek desk. 
           A common nightingale sings in a lavish pink cage. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Wow!

           She opens the closet and sees the clothes. So many amazing 
           things. All for her. She bursts into tears. 

                                 FINCH
                        We’re not filming you.

                                 TABITHA
                        What?
                                 FINCH
                        You don’t have to cry, no one can 
                        see you. No one’s watching.

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s just I’ve never had my own 
                        room before...

                                 DOVE
                        You mean they’re real tears?

           The Birdies are standing before her now. Fanned out.

                                 TABITHA
                        I know this room. It was 
                        Nightingale’s.

                                 FINCH
                        Here’s your orientation packet.

           Finch takes a packet off the desk, and hands it to Tabitha. 
           ON THE COVER: The BIRDIES hugging on the lawn. One of the 
           children is a cutout with a question mark for a face. 

            FROM BIRDER TO BIRDIE! WELCOME TO THE NEST

                                 LARK
                        But there’s a rule that’s not in the 
                        packet. The most important rule.

           Lark nods at Dove, goes into the hallway to check. All clear, 
           so she shuts the door.

                        It’s best to stay away from Mama 
                        when she’s in a burnout.

                                 TABITHA
                        Burnout?

                                 FINCH
                        YouTube Burnout. 

                                 DOVE
                        She gets sad sometimes. It’s 
                        getting worse since Gale left.

                                 TABITHA
                        But, I’ve never seen her burned out 
                        before. She always has “a smiling 
                        face and a happy heart.”

                                 DOVE
                        She only gets it at night. After 
                        eight. When the camera’s off.
                                 FINCH
                        People think being a YouTuber is 
                        all fun and games, but it’s not. It 
                        kinda burns you out sometimes. Cuz 
                        if you miss one single day, the 
                        Birders turn into nasty old trolls 
                        and unsubscribe.   

                                 LARK
                        She’ll be her old self tomorrow. 
                        She’s the best mother in the world 
                        when the camera’s on! 

                                 DOVE
                        We’re very lucky birds.

                                 TABITHA
                        I know Gale had to follow her 
                        passion, and live off the land, but 
                        I think it was, like, kinda mean to 
                        take her money and walk away from 
                        this channel as soon as she turned 
                        eighteen. After everything Mama did 
                        for her. She was mama’s favorite.

                                 LARK
                        Plus our channel lost two million 
                        subs in one night when she left...

                                 DOVE
                        You’ll have to pick up the slack.
                        Just remember, you’re not adopted 
                        yet, you’re still a foster, so make 
                        sure you keep those views up, and 
                        everything will be fine.

           It almost sounds like a threat. 

                                 TABITHA
                        But... no. Mama said this is my 
                        forever home. 

                                 DOVE

                        Nothing is forever!

           Tabitha nods, a little spooked. 

                                 LARK
                        Birdie Cuddle!

           The Birdies all give Tabitha a great big hug.

                        I’m just next door. Here’s my cell. 
                        Text me if you need anything.
           She hands Tabitha a scrap of paper.

                                 TABITHA
                        Thanks.

                                 FINCH
                        We’re so happy you’re here! You’ll 
                        really round out the cast. 

                                 HAWK
                        Call time is at six-thirty AM. The 
                        early bird gets the worm!

           With that, The Birdies leaves, shutting the door behind them.

           Tabitha goes over to the bed. Sees her welcome gifts sitting 
           on the bedspread. A brand new iPad. iPhone 11 Pro. A Canon 
           Power Shot G7. A handheld tripod. And a note from Mama Bird. 

                  To our new Birdie: 
        ELECTRONICS ARE OUR INSTRUMENTS -- WE MUST KEEP THEM IN TUNE!

           And a series of cards. WELCOME TO: Twitter, Instagram, 
           Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok. With instructions. She quickly 
           opens the iPad. Runs her hand across the sleek, perfect 
           screen. She sees her reflection.

           And the reflection of NIGHTINGALE STANDING BEHIND HER.

           She screams, and drops the iPad, whips around. It’s only 
           Nightingale’s face on a framed BIRDIE POSTER.

         NIGHTINGALE’S ASMR LULLABY CHANNEL! GOLD STATUS CREATOR 

           She’s wearing a purple wig. Two hearts stamped on her cheeks. 
           Smiling wide with her arms folded. Cartoon Sheep jumping over 
           a fence behind her.  

           The bird CHIRPS in its cage. Shrill. Tabitha looks down at 
           the iPad. The screen is cracked. Already.

                                 TABITHA
                        Shit.

           INT. MAMA BIRD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A dark room. Mama Bird sits before the cold glow of THREE 
           GIANT COMPUTER SCREENS. She scrolls through the Birdie 
           videos, lost in the happy times. She knows them by heart.  

           And then she does a horrible thing. She knows shouldn’t, but 
           she does it anyway. She scrolls down to the COMMENTS SECTION.

                 Unsubscribe -- no Gale!!! 
           This channel sucks without Gale -- unsubscribing
                I see why Nightingale peaced.

           Mama starts DELETING these comments, one by one. Scrubbing 
           the trolls. A purge of negativity.

           The deep sadness in her eyes gives way to anger.

           INT. TABITHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tabitha is curled up in her comfy new bed, fast asleep.

                                 BUSTARD (O.S.)

                        and subscribe...

           She snaps awake. Her ears perk.

                                 TABITHA
                        H-hello?

                                 BUSTARD (O.S.)
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Tabitha creeps down the empty hallway. Listening.  

                                 BUSTARD (O.S.)
                        Like and subscribe, like and

           She turns and sees Bustard’s door cracked open. He’s in his 
           race car bed, tossing and turning and talking in his sleep.

                                 TABITHA
                        Bustard?

           She runs in there, and sits on his bed. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Bustard, you’re dreaming.

           Bustard’s eyes SNAP OPEN and he gasps, shooting horrible 
           looks around the room. 
                                 BUSTARD
                        What?! What?!

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s okay! You were sleeping, you 
                        were sleep talking --

           Bustard finally SNAPS OUT OF IT. Looks around.

                                 BUSTARD
                        I was having nightmares!

           He gives her a hug, and won’t let go.

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s okay, Bustard.

                                 BUSTARD
                        Farhad. My name is Farhad. I hate 
                        Bustard. They’re not even a cool 
                        bird. They look like a turkey on 
                        stilts. 

           Bustard starts to whimper. Tabitha rubs his back.

                                 TABITHA
                        Everything’s okay now...

                                 BUSTARD
                        No it’s not. I’m so scared. If I 
                        don’t get my views up soon, there’s 
                        gonna be a “consequence.” 

                                 TABITHA
                        No, no, views don’t matter! Not to 
                        Mama. She always says that YouTube’s 
                        not about views or subscribers or 
                        Likes or any of that junk. It’s about 
                        connection. It’s about family. She 
                        never had any photos of herself 
                        growing up, and that’s why YouTube is 
                        like one giant living photo album, so 
                        we’ll never miss a moment out our 
                        childhood!

                                 BUSTARD
                        None of this is what you think. 

           Tabitha shudders. 

                                 BUSTARD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get me wrong. I love Mama. 
                        She saved me from that hell. They 
                        made us dig tunnels in Iran. Terror 
                        tunnels they called them. Little 
                        children are prized diggers cuz of 
                        our nimble bodies.

                        Mama flew all the way to Tehran to 
                        adopt me. She was so kind and nice 
                        and pretty and... She gave me this 
                        big, beautiful house and family and 
                        let me play all the games I want... 
               (sighs)
                        But I don’t have nightmares about 
                        the tunnels. I have nightmares 
                        about the views.

           Bustard bursts into tears. 

                                 BUSTARD (CONT’D)
                        What if I’m not Birdie material?

           Tabitha hugs him and he cries on her shoulder.

           INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

           Tabitha is curled up in her massive walk-in closet, watching 
           a video. The cracked iPad splays light across the ceiling. 
           The battery is at 2%.

           IN THE VIDEO: Nightingale is wearing full-glam make-up, heart 
           stamps on her cheeks, and the purple wig. She stands before a 
           green screen. She musters up all the love she has to give, 
           and sings a LULLABY. Behind her, CARTOON SHEEP jump over a 
           fence. Her voice is soft and fragile, like Tabitha’s.

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        HUSH LITTLE BABY DON’T SAY A 
                        WORD... MAMA’S GONNA BUY YOU A 
                        MOCKINGBIRD...

           Nightingale smiles so big it tickles her ears.

           But Tabitha sees -- A tear falls down Nightingale’s cheek, 
           smudging the heart stamp and making it bleed.

           Suddenly, the screen dies, plunging us into darkness. 

           INT. MAMA BIRD’S BATHROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           The lights are off in the cavernous bathroom. Mama Bird sits 
           at the massive vanity in the dark, her face in a bowl of ice. 
           She stays under a little too long. She finally rips her head 
           out, and sucks in a massive gasp, whipping her hair back. She 
           grabs her concealer. 

           INT. TABITHA’S CLOSET - DAY

           KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. Tabitha snaps awake. Sits up. Quickly 
           hides the cracked iPad just as --

           WOOSH! The door swings open! Mama Bird looming over her. A 
           glowing beauty in the soft spot of the sun. Hair done. Make-
           up perfect. A sight to behold. 
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What are you doing in the closet?

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m sorry! It’s just... where I go 
                        sometimes...

           Mama Bird climbs into the closet with her. Cuddles up to her. 
           It’s very cozy, and Tabitha is touched.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Oh sweetie bird, I understand. 

                                 TABITHA
                        You do?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Growing up, this was your safe 
                        space, wasn’t it? The closet.

           She looks over and sees -- Papa Bird standing in the corner, 
           filming everything. He shoots them a thumbs up. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        I’m not here.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You were hiding from your mother, 
                        weren’t you?

                                 TABITHA
                        I don’t like to talk about that. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        She was a bad mother?

           Tabitha glances at Papa’s camera. Fixes her hair.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        She chose drugs over you. And you 
                        feel very sad about it.

           She looks back at Mama Bird and nods again.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        She knew just where to put the 
                        bruises so no one would see them. 
               (off Tabitha’s look)
                        I read your file, sweets. We’re 
                        more alike than you know. It’s the 
                        Albatross around our necks so to 
                        speak. Abuse and neglect. We all 
                        have that in common, I’m sad to 
                        say. All of your new brothers and 
                        sisters. Even Papa. Right Papa?

           He shoots them a thumbs up. 
                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        The way they treated him at the 
                        Allmänna Barnhuset. It makes me 
                        sick to my stomach... 

           Papa bows his head, swimming in memories. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        This is the glue that binds us. We 
                        are all survivors. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Do you mind if we talk about 
                        something else? 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        It’s not good to keep these things 
                        bottled up.

           She plays with Tabitha’s hair. Tabitha loves it.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Do you mind if I tell you my 
                        backstory?

           Mama takes a deep breath. Peeks at the camera. She’s ready.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        After mommy died, I got lost in the 
                        system. There are some wonderful 
                        fosters out there, but I was dealt 
                        a bad hand. A bad Mama. She 
                        supplemented her disability income 
                        by taking in placements, and then 
                        neglected and abused us. She 
                        starved us, and burned our little 
                        hands on the stove when we talked 
                        back. I missed my mommy so much. I 
                        couldn’t sleep without her 
                        lullabies. Every night, I would cry 
                        so loud it would scare the other 
                        children. They thought the devil 
                        was loose in the halls. She would 
                        gag me, and chain me to the bed at 
                        night. But that wouldn’t stop me 
                        from crying. I cried until I lost 
                        my voice. And then cried without 
                        it... I’ll never forget, I was 
                        lying in bed, and I heard a voice 
                        through my tears. So soft and 
                        strong. It was my mommy’s voice... 

           Mama has to stop a moment. She’s getting emotional. 

                                 TABITHA
                        ...She told you you’d grow up to be 
                        a good mother. A protector of lost 
                        kiddos.

                        You would build a nest, and 
                        surround yourself with baby birds. 
                        You would give your placements all 
                        the things you never had. Your 
                        children would be seen and heard 
                        and loved. And they would want for 
                        nothing. The way you wish it had 
                        been for you... 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You really are my number one fan.

           Tabitha glows.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        This is what I was put on this 
                        earth to do.

                                 TABITHA
                        I used to hide in the closet when I 
                        was a little kid and watch your 
                        videos. They calmed me down. They 
                        told me my first word was “Birdie.”

           Mama glances at Papa to make sure he got that. He nods.

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (to Tabitha)
                        You never have to hide from me, you 
                        know that don’t you? 

                                 TABITHA
                        I know, Mama.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        A closet’s kind of like a womb. If 
                        you really stop and think about it. 

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s my favorite womb in the house.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        That’s cute. You should tweet that. 
                        You need to start thinking about 
                        these things. Insta, too. Have you 
                        explored the accounts we made you?

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh, um. Not yet. But I will! 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Unfortunately, Tabitha, your 
                        homecoming video didn’t perform as 
                        well as we’d hoped. 

                                 TABITHA
                        It didn’t?
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’re not connecting yet which is 
                        odd considering your viral status. 
                        We’re still losing subs at an 
                        alarming rate. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m sorry.

           The nightingale flutters in its cage. Mama helps Tabitha up. 
           They start scanning the wardrobe. Papa gets a better shot. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Don’t worry, you’ll catch on. You 
                        have so much to offer. But, we need 
                        to make a few adjustments. You need 
                        to start playing the part. Look. This 
                        will look so cute on you.

           She grabs a bow sleeved tunic dress from the hanger. Earth 
           tones. She drapes it over Tabitha. She keeps glancing at the 
           lens, a little nervous.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I had acne too when I was your age.

                                 TABITHA
                        Yeah right, you’re perfect. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        So are you.

                                 TABITHA
                        Yeah right.

           Tabitha feels Papa’s prying lens. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’re not seeing what I see. Would 
                        you like me to show you what I see? 
                        When I look at you?

                                 TABITHA
                        You mean...?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        How about a Mama Bird Special. 

           Tabitha squeals with glee. Hugs Mama Bird, so happy.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        We can live stream the reveal! A 
                        special “Birdie Cast,” that should 
                        give us the bump we need. Tabitha, 
                        Tabitha. We’re going to have to do 
                        something about that name. It 
                        sounds like a cat’s name.
           Papa smiles as he films. Zooming in on Mama, studying her 
           with the lens. CLOSER. An obsessive gaze. Tabitha is crying. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 TABITHA
                        Nothing. Everything’s right. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Let’s get those views up.

           INT. THE BEAUTY ROOM - DAY

           All the make-up in the world. Mama Bird does Tabitha’s make-
           up before A CAMERA mounted on a tripod. She is applying 
           Tabitha’s eye shadow with the precision of a surgeon. The 
           backdrop is sparkly and pink.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Our new Birdie is glamming out hard 
                        today with a once in a lifetime 
                        Mama Bird Special! Nothing makes me 
                        happier than doing make-up for 
                        someone I love... 

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama? Can I say something? 
                        Remember, Birders at home -- you 
                        are beautiful whether you choose to 
                        wear makeup or not. Don’t feel 
                        pressured to wear it just because I 
                        do. You do you, boo. 

           Mama kisses her on the head. Tabitha shudders with love.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Very good.

           She dips her brush in the pallet and gets to work. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to be using my Marc 
                        Jacobs Beauty highliner gel eye 
                        crayon eyeliner... link below.

                        Papa will edit that in later.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The Birdies are waiting patiently. Papa Bird live streams 
           Lark with a mounted iPhone.

                                 LARK
                        Good morning, Bird watchers! 
                        Welcome back to our channel!

                                 LARK (CONT'D)
                        It’s the moment you’ve all been 
                        waiting for -- we’re coming to you 
                        live on YouTube for the big reveal 
                        of Tabitha’s epic “Mama Bird 
                        Special” makeover, and she still 
                        hasn’t seen it yet. Are we ready 
                        Birdies?!  

                                 BIRDIES
                        YEEEEAHHH!!!!

           The shouting makes Bustard jump. He’s on edge. Eyes blood-
           shot. Face pale. Like he hasn’t slept a wink. Eric the Canary 
           flutters through the house.

           Lark hits PLAY on the iPad. “YELLOW” BY COLDPLAY IS PUMPED 
           THROUGH THE SPEAKERS... Glowing proud, Mama Bird appears at 
           the top of the stairs with Tabitha. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        The transformation is complete. I’d 
                        like to introduce you to my 
                        masterpiece -- 

           Tabitha appears -- glowing like Mama, her perfect make-up 
           concealing her acne. Full glam, and smokey eyes. She looks 
           beautiful in her tunic dress, her hair done with baby bangs 
           and beauty waves. A completely different kid.

           Everyone explodes with adulation and applause.

                                 FINCH
                        Wowwwwww!

              DOVE
                              LARK
           She’s a glamazon queen!
                        On fleek!

           Bustard stares at the floor. Hawk nudges him. He snaps out of 
           it, and smiles, reflexively. 

           Tabitha moves gracefully down the stairs like Cinderella, or 
           Rachel Leigh Cook, and into the living room.  

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        It’s time for the big reveal!

           A stand-up mirror in the living room, covered by a velvet 
           blanket. Lark and Dove usher her to it. All very affected. 

           Mama Bird eyes the subscribers on the wall, bites her lip. 

           Ticktickticktick... the subscribers are going up!

                     6,765,7899

           The Birdies fan out around Tabitha, hold her shoulders, rub 
           her back, and giggle excitedly. 
                                 PAPA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        One, two, three--

           Lark pulls the blanket off the mirror, and Tabitha sees 
           herself for the first time. She’s so beautiful. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Meet the real you!

           She bursts into tears. She can’t believe it. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh my god!!!! WHO IS THAT?!

           She laughs and cries and laughs again. Lark and Dove are 
           tearing up. Mama comes up behind Tabitha. 

           Ticktickticktick-- UP AND UP!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        The fairest of them all.

                                 TABITHA
                        Birdie Cuddle!

           Tabitha gives her a squealing hug. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        That’s the moment right there.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Tell them how you feel. All the 
                        Birders watching at home.

           Mama Bird points to Papa’s iPhone. She looks at it. She looks 
           at her new family. Overwhelming joy...

                                 TABITHA
                        My whole life... No one noticed me. 
                        No one knew I was there. Even my 
                        bio mom neglected me. And now... 
                        for the first time, like, ever in 
                        my life... I feel like you see me.

           Tabitha looks at Mama, making sure she’s on track. Mama nods 
           like -- very good. So Tabitha lays it on thick. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        And I feel like I see myself. The 
                        me inside that I never knew was 
                        there. I got millions of people in 
                        my new perfect family. All my 
                        dreams are coming true... I look in 
                        the mirror and I think, this is me! 
                        The real me! This is Tabitha!
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        No. Tabitha no longer exists. 
                        You’re a Birdie now. You need a 
                        Birdie name and a Birdie channel.

                                 TABITHA
                        This is so freaking awesome!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        From the moment I heard you sing, I 
                        knew you had the gift of the cradle 
                        song. Growing up we called it “the 
                        tingle.” It’s something born in 
                        you. It’s very rare. Mommy had the 
                        gift. She would perch on my bedside 
                        at night, and sing me a lullaby, 
                        and it was like magic, all the 
                        worry would melt away, and I’d be 
                        out like a light. Nowadays we call 
                        it ASMR. Autonomous sensory 
                        meridian response, one of the most 
                        popular trends on YouTube. The 
                        dulcet tones of your voice produce 
                        a natural calming effect on the 
                        prone. You’re a born mother. You’ll 
                        sing the worried world to sleep.

                                 TABITHA
                        ...I will?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        And now for the finishing touch.

           She produces a wrapped gift, hands it to Tabitha. 

                                 TABITHA
                        For me?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Go on. Open it. 

           Tabitha smiles. Rips it open. Whatever’s inside makes her 
           face fall. Mama smiles so big.

                                 LARK
                        What is it?!

           Tabitha takes out-- NIGHTINGALE’S PURPLE WIG. The Birdies 
           gasp. Papa lowers the camera.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Put it on, sweetie bird. Don’t miss 
                        this, Papa.

           He keeps filming. Tabitha is frozen. Confused. She looks 
           over, and notices the framed portrait of Nightingale is gone. 
           And so is her shrine. 
                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Go on. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Um, no thank you, I’m okay.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What? Come now, put it on.

           The wig trembles in her hand. Tickticktickticktick-- the subs 
           are rising really fast now, and the ticks are keeping time 
           with her beating heart. 

                     7,165,7193

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I’ll help you.

           Mama takes the wig, and plants it snugly on Tabitha’s head. 
           She whips out a stamp liner, and adds a heart stamp to her 
           cheekbone. Tabitha is a statue. Shivering.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Uncanny.

           Tabitha turns, and looks in the mirror. 

           She looks a hell of a lot like Nightingale.

           Tabitha turns, and looks in the mirror. She looks back at 
           Mama and sees the dull pain in her eyes. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I would like to present to the 
                        world, the newest member of the 
                        Birdie Bunch. Our New Nightingale!

           She clicks on her iPhone. The new channel pops up on all the 
           flatscreen TVs around the house. 

                NEW NIGHTINGALE’S LULLABIES

           Tabitha’s face has replaced Nightingale’s on the THUMBNAIL.

           Caged birds SCREAM and SHRIEK and BEAT THEIR WINGS. The 
           Birdies exchange worried looks. Bustard’s eyes bug.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Kärleksfågel.
               (gingerly)
                        Oh, Mama. Maybe we should take a 
                        little break, yah? 

           He lowers the phone. Mama has her eyes on the rising subs.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Keep streaming. 
                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Yes, but maybe we should--

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        THE CAMERA STAYS ON!

           Papa swallows his opinions, and keeps filming. Mama Bird 
           touches a button on her Apple Watch and -- GZZZZZ -- a 
           massive screen is lowered from the ceiling like a monolith.

                   FAMILY ANALYTICS

                 Mama Bird -- 80,576,744
                   Lark -- 15,645,890
                   Finch -- 2,783,128
                  The Twins -- 1,387,589
                   Bustard -- 304,438

           Mama Bird taps on her phone. DING!!! A new name appears last: 

                  *New* Nightingale -- 0

           Tabitha looks at her new name in lights.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the board, Gale. 
               (off her look)
                        What’s wrong? Don’t you like it? 

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s not that... it’s just that... 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        The nightingale’s song is 
                        considered to be the most beautiful 
                        sound that the world ever produced.

                                 TABITHA
                        But...

           Tabitha doesn’t know what to say. Bustard plays with his 
           fidget spinner. Papa hides behind his iPhone. Spooked. 
           Ticktickticktickticktick... 

                     8,418,121

           Mama approaches Tabitha and touches her face. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Sing a lullaby for us, sweetie.

                                 TABITHA
                        I don’t think I know how.

           Mama cues up “ROCK-A-BYE BABY” on her iPhone. It blasts 
           through the house.
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Repetitive, predictable lullabies 
                        remind the baby of the motion they 
                        experienced in the comfort of their 
                        mother’s womb. A baby can’t 
                        understand your words, but they can 
                        understand your song.

           Tabitha listens to the music, feels it in her gut.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Wrap me up in your voice, and tell 
                        me you love me with your song. Give 
                        me the tingle...

           Tabitha opens her mouth, but nothing comes out...

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Like warm sand being poured all 
                        over you, trickling over your head 
                        and down into your shoulders! Like 
                        goosebumps on your brain!

           Finally, Tabitha she shakes her head -- no.

                                 TABITHA
                        I don’t think I want to right now. 

           The Birdies gasp. Defiance. 

           Tabitha takes off her wig.

           The subs INSTANTLY start going down... ticktickticktick--

           Mama and Tabitha have a stare-down. The love falls out of her 
           eyes. They are bottomless pools of inky black. 

           She’s suddenly a gothic statue. Stares. Blinks. As if she’s 
           glitching. The Birdies study the patterns on the carpet.

                     7,654,744

           Papa lowers the iPhone. Tinkers with it, nervously. 
           Muttering. The burnout rises and vibrates. THE BIRDS 
           SQUAWKING AND SCREAMING. The vein pulsing in Mama’s forehead, 
           the blood humming in her veins. A vomit of rage percolates in 
           her throat. She’s about to let it spew when --

           PAPA RAISES THE iPHONE AND LEVELS IT AT MAMA.

           She stops. Stares down the lens like it’s the barrel of a 
           gun. Suddenly, she swallows her rage. It tastes so sour. 

                     6,698,325

           She paints on a gasping smile. Shakes away the darkness, and 
           returns to planet earth. Back in character!
                                 MAMA BIRD
               (chipper)
                        You know what, sweetie bird? You’re 
                        absolutely right. We’re all very 
                        tired. It’s been a long couple days 
                        and you’re still getting the lay of 
                        the land here, let’s not overdo it! 
               (smiles)
                        We’ll take a little break. 

           Mama spins on her heels, and we catch a glimpse of her 
           bugging eyes as she marches down the hallway to her room, 
           picking at her skin.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Hold on, love bird! Wait for Papa!

           Papa chases her, leaving Tabitha alone. The door SLAMS behind 
           her. The Birdies fan out, their eyes narrowing. 

                                 LARK
                        You shouldn’t have done that. 

           Tabitha drops the wig. THUNDER. Look out the window at the 
           hematoma clouds.

           EXT. BIRDIE ESTATE - NIGHT

           It’s raining now. The wind screams. Lightning pulses. 

           The bouncy castle holds on for dear life. WOOOOSHHH! A hard 
           gust of wind slowly lifting the tethers out of the grass... 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           DONG. DONG. DONG. The cuckoo clock strikes EIGHT. The little 
           bird emerges from its door. CU-CKOO! CU-CKOO! It retreats 
           back into the bowels of the clock.

           INT. TABITHA'S BEDROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Tabitha stands before the mirror, washing her make-up off, 
           like she’s contaminated, and can’t get it off fast enough.  
           She looks at her old self in the mirror. For the first time, 
           relieved to see her acne. 

           INT. TABITHA’S CLOSET - NIGHT

           It’s dark, but for the cool glow of the screen on Tabitha’s 
           face. She lies on the closet floor, scrolling through the 
           Birdies homepage. She finds her new homecoming video --

              TABITHA’S HOMECOMING! *VERY EMOTIONAL* 

           It only has 15,000 views. A lot of nasty comments. 
                  The new birdie sucks
                    PIZZA FACE!
                   TABITHA IS BORING
                    I miss gale!

           Tabitha shudders. Scrolls down, down, down, through cheerful 
           clickbaity thumbnails, ten years of daily Birdie content. 

           It takes a minute, and her finger is tired by the time she 
           gets to one of first videos --

              ADOPTION DAY -- MEETING OUR NEW BABY 
               *VERY EMOTIONAL* *BRING TISSUES*

           She clicks it. The video starts:  

           MAMA BIRD is twelve years younger and a completely different 
           woman. JC Penny chic, her hair is brown, no make-up, pure 
           love pops out her eyes. Papa Bird films. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I’m so excited. The agency doors 
                        are right behind us, and we’re 
                        going to meet our new baby girl.

           UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYS, as we cut to Mama Bird walking through 
           the doors of the adoption center. There is a photographer 
           there snapping pictures as they usher YOUNG NIGHTINGALE (5) 
           out of the waiting room. She sees MAMA and does a giddy love 
           dance and she runs into Mama’s Arms and Mama wraps her up, 
           and won’t let go. Bursting into tears.  

                                 YOUNG NIGHTINGALE
                        MAMA!!!!!!

                                 PAPA BIRD (O.S.)
                        That’s the moment right there.

           DING! A TEXT COMES THROUGH FROM BUSTARD --

                      Hi.

           Tabitha texts back:

                      Hi!

                     You good?
                     Hundo P.
                      Cool.
                     What’s up?
                      nm, u?
                     nothing

           Undulating ellipses. And then Bustard texts:

                     i’m scared
           INT. BUSTARD'S ROOM - EVENING

           Bustard sits on his bed, shaking with fear. Tabitha sits with 
           him, rubbing his back. 

                                 BUSTARD
                        Get those views up, get those views 
                        up. I can’t get ‘em up, I tried!

                                 TABITHA
                        Maybe you can try something new.

                                 BUSTARD
                        I tried everything! I can’t get ‘em 
                        up, people hate me! I’m not good 
                        enough to be a Birdie, I’m not 
                        likable and relatable like you, I 
                        don’t have a good personality. 

                                 TABITHA
                        You have a great personality, 
                        Farhad! 

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m ugly and fat cuz I can’t stop 
                        eating and I have a stupid accent. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I love your accent! It’s so you!

                                 BUSTARD
                        The analytics don’t lie! I can’t 
                        get my views up! Will you show me 
                        how to go viral?! Will you?!

                                 TABITHA
                        I don’t know how I did it, I wasn’t 
                        trying to go viral--

                                 BUSTARD
               (crying)
                        That’s probably why you did!!! IT 
                        WAS ORGANIC!!!!!

                                 TABITHA
                        Stop it, Farhad! 

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m just low-key thirsty. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Who cares about stupid old views?! 
                        My new video didn’t do that good 
                        either-- 
                                 BUSTARD
                        IF I DON’T GET MY VIEWS UP THERE 
                        WILL BE A CONSEQUENCE!!!

                                 TABITHA
                        I love watching your videos! I 
                        don’t even like games at all, but I 
                        love you so much I tune in every 
                        day just to see how you’re doing, 
                        cuz you’re one of my best friends 
                        even though we never met!!

                                 BUSTARD
                        I CAN’T!!! 

           WHAMMM!! Bustard slams his head against the headboard.

                                 BUSTARD (CONT’D)
                        GET!!!

           WHAM! Harder.

                                 TABITHA
                        Stop! You’re so talented, and--

                                 BUSTARD
                        MY!!!

           WHAM! Harder!

                                 TABITHA
                        STOPPPP!!!!

           She tries to stop him, but--

                                 BUSTARD
                        VIEWS!!!

           WHAMM!!!

                                 BUSTARD (CONT’D)
                        UP!!!!

                                 TABITHA
                        YOU’RE HURTING YOURSELF!!!

           Blood stains the head board. She grabs him and holds his 
           bleeding head, and he bursts into tears.

           EXT. BIRDIE ESTATE - NIGHT

           WOOOSHHH! A hard gust of wind rips the bouncy castle from its 
           tethers! It skips across the grass, heading for the fence. It 
           catches on the ornate spikes and is sucked up into the stormy 
           sky, deflating as it flies over the trees... over the 
           world... shriveling up and dying as the storm steals it away 
           and LIGHTING EXPLODES!
           INT. THE BIRDIE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house is spooky in the dark. Lit only by the subscribers 
           glowing red on leader board. Tickticktickticktickticktick...

                     4,987,472

           We see the ornate green door to Mama’s room as we move down 
           the long dark hallway. See the smiling pictures on the wall. 
           And the horrible MOANS emanating from within. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        MOMMMMMMMYYYY!!!!

           VARIOUS BEDROOMS

           -- Dove and Hawk lie in their beds, listening to Mama cry. 
           Dove leans over and looks at her brother, who shares her 
           worry. THUNDER.

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        Noooooooooo!!! 

           Dove quickly gets up and locks the door. Hawk hurriedly 
           stacking furniture against it. 

           -- Bustard is wearing a FULL VIRTUAL REALITY OUTFIT. Haptic 
           body armor suit, VR boxing gloves, and headset. He’s dripping 
           with sweat, taking out his frustrations out on Floyd 
           Merriweather in the ring. Hiding from Mama’s SCREAMS...

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        AHhhhhhHAHHHHhh!!

           -- Lark stares at the ceiling. Wide-eyed. Lightning flashes. 
           Her dresser is in front of the door.

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        UhhhgghhhHHGHGOHGOODDDDDDDDDDDD!!

           -- Finch leans against his door, trying to plug his ears with 
           his pillow. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        MOMMMMMMMYYYYYY!!!!

           -- Papa Bird is in his CRAMPED QUARTERS, half the size of the 
           Birdies’ rooms. It looks more like a servant chambers. The 
           walls are lined with photos of Mama Bird, a little shrine to 
           her. No pictures of Birdies. He’s on his laptop. Looking at 
           old honeymoon photos of him and Mama Bird on Facebook. They 
           were so in love. So happy. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

           He sighs. Touches his heart. 
                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Vi kommer att vara okej i 
                        slutändan. You’ll be okay, my love, 
                        I promise.

           He kisses her face on the screen. And then he closes the 
           laptop, hugs it like pillow and falls asleep.

           INT. TABITHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tabitha is sound asleep. AN EXPLOSION OF LIGHTNING wakes her 
           with a start. She sits up, and gasps when she sees --

           The PERSON standing at the end of her bed. 

           Backlit by the light from the hallway. 

                                 TABITHA
                        H-hello?

           TABITHA SCREAMS AS THE PERSON RAISES A MACHETE-- 

           --And steps into the wet moonlight. It’s only Mama, gripping 
           a CAMERA ON A SELFIE-STICK. 

           We finally see her without make-up. We see the scars from the 
           picking, the fresh pocks and smeared blood dribbling down 
           from the pustules on her forehead. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I was filming you dream. 

           She lowers the selfie stick.

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama? 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What’s this?

           She holds up Tabitha’s cracked iPad.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Look at what you’ve done. Didn’t 
                        you read the codes of conduct?

                                 TABITHA
                        It just slipped through my fingers.

           Mama caresses the screen like it’s a poor wounded animal.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        It breaks my heart to see 
                        technology mishandled. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I promise it won’t happen again.
           Mama sits on the edge of the bed. Sitting a little too close. 
           Her face bleeding.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’ve ruffled my feathers, sweetie 
                        bird. I gave you a channel, and a 
                        name. That’s a very special thing. 
                        Don’t you want to be a Birdie?

           She runs her hand through Tabitha’s hair, lovingly.

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes, Mama, I was just confused.

           Mama rips her hand away.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I thought you were my number one 
                        fan. I thought you loved me.

                                 TABITHA
                        I do love you. 

           She pokes Tabitha in the shoulder with the selfie stick. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Do you?

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes, yes... so much... I just... I 
                        want to be my own Birdie. I don’t 
                        want to be the new Nightingale. I 
                        want to be the new me.

           Mama cocks her head. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        ...I was thinking I could be Raven. 
                        Cuz Ravens are the smartest birds. 
                        They’re smarter than dolphins. And 
                        I was thinking, maybe... I could do 
                        a review vlog. Like my favorite 
                        things. “Raven’s Raves.” Maybe if I 
                        rebrand, I could still be me and 
                        get more views.

           Tabitha looks in the abyss of Mama’s eyes. And then --

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Would you like to see my prized 
                        possession?

           Mama pulls a bronze medallion out from under her shirt. 

               GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS. 

           It catches the moonlight and reflects in Mama’s swollen eyes.
                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        For most Consecutive Daily Video 
                        Blogs Posted On YouTube. I’ve made 
                        3,751 consecutive videos, and I’ve 
                        never missed a day. Did you know 
                        that? 3,751 days is over ten years. 
                        I’ve never missed a single day in 
                        ten years. Don’t you think that 
                        maybe, I know what I’m doing?

                                 TABITHA
                        I haven’t missed a day either. I’ve 
                        seen every video...

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I always posted on time for you, 
                        didn’t I? I was always there when 
                        you were sad, or scared, or 
                        lonely... you could always count on 
                        Mama Bird, couldn’t you? Now I have 
                        to know that I can count on you.
               (smiles)
                        You’re not a Birdie yet. You’re 
                        still a foster. You haven’t been 
                        adopted. You have to prove to me 
                        that you’re Birdie Material. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I was born to be a Birdie.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Prove it, dear. Mama needs help. I 
                        need to know you can be consistent 
                        for me, my love. Consistency is 
                        key. YouTube is like a shark. If 
                        you stop, you die.

           THUNDER.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Nightingale. There’s something you 
                        have to know, and you must promise 
                        me that what I’m about to tell you 
                        will stay between us. Can you keep 
                        a secret?

           Tabitha nods, holding back tears. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        You’re not like the rest. You’re 
                        special. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I am?
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’re the most talented, the most 
                        beautiful perfect little birdie 
                        I’ve ever seen in my entire life.  
                        You’re a fucking superstar, girl. 
                        You remind me of me... 

           Mama Bird touches Tabitha’s face and smiles. Tabitha glows. 
           It’s like Mama’s words an opiate, washing over her. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Because you are my Nightingale. It 
                        was never her, or anyone else. It 
                        was always you. It was who you were 
                        born to be. And she was the 
                        temporary Nightingale, holding your 
                        place for you. While the universe 
                        conspired to bring us together.

           Mama hangs the medallion around Tabitha’s neck. Her eyes half 
           mast, like she’s under a spell.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        We’ve lost another hundred thousand 
                        subs since breakfast. We just go 
                        down and down and down. I can feel 
                        them slipping right through my 
                        fingers, like sand draining from an 
                        hourglass, like time running out, 
                        and every sub we lose, I feel like 
                        I’m losing a piece of me, too, and 
                        I can’t sleep at night. The 
                        nightmares are coming back, and I 
                        feel every single sub we lose, I 
                        can feel it right here--

           Mama pounds her sternum, a little too hard. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Like a knot, twisting and twisting 
                        and-- I can’t breathe. I can’t 
                        sleep. It can’t go on like this. 
                        Help. I’m asking you for help. 
                        You’re the only one who can pull us 
                        out of this free-fall... I need to 
                        sleep. Mama needs to sleep.

           Her eyes dancing deliriously as she rises to her feet.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Will you? Will you help your family 
                        get their views up?

           Tabitha thinks about it, and then she nods. Hypnotized. And 
           suddenly filled with a sense of purpose. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes, Mama. I will help you.
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Will you be a good Nightingale?

           Suddenly, Tabitha takes on Nightingale’s affectation --

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes, Mama. I’ll sing the worried 
                        world to sleep.

           DING! Mama gets a notification on her Apple watch. She checks 
           it. Her eyes pop with pain. She looks out the window. The 
           rain is trying to break in.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        ...they just took away our gold 
                        status...

           AN EXPLOSION OF THUNDER that lingers in the air as --

           Mama throws her head back and screams with the storm. Loud, 
           painful screams from her depths. She holds her head in 
           sorrow. She starts picking wildly at her face. 

           Tabitha jumps out of bed, and goes to Mama.

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama. Stop. We’ll get it back.

           She rubs her back and hugs her. They are face to face, Mama’s 
           blood smearing on Tabitha’s cheek as she cries.

           Suddenly -- Mama is a terrified five-year-old girl.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        IF WE LOSE ANY MORE SUBS, I DON’T 
                        KNOW WHAT I’LL DO!!! 

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s okay, it’s just a little 
                        burnout, it will pass. You’ll be 
                        your old self again tomorrow.
                        We’re gonna hit diamond status in 
                        no time. Only 400 channels in the 
                        history of YouTube have gotten 
                        there, and we’re next. You’ll see, 
                        in a little while we’re gonna have 
                        more followers than God!

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (calming)
                        Promise?

                                 TABITHA
                        I promise.
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Born not from our flesh. But born 
                        in our hearts. You were longed for 
                        and wanted and loved from the 
                        start.
               (smiles)
                        Family is so much more than blood.

           Mama Bird touches Tabitha’s face. Her picked finger is 
           bleeding and a tiny bit of blood smears her cheek. The 
           nightingale beats its wings against the cage.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Oopsie!

           Mama Bird grabs the tissue hidden up her sleeve like an Ace, 
           gives it a lick, and wipes away the blood. Tabitha closes her 
           eyes, shuddering at Mama’s soft touch. She feels the love.

           With that, Mama sulks out of the room. Stops at the door. 
           Suddenly, a chipper smile breaks across her face. She’s her 
           old self again. Even more jarring with the weeping sores. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
               (merrily)
                        Door open or closed?

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh-open. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Sleep tight. And remember. There’s 
                        no force on earth more powerful 
                        than a mother’s love. 

           And with that, Mama is gone. THUNDER!

                 SUBSCRIBERS -- 4,185,7657

           INT. TABITHA'S CLOSET - NIGHT

           Tabitha is curled up, watching Nightingale’s old videos. The 
           storm rages outside. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        ROCK-A-BYE BABY... IN THE 
                        TREETOP... WHEN THE WIND BLOWS... 
                        THE CRADLE WILL ROCK...

           Tabitha tries her best to parrot Nightingale’s voice. 
           EXT. BIRDIE HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           The sun peeks out from behind a cloud. A sickly pall hangs 
           over the wet grass and settles around the house.

           INT. MAMA BIRD'S BATHROOM - DAY

           The massive mirror is cracked now. Maybe from her fist. Mama 
           Bird sits at the vanity with her head in the bowl of ice. She 
           finally rips her head out, and sucks in a gasp, whipping her 
           hair. Her face is a scabbed and bruised and festering. 

                                 CUT TO:

           VARIOUS SHOTS. 

           -- Mama wears a protective cloth mask. Like Hannibal Lector’s 
           second face. She ties a plastic tourniquet around her arm. 
           She finds a juicy vein, and stabs in the needle. Blood swirls 
           through winding plastic tubes. 

           -- Mama sticks her blood sample in what looks to be a high 
           tech microwave. It hums to life, and starts to spin, 
           separating the blood into platelet rich plasma. 

           -- DING! She grabs a jar of numbing cream, and smears it all 
           over her face like grease. 

           -- She fills a syringe with her treated blood and inserts it 
           into a large, humming NEEDLE GUN. She starts injecting her 
           face with her own blood, prick by painful prick. Her face a 
           smear of crimson, like a ravenous beast. This is a “vampire 
           facial.”

           INT. TABITHA'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Mama Bird enters, and the room gets brighter. She’s her old 
           happy self again -- made up, hair done, and pretty as a 
           picture. The scars and scabs are well hidden.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Knock, knock!

           She smiles when she sees Tabitha on the edge of the bed. Full 
           Nightingale make-up. Purple wig snug. Heart stamp on her 
           cheek. She’s ready. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Look at you. Raring to go!

                                 TABITHA
                        The early bird gets the worm!

           Mama smiles, baring a mouthful of bleached teeth.

                                 CUT TO:
           LATER. 

           Tabitha stands before the green screen. Her pet nightingale 
           is freaking out in its cage. Papa mans the camera, Mama sits 
           on Tabitha’s bed, watching like a hawk. She cues the music.

           The Birdies are watching through the cracked door. Tabitha 
           feels it. Her eyes flutter as she sings. It’s so soothing 
           it’s almost medicinal. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        ROCK-A-BYE BABY... IN THE 
                        TREETOP... WHEN THE WIND BLOWS... 
                        THE CRADLE WILL ROCK...

           It hits Mama instantly. She sounds exactly like Nightingale.

           Goose-flesh spreads. The hair on her neck stands erect. 
           Pupils swell. And THE TINGLE -- a high frequency tone. The 
           bell rings in her brain. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Is it the tingle, mama?

           The TONE grows louder, and she’s vibrating. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        ...Nightingale.

           The PET BIRD QUIETS. The music lulling it into silence.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        That’s it, it’s working!

           Mama sways, letting the opiate of her voice wash over her. 
           Tears stream down Mama’s face. She feels it in her soul.

           Dove starts to fall asleep as she listens. WOOSH!!! ERIC THE 
           CANARY flies into the room, and lands on Tabitha’s shoulder. 
           Perches there. Perfect!

                                 PAPA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        That’s the moment right there!

                                 TABITHA
                        WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS... THE CRADLE 
                        WILL FALL... 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Is that good, mama?  

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        She’s home... she’s home...

           Mama’s eyes flutter with love. She’s a little girl again. 
                                 TABITHA
                        AND DOWN WILL COME BABY... CRADLE 
                        AND ALL...

           Her eyes woozy, as if she’s in a trance. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                         I missed you so much... 

           Tabitha parrots Nightingale’s speaking voice perfectly.

                                 TABITHA
                        I missed you, too.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        We’re the perfect family again! And 
                        everything is so perfect!

           She goes to Tabitha and wraps her up in a hug. She so happy.

                                 TABITHA
                        I love you.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I love you, too. You’ve always been 
                        my special little bird. 

           Tabitha glows proud. The Birdies burst through the door and 
           join the hug.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        BIRDIE CUDDLE!

           EXT. SKY - DAY

           An army of Amazon Prime delivery drones soaring over the 
           world. Down below, nothing but dense, old growth forest.

           ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!! And then a clearing. The fence 
           slithers across the land like a snake. Beyond it... THE 
           BIRDIE ESTATE. The drones start their decent. 
           EXT. BIRDIE ESTATE - YARD - DAY

           Papa films the Birdies run across the grass retrieving pretty 
           brown boxes from the drones, like an easter egg hunt. They 
           fight over packages. 

                                 CUT TO:

           Ticktickticktickticktickticktick... The leaderboard stops

           Mama and the Birdies scream through the house on their 
           scooters, Bustard crashes into the wall. Mama is in the lead. 
           Papa is chasing them down with the camera.

           -- All the while, we see the SUBSCRIBERS ticking up:

           -- Tabitha is recording her new lullaby.

                                 TABITHA
                        TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR, HOW I 
                        WONDER WHAT YOU ARE...

           Mama bursts into the room, waving her phone --

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        We got our gold status back!

           Tabitha squeals and jumps into Mama’s arms. 

           -- Tabitha basks in the likes, comments, and rising subs. 
           Glued at her phone, constantly refreshing the endless stream 
           of virtual love. She needs another hit. On the leaderboard, 
           her name climbs up the family rankings. Ding! Ding! Ding!

           -- A framed portrait of Tabitha goes up in the same spot 
           Nightingale’s portrait was. 

           -- Mrs. Bollinger, the social worker arrives. Tabitha takes 
           her on a tour. Showing off her school work, her amazing 
           rooms, singing Mama’s praises. Mrs. Bollinger taking notes.  

           -- Screaming with glee, Mrs. Bollinger and The Birdies jump 
           on the bouncy castle in the yard. Mrs. Bollinger does a flip. 
           Everyone cheers. Mama and Papa clap. 

                                 BIRDIES
                        Go Bollinger Go! Go Bollinger Go!
           Later, they all take a selfie together at the stoop.

           Lark is sitting before her webcam, surrounded by TWENTY BLACK

           Bustard gives a droning commentary as he navigates the game.

                        In Fortnite, “Meta” is a word that 
                        means, like, um, the most effective 
                        tactic available. Like, the Meta 
                        refers-- oh shit I just died.

           -- Thousands of “THUMBS DOWN” on Bustard’s video.

           -- Tabitha is giving Bustard pointers on how to present 
           himself on camera. Showing him how to not be so uptight.

           -- We’re at a BIRDIE MEET AND GREAT AT THE MALL! An EXPLOSION 
           OF SHRILL JOY! COPS are there to corral the pimple-laden, 
           braced-faced throngs. Stand back! A sea of phones snap and 
           flash and post and live stream behind barricades.

           Tabitha and Mama Bird step out of the mall, holding hands.  
           The Birdies follow, and fan out around them. 
           CHAOS! They hurry through the GAUNTLET OF SWOONING SCREAMING 
           FANS towards the waiting SUV. They’re rabid and grabbing 
           after Tabitha and Mama, trying to touch them, AND EVERYONE 
           STARTS CHIRPING! It sounds like a deranged bird sanctuary. 

           A red-faced GIRL faints dead. Tabitha is loving it, and Papa 
           is filming it all as Tabitha and Mama are DEVOURED BY THE 
           THRONGS OF SCREAMING, LOVETHIRSTY FANS! 

                    8,204,991 

           -- DINNER TIME! The Birdies eat the most glorious home-cooked 
           meal. Mama bringing out course after course. Tabitha stuffs 
           her face. Cake and ice cream, too. 

           Suddenly, Dove stabs a piece of cake into Hawk’s face, and 
           smears it all over.

                                 DOVE
                        Hashtag sibling prank war!

           Hawk gasps, and chucks his MILK in her face, and she screams. 

                                 HAWK
                        Food fight!!!

           Mama isn’t afraid -- she hurls a fist full of pie at Dove, 
           and she falls out of her chair. Food rains and sprays the 
           walls. Beautiful chaos. Mama wipes the smear of cake from her 
           face. Papa gets it all on film. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        That’s the moment right there.

           DONG. DONG. DONG. The cuckoo clock strikes EIGHT. The little 
           bird emerges from its door.

           Everyone freezes, mid food fight, to stare at that horrible 
           little wooden bird -- CU-CKOO! CU-CKOO! It retreats back into 
           the bowels of the clock.

           PAPA LOWERS THE CAMERA, PLUNGING US INTO --

           REALITY.

           Mama’s eyes flash with anxiety. She wipes the smear of 
           chocolate off her face. Birds SQUAWK. Guards rise.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Eight PM. That’s a wrap.

           Mama glares at Papa -- His silly accent. It makes her sick.

                        Tomorrow we’ll be filming 
                        Nightingale’s first music video, 
                        and it will be a long day.
           He points to the massive GREEN SCREEN in the living room. 
           Movie lights and a video village set-up.

                        “Five Little Ducks!” Are we all

                        Yessss, Papa!!

           Mama starts picking at her temple.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        It’s time for family analytics.

           Bustard’s eyes widen in fear.

           EXT. BIRDIE HOUSE - NIGHT

           A full moon looms over the house. Crickets chirp.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A fire burns in the hearth. Mama stands there, staring at the 
           leaping tongues. Chewing her lip, and sipping from a wine 
           glass. Every so often she picks at the skin on her face.

           The Birdies enter solemnly, and sit cross-legged on the floor 
           with their iPads screens. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Nightingale will be our team leader 
                        tonight.

                                 TABITHA
                        Me? Wow, lit. Thanks. 

           She takes the iPad and sits in the massive throne like chair 
           before the fireplace. The Birdies fanning out before her. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see where we’re at...

           The leaderboard looms over them:

                   FAMILY ANALYTICS

                 Mama Bird -- 104,532,567
               *New* Nightingale -- 92,869,789 
                 Hawk & Dove -- 9,987,589

                   Bustard -- 938,899

           Mama stares at the fire, it plays on her face. Tabitha 
           scrolls through the iPad.

                        Okay, so, our subs have risen by 
                        five million in the past few weeks. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Thanks to you. You’re a YouTube 
                        sensation, Nightingale. Your 
                        transformation video demolished all 
                        of our previous view records. Not 
                        to mention your two million valid 
                        watch hours. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes, and I just beat the old 
                        Nightingale’s going away video. We 
                        might even be getting Diamond 
                        Status soon. We’re not too far off! 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Fifty grand per sponsored post, 
                        that’s quite the college fund, 
                        young lady. And that means the rest 
                        of you are going to have to work a 
                        lot harder now that Nightingale has 
                        set the bar so high for us...

           Tabitha blushes. The Birdies glare at her, simmering.

                                 LARK
                        Yea, but I had more views than Hawk 
                        and Dove last month, so how come 
                        I’m so low up there? 

                                 DOVE
                        It was a fluke. You got sympathy 
                        views cuz of your spinal bifida.

                                 LARK
                        That’s not true! 

                                 DOVE
                        If I had a hunchback and did a 
                        video about it, I’d be Diamond 
                        Status already!

                                 LARK
               (jumps to her feet)
                        Liar! Liar! Take it back!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Sit down.

           She sits down. Dove folds her arms and bristles. 
                                 TABITHA
                        Actually, Lark was smart to make a 
                        storytime about her struggles with 
                        Spinal Bifida. The metrics tell us 
                        that vulnerability is super on-
                        trend. Maybe you can do a video 
                        about how you grew up in a tool 
                        shed, Dove. People love that stuff.

           Dove narrows her brow.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Where are we at with Bustard?

           Tabitha looks up his analytics. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Well, unfortunately. He’s gone down 
                        another forty-five percent.

           Bustard plays with his fidget spinner. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        How are we gonna get those views 
                        up, kiddo? 

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m trying real hard to. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Let’s look at our short term goals.

           Bustard fumbles with his iPad as he pulls up his notes.

                                 BUSTARD
               (reading)
                        Some ideas I have is to use better 
                        keyword titles, richer and more 
                        descriptive keyword titles. I think 
                        part of the problem is my 
                        thumbnails aren’t very, um... I 
                        will make better more, like, 
                        clickbaity thumb--

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Ah, ah. We don’t say “clickbait!” 
                        It’s gauche.

                                 BUSTARD
                        More eye-catching thumbnails. 
                        Another idea is that I thought I’d 
                        have Nightingale appear as a guest.

                                 TABITHA
                        I don’t do collabs actually. Right, 
                        Mama? 
                                 BUSTARD
                        Oh.

                                 TABITHA
                        Sorry, no offense, it’s just that 
                        Mama says it would be confusing to 
                        my brand. 

           Mama gives her an encouraging nod. 

                                 BUSTARD
                        Oh, okay. Sorry.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Brand identity is a fickle food. 
                        You can’t do an ASMR video game 
                        crossover, they’re two very 
                        different content categories.

                                 TABITHA
                        Well, that’s not totally true, 
                        according to the drop off times, 
                        more people are falling asleep to 
                        Bustard’s videos than to mine.

           Mama Bird explodes with laughter. Slaps her knee. Tabitha 
           glows, so proud of her killer joke. 

           Bustard bows his head in shame. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Let me ask you a question. Do you 
                        even like gaming, Bustard? 

                                 BUSTARD
                        Yes. It’s my passion.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Could have fooled me. You know, 
                        sometimes I wonder if you’re birdie 
                        material at all...

           The birds start to SQUAWK and FLAP in their cages. Bustard 
           trembles. He’s sweating pretty bad.

                                 TABITHA
                        He could pivot.

           Everyone looks at Tabitha.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Say more.

                                 TABITHA
                        Well, maybe he could find something 
                        else on trend...
                                 BUSTARD
                        But... Gaming’s the only thing I’m 
                        good at...

                                 TABITHA
                        Expand your horizons, take some 
                        chances. There’s a lot of content 
                        out there nowadays and you have to 
                        ask yourself, how can I cut through 
                        the clutter? Be brave! Don’t play 
                        it so safe. I mean, think outside 
                        the X-box for a change... 

           This hits Bustard hard. He can’t even look at her.

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (laughs)
                        You’re on a roll tonight with your 
                        quips. You should tweet that. 

           She takes out her phone and tweets: Bustard should think 
           outside the X-Box for a change! #zzzz

           People start instantly retweeting her. 

                                 BUSTARD
               (to Tabitha)
                        But... You said that, like, 
                        YouTube’s about family, not 
                        views...

           Mama Bird and Tabitha exchange looks. 

                                 TABITHA
                        It is about family. That’s all it’s 
                        ever been about. Cuz if you really 
                        stop and think about it... YouTube 
                        is the family business. If we were 
                        farmers, I bet Mama would expect us 
                        to wake up at the crack of dawn and 
                        muck the stalls. Right, Mama? But 
                        lucky for us, we’re YouTubers, so I 
                        guess we just gotta keep those 
                        views up.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        That’s my girl.

           Tabitha glows. Bustard chucks his fidget spinner into the 
           fire. It melts and burns. 

           Suddenly -- DING! DING! DING!

           They all look up at the leaderboard. Tabitha’s views 
           increase, sending her rising in the ranks. 

           She passes Mama -- 
                Nightingale -- 112,899,589 

                 Mama Bird -- 104,532,567

           Tabitha smiles and blushes, batting her eyes. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh wow! Papa must have uploaded my 
                        new lullaby. It looks like I’m 
                        number one now. Cool!

           Her smile fades when she sees the Birdies staring at her in 
           abject horror. 

           She looks at Mama. Craning at the board with her mouth agape. 
           Fist clenched. Gripping her wine glass, and shaking with 
           anger. She slowly turns and locks eyes with Tabitha.

           The wine glass EXPLODES in her hand. She squeezes the shards 
           of glass in her fist. Blood and wine and spills down her 
           sleeve. Pet birds jump about and beat their wings. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Mama, you’re hurt!

           Mama sucks in a breath, like the wind was just knocked out of 
           her. She leans against the wall for balance. Blood gushing. 
           She drops the glass.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Mama, are you okay?!

           Tabitha goes to her, touches her back, but Mama reels away. 
           Looks at Tabitha like she’s evil incarnate. Like she’s afraid 
           of her. She backs away, trying not to make any sudden moves. 

           Mama backs towards the hallway, never breaking eye contact, 
           blood smears the wall as she feels her way.

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (chokes)
                        Mama needs some m-m-me time.

           Mama turns and sprints down the hallway towards her room --
           WHAMM!!! She slams the door behind her. Silence. 

                                 TABITHA
                        What happened?

                                 LARK
                        No one’s ever gotten more views 
                        than Mama before...

                                 FINCH
                        I guess she doesn’t like that.

           Tabitha looks horrified. 
                                 TABITHA
                        ...I didn’t know.

           INT. MAMA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mama stands before her mirror, trying frantically to make 
           herself look cute.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Leave me alone, leave me alone--

           She puts on her mauve Fedora hat, makes a duck face, hides 
           her bloody hand, and snaps a selfie. Hands trembling, she 
           posts the picture on Instagram with the caption:

               Still got it! #Birdielife #blessed

           A little blood smears across the screen, and she cleans it 
           off. Collapses on her bed. Blood stains the sheets. Taking 
           deep breaths. Trying to ward off a panic attack. 

           She looks down at her phone. Blowing up. A flood of LIKES. 
           She lets them wash over her. Each one blossoming in her gut 
           like a warm flower. Calming, she collapses on the bed and 
           breathes in the validation. It’s good.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t. Don’t you dare--

           But she does. She scrolls down to the comment section.

                   EW! UGLY AND OLD!
                   you don’t got it
                 No one likes you cow - sad
                  kill yourself, bitch
                    UNSUBSCRIBE!!

           The spell is broken. She lowers the phone, and starts to bawl 
           like a newborn. She looks over at the mirror. Sees herself 
           staring back. She looks so stupid in that hat. She pulls it 
           off her head, jumps to her feet, and ATTACKS THE MIRROR, 
           raining down blows until it SHATTERS, and her knuckles bleed. 
           She grabs a shard of glass off the floor, and grips it tight.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           THE SCREAMS start wafting out of Mama’s room. The Birdies fan 
           out around Tabitha. And darken. 

                                 HAWK
                        Don’t mess this up for us, Tabitha.

                                 TABITHA
                        What? But, I--
                                 DOVE
                        --Mama is very fragile right now, 
                        and we need to try our best not to 
                        upset her. 

           There’s a “The Shining” Twins vibe there.

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m trying, I am--

                                 LARK
                        --Try harder.

                                 DOVE
                        We can’t let her burn out.

                                 FINCH
                        We have to be there for her. Like 
                        she was there for us. 

                                 DOVE
                        We’re very lucky birds.

                                 LARK
                        My foster mom made me live in the 
                        tool shed, because I was different.

                                 HAWK
                        Me and Dove were sold on the dark web.

                        When I was three, the cops found me 
                        wandering down a highway twice in 
                        one week. 

                                 HAWK
                        I’m not going back into the system. 

                                 DOVE
                        I’m never going back there.

                                 HAWK
                        You better make this right. 

           Bustard gets up and BOLTS up the stairs. Pet birds SQUAWK. 
           Mama screams.

           EXT. BIRDIE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mama’s screams are louder and horrible. They infect the 
           silent night. She screams like a banshee born in hell. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s empty and silent. Except for Mama’s screams, and --
           Ticktickticktickticktickticktick...

           The rise has slowed, they’re only jumping hundreds at time 
           now, instead of thousands. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

           INT. BUSTARD'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Bustard’s computer lies in a heaping pile in the corner. 
           Trashed. Cracked. The keyboard split in two. 

           He is staring out the window, at THE POOL. He is still 
           gripping his mouse. It’s not connected to anything. 

                                 BUSTARD
                        Like and sup-scribe. Like an sub-- 
                        Like and sub-cribe...

           Steam rises from the heated water. It’s calling him. He can’t 
           look away. And Mama screams and screams.

           INT. TABITHA'S CLOSET - NIGHT

           Tabitha is curled up on the floor with the iPad, watching 
           Mama Bird do her make-up. THIS VIDEO has 23 million views:  

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Our new Birdie is glamming out hard 
                        today with a once in a lifetime 
                        Mama Bird Special! Nothing makes me 
                        happier than doing make-up for 
                        someone I love. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama? Can I say something? 
                        Remember, Birders at home -- you 
                        are beautiful whether you choose to 
                        wear makeup or not. Don’t feel 
                        pressured to wear it just because I 
                        do. You do you. 

           Mama kisses her on the head. Tabitha shudders with love.

                                BACK TO:

           Tabitha LIKES Mama’s video, leaves a comment: 

              “Mama Bird is the best of all by far.”

           She refreshes the video. Over and over. Trying to get Mama 
           more views. 23,134,801 -- Refresh!

           She sighs. This is going to take a long time.

           WOOSHHH! THE CLOSET DOOR SWINGS OPEN!! 

           Tabitha SCREAMS! Mama is standing above her. Backlit by the 
           night. Holding her selfie stick, filming. No make-up. Face 
           covered with scars from picking.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Are you hiding from me, kiddo? 

                                 TABITHA
                        No!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What are you watching?

                                 TABITHA
                        Just you... like always.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You look frightened.... Are you 
                        afraid of me?

                                 TABITHA
                        No! Of course not!

           Mama climbs into the closet again. Filming.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        It’s okay to be afraid, it’s wise 
                        to fear the creator... 

                                 TABITHA
                        Please don’t be mad at me, mama.

           The smile falls off Mama’s face. She starts picking. The 
           nightingale stops singing in it’s cage. Like it knows.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        No. 

           She turns the camera off. Powers it down. It whirrs and dies. 
           Her smiles powers down, too.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        You can’t call me that anymore.

                                 TABITHA
                        Can’t call you what?
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’re not my daughter.

                                 TABITHA
                        What?!

           Mama snuggles up beside her. Too close.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        As long as the camera’s on, I will 
                        love you with all of my heart. But 
                        the camera’s off now, Tabitha. 
               (smiles)
                        You need to understand. You are my 
                        content. I am your creator. You are 
                        my raw clay for molding. You’re not 
                        my Nightingale, you are my parrot. 
                        Understand? 

           Tabitha is horrified. Teeth chatter with fear. The 
           nightingale chirps like it’s going mad.  

                                 TABITHA
                        You don’t mean that... 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What do you want from me?

                                 TABITHA
                        What?! I don’t want anything!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You want my channel. You want my 
                        subs. You want my views.

                                 TABITHA
                        No, I don’t care about that!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You don’t love me. You never did.

                                 TABITHA
                        I love you so much.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You tricked me! You want my 
                        Birdies. That’s what you want. You 
                        want to take them away from me. 
                        You’re a troll...

                                 TABITHA
                        No! I didn’t mean to get more views 
                        than you, it was a mistake!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        AFTER ALL I’VE DONE FOR YOU! AFTER 
                        ALL I’VE DONE! 
           Mama grabs Tabitha, but instead of hurting her, she hugs her 
           close, strangling her with love. Spit flying as she screams: 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?! YOU 
                        NAUGHTY BIRD! I’LL CLIP YOUR WINGS! 
                        I’LL CLIP YOUR WINGS, YOU NAUGHTY 
                        BIRD!

           Hugging her so tight she can’t breathe. Suddenly, she lets 
           go. Tabitha sucks in a breath, and bursts into tears. 

           Mama smears her tears away.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Save it for the cameras, dear.

           Tabitha notices a symbol that has been freshly carved into 
           Mama’s arm. A crude thumbs up Like button. It bleeds. Mama 
           climbs to her feet.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid there has to be a 
                        consequence. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Please...

           Mama walks to the birdcage, where the nightingale is flipping 
           out. Squeaking and screaming. 

           She opens the cage, and removes the little bird from its 
           perch, cradling it with love. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Pretty bird.

           The nightingale tweets and sings and--

           WHAMMM!!!! CRUNCH!!! MAMA SMASHES IT AGAINST THE DESK!!!

           The squawking stops instantly.

           WHAMM! WHAMM! WHAMMM!! The crunch of bones, the splatter of 
           blood, and Tabitha is screaming. 

           Mama drops the dead bird on the carpet. Blood oozing from its 
           decimated little body. Broken wing twitching spastically. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        You flew too close to the sun. And 
                        it won’t happen again.

           Mama smiles at Tabitha, wiping the blood on her pants like 
           it’s only a bit of dust. 
                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        The costumes arrived for your music 
                        video. They’re just perfect. Be up 
                        and ready early tomorrow morning...
               (smiles)
                        We’ve plateaued at eight million 
                        subs. We’re going to have to do 
                        something truly spectacular to get 
                        that Diamond Status...

           Mama crosses the room, making her way to the door. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and don’t even think about 
                        calling Mrs. Bollinger, or that old 
                        troll, or running away like your 
                        ungrateful sister. That will never 
                        happen again. We donated another 
                        five million to Child and Family 
                        Services. These budget cuts really 
                        are a travesty. It’s the children 
                        who suffer. I think they’re 
                        starting to depend on us... 

           She opens the door, turns back and smiles. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        It turns out you are Birdie 
                        Material after all, Tabitha. You 
                        are consistent. Reliable. And 
                        you’ll never leave this nest. This 
                        is your forever home. 

           And with that, she’s gone. The first rays of morning punch 
           through the blinds and make the dead bird glow on the carpet. 

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s not her, it’s the burnout, 
                        it’s not her it’s the burnout, it’s 
                        not her it’s the b--

           And then something catches her eye out the window -- 

           IT’S BUSTARD.

           Walking on the roof. He’s dressed like a ninja.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Bustard?!

           A blast of wind, and Bustard slips a little as he moves past 
           the window, and out of sight.

           Tabitha gasp, and runs to the window. Throws it open.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Bustard?!
           ON THE ROOF --

           The sun explodes over the distant mountains beyond as Bustard 
           navigates the steep, sharp angles of the roof. He talks to 
           his CAMERA on a selfie stick as he walks.

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m Bustard THE STUNT BIRD! Welcome 
                        to my new and improved channel! 
                        STUNT BIRDZ USA! I’m going to be 
                        doing a bunch of wild and crazy 
                        death defying feats for you guys, 
                        so don’t forget to smash that Like 
                        button!

           He jumps and does a little karate kick. A loose shingle 
           falls. The roof is slick.

                                 TABITHA
                        Bustard! Get inside! What are you 
                        doing?!

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m rebranding like you said!

           He keeps climbing up the roof.  

                                 TABITHA
                        I didn’t mean it like this!

                                 BUSTARD
               (horrified)
                        I’m not playing it so safe!

           Suddenly -- Mama Bird grabs Tabitha by the arm and JERKS HER 
           INSIDE!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        NEVER INTERRUPT A BIRDIE WHEN HE’S 
                        MAKING CONTENT! 

           Her horrible bleeding face. Tabitha reels back as Mama grips 
           her wrists and blocks the window. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Make him stop!!!

           Tabitha rips away -- glares at Mama. Hates what she sees. And 
           then she runs out the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Tabitha flies down the hallway, knocking on everyone’s doors. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Wake up! Wake up! You have to help 
                        me! Bustard’s gonna break his neck!
           The Birdies emerge, wiping the sleep from their eyes. 

           EXT. BIRDIE HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT

           Tabitha and the Birdies run out of the house, and spot 
           Bustard on the roof filming himself. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Bustard!

           Papa trails.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Bustard, get down! If you fall, 
                        they’ll shut us down so fast it 
                        will make your head spin!

                                 BUSTARD
               (to the camera)
                        Today I’m going to scale to the top 
                        of the chimney and jump off into 
                        the pool! I’m a professional, so 
                        don’t try this at-- oops!

           He slips, nearly falls, but catches himself. They all scream. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Bustard, come down at once or there 
                        will be a consequence!

           Bustard smiles through uncut fear.

                                 BUSTARD
                        It’s okay, Papa! I’m not afraid! 

              HAWK
                              LARK
           Don’t be an idiot!
                        Bustard!

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m gonna get the most views!

           He starts towards the chimney, petrified.  Suddenly --

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        Good job, honey! Good pivot! Stunt 
                        content is always on trend! 

           Mama pokes her head out of the window. Smiling big and wrong. 
           Make-up smeared, mascara dripping, and she’s filming Bustard.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Mama stop! We can’t afford an 
                        accident!

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m gonna jump in the pool, mama! 
                        I’m gonna go viral for you!
           She hangs out the window for a better shot. Manic and 
           exploding with enthusiasm. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I got another angle, sweetie bird! 
                        Mama won’t miss a thing! 

                                 LARK
                        Mama, don’t say that!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        He’s going to break his neck! 

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m gonna get you Diamond Status!!!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I know you will, baby bird!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Something’s wrong with mama!

                                 LARK
                        She’s in a burnout! 

                                 TABITHA
                        She’s fucking nuts.

           Tabitha turns and runs back into the house. 

                                 MAMA BIRD

                        Mama! I did it! I said it!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        That’s my boy!

           Bustard swells with pride, and starts to scale the chimney. 

           INT. BIRDIE HOUSE - DAY

           Tabitha runs up the stairs, skipping steps. 

           INT. TABITHA'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Tabitha enters. Mama is hanging out the window filming. 
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Danger is your middle name, love!

                                 TABITHA
                        Stop it!

           Tabitha tries to pull Mama Bird inside. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Tell him to get inside!

           Tabitha grabs Mama by the shirt, and pulls her back in.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Now! Tell him!

           Mama lowers the camera, and looks at Tabitha with her cold 
           dead eyes. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’re a troll.

                                 TABITHA
                        You’re crazy!

           Tabitha leaps on Mama, she screams and Tabitha kicks her and 
           slaps her. Mamma grabs her by the shirt and pushes her into 
           the closet. WHAMMM!!! Slams the door and locks it.  

           INT. CLOSET - DAY

           Tabitha screams and starts slamming the door with her feet, 
           but it won’t budge. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        You know what we do with trolls, 
                        Tabitha? We delete them.

           Mama Bird goes back to encouraging Bustard. 

           She remembers -- She grabs her iPad, sitting on the floor. 
           She clicks a contact, and FaceTimes Dove. 

           Dove answers, worried. 

                                 DOVE
                        Gale?

                                 TABITHA
                        Dove, you gotta help me, Mama 
                        locked me in the closet, and I 
                        gotta help Bus--

           --GZZZTT. The feed dies. 

                   Connection Lost.
           Suddenly -- BLINNNNGGGGG!!!! Incoming FaceTime Call. She 
           answers. It’s Mama’s horrible picked and festering face. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You shouldn’t have done that.

           Mama hangs up. 

                 Parental lock activated. 

           BLING! Her wi-fi dies. The bars vanish on her phone service. 

           EXT. BIRDIE HOUSE - YARD - DAY

           Papa runs across the lawn with the ladder, muttering in 
           Swedish. Bustard is climbing up the chimney, hugging it tight 
           as his little feet slip. 

           EXT. ROOF - DAY

           Bustard finally reaches the top of the chimney, it’s barely 
           wide enough for both of his feet. So high up now. 

           He looks up at the pool below. Further than he thought. He 
           holds out his selfie stick.

                                 BUSTARD
                        Look at me! Look at me!

           Mama climbs out on to the roof for a better shot. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        A bird’s eye view, honey! 

           Papa starts climbing up the ladder on to the roof--

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        I’m coming, Bustard!

                                 BUSTARD
                        I’m not afraid! Birdies can fly! 

           Mama kicks Papa’s ladder with him on it. 

           He falls and HITS THE GROUND HARD. He moans. The Birdies 
           swarm him and try to help him. 

                                 LARK
                        Papa! Papa!

                                 BUSTARD
                        I can fly! I’m the best Birdie! I’m 
                        the best Birdie!

           Tears falls down his terrified face.
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Look at my brave bird!

           Mama is picking her face, and pulsing with sweaty joy.

           INT. TABITHA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Dove enters the room. She sees Mama through the window, on 
           the roof. Facing away. She creeps across the carpet, quiet, 
           unlocks the closet, and frees Tabitha. Puts a finger to her 
           lips. Shhhh. They creep out of the room together. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           They hurry down the hallway.

                                 DOVE
                        It’s all burnout now! There’s no 
                        mama left!

                                 TABITHA
                        I have to get on the roof.

           EXT. ROOF - DAY

           Mama films Bustard standing on top of the chimney, looking 
           down at the pool. Trying to work up the courage to jump. 

                                 BUSTARD
                        You can do it. You can do it.

           His foot slips a little and pebbles rain down into the pool. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Go on and jump, baby! Do it for the 
                        Birders, all your wonderful fans!

                                 TABITHA (O.S.)
                        Bustard! Stop!

           He looks at Tabitha, she’s climbing out the opposite window. 
           They are on opposite sides of the roof, perfectly symmetrical 
           with Mama, like the angel and the devil. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You jump in that pool, Bustard! 

                                 TABITHA
                        Don’t listen to her! Please come 
                        down! Please! 

           He looks at Tabitha. Listening. Trying to balance himself.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want you to get hurt! 
                        You’re my little baby brother now, 
                        you’re my family! 
                                 BUSTARD
                        This is the family business! I’m 
                        thinking outside the X-Box!

                                 TABITHA
                        You could die!

                                 BUSTARD
                        Good! That’s what everyone wants, 
                        isn’t it?! I’m the worst Birdie and 
                        everybody hates my guts!

                                 TABITHA
                        Not me! I love you so much! I never 
                        had a brother before! I just got 
                        you, and I don’t want to lose you 
                        now! Please! I’m sorry for what I 
                        said, I’m sorry if I made you feel 
                        like you weren’t good enough. That 
                        was Nightingale talking, but I’m 
                        not her anymore. I’m Tabitha, and I 
                        think you’re the coolest!  

           He takes a breath. Starting to come to his senses.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Farhad. Come down. 

           He sees the love in her eyes. He sees her reaching for him. 
           He nods. 

                                 BUSTARD
                        Okay... I’m... I’m coming down... 

           Starts to climbs down. Tabitha breathes relived. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        No! A good Birdie finishes what he 
                        starts! 

                                 TABITHA
                        Shut up!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Rules are rules for a reason! 
                        Consistency is key! Consistency is 
                        key! Consistency is--

                                 TABITHA
                        --Fuck consistency! And fuck you!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        FINISH YOUR CONTENT, BUSTARD! OR 
                        I’LL SEND YOU BACK TO THE TUNNELS 
                        WHERE YOU BELONG! AND YOU’LL BE THE

           Bustard gasps, and -- SLIPS. 

           Everyone screams. Papa jumps to his feet.

           But Bustard falls backwards instead -- WHAPPP!!!! He hits the 
           roof back-first and slides down Mama’s side, tumbling and pin-
           balling towards her.

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama!

           But she doesn’t try to save him. Just films him roll right 
           past her feet, down the roof, towards the edge and --

           WHOOOSHHHH!!!!! Bustard flies off the roof in SLOW MOTION.

           Papa running to catch him.

           Bustard flying.

           Tabitha’s mouth falling open.

           The Birdies are running for him.

           Mama filming, smiling.

           Papa extends his arms, running...

           Bustard flying. Falling. Running. Filming.

           Bustard flaps his arms. A Hail Mary. But he can’t fly after 
           all, and Papa he can’t get there in time -- 

           WAHMMMM!!!!! Bustard hits the ground hard -- CRACK!!!

           He SCREAMS so loud it scatters the birds in the trees.

           His arm is bent back in an impossible direction. 

           The Birdies surround him.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Give him space!

           Tabitha runs out the door, towards them. 

                                 DOVE
                        He’s alive! He’s okay!

           Mama films her screaming boy. Pale and grinning like Robert 
           Blake in “Lost Highway.” Her flowing white things flapping in 
           the wind. She turns it on herself, suddenly coming alive.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        HI, BIRD WATCHERS! IT’S MAMA BIRD

           Papa locks eyes with Mama up there. She levels her camera at 
           him. Tabitha puts her hand on Papa’s shoulder.

                                 TABITHA
                        Papa... Pull the car around. We 
                        have to get him to the hospital.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        She’s not gonna like that. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Papa. Now.

           Finally, he nods. Jumps to his feet, and runs off. Tabitha 
           kneels next to Bustard. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Where’d she go?

           They look back up at the roof. Mama is gone. 

           Papa pulls the SUV up. He hops out. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Bustard, can you walk?

                                 BUSTARD
               (wheezing)
                        I can do it. I can do anything. 
                        Danger is my middle name.

           He cries out as they help him to the car. Tabitha opens the 
           door for him.

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        DON’T LEAVE MEEEEEE!

           Mama is barreling out of the house in a dead sprint. 

             TABITHA
                             PAPA BIRD
           Hurry!
                        För fan i helvete!

           They get Bustard in the back. And pile into the car. 
           Mama on their tail, gripping her selfie stick like a weapon -- 
           slicing the air like its a sword, the wind whipping through 
           her hair, her face a mask of horror, her blood-curdling 
           SCREAMS wafting across the world...

           She bears down and SWINGS the stick -- CRASHHH!!! The window 
           EXPLODES, showering the screaming children with glass.

           INT. JAGUAR SUV - DAY

           Papa stomps on the gas. VROOOOOOMMM!!!! Tires squeal as they 
           tear down the driveway. Horrified, wiping away the glass.

                                 TABITHA
                        Seatbelts!

           They all buckle in.  

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.)
                        NO! NO! DON’T LEAVE ME!

           Tabitha looks back and sees Mama chasing them down, her eyes 
           are like hot marbles. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        PLEASE!

           WOOOOOSHHH! They speed towards the gate. Papa hits the 
           clicker button. The gate opens. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Faster, Papa!

           He glances at Mama in the rearview -- Running and screaming, 
           arms flailing. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        DON’T LEEEEEEAAVVEEEEE MEEEE!

           Suddenly -- REEEEEEEEE!!!!!! He slams on the breaks. They all 
           lurch forward. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Papa?

           He hesitates. Looking at Mama in the mirror. Running at them, 
           screaming in pain, holding out her arms, screaming for Papa.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        I can’t.

                                 TABITHA
                        What?!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        I can’t leave her.
                                 TABITHA
                        Papa, drive!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        She needs me.

                                 TABITHA
                        She’s out of her mind!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        She wouldn’t hurt a flea! She’s 
                        just a little tired is all!

                                 DOVE
                        Go, go, go!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        We’re all a little tired, we all 
                        just need to calm down.

                                 LARK
                        Papa, something’s wrong with her!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        She’ll be her old self in the 
                        morning, like always! We’ll go on a 
                        family vacation, and decompress! We 
                        won’t even film it!

                                 HAWK
                        Pleeeease go!

           Mama is getting closer. Screaming, and swinging her stick. 
           The Birdies are screaming. 

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        I’m sorry... I can’t leave Mama 
                        Bird... I can’t... she’s my family. 

           He closes the gate -- THUMPPPPP! Mama is bearing down.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        WHAT ABOUT MY DIAMOND STATUS???!!!!

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        It’s okay, Mama! 
               (opening the door)
                        We’re not going anywhere! We’re 
                        never leaving!

           Suddenly, Tabitha leaps across the seat and SLAMS ON THE GAS. 
           Papa starts screaming in Swedish as they rocket forward, Papa 
           fighting Tabitha and she’s no match, until-- 

                                 DOVE
                        Birdie Cuddle!
           All the Birdies pile on Papa, and hold him back with their 
           hugs as -- WHAMMMMMM!!!! 

           They crash through the gates, turning them into a heap of 
           twisted metal and flying sparks, and Tabitha takes the wheel 
           as Papa tries to fight the Birdies’ suffocating love, but 
           they’re rabid and hold him so tight he can’t breath because 
           he’s no match for their embrace! 

           Lark starts beating Papa mercilessly with her crutch.

                                 BUSTARD
                        Do you know how to drive?!

                                 TABITHA
                        No! Do you?!

           They fly down the narrow dirt road, with trees blurring past.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mama takes out her cell phone and pulls up the JAGUAR app.

           THE SUV SPINS OUT, CAREENING FOR A DITCH --

           The Birdies lurching forward, as the SUV FLIPS!!!!

           Somersaulting through the air IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION.

           Up is down and down is up and --

           The seatbelt-less Birdies are screaming, tumbling like 
           laundry in the dryer, hair standing on end, cell phones on 
           the ceiling as they flip and flip and flip and --

           And we catch a glimpse of Mama filming the car crash as--
           Tabitha is launched through a windshield like a missile. 

                                 CUT TO:
           BLACK

           THE SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING. 

           Tabitha opens her eyes. Dusty morning light cuts through the 
           canopies. Her eyes adjust and she scans the scene. It’s bad.

           Birdies scattered around THE WOODS. Thrown from the vehicle.

           Lark’s crutches are strewn in the leaves. Dove moaning. Lark 
           bleeding. Finch stirring, unconscious. 

           Hawk doesn’t look like he’s moving at all.

           Bustard, the only one wearing a seatbelt, is hanging upside 
           down in the flipped and smoking SUV. Crying. Scared.

           Tabitha in and out of consciousness. Blood in her eyes.

           She hears footsteps, and sees Mama wandering amongst the 
           wreckage like a wraith. She grips her selfie stick a little 
           too tight. Her face is slack as she stands over Papa Bird who 
           is leaning against a tree, battered and bloodied and trying 
           like hell to breathe. 

           Tabitha fights sleep, struggling to keep her eyes open. She 
           watches as Mama lifts her camera and films Papa. He stares up 
           at her, eyes pleading, and then spikes the lens.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        Help me... Megen, help me...

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You want to take my Birdies, too.

                                 PAPA BIRD
                        No... I would never... I... love 
                        you... I...

           Blood oozing from his gut. Pooling around him. He looks a 
           little like that dead bird. Mama is silent. Staring.

                                 PAPA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        I’ve loved you... Since... the 
                        moment I saw you... on my screen...
               (a stab of pain)
                        And I heard your sad story, and I 
                        heard my story in yours, and for 
                        the first time in my life, I knew I 
                        wasn’t alone. I’m your number one 
                        fan. I scrolled to the comments 
                        section, and wrote “first.” And you 
                        liked my comment and...
               (a bloody smile)
                        I was the first Birder, Megen. Me.

           He grabs her ankle. Clutching it. Desperate. Choking. 
                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Thanks for watching. 

           She raises the selfie stick like a bludgeon and brings it 
           down hard on his face.

           WHAMMM! WHAMM! WHAMM! WHAMM! Harder and harder, like a mad 
           conductor, his blood powders her cheeks like blush. 

           And the camera she’s killing him with is recording his death. 

           Blood splatters the lens as she caves in his face. Finally, 
           Papa Bird gurgles and dies. His face is a mask of mangled 
           flesh. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        That’s the moment right there.

           Tabitha passes out cold.

           WE SLOWLY WIDEN TO REVEAL THE CRACKED TABLET SCREEN THAT 
           PLAYS THIS YOU TUBE VIDEO.

           We’re in a DARK ROOM. Pitch black, but for the warm glow of 
           THE VIDEO lighting up BABY TABITHA’S face, and reflecting in 
           her big brown eyes. She’s three-years-old, and the tablet is 
           her blanky. It’s the same one she had in the opening.

              “Mama Bird’s MOMMY TIPS. 10/23/11” 

           This video has 400 views, and 200 of them are probably Baby 
           Tabitha’s. She coos, under the hypnotic spell of the lullaby. 
           The tablet battery is at 1%. The screen dies, killing the 
           love and plunging Baby Tabitha into darkness. She cries out, 
           frightened. 

                                 BABY TABITHA
                        Birdie! 

           Tabitha pushes open the door to reveal -- A NIGHTMARISH 
           HOARDER HOUSE. A backlit jungle of stuff stacked at severe 
           angles. Piles of clothes, trash. The skeletons of broken 
           shelves buckling under the load. Leaning towers of newspapers 
           hunched like ghosts in the dark. 

           Baby Tabitha emerges from THE CLOSET in her dirty onesie, 
           clinging to the dead tablet. It’s heavy and she struggles. 
           She navigates through a path of stuff stacked taller than she 
           is. Past a spoon, bent and burnt on the carpet. 

           We hear the buzz of FLIES as Baby Tabitha approaches her 
           BIRTH MOTHER, in dull red hair in nightgown, slumped in a 
           sofa. Her face is lost in shadow. The tablet charger wrapped 
           snugly around her arm like a makeshift tourniquet. 

                                 BABY TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Mama? Can I have the Birdie?

           Tabitha holds up the dead tablet for her mother. Pushes it at 
           her, but it’s too heavy and she drops it. 

                                 BABY TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Birdies, Mama... please.

           Frustrated, she tugs at her Mother’s dangling tourniquet, 
           causing her to lurch forward, into the dull moonlight... 

           She’s long dead. Blue eyes pop against her waxy gray flesh. 

           Tabitha stares at her mother’s face. Not afraid... not yet... 
           just curious... confused... unable to process...

           Finally, she just turns and waddles back to the safety of --

           THE CLOSET

           Where she shuts the door forever, and curls up in laundry 
           basket, trying her best to keep the song alive...

                                 BABY TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Huh... ill... bebe... Dun say 
                        wor... mam gonnnnn by by... mockab-
                        a-rrrrrrr...

           She sings herself to sleep.
           INT. BASEMENT - REALITY

           TABITHA SNAPS AWAKE, opens her eyes. It’s dark down here in 
           the basement. Filled with BIRD AND WATERFOWL TAXIDERMY 
           perched on branches and in decorative nests. Frozen in mid-
           flight. Hundreds of boxes of bizarre, and inexplicable 
           YOUTUBE VIDEO props and a store of unopened Amazon packages.  

           Tabitha sits up, and looks around. She see the bars, and 
           realizes she’s sitting in the GIANT HUMAN-SIZED BIRDCAGE from 
           the title sequence. An indulgent prop. She sees her brothers 
           and sisters sitting in the cage with her. 

           They are all wearing elaborate DUCK COSTUMES with hoods that 
           have eyes and beaks. 

                                 DOVE
                        You’re awake.

           Their cuts and scrapes have been and mended. And covered with 
           make-up. They look good as new, a Mama Bird special!

           Tabitha extends her fabric wings. Bustard’s left wing has 
           been modified to fit the makeshift splint on his broken arm. 

                                 TABITHA
                        How long have we been down here?

                                 LARK
                        I don’t know.

                                 HAWK
               (looking at the costume)
                        Why are we wearing these?

                                 TABITHA
               (gulps)
                        “Five Little Ducks.”

                                 FINCH
                        I’m scared.

                                 TABITHA
                        Everything’s gonna be okay.
               (to Bustard)
                        Are you okay, Bustard?

                                 BUSTARD
                        It hurts... it hurts...

                                 TABITHA
                        We’re gonna get out of here. We’re 
                        gonna get you to the hospital. 

           They all huddle and hug. A Birdie Cuddle.
                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me. No matter what 
                        happens, we’ll always stick 
                        together. If we stick together, 
                        nothing bad can happen, because 
                        we’re a family, and we’ll always 
                        have each other’s backs.

                                 FINCH
                        I’m happy you’re my sister.

           It makes her smile. FOOTSTEPS.

           Tabitha tries to squeeze through the bars, but they’re too 
           tight. She rams her shoulder against them. No avail.

                                 LARK
                        Shhhhh. She’s coming. 

           Lumbering down the stairs. Mama emerges into the dull light, 
           with a smile is so big it boxes her ears. She’s her old 
           beautiful self again. Her hands are smeared with green paint. 
           Freshly spray painted GREEN SHACKLES slung over her shoulder. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Hello, Birdies! I hope you had a 
                        good rest! 

           They all moan and stir.

                                 DOVE
               (horrified)
                        You killed, Papa!

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (huffs)
                        Don’t be silly. It’s almost five 
                        PM, we have to get cracking on 
                        Gale’s new music video if we’re 
                        going to make our deadline!
               (jumps for joy)
                        NOW LET’S!! MAKE!! SOME!! 
                        CONTENT!!!

           She chucks the shackles on the ground before them. 

           EXT. BIRDIE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           The sun looms over the soaring mountains. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           The Birdies are shackled to the green cinderblocks before the 
           massive GREEN SCREEN. 
           Tabitha stands stiffly, sweating under the hot stare of 
           lights. The duck costume is stifling. A boom mic hangs over 
           her head like the Sword of Damocles. 

                                 TABITHA
               (singing)
                        Five little ducks went out one day
                        Over the hill and far away...

           The Birdies, in so much pain, do a choreographed duck waddle 
           dance. It’s hard to do with shackles on, but they do their 
           best. Bustard is ghost white, and sweating, his arm has 
           swelled to twice its size. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
               (singing)
                        Mother duck said, "Quack, quack, 
                        quack, quack.” But only four little 
                        ducks came back--

           Mama looks up from behind the camera. The deadly selfie stick 
           at the ready. 

                                 MAMA BIRD 
                        No, no. That’s not right. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Mama, it hurts, it hurts to sing... 
                        I think I hurt my ribs bad...

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        You’re going to have to do better 
                        if we’re gonna get Diamond Status. 
                        You know that, dear.  

                                 BUSTARD
               (whimpering)
                        My arm... my arm...

                                 LARK
                        I think I’m bleeding bad.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Oh, don’t you start, too!

           Her duck costume is soaked in blood. 

                                 FINCH
                        Please, Mama! Please! This thing is 
                        hurting my foot!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        We have to upload on time, we have 
                        to make our deadline. Consistency 
                        is key. Consistency is key. 
                        Consistency is key. 
           Mama Bird is adjusting the green screen graphics. There is a 
           cartoon pond and hills behind them. The shackles have been 
           keyed out. She starts to pace, chipper, gripping the stick so 
           tight it whitens her knuckles.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Consistency is keeeeey! 

                                 TABITHA
                        Please, just let us rest...

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Not until you give me the tingle.

           Mama starts to music over. Tabitha and the Birdies try again. 
           But they’re so exhausted and dragging. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Five little ducks went out one day
                        Over the hill and far a--

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        NO! I’M NOT GETTING THE TINGLE! DO 
                        YOU SEE THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY 
                        NECK STANDING UP?! DO I LOOK 
                        RELAXED TO YOU?!

           The pet birds start to ruffle in its cage. Their song is a 
           sick SQUAWK. Mama groans and chews on her fingernails.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        This is so, so FRUSTRATING!

           Dove’s eyes roll back in her head, and she faints.

                                 LARK
                        Dove!

           The Birdies go to Dove and help her up. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Oh, don’t be such a drama queen.

                                 TABITHA
                        She needs water!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        If at first you don’t succeed, try, 
                        try again!

           Dove shakes it off.

                                 DOVE
                        It’s okay, it’s okay...

           Tabitha is starting to sweat off her make-up, under the 
           sizzling stare of the lights.
                                 MAMA BIRD
               (dark)
                        Again.

           She starts the music. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Five little--

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        No... No, that’s not right...

           Tabitha swallows her song. The Birdies start crying.

                                 FINCH
                        Please, mama!!

           The pet birds are going crazy, doing backflips off their 
           perches and pin-balling around. 

           A pool of urine gathers at Finch’s feet, his costume soiled, 
           and he cries and cries. Mama turns and looks at herself in 
           the monitor. She’s looks so pretty. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        I’m feeling the frustration in your 
                        voice, Nightingale. It just won’t 
                        do. How can you expect to relax 
                        your audience if you’re not relaxed 
                        yourself? Take a heart-focused 
                        breath, count to five. And relax.

           Tabitha locks eyes with Mama. 

                                 TABITHA
                        No.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What?

                                 TABITHA
                        I won’t do it. 

           Tabitha takes off her wing and throws it at her feet. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What did I say about talking back?!

           Mama charges and -- WHAPPPP!!! Slaps Tabitha across the face. 
           She reels back in pain, holding her cheek. And then THE 
           PERFECT ASMR VOICE FLUTTERS THROUGH THE HOUSE. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE (O.S.)
                        Five little ducks went out one day, 
                        over the hill and far away...

           Mama freezes. Under a spell. 
           QUICK SHOTS: The hair on the back of Mama’s neck stands. Her 
           pupils dilate. Gooseflesh spreads down her arm. The Tingle. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE (CONT’D)
                        Mother duck said, "Quack, quack, 
                        quack, quack.” But only four little 
                        ducks came back...

           She turns to find THE REAL NIGHTINGALE standing there. In 
           flannel. Rucksack on. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        Gale?

           And then she softens. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        My baby... my baby’s home!!! 

           Mama runs at Nightingale with open arms, but stops dead in 
           her tracks when Nightingale lifts her iPhone like a gun--

                                 NIGHTINGALE
               (chipper)
                        Hey, YouTube Live! It’s me, 
                        Nightingale, home from Nome, to 
                        show you all just how much of a 
                        burnt-out bitch Mama Bird is IRL!

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        What? What are you--

           Tabitha films the shackled Birdies.

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        Don’t worry, the police are on 
                        their way.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        NO!!!!!!

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        Say goodbye to your precious subs!

           WAILING, MAMA RUNS HER DOWN--

           Nightingale chucks the phone at Mama’s head -- THWACK!!! It 
           hits her square in the nose, and it explodes, blood streaming 
           down her face and staining her shirt.

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        MY CHANNEL!
           Mama leaps through the air, and belly flops on top of 
           Nightingale, pinning her down. She claps her hands around her 
           throat. Squeezes good.

           The Birdies scream! Helpless and shackled. 

                                 BUSTARD
               (screaming at the phone)
                        SEND HELP, BIRDERS! SEND HELP!

           Tabitha is pulling at her shackles, trying desperately to 
           move her cinderblock, and save her sister. But it’s no use.

           And as the color drains out of Nightingale’s trembling face, 
           Mama looks up at the leaderboard. Nightingale sees it, too, 
           and she is horrified. It can’t be...

           The subs are rising. Higher and higher!

                    9,587,389

                                 DOVE
                        They’re going up... 

                                 TABITHA
                        No. No, No!

           Higher... Mama bird picks up Nightingale’s phone and leans it 
           against the chair. She gets the shot framed, live streaming.

                    9,887,389

           Mama clamps down harder. Veins throbbing in Nightingale’s 
           forehead, blood vessels popping in her eyes like little 
           crimson fireworks. 

           Instantly, there are thousands of Likes and comments. 

                     First! 
                Holy shit she’s killing her! 
                   This is amazing! 
                  BITCH IS BATSHIT!!!!
                    LOL!!!!!!!!

                   Are you kidding? 
                   This is insane!
                  I LOVE YOUTUBE!!!!!  

           And Mama glows in the warm red glow of the leaderboard. 

           Tickticktickticktickticktick... And she feels every tick 
           where it counts. 

           Suddenly, Eric the Canary lands on Tabitha’s shoulder. 
                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Eric--

           The bird flies into its metal birdcage that hangs on a black 
           iron pool.  She starts reaching for the cage. Pulling her 
           cinderblock.

           Nightingale is turning purple. Slipping away. The veins 
           throbbing in her forehead. Tears streaming down her face. 

           The Birdies screaming and screaming. Pulling at their 
           shackles. Tabitha reaches for the Birdcage. Straining at her 
           chains. Her fingers tickle the stand. So close. And then -- 
           DING!!!

                  10,085,7657!!!!!

           They’ve just surpassed ten million subs.  

                                 MAMA BIRD
                        OHHHHHH MYYYY GOODDDDDDDD!!!!!

           Mama shudders, orgasmically and this triggers --

           WHAAAAAAAAAA-- AIRHORNS! Matching Mama’s screams. 

           An automatic laser light show begins, spewing colored lights 
           around the room. Mama throws her hands into the air, and 
           Nightingale sucks in a massive breath, desperate for life--

                                 MAMA BIRD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        WE DID IT! WE DID IT! OH MY BIRDIES 
                        ISN’T THIS WONDERFUL?! 

           “DIAMOND STATUS CREATORS!” pops up on all the TV screens 
           throughout the house. “SURFIN BIRD” blasts on the system. 

             A-well-a everybody's heard about the bird!
                        B-b-b-bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word

           It’s scoring Mama’s screams, and it’s a horrible harmony. 

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
               (dark, and calm)
                        But a good birdie finishes what she 
                        starts--

           And as Mama clamps down harder. The life drains from 
           Nightingale’s eyes...

           She looks up at the leaderboard... Her name has just 
           surpassed Nightingale’s in the family analytics.

                 Mama Bird -- 194,532,567

               *New* Nightingale -- 152,899,589 
           She squeals with delight.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        Look! Look! I’m the best Birdie!

           But then A SHADOW falls over her.

                                 TABITHA (O.S.)
                        But you’re the worst mother.

           Mama whips around and -- WHAMMMMMMM!!! THE METAL BIRDCAGE 
           CRACKS HER ACROSS THE SKULL.

           Mama reels forward. Tabitha is gripping the pole like a 
           baseball bat. She falls on top of Nightingale like a snipped 
           marionette.

           Nightingale rolls off, trying to catch her breath, grabbing 
           at her throat, desperate for life.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Gale!!!

           Mama is dizzy. Nightingale rises to her feet. Seething. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE
               (raspy, still choked)
                        Close your eyes, Birdies. This is 
                        gonna be rated R.

           They all turn away, no peeking. 

           Nightingale lifts the Birdcage by the pole. Stands over her 
           mother. She lifts it high above her head. And Tabitha has to 
           see. She opens her eyes as -- 

           WHAMMMM!!!! NIGHTINGALE BLUDGEONS MAMA WITH THE IRON BASE OF 
           THE STAND -- BLOOD SPRAYS!!! Mama’s skull implodes. WHAM!!! 

           A-well, a bird, bird, bird, well-a bird is a word
              A-well, a bird, bird, b-bird's a word

           WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Wrecked, Tabitha falls to her knees. Eric 
           perched on her shoulder. She’s crying and screaming, and 
           exorcising all of the trauma that has been trapped inside her 
           all these years, the foster homes, the abuse, the false 
           promises. Crying her eyes out, and it’s a beautiful purge.

           MEMORY FLASH: Baby Tabitha driven away from the Hoarder house 
           in the cop car. Blues and reds spray. 

           Nightingale collapses on her ass, and drops the weapon. 

           Tabitha looks up and sees -- Mama, with a massive head wound, 
           crawling away from Nightingale, across the floor on her hands 
           and knees like an infant, leaving a trail of blood and gore. 
           She’s not angry, she’s terrified. 
           Clinging to the last morsels of life. Staring at Tabitha with 
           emptying eyes, blinking desperately. 

           She reaches for Tabitha. 

                                 MAMA BIRD
               (sucking wet breaths)
                        ...Mommy...
               (weakening)
                        Mommy...

           Mama Bird crawls into Tabitha’s lap, and she finds herself 
           cuddling up together, holding Mama Bird’s bleeding, broken 
           gurgling head. She rubs Mama’s damp red hair.

                                 MAMA BIRD (CONT’D)
                        ...Mommy? ...Mommy?

           Tabitha and Nightingale lock eyes. Nightingale nods, as if 
           giving her permission.

           Instinct kicks into high gear. Tabitha starts to rock Mama 
           Bird. And she sings her to sleep. It’s born in her.

                                 TABITHA
                        Rock-a-bye, baby, in the treetop...
                        When the wind blows, the cradle 
                        will rock... 

           With the last of her strength, Mama Bird hands Tabitha her 
           purple wig. Tabitha hesitates, but what the hell, a dying 
           wish. She puts it on. 

           Nightingale hobbles over. Lies down beside them. She joins 
           Tabitha in song, her raspy voice a perfect ASMR trigger.

                                 TABITHA & NIGHTINGALE
                        When the bough breaks, the cradle 
                        will fall... And down will come 
                        baby, cradle and all...

           It’s a perfect duet. The hair on Mama’s neck stands erect. 
           Gooseflesh spreads down her arm. And the life is slowly 
           draining from her eyes as her daughters sing her to sleep.

           Suddenly -- GZTTTT!!!! Words flash on the flatscreens.

                                 ACCOUNT SUSPENDED!

           Ticktickticktickticktick. The subs start to go down. 

                    9,432,246

           Plunging down. Losing millions at a time. 

                    4,371,432
           Hemorrhaging subs... 

                     21,192

           Until there are no subscribers left. 

           Just a big fat goose egg --

           And Mama is dead. 

           Tabitha lets her go, lays her stiff body down gently. 

                                 DOVE
                        Is she...

           Tabitha nods. The Birdies bow their heads. 

                                 LARK
                        ...poor Mama. 

           Lark and Dove hug and cry a little. Tabitha takes off the wig 
           and hurls it across the room. She gets the keys from Mama’s 
           pocket, and unshackles herself.

           She throws the keys to Lark, who goes to work on the Birdies.  
           Nightingale wipes Mama’s blood off on Tabitha’s duck costume. 
           And then helps her up. She’s still catching her breath. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m Tabitha. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        I’m... Mary... 

           Nightingale holds her tender throat.

                                 TABITHA
                        Mary... so pretty. Nice to meet you 
                        in real life, sister.

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        You too.

                                 FINCH
                        I’m Sam. 
                                 BUSTARD
               (in great pain)
                        I’m Farhad. 

                                 LARK
                        I was actually already Lark.

           They all sort of laugh, but it’s hard and it hurts. 

           They smile and size each other up...Like they’re seeing each 
           other for the first time...

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        I’ve been watching every day. I 
                        could tell she was getting worse, 
                        and I came as soon as I could. I 
                        knew I had to do something...

                                 TABITHA
                        Thanks for watching. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        Thanks for saving my life.

                                 TABITHA
                        Birds of a feather. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        No more bird puns, please. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Sorry.

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        You’re safe now. I promise. 
                        Nothing’s bad is gonna happen to 
                        you again, I’ll make sure of it. 
               (to the Birdies)
                        You got me now. I’m here for you. 

           Tabitha hugs her. And she feels so safe in her arms. They 
           Birdies join in for a Birdie Cuddle. 

                                 NIGHTINGALE (CONT’D)
                        There’s something I always wanted 
                        to do...

           Nightingale climbs to her feet. 

                                 CUT TO:

           The Children run through the living room freeing all the pet 
           birds from their cages, opening all the windows and doors. A 
           symphony of perfect birdsong as the birds fly through the 
           house, and fly out the windows and doors...
           EXT. LAWN - DAY

           The Children watch the pet birds fly away into the sky--

           They all hold hands. A perfect family. 

                                 DOVE
                        Look.

           She points to the sky, where a fleet of THE THUNDERING POLICE 
           HELICOPTERS cut through the clouds... Coming to the rescue... 
           And, yes, they look like giant metal birds. 

                                 LARK
                        How was Nome?

                                 NIGHTINGALE
                        Terrible WiFi.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           SIRENS in the background. Police on their way... Moving 
           through the house... Past Mama’s dead body... Down the dark 
           hallway to HER BEDROOM...

           Through the door... Mama’s room is plain and tidy... The bed 
           is made...

           There’s a small altar by the window... Unlit candles...  And 
           at the center of the altar...

           An old photo from the 80s. An engraved wooden frame reads: 
           Mommy & Me. A YOUNG WOMAN with a kind smile, tattoos and 
           streaks of purple in her hair. She’s sitting next to a YOUNG 
           MAMA BIRD, THE HAPPIEST LITTLE GIRL IN THE WORLD. 

           Together forever.
