                                                                      David Weil

                                                                      UTA 
           INT. RESORT

           Completely grey screen: a birds eye view of an empty 
           conference center.

           Sound is magnified and crisp. When SARAH BAUGHN, an 
           extraordinarily fit brunette in her mid 20s, enters, wearing 
           a bright pink leotard and holding a yoga mat, we hear the 
           THUD of each and every step.

           She unrolls her mat, sits, and reclines: CORPSE POSE.

           When Sarah blinks, our screen mimics her closing eyes, 
           transitioning to BLACK.

           Sometimes, when her eyes open, we return to our birds eye 
           view. Each time, the conference center is slightly more full.

           A svelte EAST ASIAN WOMAN (mid-30s) enters, or a six-pack 
           bearing WHITE MAN (early 20s), a skinny but muscular BLONDE 
           WOMAN (early 40s). They stretch gently, or take a sip of 
           bottled water, and then they join Sarah on their backs.

           Eventually, the room is packed tightly and neatly: rows and 
           rows of mats cover every inch of the screen, a sea of TAUT, 
           limber, light-skinned and barely-clothed bodies upon them.

           Other times, the screen's blackness opens to a close up of a 
           body part: an outstretched palm, fingers GRASPING for the 
           backs of heels, a furrowed brow, a set of toes REACHING into 
           view from behind rock-solid calves.

           Beads of sweat roll down tightened skin as we hear a FORCED 
           inhale, the strain of a STRETCHING torso, a SHARP exhale, a 
           grunt, a moan, an exaggerated sigh.

           We can feel the PAIN, exertion, struggle.

           A return to birds eye view. Plastic bottles have fogged up in 
           the 40% humidity. Towels are soaked in sweat from the 105Â° 
           heat.

           And at once, a COLLAPSE, as the bodies return to their mats 
           in unison. The crowd is again in corpse pose, bodies 
           outstretched on the floor.

           Their fatigue is palpable. What we feel is not relief, it is 
           exhaustion. SURRENDER. And, knowing there is more to come, 
           DREAD.

           Eyes close again, the screen fades to BLACK.

           And then, we hear a male voice. It is calm but BELLOWING, 
           soothing but forceful. A light Indian accent. Every syllable 
           is enunciated.

           He sounds natural, but deliberate.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Let. Me. Help. You.

           We are zoomed in tightly on the face of BIKRAM CHOUDHURY 
           against a bright yellow, saffron-colored background. Bikram 
           is in his mid-60s, though he looks decades younger than his 
           years.

           In contrast to the contorted bodies and faces we've seen, 
           Bikram wears an expression of Buddhic serenity. He does not 
           smile, but the edges of his mouth curl naturally upward; he 
           is utterly at peace.

                                 BIKRAM
                        You have been trapped in an illusion: 
                        the tricks of the mind that you think 
                        are reality. But I am here to free 
                        you, to help you see things as they 
                        truly are. You have been asleep for 
                        too long.

           Our "eyes" close for the last time as screen fades to black.

                                 BIKRAM
                        It is time to wake up.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - DAY

           Text reads: "1985"

           A MAKEUP ARTIST and HAIR ARTIST (both white women) stand over 
           a chair, where RAJASHREE CHOUDHURY (20) sits.

           After a few finishing touches, they part, revealing 
           Rajashree's face in the mirror. Rajashree exudes a profound 
           sense of calmness, of strength, of intelligence. She's 
           stunning.

           But she looks horrible. Her hair is styled in a garish '80s 
           blowout. Her foundation is too light, her blush too bright, 
           the lip and eye colors all wrong for her skin tone. The 
           makeup & hair artists look at each other, shrug, and exit.

           Rajashree, now alone, looks up at the TV set mounted in the 
           corner of the room. MERV GRIFFIN sits behind his desk.

                                 MERV (ON TV)
                        So please welcome Bikram Choudhury, 
                        The Yoga Guru to the Stars, and one of 
                        those stars, Miss Juliet Prowse.

           Bikram (30s) emerges onto the set wearing a black robe, 
           JULIET behind him in a black leotard.

           We hear the sound of applause from the TV. Then (PRE-LAP) the 
           more natural sound of applause on set.

           INT. SET - MERV GRIFFIN SHOW

           We see the backs of the heads of an entirely white audience. 
           Above them hangs a bright red light. It reads: APPLAUSE.

           Bikram and Juliet shake Merv's hand and wave to the crowd 
           before taking seats on the couch--Bikram in lotus pose. The 
           APPLAUSE sign goes off, the clapping fades.

                                 MERV
                        Well, we were chatting backstage, and 
                        you certainly have a remarkable story, 
                        Bikram. Truly remarkable.

                                 BIKRAM
                        That's right.

                                 MERV
                        Can you share that story with us now?

                                 BIKRAM
                        Well, my story begins in India.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW (CONTINUOUS)

           Rajashree stares up at the TV, like she's prompting Bikram.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        ...like the story of Western 
                        civilization.

           Rajashree, frustrated, slams her hand on the dresser.

                        typical middle class home...

           EXT. INDIA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Late 1940s shots of India: rolling hills in the rural 
           countryside, beggars on the streets of Calcutta, crowds 
           gathered along the Ganges.

           We hear a few strums of the sitar, beating thuds on the 
           tabla. A white male voice sings "OM," then more voices join 
           in. (A familiar soundtrack in American yoga classes: notably 
           white imitations of traditional Indian music and chants.)

           EXT. CHOUDHURY HOME (FLASHBACK)

           It is, as Bikram described it, a typical middle class 
           Calcutta home.

                                 BIKRAM
                        At first, it was normal. An ordinary 
                        upbringing.

           INT. CHOUDHURY HOME (FLASHBACK)

           Six mats lie on the ground, and six CHILDREN (ages 6 months-
               ___________ __________                                  
           13 years) lie upon them.

           Open sores and scabs cover their skin. They STRUGGLE to 
           breathe. We hear their wails and cries. Except for...

           A YOUNG BIKRAM (age 4) holds his feet in his hands in HAPPY 
           BABY pose. He rocks back and forth. He is calm. A young yogi.

           BISHNU GHOSH, a very famous guru, greets young Bikram (age 5) 
           and his FATHER. His father clasps his hands together.

                        Soon, Bishnu became    guru.

           Bishnu enters a gymnasium, where he proudly showcases a group 
           of older boys struggling to perform balancing asanas of 
           medium difficulty for Bikram's father.

           They turn to Bikram and are astonished to find him in an 
           unwavering headstand. Perfect form.

           INT. AUDITORIUM (FLASHBACK)

           A banner reads "All-India Yoga Asana Championship". A line of 
           grown men on stage, along with 13-YEAR-OLD BIKRAM.

                                 BIKRAM (V.O.)
                        I became the youngest yoga champion 
                        ever at 13.

           Each adult performs an impressive routine.

           But Bikram's execution is flawless, a clear cut above them.

           A judge places a gold medal around Bikram's neck, and Bishnu 
           clasps his hand and hoists it in the air.

           Rajashree doesn't react to this. Instead, she frantically 
           scrubs her face with her cold cream-drenched tissues, a fresh 
           streak of clownish makeup off with each pass.

           INT. BISHNU GHOSH GYM - WEIGHT ROOM (FLASHBACK)

           18-YEAR-OLD BIKRAM sits down-- wriggling under the 380-pound 
           weight he is about to bench press.

                                 BIKRAM (V.O.)
                        You see, for me, I have a short 
                        attention span. Always on to the next 
                        thing, on to the next thing. So, I 
                        began to train as a weight-lifter. I 
                        was headed for the Olympics.

           A pair of SPOTTERS stands above him. One attempts to lift too 
           early, without warning, and the weight comes CRASHING down.

           A long line of maimed, ill visitors crowd line outside the 
           door of Bishnu's clinic seeking his guidance.

           Inside, Bishnu's ASSISTANTS (Indian males, late teens/early 
           20s) attempt to force Bikram's legs into a cross-legged pose.

                        But yoga healed me.

           We hear Bikram's blood-curdling scream, as the bandage on his 
           knee BLOODIES from exertion. Bishnu instructs them to 
           continue.

           INT. BISHNU'S OFFICE (FLASHBACK)

           Bikram demonstrates his 26-pose sequence for Bishnu.

                        You see, we used to prescribe an 
                        individual sequence for each patient. 
                        But I developed a cure-all: a standing 
                        series, then corpse pose-- in the 
                        middle of the series, not at the end-- 
                        and then the seated postures.

           Bikram kneels on the ground and breathes rapid short, sharp

                        And you close with pranayama.

                        The same 26-posture sequence. Can heal

                        At first, my guru was skeptical, too.

           INT. BISHNU'S OFFICE (FLASHBACK)

           The line outside Bishnu's office shortens; Bikram's class 
           size grows.

                                 BIKRAM (V.O.)
                        Until he saw the results.

           Soon, the duo are healing patients together, instructing 
           large classes in Bikram's technique.

           After class, throngs crowd around Bikram to thank him. Once 
           the room has cleared, Bishnu falls weeping at Bikram's feet.

                        You see, my guru had always considered 
                        it his destiny, his mission, to take 
                        yoga outside of India. To bring it 
                        around the entire globe. But he could 
                        not do it.

                        delivered to him, the most perfect, 
                        the most pure form of yoga. And he saw 
                        it was so perfect, so pure that it 
                        could, that it would, spread. That I 
                        would bring yoga to the whole world. 
                        That he would carry out his destiny 
                        through me, through my Bikram yoga.

           Large crowds flock to the latest Bollywood offerings. Bikram 
           instead goes to see a Hollywood film: IRMA LA DOUCE.

                                 BIKRAM (V.O.)
                        It was around that time that I met 
                        Shirley Maclaine.

           Inside the theater, the screen lights up his captivated face 
           in the dark. He stares at the image of Shirley's face above.

           Dusk. Lavish party on the Bombay beach. Bikram approaches DEV 
           ANAND (mid 40s), who stands with SHIRLEY MACLAINE (30s).

                        We met at a party hosted by my friend 
                        Dev Anand. A Bollywood actor, very 
                        famous in India.

           Dev introduces the two, who shake hands. Later at night, 
           Bikram and Shirley stroll along the beach.

                        Oh, it's such a vibrant country. So 
                        many colors! So full of life! I think 
                        I might move here for good.

                                 BIKRAM
                        No! We all have a duty, a karma yoga. 
                        Mine is to heal people through yoga. 
                        Yours is to sing, dance, entertain. 
                        You won't find the truth in India. You 
                        must return to Hollywood.

                        Well, she agreed to return only if I 
                        promised to one day come to America,

                        me.

                        And this is very important. The first, 
                        most fundamental lesson of yoga: when 
                        your guru tells you to do something, 
                        you must obey him.

           INT. HOTEL (FLASHBACK)

           Bikram enters a fancy hotel lobby and is immediately whisked 
           away by Secret Service AGENTS who guide him to a room.

                        Bishnu sent me to Japan, to spread the 
                        teachings of yoga. First to the Far 
                        East, and then to work my way around.

                        That was when I discovered the perfect

                        bigger following. And one day I got a 
                        call, summoning me to Hawaii.

           The agents nod at the others guarding the door and show 
           Bikram in. They enter to find an ailing RICHARD NIXON, who 
           lies in his bed groaning in pain.

                        Richard Nixon!?! Did you cure him?

                        What the hell.

           Nixon's robe falls as he climbs on in. Bikram reaches into 
           the water and the agents hurriedly exit the room.

           Bikram shakes hands with Nixon at the airport as REPORTERS 
           gather around. Nixon hands him an envelope before boarding.

           Bikram watches casually, clearly distracted, until the 19-

                        sounds interesting. What exactly

                        That's right! Here to demonstrate some 
                        postures for us is Bikram's wife, the 
                        lovely Rajashree Choudhury.

           BLINDING bright lights as the spotlight above Rajashree turns 
           on. She exudes youthful radiance.

           Rajashree performs an advanced yoga routine, as Merv turns to

           The crowd is mesmerized, and when she completes her routine,

                        Twenty.

           Merv whistles and raises his eyebrows suggestively. At his 
           welcoming gesture, Rajashree crosses the stage and joins 
           Bikram and Juliet on the couch.

           Rajashree is deeply confused.

                        No, no, in India women don't wear 
                        those. You're thinking of the Arabs?

                        I'm not sure we much care for it 
                        there, either, Merv.

           Rajashree gently places her hand over Bikram's closed fist.

           Bikram looks at her quizzically.

                        The line we rehearsed: "My story

                        India isn't the West.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Well that's the idea, isn't it? That 
                        India is the world's oldest living 
                        civilization. That it was, up until

                        Bah!

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Besides, Westerners think "Western 
                        civilization" and "civilization" are 
                        the same thing.

                        Americans don't want to hear that. 
                        They want to hear "The West is the 
                        best! America is the best!"

           As they pull into the driveway, Rajashree turns to unlock the 
           back door.

           Bikram exits the car and walks away empty-handed while 
           Rajashree struggles to gather all of their belongings from 
           the back seat.

           Bikram turns to face her.

                        Do you know why?

                        Maybe "modern." "Like the story of 
                        modern civilization."

           We pan out to see Rajashree and Bikram's home. A comfortably 
           upper-middle class house. Of course, that means something 
           different in 1980s Los Angeles than in 1940s Calcutta.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Because it is.

           Rajashree sits at the reception desk. She can see into the 
           classroom, where a group of WORKMEN construct a platform at 
           the front of the room, and mount mirrored panels on the wall.

           To her right is the wall of fame: pictures of Bikram with 
           various celebrities.

           Bikram enters in a hurry and sees the workmen.

                        I said they would work through the 
                        morning so the reporter would catch 
                        them. It's good to show that we're 
                        renovating, constantly improving.

           Bikram now spots a tiny idol of Ganesh on the desk. He places 
           it carelessly behind the counter, out of sight to everyone 
           but Rajashree.

                                 BIKRAM

           celebrity.

           Martin Sheen enters the studio. With him, the reporter 
           RODERICK MANN and a PHOTOGRAPHER. Bikram bounds toward them.

           excitedly interjects.

                        Yes, of course. Sit, sit.

           Bikram, somewhat reluctantly, enters the classroom while 
           Roderick places a tape recorder between Martin and himself.

           As the two talk, the workmen wrap up and leave, and students

           The same faux-traditional Indian music plays. We zoom in on 
           our same shots of India from before. Indian women, men, and 
           children all interact playfully and openly with the camera. 
           They know they're being filmed. We know they're being filmed. 
           They relish it.

                        India's an extraordinary country. 
                        Every sense is assaulted, even your 
                        sense of justice. You begin to 
                        understand that there really is just 
                        one family of man. It inspired me to

                        Christ, you know, was a guru. Some say 
                        he spent his missing years in India. 
                        But he returned to Jerusalem so he 
                        could unite East and West. He saw the 
                        great good in the East, great good in 
                        the West, and potential for great evil 
                        in both.

           It looks as though class is about to begin. Martin and 
           Roderick both rise.

                                 MARTIN
                        You ready?

                                 RODERICK
                        I think I can handle a light stretch.

           Martin and Rajashree exchange a knowing glance as Roderick 
           saunters into class.

           LATER

           The windows and glass doors of the studio are fogged up with 
           humidity. Roderick emerges and makes desperate eye contact 
           with Rajashree. She instinctively holds out a trash can as he 
           vomits. She rubs his back maternally and giggles 
           affectionately.

           Once Roderick comes up for air, he laughs, too.

           LATER

           The two sit in the lobby, watching the ongoing class as the 
           fog gradually fades.

           Roderick sips from a cup of ice water. The photographer snaps 
           pictures, occasionally pausing to defog his lens.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        It happens to many people their first 
                        class. Especially if it's with Bikram.

                                 RODERICK
                        Even you?

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I've never actually taken a class from 
                        Bikram. Gosh, I can't remember the 
                        last time I took a class from anyone.

                                 RODERICK
                        Really? You only teach?

           Rajashree nods.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I was supposed to teach this 
                        afternoon, actually, but Bikram heard 
                        you two were coming.

           Created using Celtx                                          
                                 RODERICK
                        Ah, so he's a sadist.

           As the students perform a backbend, Bikram straddles a female 
           student and, without warning, forcefully pulls her shoulders, 
           driving her back into an even deeper arch. She grimaces, and 
           he pulls her further still, until she's looking up at his 
           face. They make eye contact-- she hesitates, then smiles.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Could I potentially...run something by 
                        you?

                                 RODERICK
                        Of course.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I'm thinking of putting together a 
                        book. Outlining Bikram's yoga program. 
                        Pictures of our famous clientele 
                        demonstrating different postures.

                                 RODERICK
                        "The wellness routine of the 
                        celebrities..."

                                 RAJASHREE
                        "...Now in your very own hands."

                                 RODERICK
                        With a picture of Bikram on the cover. 
                        "The Yoga Guru to the Stars."

           Rajashree looks down.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Exactly, right.

                                 RODERICK
                        It could work.

           Roderick looks at Bikram. He stands on the platform, his arms 
           outstretched by his sides in a Christ-like pose.

                                 RODERICK
                        After all, it's a nation of 
                        masochists.

           Rajashree gestures at the wall.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Especially the celebrities.

           Roderick laughs heartily. Class wraps up and people start to 
           trickle out.

                                 RODERICK
                        Well, I suppose I should maintain 
                        what's left of my journalistic 
                        dignity.

           Roderick returns to the classroom, notepad in hand, to shake 
           Bikram's. Rajashree smiles as he eyes her in the background.

           INT. BIKRAM YOGA STUDIO - LATER

           Martin enters carrying a copy of the LA Times. He hands it to 
           Rajashree, the paper open to this profile. Among the 
           pictures: a shot of him in class, Bikram teaching.

                                 MARTIN
                        Thanks again for doing that.

           Rajashree eagerly scans the article.

                                 RAJASHREE
                                         (Distracted)
                        Don't be silly. It was our pleasure.

                                 MARTIN
                        Well, he said some wonderful things 
                        about the studio and practice, and 
                        Bikram is quoted.

           Rajashree places the paper down, disappointed.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Oh, is he?

                                 MARTIN
                        And you've got another picture for the 
                        wall in there!
                                         (Beat)
                        Is something the matter?

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Oh no, no. It's lovely.

           Martin pays for the class and Rajashree rises to teach.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        This is beautiful. Thank you, Martin.

           Rajashree looks up longingly at the wall.

           INT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO

           As she described, Rajashree leads a photo shoot with Bikram's 
           famous clientele demonstrating postures. Brooke in half-moon 
           pose, Shirley in eagle, Martin in awkward pose, etc.

           Rajashree plays an active role in the shoot: moving lights, 
           consulting with the photographer, and offering hands-on 
           adjustments to the stars.

           Raquel Welch enters.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        We were thinking of placing you in 
                        standing bow pose. Some call it 
                        "dancer."

                                 RAQUEL
                        Oh, "dancer"! How fitting. I love it!

           Raquel gamely enters the posture after Rajashree 
           demonstrates. Rajashree adjusts her form, but Raquel is also 
           a natural model, posing perfectly for the camera.

           The final shot of the day: Rajashree and Bikram, the former 
           in front of the latter, in parallel side angle poses.

           EXT. CHOUDHURY HOME

           A new, bigger home than the one we saw last. This one is 
           decidedly lower-upper class.

           INT. CHOUDHURY HOME

           Upstairs in her home office, Rajashree looks at mock ups for 
           the book cover: "Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class" with the shot 
           of the couple underneath.

                                 RAJASHREE
                                         (Into phone)
                        Yes, I think the brighter blue 
                        background makes us, it, pop.

           Bikram stands at the foot of the stairs shouting up to her.

                        Yes, especially with our skin tones.

           Bikram's voice approaches the door.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Rajashree! Rajashree!

           Bikram bursts in.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Okay, great. I'm looking forward to 
                        seeing those changes. Thank you.

           She hangs up.

           CUT TO

           Rajashree follows Bikram down the stairs.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I'm just saying, when I'm on the phone 
                        with the publisher, perhaps it isn't 
                        as important to...

           The two enter the living room, where the TV is already on, 
           and set to The Merv Griffin Show. The guest is Raquel Welch.

                                 BIKRAM
                        You see, it's almost over.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Well, next time I'll just tell our 
                        book publisher that-

                                 BIKRAM
                        Shh! Shhhh! You must listen.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Okay, okay. I'll learn about America.

                                 MERV (ON TV)
                        Well, Raquel, thanks so much for being

                        Ah, yes, the book!

           Merv holds up a copy of Raquel Welch's book. "Raquel: The 
           Raquel Welch Total Beauty and Fitness Program." Raquel adorns 
           the cover, performing a perfect standing bow asana, wearing a 
           high-cut white leotard.

           Bikram is flabbergasted. Rajashree calm.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Well, America.

           She reaches behind the couch for the phone.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        What's your attorney's number?

                                 BIKRAM
                        What?

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Your lawyer? What's his number?

                                 BIKRAM
                        I don't have a lawyer.

           Now Rajashree is flabbergasted.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        You don't. Have. A lawyer.

                        Lawyers are thieves! All they do is 
                        take your money!

                        Here, give me the phone. I know who to 
                        call.

           INT. LOS ANGELES BOOKSTORE

           Raquel holds a book signing. A LINE of fans waits to have her 
           sign their copies as photographers snap pictures.

           Bikram angrily stands at the front of the line. Rajashree is 
           off to the side.

           The fan nods and Raquel proceeds to sign her book. Rajashree 
           watches the entire spectacle.

                                 RAQUEL
                        Now come on, Bikram, I gave you a very 
                        nice acknowledgment.

                        Yes, I saw your acknowledgment. You 
                        named me right after Chat.

           Camera pans to Raquel's dog, tied to the table beside her.

                                 RAQUEL
                        Well, Bikram, Chat is very important 
                        to me.
                                         (Turns to BOOKSTORE CLERK)
                        Actually, that reminds me, would you 
                        get him a bowl of water, darling?

           The clerk nods and walks off.

                                 RAQUEL
                        Listen, Bikram, I'm not sure what you 
                        want from me. I mean no one can     
                                                        own 
                        yoga, it's in the public domain.

           Another fan hands her book to Raquel.

                                 FAN 2
                        Do we pay here?

                                 RAQUEL
                        No, dear, at the register.

           Raquel signs the book and the fan walks toward the cashier to 
           pay.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Well, we'll see about that.

           Bikram nods toward Rajashree, who flips through Raquel's 
           book. She reads the cover caption on the front flap: "Dancer 
           Pose." She makes eye contact with Raquel, and looks genuinely 
           disappointed, hurt.

           A fleeting flicker of guilt on Raquel's face before she turns 
           to her next fan.

                                 RAQUEL
                        Hello, darling, what's your name?

           Rajashree turns back one last time before leaving, the 
           flashes of the cameras reflecting in her eyes.

           INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE

           A dissatisfied Bikram and Rajashree sit across from a LAWYER,

           Created using Celtx                                          
           who is professional but not especially warm or polite.

                                 BIKRAM
                        It's nothing! They're offering me 
                        pennies.

                                 LAWYER
                        Those aren't pennies, first of all, 
                        it's a hefty sum to most people.

                                 BIKRAM
                        I am not most people.

                                 LAWYER
                        Well, you're not Raquel Welch.

                                 BIKRAM
                        And what does that mean?

                                 LAWYER
                        Listen, Bikram, I mean, you're well-
                        known in some circles, and no one is 
                        denying that you've created a very 
                        impactful program here, an impressive 
                        operation, really, but compared to 
                        her, you're no one.

                                 BIKRAM
                        I am not no one! I am Bikram!

           Rajashree gestures toward the book on the table, Raquel's 
           book.

                                 RAJASHREE
                                 Bikram        
                        And it's        yoga...

                                 LAWYER
                        Yes, of course, I don't mean he's, I 
                        don't mean you're *literally* no one. 
                        I just mean that you aren't a brand.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        A "brand"? Of course he's not a brand. 
                        He's a person.

                                 LAWYER
                        Well, Raquel Welch is both.

           the classroom.

           Bikram enters, Rajashree sits at the front desk. He drops a 
           pile of crudely-made pamphlets on it and picks up his mic-ed 
           headset, now a part of his uniform.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        What's this?

           She picks up the top one: it reads "BEVERLY HILLS BIKRAM"

                                 BIKRAM
                        The new prices. For the new brand.

           STUDENTS start to trickle in, starting with two attractive 
           young white WOMEN. Clearly regulars, they exchange familiar 
           nods, and then cash, with Rajashree. Still, Bikram introduces 
           himself.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Welcome. Welcome to Beverly Hills 
                        Bikram.

           They clearly find this slightly odd, but smile anyway, before 
           placing their hands together and bowing.

                                 WOMEN
                        Namaste

                                 BIKRAM
                        Yes, yes. Namaste, namaste.

           Rajashree, having watched the exchange, looks at the idol of 
           Ganesh and smiles to herself as she crosses out the words on 
           the pamphlet and scribbles something down: "The Yoga College 
           of India."

           LATER

           It's night; the studio is empty. Rajashree is alone, tidying 
           up, although we sense she's just playing busy.

           As she cleans, she talks to herself, rehearsing emphatically, 
           at times gesticulating wildly.

           INT. CHOUDHURY HOME

           Bikram sits at the kitchen table, a mix of skeptical and 
           disinterested.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        It will be like the Bishnu Ghosh 
                        Mission.

           At this, Bikram perks up. Rajashree takes notice.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Yes, like the Bishnu Ghosh Mission. 
                        Except your mission instead. Better, 
                        bolder than anything Bishnu could have 
                        dreamed. For a better, bolder guru.

           Rajashree leans back. We can see from her satisfied 
           expression that Bikram has been convinced.

           INT. YOGA COLLEGE OF INDIA HQ

           Rajashree shows Bikram around. She leads him to his office: 
           the biggest office, the corner office. On the wall behind his 
           desk, Rajashree has arranged all of his framed magazine 
           covers and press clippings. He sits in the chair and smiles 
           to himself, pleased and proud. He serenely closes his eyes.

           Rajashree now sits with a group of ACCOUNTANTS and MARKETING 
           PROFESSIONALS.

                        Arizona.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And those studios are doing well.

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        Still, we aren't sure the rate of 
                        growth you're aiming for here is 
                        reasonable.

           She looks at a spread sheet, and a red number in parentheses.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Can you walk me through this? What is

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        That's your projected customer 
                        acquisition cost.

           Rajashree looks confused, but she isn't going to ask him to 
           explain further. A marketer picks up on this.

                                 MARKETER
                        It's the amount of advertising spend

                        single new customer.

           Bikram and Rajashree lead a series of classes and lectures to

           A student raises his hand and asks an inaudible question. The 
           suit nods and points to a section of the contract.

                        Yes, as you can see in Clause 3b that 
                        is the franchise fee, which is 
                        separate from the teacher training fee 
                        which you paid to be here and learn 
                        from Bikram and Rajashree.

                        students, you have all become my 
                        family. My children.

           Bikram and a group of devotees sit up late at night watching 
           films. Not the Hollywood films which Bikram used to see in 
           theaters. Now, Bollywood movies.

           But Bikram does not look at the screen. Instead, his eyes 
           flit around the room at the women who surround him. On some, 
           his gaze lingers.

           from her office carrying a large trophy: the Bishnu Ghosh

           When Bikram speaks, Rajashree is attentive and aware. When 
           Rajashree speaks, Bikram is disengaged and checked out.

                        So that's the complaint I've heard 
                        most often. That it's a $5500 teacher 
                        training fee, and then an ongoing 
                        franchise fee...

                                 RAJASHREE
                        The "teacher training fee" is an all-
                        expenses paid, intensive program at a

                        training to ensure their later 
                        success, and they form a community. 
                        That community is living: being listed 
                        on our web site, getting to teach the 
                        Bikram program and use the Bikram 
                        name. That link is ongoing, it's 
                        concrete, it's consequential. That's 
                        what the franchise fee is for. It's 
                        good for the studio owners, too. Most 
                        of them--the vast majority--are on our 
                        side with this. You should talk to 
                        some of them.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Still, $5500? That seems a little 
                        steep, no?

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Do you know what the going rate is for 
                        a yoga retreat?

                                 JOSHUA
                        I can't say I do, no.

           Rajashree laughs warmly.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        You know, when Bikram and I came to 
                        this country, people didn't even know 
                        what yoga was! Now there's some 
                        awareness, but not enough.

           Rajashree turns to Bikram, looking natural. A long pause; 
           Bikram missed his cue. Rajashree smiles at Joshua and then 
           gives Bikram a nod.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Yes, yes. Not enough. I want Bikram to 
                        be everywhere, like McDonalds!

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And if I opened up a McDonalds, 
                        decided to stop paying my franchise 
                        fee, but wanted to continue to use the 
                        same techniques and equipment, the 
                        same name, what would happen?

                                 JOSHUA
                        I'd imagine you'd get sued.

           respect. She's smart and savvy. She's good at this.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And that's what's happening here. The 
                        Bikram name is worth something.

           Bikram removes his slipper and holds it up illustratively.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Bikram yoga is so big: this is a 
                        bathroom slipper you buy for $2 in 
                        Kmart. But you put "Bikram" on it, and 
                        it'll sell for $35! In a second.

                                 JOSHUA
                        So you're also merchandising the 
                        "Bikram" name? Using it as a marketing 
                        tool? Profiting off of it?

                        It's our brand.

           Brief, uncomfortable pause.

                                 JOSHUA
                        I spoke with Hillari Dowdle, the 
                        editor-in-chief of Yoga Journal. 
                        Hillari says that, unlike what you 
                        teach, "Yoga is a vast and limitless 
                        path for personal transformation. The 
                        practice is not a one-size-fits-all 
                        prescription."
                                         (Beat)
                        She says you're "playing a Western 
                        game with an Eastern tradition."

           At this last line, Rajashree flinches.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Well, I'm not surprised to hear 
                        Hillari say that.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        No, not at all. Did you know Hillari 
                        has a new book out? "The Detox 
                        Prescription: How Anyone Can Use Yoga 
                        to Eliminate the Toxins Within." So, 
                        no. I'm not surprised to hear her say 
                        that. We're her competition.

                        Speaking of competition, your Bikram 
                        International Yoga Competition seems 
                        to be going well.

                        Of course, there's a marketing 
                        component to it. Inspiring more people 
                        to join the practice, inspiring 
                        sporadic attendees to become everyday 
                        yogis. You know, create some buzz.

                        But the thing with Bikram yoga is that 
                        it really does help people. It really 
                        does make them healthier, happier, 
                        improve their lives. So the bigger we 
                        become, the more good we can do.
                                         (Beat)
                        That's why we're pursuing this 
                        litigation. Because a franchise is the 
                        only way to ensure quality.

                        I don't want to deal with this 
                        headache! In India, nobody sues 
                        anybody. I am suffering greatly from 
                        all this talk of law and justice and 
                        courts. But my yoga helps people. I am 
                        suffering now to ease suffering later. 
                        I am sacrificing myself for my

                        Page 27.

           As Bikram flips through the pages, Rajashree continues.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        He doesn't quote me at all, he doesn't 
                        quote a single favorable studio 
                        owner...

           Bikram finds the article: "THE MONEY POSE." The backdrop is a 
           picture of Bikram, smiling and leaning on the hood of his 
           Bentley. He reads the pullquote out loud:

                                 BIKRAM
                        "I want Bikram to be everywhere, like 
                        McDonalds!" Great picture! Have this 
                        framed.

           Bikram hands the magazine back to Rajashree. Next to this 
           picture of Bikram is a shot of the young white married couple 
           we saw being subpoenaed earlier. They hold hands, their blue 
           eyes wide. They look innocent, frightened.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        He doesn't mention Hillari's book. 
                        Instead he quotes a "classical yogi," 
                        a man named "Dharmanindi Sarasvati," 
                        who claims that

                        "It's the culmination of 
                        commercialization, he says. In India, 
                        disciples did not pay to learn from 
                        masters."
                                         (to Bikram)
                        Have you seen this guy?

           Bikram shakes his head and shrugs. Rajashree walks around the 
           desk and pulls up Dharmanindi's website on the computer.

           A white man, he wears a saffron robe, a shaved head, and a 
           bright red dot on his forehead. "The Guru," the header reads.

                                 RAJASHREE

                        not the fact that "Dharmanindi" is 
                        aggressively Caucasian and charges $75 
                        to attend his lectures on "cultivating 
                        an authentic personality."

           Bikram takes the magazine from her.

                                 BIKRAM
                        The car looks good. The house. Very 
                        nice.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        That's the point! He's saying we're 
                        too rich.

                                 BIKRAM
                        In America? There's no such thing as 
                        too rich.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Maybe not if you look like Dharmanindi 
                        Sarasvati.

           Rajashree storms out.

           INT. RESORT

           Rajashree guides MINAKSHI JAFA-BODDEN, an Indian attorney in 
           her late twenties, through a teacher training. Minakshi flips 
           through a contract.

           As they walk by, Sarah Baughn is signing in. She looks at 
           Rajashree the way students once looked at Shirley Maclaine, 
           trying to be discreet, but failing.

           Rajashree nods, clasps her hands together.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Namaste

           Sarah is thrilled. Rajashree continues to talk to Minakshi.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Your contract is crystal clear. 
                        Legally, you aren't going to have any 
                        trouble enforcing it.

                        It's not just that.

           She hands Minakshi a copy of Mother Jones. Minakshi flips 
           right to page 27.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        I read it. If you're going to have any 
                        problems, it's here.

           Minakshi holds up the magazine as she delivers the line. 
           Rajashree stops her gently and stands to face her.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Bikram is a--

                        Minakshi, there are many lawyers who I 
                        could have hired here. Many who are 
                        eager to work with us now. But I 
                        sought you out because I need someone 
                        who I can trust. Fully. I want us to 
                        both take on this challenge together, 
                        to both learn together.
                                         (Beat)
                        I know this isn't an easy decision for 
                        you. That you're a single mother with 
                        a young daughter.

           Minakshi seems a little surprised that Rajashree knows this.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        But that is exactly why I want you on 
                        board. The immigration paperwork, 
                        housing. We have resources. I have 
                        resources. I want to use them to help 
                        you. Please. Let me help you.

           INT. JAFA-BODDEN HOME

           A somewhat modest home, but when Minakshi enters with ALIX 
           (six), holding their luggage, her daughter is in awe. 
           Minakshi tries to play it cool, but she is clearly thrilled.

                                 ALIX
                        We get to live here!

                        We get to live here.

                                 ALIX

                                 ALIX
                        Wowowowowow.

           Minakshi reaches down and hugs her daughter's face.

                                 MINAKSHI

           Minakshi grabs her daughter's hand as they explore the rest 
           of the home.

                                 ALIX
                        Mommy, what's your new job? What do 
                        you do?

           INT. YOGA COLLEGE OF INDIA HQ - RAJASHREE'S OFFICE

           Minakshi and Rajashree sit in Rajashree's office laughing 
           like old friends.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And then he turns to me, and he says 
                        "So, how does it feel to be out of 
                        your burqa?"

                                 MINAKSHI
                        No!

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Yes! I had no idea what he was even 
                        talking about.

                                 MINAKSHI

                        God and I'd been here, what, 9 months? 
                        And Juliet Prowse was taking blocks 
                        for me on national television.

                        Maybe I should ring up Juliet Prowse 
                        and see if she's available instead.

           The two laugh merrily.

                        I think, though, the key here is to 
                        keep it simple. Shut down any line of 
                        questioning about "copyrighting yoga."

                        a specific sequence and specific 
                        instructions on how to do them. That 
                        isn't just "yoga." It's not like 
                        Bikram's 26 poses were handed down 
                        from on high.

                        Is there something to the idea that 
                        this is his creation, his invention?

                        invention, his idea, and now he's just 
                        trying to protect it.

                        Right, his idea. He came to this 
                        country with nothing but an idea...

                        There's no success in this country for 
                        anyone other than them. There's money, 
                        maybe. But success? No such thing.

                        I know, it's awful. Horrible. 
                        Insulting.

                        Bikram would be caught dead in a Benz.

           Rajashree looks up at Minakshi and laughs. She picks up a 
           pair of keys on her desk.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Care for a spin in the Rolls?

                        You don't want to prep for the London 
                        interview first?

           Rajashree stands, covers her watering eyes with a pair of 
           designer sunglasses, and smiles.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Fuck 'em.

           She exits the office, Minakshi behind her.

           INT. TOWN HALL - LONDON

           Rajashree walks through the site of the International Yoga 
           Competition with a REPORTER (American white male in his 30s) 
           for the Wall Street Journal.

           Unlike before, she wears traditional Indian attire, a scarf 
           wrapped around her hair. For the first time, a red dot on her 
           forehead.

           Various yogis are practicing intently; others are merely 
           spectators. Again, Rajashree enjoys a CELEBRITY STATUS in the 
           crowd. People nod with recognition in her direction, but are 
           too intimidated to approach her.

                                 REPORTER
                        But what about those who would say 
                        that competition goes against the 
                        spirit of yoga?

                        Ah, the spirit of yoga. I know it very 
                        well.

           She clasps her hands together when a SPECTATOR crosses her 
           path and makes eye contact.

                                 RAJASHREE

                                 REPORTER
                        Yoga? Only occasionally. I'm more of a 
                        runner, myself, to be honest.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Perfect! Perfection. Then you know 
                        that during the Olympics--we hope, you 
                        know, to make yoga an Olympic sport 
                        one day soon-- during the Olympics, 
                        they organize the runners by heat. The 
                        fastest sprinters run only against the 
                        fastest sprinters.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        A lot! He'd pick up his pace by a lot.

                                 REPORTER
                        I suppose that's why long-distance 
                        running has always appealed to me 
                        most. It's just me against the 
                        pavement.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Ah, yes. And have you ever arrived at 
                        your front door after a long run and 
                        thought to yourself, "Thank God I am 
                        here. I'm completely spent. Totally 
                        exhausted. I couldn't run another

                        Of course. On my last run, in fact. 
                        This morning, before I arrived here.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Our methods at Bikram, they are 
                        ancient. And proven. But, in some 
                        ways, they are unorthodox. They are 
                        not, so to speak, traditional.

           Rajashree pauses to offer an adjustment to an aspiring 
                     gentle      firm 
           champion:       , but     .

                        When we placed the wall of mirrors at 
                        the front of our classrooms, many said 
                        it was a distraction. That it 
                        encouraged a superficial practice, one 
                        void of true introspection.

           Rajashree stands up and continues to weave through the crowd.

           INT. COMPETITION STAGE

           We see shots from the competition: as each body takes the 
           stage, it contorts itself into an IMPOSSIBLE position, each 
           more FANTASTICAL and TWISTED than the last.

                                 RAJASHREE (V.O.)
                        But what happens over the course of a 
                        90-minute class? First, yes, you look 
                        to the person on your left. And then, 
                        absolutely, you look to your right.

           Sarah Baughn COLLAPSES out of a pose, tumbling forward onto 
           her face. Rajashree climbs upon the stage to console the 
           tearful and SHAKEN competitor with a warm embrace.

           The crowd goes wild with APPLAUSE.

                                 RAJASHREE (V.O.)
                        But after a while, you have nowhere 
                        else to look. You must lock eyes with 
                        your own reflection. And what do you 
                        see then? "Ah, in poorna-salabhasana, 
                        locust pose, my left arm dips below my

                        strain upon my face.

           Now, we see COMPETITOR X close their eyes, the picture of 
           grace and ease in a mind-bending posture.

                                 RAJASHREE (V.O.)
                        We all harbor illusions-- delusions, 
                        really-- of grandeur. About others, 
                        about ourselves. Even the illusions we 
                        cling to about others, they are really 
                        about ourselves. Bikram calls his 
                        class his "torture chamber," but the 
                        physical element, that is easy. What 
                        is not easy is meeting your own gaze. 
                        The hardest thing in the world is 
                        looking in the mirror.

           Ghosh cup above their head. TRIUMPH.

           this duty very seriously. Rajashree playfully ruffles her 
           hair, and the two are on their way.

           Rajashree walks back toward the kitchen and unwraps the gift: 
           a framed, flattering photograph of her, bindi and all, hands 
           clasped together, in the Wall Street Journal. "The Phenomenal 
           Popularity of Yoga," the headline reads. Underneath it,

           envelope over, and then smiles and does so.

           and finds two greencards inside: one for her and one for 
           Alix.

           She sits in silent, joyful shock. Alix grabs her card and 
           turns it over, then shrugs with disinterest and climbs out of 
           her mother's arms to play with some toys on the ground below.

           They each shake hands.

                                 CLANCY
                        I recognized him from his signature 
                        topknot.

           Bikram holds his bun self-effacingly.

                                 BIKRAM
                        So, you'll be attending a class.

                                 CLANCY
                        Of course, if you'll have me.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And you'll be attending the lecture, I 
                        hope?

                                 CLANCY
                        If that's alright with you.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        You'll see what all the fuss is about.

           MONTAGE

           Rajashree and Bikram stand together in Bikram's office before 
           the MAP. Now of the world, not just the US. A sea of blue and 
           red pins.

           Bikram stands upon a platform at the front of a large 
           CONFERENCE CENTER, mirrors behind him, practitioners in

           As his photographer snaps pictures, Clancy openly, creepily 
           leers at the female students around him.

           CUT TO

           Rajashree sits upon a stool before a large, packed lecture 
           hall. Minakshi stands with Clancy behind a group of 
           hypnotized students.

           Bikram and Rajashree speak in tandem...

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I am proud, Bikram and I are very 
                        proud, to be from where we are from.

                                 BIKRAM
                        I come from the gutters of Calcutta, 
                        where people piss in the street like 
                        dogs.

                        People may not have very much, but 
                        they are content.

                                 BIKRAM
                        When Indira Gandhi came to me for yoga 
                        instruction, she asked me, "Bikram, 
                        what should I do to improve India?"

           More and more STUDIOS are being OPENED...

           More and more students arrive at Sarah's class, led by 
           instructor JIM KALLETT (upper middle-aged white man). Sarah 
           is a clear stand out, working harder, holding poses longer 
           and better than the other students. Jim is clearly impressed.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        We have a long history of problems. 
                        But still we are fundamentally happy.

                                 BIKRAM
                        I said, "Build a fucking toilet!"

                                 RAJASHREE
                        There is an innate happiness.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Still, somehow, people manage to be 
                        happy.

           Sarah approaches Jim after class: the two discuss something, 
           shake hands, and hug.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Here, in America, you have everything.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Here, you have so much. And you are 
                        miserable!

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And still, you are not satisfied.

                        So why did I leave a poor and happy 
                        nation for a rich and depressed one?

           platonic, productive intimacy.

                        the Western World? This was in 1893.

                                 BIKRAM
                        But you listened.

           which give way to more and more BENTLEY logos in his garage, 
           more and more Rolls Royces...

           Rajashree and Bikram co-teach a seminar, and Sarah is called 
           to the front of the room to demonstrate a series of difficult 
           postures as the couple looks on in pride and the class looks 
           on in awe.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Well, this should help even out the 
                        gender ratio at our next teacher 
                        training.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        I was thinking the same thing. 
                        Overall, it's good publicity.
                                         (Beat)
                        We just...we might want to consider 
                        advising Bikram to pull back a little.

           Rajashree looks up at her, waiting for her to continue.

           Minakshi picks up the magazine.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        It's just...and Clancy was all about 
                        it...but a few of his comments here 
                        might be opening us up to some legal 
                        liability: "There are the stories 
                        about him having sex with his 
                        students. He claims they blackmail 
                        him", "They say to me, 'Boss, you must 
                        fuck me or I will kill myself,' then I 
                        do it! Think if I don't! The karma!"

           Knowing she's just humiliated Rajashree, Minakshi continues 
           beyond relevance to soften the blow.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        "Whatever the nature of his 
                        dalliances, his appeal to women is 
                        obvious. When Swami Vivekananda toured 
                        the U.S. at the end of the 19th 
                        century, it was the same way. Mostly 
                        women showed up for his lectures."

           At this, Rajashree grabs the magazine out of her hands.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Great, sure.        what he writes 
                                     That's                
                        about Swami Vivekananda. Fantastic.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        The article itself says Bikram has a 
                        "penchant for hyperbole." Certainly no 
                        one believe-

           Here, Rajashree senses she's being comforted. It wounds her 
           pride, and she rudely interrupts.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I'll speak to him. Tell him to tamp 
                        down the rhetoric. If that's your 
                        professional opinion.

           Undeterred, Minakshi delivers the next line too gently.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Would you prefer I spoke to him?

                                 RAJASHREE
                                         (Coldly polite)
                        I'll handle it.

           Minakshi stands to go, then turns to face Rajashree, who rubs 
           her temples in frustration. But when she speaks, she does so 
           calmly.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        On second thought, perhaps he'll pay 
                        more heed if the news comes from you. 
                        It's a business matter, after all. A 
                        legal issue.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Of course. Either way, I think at this 
                        point we've milked the brash 
                        blustering personality for all it's 
                        worth. Courting controversy has its 
                        limits. From a branding perspective.

           Rajashree picks up her papers and resumes her task.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Yes, he ought to pull back. Exhibit 
                        more restraint.

                        Exactly. I'll suggest he tone it down 
                        across the board. Generally.

           Rajashree gestures at another chair in the room, indicating 
           that Minakshi is welcome to sit.

           Minakshi takes her up on the offer. A moment of brief, silent 
           camaraderie.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Do you think he'll listen?

           Rajashree turns to face her.

           INT. TOWN AND COUNTRY RESORT SAN DIEGO

           A class full of students lies in savasana.

                                 BIKRAM
                        They should ship all gay people to an 
                        abandoned, isolated island and leave 
                        them there to die of AIDS.

           PANDHORA WILLIAMS's (early 30s, African-American woman) eyes 
           shoot open and widen. She looks to her left and her right, 
           trying to see if anyone has had a reaction beyond the few 
           nervous titters.

           When she sees a YOUNG FEMALE TRAINEE attempt to leave the 
           class (LARGE MEN guard the doors), she is relieved and sits 
           up, as if to gather her things.

           The doorman shakes his head, gesturing at the trainee to 
           return to her mat. The trainee, embarrassed, motions at the 
           blood dripping down her leg.

           Pandhora immediately lies back down.

           The doorman is unsure of what to do. He looks to Bikram.

                                 BIKRAM
                                         (Shouting)
                        Where are you going? To change your 
                        tampon?

           Hundreds of people hear the words echo through the hall. The 
           trainee nods with shame. Bikram laughs coldly and nods to the 
           doorman, who lets her out. We see her wipe away tears as she 
           disappears from view.

                                 BIKRAM
                        You see? Women, they are bitches and

                        whores. They are here for one thing, 
                        and that is to make babies.

           Bikram motions to the doorman to lock the door behind her.

           LATER

           The class is over, and exhausted students are filing out of 
           the room.

                                 BIKRAM
                        A short, one hour break. We have a 
                        long session this afternoon. No 
                        stuffing your faces.

           As per usual, some students flock to Bikram to ask questions 
           about an injury or for advice on a posture (typical yoga 
           stuff), or even just to shake his hand or take a picture 
           (unique to Bikram).

           Pandhora lines up behind them, and when it is her turn, she 
           approaches Bikram deferentially, cautiously.

           Bikram puts his arm around her to pose for a picture.

                                 PANDHORA
                        No, Bikram, thank you, but...

                                 BIKRAM
                        Yes, do you have a question?

                                 PANDHORA
                        I do...

                                 BIKRAM
                        Come on, out with it!

                                 PANDHORA
                        I...I was wondering, Bikram, whether 
                        you meant what you said?

                                 BIKRAM
                        About what? I always mean what I say. 
                        Even when I am joking, there is some 
                        truth in it.

                                 PANDHORA
                        So you believe, then, that all women 
                        are good for is making babies?

                        Listen, that girl, she walked out, in 
                        the middle of class. After I said 
                        that, said women were not good enough 
                        for my training, did not have what it 
                        takes, did you see anybody else walk 
                        out? No! I have to motivate the 
                        student. If you hate me, that is fine. 
                        But I will make a yogi out of you.

                                 PANDHORA
                        What about what you said about gay 
                        people? Did that have a motivational 
                        purpose?

           A small crowd has now gathered to observe the confrontation. 
           People ask questions of Bikram during these sessions, but no 
           one ever questions him.

           He nervously eyes the growing crowd, though he'd never admit 
           to being nervous.

                                 BIKRAM
                        What do you care? Are you a lesbian?

                                 PANDHORA
                        That's not the poin-- Bikram, yoga is 
                        so beautiful and so pure.

                                 BIKRAM
                        Hey! What is this? Are you here to 
                        tell me what yoga is? I tell you what 
                        yoga is! I am Bikram! Who are you? All 
                        these people, they come here to learn 
                        from me, not from you.

           Bikram gestures at the doormen, who also function, 
           apparently, as his pseudo-security detail. They move in 
           closer.

                                 PANDHORA
                        But why preach hate? There is so much 
                        hatred in the world. Why not instead 
                        preach love? You're breaking my heart.

                                 BIKRAM
                        We don't sell love here, you fucking 
                        black bitch. Get out.

           A few people whistle, sigh, or mumble under their breaths. 
           Pandhora sees that the guards are moving closer. She again

           looks to the crowd for a response.

           We zoom in on body parts again: this time, eyes, 
           intentionally avoiding her gaze, and mouths, whispering to 
           each other about her or sealed shut.

           The guards escort her out of the room, not violently, but not 
           gently, either.

           She looks back at Bikram, one last time, as he signs an 
           autograph for an admirer. Bikram is bold enough (unapologetic 
           enough) to make eye contact.

                                 BIKRAM
                        And don't come back!

           INT. BIKRAM YOGA STUDIO

           Minakshi takes a class. The instructor is FRANCESCA ASUMAH, a 
           half-Ghanian, half-British woman in her early 40s, with a 
           British accent.

           The class is wrapping up, Francesca at the front of the room 
           instructing STUDENTS on pranayama, the students each 
           breathing in short, stilted breaths.

           The sequence completes, everyone's breathing slows, and she 
           closes her eyes calmly, and then opens them again, refreshed.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Wonderful work today, everyone.

           The students clean off and roll up their mats as they gather 
           their towels and walk toward the doors. Only Minakshi remains 
           seated, her breathing erratic.

           She draws the attention of some of her classmates, some of 
           whom look to Francesca expectantly, but nobody stops or 
           attempts to help her.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Minakshi?

           Francesca approaches Minakshi, who is now in full-on panic 
           attack mode. She lifts Minakshi's head in her hands.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Minakshi? Here, just breathe.

           She guides her gently and calmly to deepen her breath. 
           Minakshi is, momentarily, relieved.

                        alright.

           Minakshi looks back at her, embarrassed but still wanting. 
           Francesca reads her perfectly.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Are you alright?

           LATER

           Francesca and Minakshi sit comfortably in the far corner of 
           the studio, next to the open windows. They sip from cups of 
           tea.

                        I always knew he was an off-the-cuff 
                        guy. Not politically correct.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Ha!

           That's an understatement.

                        this whole thing. About his

                        There are some days he'll be calling 
                        me a "bitch," other days he's asking 
                        me to get into bed with him. And now 
                        with this lawsuit...I think I might be

                        I suppose I am. Maybe I'm not. I never 
                        really thought much about it.

                        I'm mixed, you know. When Bikram found 
                        out..."You shouldn't have been born" 
                        were his words, I think. "People like 
                        you shouldn't be born."

           Minakshi walks through the hall with Bikram, chasing after 
           him, waving a paper.

                        Bikram, we need to talk about this!

           Bikram turns to another person in the office, an AIDE who 
           clearly isn't following the conversation.

                                 BIKRAM

                        What is she talking about?

           Minakshi catches up to him when he pauses. The entire time he 
           looks at her without recognition.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        I am talking about the fact that I 
                        have been subpoenaed to testify.

           A hush falls over the office and they all look toward the 
           arguing pair. Bikram grabs the paper out of her hand. He 
           looks around, and everyone continues to work. More quietly, 
           but enough to drown out their words.

                                 BIKRAM
                        And you are being subpoenaed?

                        Yes. I just received a note today 
                        from...

           Minakshi looks down at the paper.

                        Well, then. We'll just have to tell 
                        them we don't know where you are.

           He walks into his office and slams the door. Minakshi looks 
           after him, frightened and frustrated, as Rajashree looks on. 
           She raises her hand, indicating that Minakshi should take a 
           moment and calm down. Minakshi nods and walks away, while 
           Rajashree enters Bikram's office.

           Bikram hands her a paper. A resume. The name at the top: 
           "Petra Starke." Rajashree is stunned.

                        This woman wrote to me. A true Bikram

           Sarah sits in front of a lawyer, MARY SHEA HAGEBOLS (white 
           woman, early 40s), and her two AIDES.

           She gives a deposition; a camera is in the room. We enter in 
           media res.

           This scene in which she "testifies" is distinct from the rest 
           of the film: there are no abrupt cut aways, no cut aways at 
           all, no flashy, frenetic pacing, no music. It isn't remotely 
           stylized. We stay tightly on Sarah's face throughout--- we 
           have to wallow in our discomfort when she chokes up or 
           pauses. We are forced to react to her words in isolation with 
           no visual or aural tidbits that signal, one way or the other, 
           their truthfulness. And we are forced to reflect on that 
           reaction when we learn what we're about to find out.

                        I've been practicing Bikram since

                        that his relationship with young 
                        female students was different. 
                        Inappropriate. But I assumed there 
                        were cultural differences I didn't 
                        understand. Maybe the young women were 
                        just overly enthusiastic.

                        to retaliate. He'd glower down at me 
                        from the podium, shoot me nasty looks 
                        while loudly instructing others. It

                        Did he ever offer an apology for his

                        To my boyfriend. He told him "things 
                        happen," and he hoped he wasn't 
                        unhappy.

                                 MARY SHEA
                        Did things ever return to normal in

                                 SARAH
                        I thought they might. He started 
                        demanding that I be the one to brush 
                        his hair. He kept prodding me until I 
                        gave in.

                        And then he called on me to 
                        demonstrate again. I thought he meant 
                        I was back in his good graces. But 
                        when he was assisting me with a 
                        posture, "assisting me," he pulled on 
                        my top leg so hard he tore my 
                        hamstring. When I complained about the 
                        pain he mocked me in front of the 
                        entire class. I tore another muscle. I 
                        was immobilized.

                                 MARY SHEA
                        Was he still coming on to you, 
                        romantically?

                                 SARAH
                        Yes, still. So I started telling more 
                        people at the Yoga College, other 
                        studio owners. But everyone made 
                        excuses: "You know how he is", "Of 
                        course he's going to try to be with 
                        pretty, flexible girls", and, the 
                        classic, "You have to separate the man 
                        from the teacher. From the yoga."
                                         (Beat)
                        And meanwhile the thing was exploding, 
                        everything was growing so fast. More 
                        and more people started coming through 
                        the doors. I realized that if I didn't 
                        warn people, didn't warn these young 
                        girls, young girls like me, no one was 
                        going to.

                        So I did. And they confided in me, 
                        too. They told me stories about

                        money teaching seminars or advanced 
                        classes. Sometimes they got driven out 
                        of the organization altogether. Or 
                        their boyfriends or husbands found out 
                        and made them quit. Or they just

                        I kept going. I tried not to be alone 
                        with him. I really did try.

                        Even the night I went to his home, it 
                        was supposed to be a family dinner. I 
                        even arrived early, to help his wife 
                        in the kitchen.

                                 MARY SHEA
                        What prevented you?

                                 SARAH
                        Bikram. I asked him about my chances 
                        at Internationals, the International 
                        Yoga competition. And he put his hand 
                        on my leg, started whispering sexual 
                        demands in my ear. He grabbed me from 
                        behind and pressed his penis into my 
                        leg. I was shocked. I froze.

           Sarah starts to cry. The aide reaches over to turn off the 
           camera but Mary Shea holds his arm, preventing him. She 
           eventually composes herself and continues.

                                 SARAH
                        He told me, "I can make you a 
                        champion. It's the only way." I was 
                        livid. I pushed him off of me and told 
                        him I could do it on my own. He kept 
                        shouting "no," shaking his head at me, 
                        so I asked him outright. "Are you 
                        saying the only way I'll be a champion 
                        is to sleep with you?"

                                 MARY SHEA
                        And his response?

                        I wanted so, so badly to prove him 
                        wrong. I gave the best performance of 
                        my life at Nationals. Until 
                        Internationals. Where I gave the best 
                        performance of my life again. The 
                        judges knew it, the audience knew it. 
                        I was the clear winner.
                                         (Aside)
                        And this stuff is no joke, either. 
                        People think "oh, yoga championships, 
                        whatever," but people train for 
                        months. For years. Train hard. The 
                        winner gets a significant amount of 
                        money-- thousands and thousands of 
                        dollars, a huge donation to the 
                        charity of your choice, funded travel, 
                        your accommodations are covered, 
                        publicity. Important opportunities. To 
                        teach and to learn. I'll never know 
                        what I could've become.

                        People knew I was robbed. The judges, 
                        even. They told me outright. But 
                        still, the people at the Yoga College 
                        wouldn't admit it, they couldn't, they 
                        wouldn't admit a thing.

                        Do you know what they said to me? When

                        psychological block. That I lost 
                        because, on some level, I wanted to.

                        deserve it, and then someone can come 
                        along and snatch it right out of your 
                        hands on a whim. And it isn't his 
                        fault, oh no. It's not his fault for 
                        being spiteful, being spoiled, being a 
                        thief. It's yours. Because that's how

                        gets anything-- the only reason 
                        anything ever happens to you-- is 
                        because you must, on some level, have 
                        really, really wanted it. Isn't that 
                        just awfully fucking convenient?

           Rajashree walks into the garage, where Bikram is working on 
           one of his many cars. He doesn't look up.

           Still calmly, gracefully, she maneuvers between the vehicles 
           until she's standing right beside him. She SLAMS the trunk 
           shut.

           He jumps and looks at her expectantly, though he doesn't know 
           what quite to expect.

           We don't know either.

                        is not, as it reads here, the

                        Yoga College of India." That's it. Not 
                        "Bikram's." This is, this is a gross 
                        violation of legal---

           Minakshi realizes that Bikram isn't paying attention to her 
           at all. He is still just staring at Rajashree. He seems to 
           feel, for the first time, vulnerable.

           Minakshi looks out at Rajashree then back at Bikram. More 
           with dismay than concern, she says:

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Bikram, what the hell is going on?

           INT. LUXURY HOTEL SUITE

           Minakshi arrives at Rajashree's hotel suite with a box of 
           files and a bottle of wine. Rajashree's eyes are swollen and 
           red.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Come in, come in.

                        Thanks for bringing these over.

                        Of course.

           Minakshi places her things down and the two embrace. 
           Rajashree closes her eyes, getting emotional for a moment, 
           then abruptly pulls away.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Come, come. Sit.

                        So there are two women now?

           Minakshi carries the box over. The two go through the files 
           as they discuss.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Yes, two women in addition to the one 
                        who came out already.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And what was the quote..."A hotbed 
                        of..."

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Yes, about the teacher training. "It 
                        was a hotbed of alleged harassment and 
                        abuse."

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Well, that GQ article won't be such 
                        good PR anymore. You were right to 
                        flag it as a liability.

           Minakshi takes no pleasure in this.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        And there's one false imprisonment, 
                        and a human trafficking charge, in 
                        addition to the harassment?

           Minakshi nods.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Some of these lines are going to hurt 
                        us from a branding point of view?

                        now, those charges are just 
                        allegations, they'll play that way in

                        I should have had a contingency plan 
                        in place. From Day One. I was just 
                        sitting around. Waiting for the other

                        I think we both were.

           Rajashree looks at her with a flicker of confusion, then 
           anger. Minakshi doesn't notice.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        You know, we don't have to work 
                        tonight. We can just drink, and talk, 
                        and...

           Rajashree rises abruptly wearing an artificial smile.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        It's been a long day.

           She leads Minakshi by the arm toward the door.

                        Maybe we should just call it.

           Rajashree enters the garage. Bikram is not working on a car, 
           just sitting in the passenger seat of one, leaning back, 
           staring blankly ahead. (Important not to portray him 
           sympathetically here. This is meant to illustrate his 
           deterioration, nothing more.)

           Rajashree enters the car.

           She is in the driver's seat.

                        I don't think we should do this. I

           Bikram nods. Rajashree is silent. He turns to her and she 
           raises her eyebrows.

           He defeatedly shakes his head "no."

           Rajashree begins:

           turns to look at her. Rajashree does not avert her eyes, and

           unfeeling, empty gaze.

           EXHAUSTED. He groans loudly.

           He rises eventually and washes his hands at the sink. He 
           picks up a bottle of BLACK HAIR DYE and, in painstaking 
           detail, searches his hair for grey roots-- he's done this 
           before.

           He picks up a magnifying mirror, examining his wrinkles 
           closely. When he spots a faint line, he opens a drawer to 
           reveal a row of NEEDLES filled with BOTOX.

           He injects himself, dabbing away the drops of blood that

           He moves slowly, lethargically. He is OLD. Again, this is not 
           sympathetic. It is disgust-inducing. Grotesque.

           Over the course of the entire routine he does not once meet 
           his own gaze.

                        all. Presidents! Nixon, Clinton. All 
                        of them. They ask for me, Bikram. 
                        Sometimes, they doubt me. They say, 
                        "Maybe I should go to a doctor." But 
                        your doctors here, they know nothing. 
                        I say "give me one class." That is all 
                        I need to cure you. Of anything! Just 
                        one class. And I fix them. I am 
                        Bikram!

                        It doesn't matter when she knew, 
                        whether she knew. What matters is that 
                        she created a culture, she had a 
                        leadership position in an 
                        organization, where such behavior went 
                        unchecked. I don't think she 
                        understands what I went through. 
                        Bikram's behavior wasn't just racist 
                        and misogynistic. It was erratic.

                        But I was dependent on them for 
                        everything. Bikram would say he gave 
                        me everything. But that means I needed 
                        them for everything. For my housing, 
                        for my immigration status. By the time 
                        I was escorted off the premises I 
                        hadn't been paid in months. I have a 
                        daughter. A young daughter. I don't 
                        think Rajashree understands how 
                        vulnerable I was. I don't think she 
                        knows what it's like to be that

                        Well, given the young age at which 
                        Mrs. Choudhury entered this marriage, 
                        her lack of familiarity with our legal 
                        systems here, we couldn't expect her 
                        to have entered into an equitable pre-
                        nuptual agreement. And since she has 
                        proven to be a more credible, and more 
                        cooperative, witness than Mr. 
                        Choudhury, there is no reason to, no 
                        evidence to cast doubt on her claims 
                        that she was unaware of the alleged 
                        abuses. So it is only fair to exempt 
                        her from liability for any current or 
                        future penalties inflicted on Mr. 
                        Choudhury for these or any future

                        Bikram, what do you have to say about 
                        the charges of rape and abuse? Do you 
                        owe your victims an apology?

                        Bikram, we have investigated those 
                        claims you made to the judge. Governor 
                        Brown and his office both 
                        categorically deny them. They say they

           Rajashree's lawyer rattles off the same series of questions 
           to their seemingly uninterested client.

                                 R LAWYER 1
                        And did you, in the capacity of your 
                        role at the Yoga College of India LP 
                        or any Bikram subsidiaries or 
                        holdings, ever knowingly tell or 
                        repeat a lie about Mr. Choudhury the 
                        man or Bikram the company?

                                 RAJASHREE
                        No.

                                 R LAWYER 1
                        And did you-

                        The lies I told were bigger.

           Everyone's eyes JOLT up. Rajashree remains detached.

           Her team of layers are RATTLED. They ruffle their papers.

           R LAWYER 1 eyes the camera at the head of the table, 
           recording the scene.

                                 R LAWYER 1
                        I'm sorry, Ms. Choudhury, can you repe-

           Rajashree eyes the camera, too. She knows what she's doing.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        The lies I told were bigger.

           INT. PLANE

           Bikram sits in a window seat in FIRST CLASS. He has a birds 
           eye view of the country he came to decades ago, for what he 
           knows may be-- will likely be-- the very last time.

           He SLAMS the window shut.

                                 RAJASHREE (V.O.)
                        Bikram has lied to me my entire life.

           INT. COMPETITION STAGE (FANTASY FLASHBACK)

           Bikram remembers, vividly, scenes we now know to be FALSE. 
           But this time they are even more grandiose and ABSURD.

                                 RAJASHREE (V.O.)
                        He lied about his background, he lied 
                        about our marriage, he lied about his 
                        affairs, he lied about his assaults.

           A teenage Bikram stands on the competition stage-- this time 
           Bishnu Ghosh hoists him on his shoulders as he holds a giant 
           trophy. The audience throws flowers at him.

           INT. STADIUM (FANTASY FLASHBACK)

           Bikram holds a heavy weight high above his head in a large 
           stadium filled with spectators, who again throw flowers on 
           him and shower him with applause.

                                 RAJASHREE (V.O.)
                        He's been lying easily, effortlessly, 
                        casually, about everything, for as 
                        long as I can remember.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE (FANTASY FLASHBACK)

           Bikram shakes hands with a grateful Richard Nixon inside the 
           Oval Office, a crowd of photographers snapping pictures, 
           inexplicably throwing flowers on the pair.

                                 RAJASHREE (V.O.)
                        And not just to me, to everyone, to 
                        all of you, for as long as you've 
                        known him, too.

           Bikram reclines, closing his eyes.

           We won't see him again.

           INT. OTHER LAW OFFICE

           When Rajashree says "you", she doesn't mean the people in 
           this room. She's speaking generally, and it shows.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I don't think he even knows what the 
                        truth is anymore. He certainly doesn't 
                        care. Fantastic lies. About anything 
                        you can think of. Anything he could 
                        think of.

                        But the lies I told were bigger.

                                 R LAWYER 2
                        Why don't we take a break and regro-

                                 RAJASHREE
                                         (To Petra)
                        How old were     when you met Mr. 
                                     ___                  
                                     you                  
                        Choudhury?

           Petra looks to her lawyer.

                                 P LAWYER 1
                        Don't answer that.

           Petra looks back to Rajashree and smiles. SMUGLY.

           Rajashree smiles as well, but as she speaks she grows angry. 
           A quiet anger. PASSIONATE, but not erratic. She's grounded.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Bikram lied about his life, about 
                        yoga, about India. But the lies I told 
                        -- the ones he repeated-- they weren't 
                        about Bikram and they weren't about 
                        that place.
                                         (She gestures in the East's 
                                         general direction)
                        They were about this one.

           Here, Rajashree no longer speaks generally. She is being very 
           precise:

           Created using Celtx

                        They were about you.
                                         (To Petra)
                        And you ate them up.

           Petra's eyes SHOOT daggers. She realizes she was had.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Do you know what you call a lie in 
                        this country? Do you know what you 
                        call an utterly fantastical, 
                        unbelievable lie, a myth of your own 
                        making, here in America?

                        And America is the most profitable 
                        brand of all.

           Rajashree sits back.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        This country will believe anything you 
                        tell it about itself. Anything good. 
                        If you're selling it, this country is 
                        buying. So here, in this room--

           Here, Rajashree addresses not just Petra, and not just 
           Petra's lawyers, but also her own.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        --don't you all talk to me, don't you 
                        all look at me, like I'm the first 
                        person who ever built a fortune on a 
                        fraud.

           P Lawyer 1 shuts her folder and gathers her papers with a 
           satisfied, decisive finality.

                                 P LAWYER 1
                        Well what we're hoping, Mrs. 
                        Choudhury, is that you'll be the last.

           At this, Rajashree smirks, holding back laughter. She 
           blatantly, dismissively eyes Petra up and down.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I doubt it. I really, really doubt it.

           It is Rajashree's turn to be smug.

           INT. YOGA COLLEGE OF INDIA HQ - BIKRAM'S OFFICE

           Minakshi enters the office complex...formerly bustling with 
           frenetic energy, it's now dead. A few stray papers on top of 
           a few desks.

           A lone figure sits at the desk. We cannot see who is in it.

           Minakshi takes a deep breath and enters. The chair swivels 
           around: Rajashree.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        I was told that you wanted to see me.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        In exchange for what?

                                 MINAKSHI
                        You tell me.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I don't think I have to.

           Minakshi looks at her skeptically, feeling her out.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        You were told I wanted to see you, of 
                        course. But that isn't why you're 
                        here.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        We still don't know where Bikram is?

           Rajashree shrugs.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        His housekeeper has not seen him in 
                        weeks. Which means that, for now, 
                        there is no money to move. A mess, 
                        that's all he left behind. A gigantic 
                        mess.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        I was told that you were willing to 
                        hand over control of The Yoga College 
                        of India.

                        I was told that control would go to 
                        me, and me alone. That you would give 
                        Petra a cash payout, but no stake in 
                        the company.

           Rajashree takes a set of keys out of her pocket. She places 
           them on the desk in between them.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        In exchange for what?

           Minakshi is exasperated. She's done being tested.

                                 MINAKSHI
                        In exchange for this meeting.

           Rajashree gestures that she should take a seat. Minakshi eyes 
           the keys and relents.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Do you remember the story of Swami 
                        Vivekananda?

                                 MINAKSHI
                        He came here to spread his teachings. 
                        He came here, to America, because it 
                        is the greatest country...

                                         (In unison, sing-songy)
                        The greatest country in the world.

           Rajashree laughs, wryly, and Minakshi offers up a dry, 
           wistful smile in spite of herself.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Do you know what he found when he got 
                        here?

           Minakshi half shrugs, half gestures broadly, as if to say 
           "All of this."

                                 RAJASHREE
                        He found a mean and vicious country 
                        with a primitive caste system. "Whites 
                        Only," that's what he heard at every 
                        hotel he went. He wasn't at the 
                        bottom, but he was damn close.

                        Their words, not mine. I only gave 
                        them a short quote.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        But you didn't correct them. I know 
                        your resume by heart, Minakshi. You 
                        were educated at a small, for-profit 
                        college in the town of Oxford, but you 
                        did not receive a law degree from 
                        Oxford University.

                        So it's technically accurate, then, 
                        isn't it? Which is more than you can 
                        say for half the articles up there.

           Minakshi gestures at the wall behind Rajashree.

                                 RAJASHREE

                        Well, then, perhaps you should hire 
                        her. I'm sure you could use the 
                        counsel.

                        She isn't as smart as you are.

           Minakshi is shocked, genuinely moved. Shocked                 
                                                         to find herself 
           genuinely moved.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Do you know what they say about me? 
                        That I arrived a submissive, obedient 
                        Indian wife. But here, in the States, 
                        I became smart and strong. They say 
                        that is why I'm smart and strong. 
                        Because I became Westernized.

                        How does it feel to be out of that 
                        burqa?

           Rajashree laughs-- surprised but dry.

                                 RAJASHREE
                                         (Sarcastic)
                        It feels great. It feels great to 
                        finally be out of that burqa.

                        They don't know, do they, what Indian 
                        women are?

           Rajashree stands and gathers her things.

                                 RAJASHREE
                                         (Matter-of-factly)
                        This is a stupid country filled with 
                        stupid people who have been far too 
                        rich and far too powerful for far too 
                        long.

                        Don't go chasing after their respect 
                        on their terms. Don't look for their 
                        validation.
                                         (Not unkindly)
                        You're never, ever going to get it.

           The two circle the table, remaining on opposite sides of the 
           entire time, facing each other, until they've switched 
           places.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Petra isn't as smart as you, Minakshi. 
                        I told Bikram so. And I should have 
                        told you, too.

           Rajashree gestures that Minakshi should sit. In Bikram's 
           chair.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        But I shouldn't have had to.

           Minakshi sits.

           Rajashree takes in the sight. She loves it, but it's 
           bittersweet. She turns to exit.

           Behind her, Minakshi folds her hands, nods her head, and 
           calls, performatively...

                                 MINAKSHI
                        Namaste.

           Rajashree returns the gesture, faux-ironically, but actually 
           quite sincere.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Namaste.

           She leaves the room.

           INT. YOGA STUDIO

           Rajashree enters a random yoga studio. A giant statute of 
           Ganesh greets her.

                                 VOICE
                        Welcome.

           Rajashree looks up to see a white receptionist (to whom the 
           voice belongs), who hands Rajashree a pricing menu.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Is this your first time here?

           Rajashree nods.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        In that case, we offer an intro 
                        package...unlimited classes for your 
                        first week for just $15.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Great, I'll do that.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Fantastic.

           Woman looks at Rajashree expectantly. After a pause...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        That'll be $15.

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Oh, right.

           Rajashree hands her cash.

                        There's a bathroom in the back, and 
                        you can just hang out in the studio 
                        whenever you're ready.
                                         (Checks watch.)
                        Class should begin in about 15 
                        minutes.

           Rajashree smiles and takes her change. She enters the class 
           with her mat. This is not a Bikram studio--- there is no 
           carpeting, no overbearing heat.

           She places her mat down carefully, front row center, eyeing 
           the hardwood floors to ensure it is perfectly aligned.

           She sits in lotus pose and closes her eyes in meditation. She 
           is entranced and doesn't notice...

           A group of white MUSICIANS wearing white robes enters, and 
           begins to set up their traditional Indian instruments.

           Slowly, other students begin to enter the classroom, chatting 
           merrily with each other. As a group of WOMEN (Caucasian) 
           enters, one edges Rajashree away.

                                 WOMAN
                                         (Rudely)
                        Excuse me. Excuse me!

           Rajashree, startled, is jolted out of her trance. She opens 
           her eyes, surprised to find another student so close when 
           there is plenty of room elsewhere.

                                 WOMAN

           Rajashree hurriedly moves out of the way and rearranges her 
           mat. The YOGA TEACHER enters.

                                 TEACHER
                        Hello, class! I see we have some new 
                        faces here today.
                                         (To Rajashree)
                        Is this your first class?

                                 RAJASHREE
                        I'm sorry?

                                 TEACHER

           Rajashree opens her mouth to answer instinctively, but upon a 
           moment's reflection...

                                 RAJASHREE
                        Not in quite some time, actually. Not 
                        in quite some time.

                                         (To Rajashree)
                        Um, ok. Well, this is an advanced 
                        class, so if you-

                        - or anyone else- needs to take a 
                        break, you should always feel free to 
                        take child's pose.

                        So, as you can see, we have a special 
                        treat today. The Wild Lotus band is 
                        here to provide us with some live 
                        music as we go through our practice. 
                        So, let's begin.

           The music begins-- this is the same music we heard at the 
           beginning of the film, during the flashbacks to India.

           Rajashree goes through the ordinary paces of class with ROTE 
           grace and ease as the teacher leads.

           Eventually, Rajashree holds a CROW POSE-- a misleadingly easy 
           posture. As she balances on her hands, she stares at a spot 
           on the floor in front of her. Slowly, her gaze rises. She 
           locks eyes with her own reflection, and...

           COLLAPSES out of a pose, tumbling forward onto her face. 
           BLOOD drips from her nose.

           A few other practitioners look at Rajashree, some concerned, 
           some disgusted, some annoyed by the distraction.

           Rajashree looks at the musicians, at the reflection of 
           Ganesha on the wall, around her at the white faces, then back 
           to the mirror. She covers her face in her hands, and we 
           assume she's begun to sob, but then...

           She removes her hands, and instead we see that she is 
           laughing. First a soft chuckle, then loud, hysterical 
           laughter.

                                 RAJASHREE
                                         (Muffled)
                        I'm sorry-I'm so-

           Created using Celtx                                          
           She can barely eke out the apology through her laughter.

           She stands.

           She walks toward the door...she doesn't even bother to pick 
           up her mat.

           There is NO ONE there to obstruct her, NO ONE at the front of 
           the room SCOLDING her, admonishing her not to leave.

           She takes a deep breath, sighs with contentment, and exits.

                                 YOGA TEACHER
                                         (Flustered, with faux-authority)
                        Yoga...can sometimes...bring up lots 
                        of emotions... for... people...

           One of the musicians nods emphatically, genuinely moved by 
           the scene. The Teacher cues them to begin playing again, but 
           we don't hear what follows.

                        this. Please donât do this.â And he 
                        starts calling me an idiot, just over 
                        and over again. And then he penetrates 
                        me and I scream, âYouâre hurting me. 
                        Youâre hurting me.â I screamed it. And 
                        he replies, âItâs supposed to hurt.â 
                        All of a sudden, like, the veil lifts, 
                        the veil of who I think this person 
                        is.

                        Yeah. He hurt me, he assaulted me. I 
                        felt so disgusting, but I just did 
                        what he told me to do, which was 
                        basically, like, manually jerk him 
                        off. I hated doing it. But I felt like 
                        I owed him, you know? I felt like I 
                        owed him for, like, my life. He 
                        definitely took something from me that 
                        I've never been able to get back 
                        again.

                        My love for myself. My purpose in 
                        life. I can't do yoga anymore. It 
                        makes me feel sick.

                        He's no longer, like, the treasured 
                        teacher. The mentor. He's, you know, 
                        the man who raped me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Because of my experience. Because of 
                        the other women's experience. There 
                        are women who are frightened.

           We now see that Andrea also interviewed Sarah Baughn for the 
           segment.

                                 SARAH
                        No. No, I tried...a few months ago, I 
                        think, and I, I didn't make it in the 
                        door. I showed up and I, I ended up 
                        crying in the parking lot. I couldn't 
                        go in.

                        But I'm glad that I tried. To try to 
                        take a yoga class.

                        It was a good first step, I think.

           We cut, visually, between Sarah, Maggie, and Jill's faces. 
           Each has tears in her eyes.

                        We were able to track Bikram down at a 
                        teacher training in Mumbai, where we 
                        confronted him about these 
                        allegations.

                        This is what he had to say.

           Television abruptly shuts off.

           EXT. YOGA STUDIO- DAY

           Silence, except for the sounds of the Los Angeles street.

           The exterior wall of a Beverly Hills studio reads "BIKRAM". 
           Above, a row of windows. This was the first, original studio.

           But it looks different now, as it stands on a developed 
           street, between a juice bar and a sushi restaurant.

           A blonde woman walks by, an adorable well-groomed dog peeking 
           out of her Louis Vuitton bag. More white passers by, more 
           blatantly branded bags. ABJECT WEALTH.

           A group of PAINTERS (Hispanic, aged 20-40) approaches, joking 
           with each other in inaudible Spanish. They set up a ladder, 
           and one painter climbs.

           He begins to paint OVER the name.

           A group of WOMEN, clad in designer Lululemon, stroll by the 
           painters with no acknowledgment, entering the studio, and 
           eventually emerging in the windows above. They lay out their 
           mats in preparation for class.

           As the painters continue their work, the epilogues appear.

           Text: "After Sarah, Jill, and Maggie, a wave of women came 
           forward to publicly share their stories."

           Text: "Many of them approached the LAPD, but Bikram never 
           faced criminal charges."

           Text: "Some filed, and won, civil suits against Bikram."

           INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT

           We see a series of images on Bikram Chouhdury's Instagram 
           account, all advertising expensive teacher trainings, 
           classes, and lectures abroad.

           Above Petra's picture, the logo for "Sweat N Glow" appears.

           Underneath the picture, her title: "Founder and Chief 
           Idealist."

           The image of her face is copied and pasted, so there are six 
           duplicates. Five of the pictures morph ever so slightly to 
           produce different faces-- the other Sweat N Glow executives, 
           with their respective titles-- in a way that emphasizes their 
           racial homogeneity.

           Then, a quote from Petra, in glittery pink script, with an 
           animated twinkle: "I do not sweat, I sparkle."

           We move on.

           EXT. YOGA CENTER- INDIA

           Rajashree instructs a group of young Indian children in yoga. 
           She speaks to them faux-sternly and angrily.

           Text: "Rajashree still gives paid lectures and yoga classes. 
           She is also an active philanthropist."

           Rajashree breaks character as the children giggle. She hugs 
           them affectionately, kissing their foreheads.

           Then, we zoom out, and she reviews pictures of these images 
           with a photographer, as their mothers dote over them in the 
           background. She speaks to him in Hinglish, explaining that 
           she wants them displayed prominently on her web site. (We 
           make out the last two words.)

           Empty and dead, as it was when we saw it last. Only Minakshi 
           paces back and forth in Bikram's office, rehearsing.

           EXT. ORIGINAL BIKRAM YOGA STUDIO

           The now-packed yoga class inside is ongoing, steam fogging up 
           the windows.

           The painters are where we left them-- one wipes the sweat off 
           his brow in the BLISTERING heat.

           It appears their work is almost done. But then we zoom in:

           Peeking out from behind layers of grey, fading further with 
           each coat of paint but still stubbornly visible: the name 
           "BIKRAM". *
