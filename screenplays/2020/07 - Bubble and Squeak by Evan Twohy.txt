           CLOSE ON:

           A frying pan of meats and vegetables.

           Potatoes sizzle.
           Butter bubbles.
           Chopped cabbages hiss.

                                                            SMASH TO:

           AIRPORT HOLDING ROOM

           Concrete walls.
           Grates over the windows. 
           Metal folding chairs.
           A single overhead light.

           DECLAN (34) and DELORES (33) sit at a table.
           They wear Hawaiian shirts and fanny packs.
           Two Samsonite suitcases beside them.
           They look anxious and jet-lagged.

                                 DELORES
                        I’m scared. 

                                 DECLAN
                        Don’t worry. They must be confused. 
                        It’s just a misunderstanding, 
                        that’s all.

                                 DELORES
                        I wish they’d tell us how much 
                        longer we’ll be in here.

                                 DECLAN
                        Well, they can’t keep us in here 
                        forever.

           Declan sniffs the air.
                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Huh.

                                 DELORES
                        What?

                                 DECLAN
                        It smells like cabbages in here.

                                 DELORES
                        Cabbages?

                                 DECLAN
                        Smell the air. Do you smell that? 
                        Cabbages.

           Delores sniffs.

                                 DELORES
                        I don’t smell anything.

                                 DECLAN
                        Smell harder.

           Delores sniffs again.

                                 DELORES
                        Maybe a little.

                                 DECLAN
                        That smell is in the soil of this 
                        country. It’s in the air. It’s 
                        everywhere. During the war, the 
                        only thing the people of this 
                        country had to eat was cabbage. 
                        Allies couldn’t get food past the 
                        blockades. For ten straight years, 
                        the people of this country ate 
                        nothing but cabbage. It’s very sad.

                                 DELORES
                        I like cabbage.

                                 DECLAN
                        Shh! Don’t say anything about 
                        cabbage. We can talk about cabbage 
                        all we like when we’re back at 
                        home, but while we’re in this 
                        country, don’t mention cabbage. If 
                        there’s one thing the people of 
                        this country hate, it’s cabbage. In 
                        fact, they’ve outlawed cabbage 
                        entirely. No cabbage allowed.

                        If you want cabbage, you have to go 
                        to another country.

           Delores considers this.

                                 DELORES
                        Huh.

                                 DECLAN
                        What?

                                 DELORES
                        Nothing. That’s an interesting fact 
                        about this country.

                                 DECLAN
                        I read it in the in-flight 
                        magazine. They also have a church 
                        made entirely of bundled hay.

           JUST THEN ——
           BANG!
           The cell’s metal door flies open.

           A uniformed officer enters.
           His furry hat is dusted with frost.
           He holds a clipboard under a beefy arm.
           This is BKOFL (45).

                                 BKOFL
                        Okay!

           He shuts the door behind him.

                                 BKOFL (CONT'D)
                        My name is Bkofl. I am customs

                        questions about your visit to our 
                        country, if I could please have 
                        your names.

                                 DELORES
                        I’m Delores. This is my husband, 
                        Declan.

                                 BKOFL
                        Delores! Declan! Let me be the 
                        first to welcome you to our 
                        country. Tell me, what is the 
                        purpose of your visit?

                                 DELORES
                        It’s our honeymoon! We got married 
                        in August!
           Delores holds up a hand.
           A diamond ring sparkles.

                                 BKOFL
                        Gilôt! Many congratulations to the 
                        newlyweds!

                                 DELORES
                        All our friends go to tropical 
                        islands, but Declan wanted an 
                        economical honeymoon off the beaten 
                        path.

           Bkofl scribbles on his clipboard.
           Then looks up with a smile.

                                 BKOFL
                        Okay! Very good. I do hope you 
                        enjoy your stay.

                                 DECLAN
                        That’s it? We’re free to go?

                                 BKOFL
                        Vlà! You may go, after you help me 
                        with just one more thing.

           Bkofl’s eyes twinkle.

                                 BKOFL (CONT'D)
                        The bureau has received reports of 
                        an American couple walking in the 
                        airport with cabbages in their 
                        pants. I wonder if maybe you know 
                        anything about this?

                                 DECLAN
                        With cabbages in their pants?

                                 BKOFL
                        This is correct, whole cabbages in 
                        their pants. You must understand, 
                        this is a crime we do not take 
                        lightly. Perhaps you have any 
                        information that might help us, any 
                        friends you might be traveling with 
                        who have cabbages in their pants?

                                 DECLAN
                        No, we don’t have friends who keep 
                        cabbages in their pants.

                                 BKOFL
                        Delores?
           Delores’ cheeks are tinged pink.
           She shakes her head.

                                 DELORES
                        Mm-mm. Nope.

                                 BKOFL
                        Okay! Very well. If you could wait 
                        here one more minute, I will talk 
                        with my associate, Shazbor, and 
                        then you may go.

                                 DECLAN
                        One more minute? But we’ve been 
                        sitting here over two hours 
                        already!

                                 BKOFL
                        My associate, Shazbor, may want to 
                        talk with you.

                                 DECLAN
                        We’ve already answered your 
                        questions! We don’t have any 
                        cabbages in our pants or know 
                        anyone who would ever do such a 
                        ridiculous thing, and that’s all 
                        there is to it!

           Bkofl smiles.
           He takes a step toward the table.
           And lowers his voice:

                                 BKOFL
                        Look. Declan and Delores. We can 
                        make this easy, or we can make this 
                        very hard. Me, I like to make 
                        things very easy. But my associate, 
                        Shazbor, he likes to make things 
                        very hard. Between me and you, 
                        Shazbor’s baba died in the war 
                        because she refused to eat any more 
                        cabbages. “Baba,” they said, “eat 
                        more cabbage or you will die.” But 
                        Shazbor’s Baba said, “then let me 
                        die, I can eat no more cabbage, it 
                        is too much cabbage.”

           Bkofl shakes his head sadly.
           A profound silence.

                                 DELORES
                        Horrible. So sad.
                                 BKOFL
                        As you can imagine, Shazbor gets 
                        very angry when he hears about 
                        cabbages. Very angry.

           Declan opens his mouth to speak. 
           But Bkofl holds up a hand.

                                 BKOFL (CONT'D)
                        Let me give you some advice. If I 
                        had cabbages in my pants, what I 
                        would do is I would sign a written 
                        confession. That way, I would not 
                        have to talk to Shazbor about 
                        cabbages.

                                 DECLAN
                        But we don’t have cabbages in our 
                        pants!

                                 BKOFL
                        If you confess, the punishment is 
                        simple. You make promises, we shake 
                        hands, you are on your way. Very 
                        simple. It is much worse to talk to 
                        Shazbor.

                                 DECLAN
                        But this is preposterous! As a 
                        matter of principle, I refuse to 
                        confess to putting cabbages in my 
                        pants!

                                 BKOFL
                        Very well! Shazbor will be happy to 
                        hear!

           Bkofl turns toward the door.

                                 DELORES
                        Mr. Bkofl?

           Bkofl turns back.

                        What happens to us if we confess?

                                 DECLAN
                        We’re not confessing to anything, 
                        Delores. We have no power if we

                        the parliament for your

           Declan paces the room.
           Mulling his options.

                        think of something.

           Declan cranes his neck.
           And clocks a barred window overhead.

           He drags a chair under it.
           Climbs onto its seat.
           Examines the grate.

                        Escape! I don’t know, Declan. That

                        idea.

                        In decision theory, the option that 
                        appears the riskiest often proves 
                        the most rational. I think I packed 
                        a travel screwdriver in my fanny 
                        pack.

           Declan unzips his fanny pack.
           Pulls out a travel screwdriver.
           He makes quick work of unscrewing the grate.

           Declan pries the grate off the window. 
           And drops it to the concrete floor.
           CLANG!

           Then, Declan pushes open the window.
           A gust of cold air floods the room.
           Outside, the sky is dreary and gray.
           The distant horizon is crowned with pines.

           Declan picks up his suitcase.
           Hurls it through the window.

           There are thirty-nine cabbages in her pants.

           With great effort, Delores climbs onto the chair.
           She shoves her suitcase over the sill.
           Then hoists herself to the window.

                        breath and count to ten. I want to 
                        get out of this country.

                        You’re the one who wanted to save 
                        money on our honeymoon. We could 
                        have gone to Bora Bora like Craig 
                        and Rhonda Feigenbaum. We could be 
                        drinking mai tais in a cabana right

                        Let’s just be quiet and run.

           They run between pines.
           Sneakers kicking up dirt.
           Suitcase wheels squeaking.

                        The people of Great Britain serve a

                        bubble and squeak made from boiled 
                        potatoes and cabbages. The people

                        make when boiled over a fire.

                                 DECLAN
                        Why are you telling me this?

                        this is turning out to be.

           Declan ducks through thick, brambly bushes.
           Delores clenches her jaw.
           Then follows Declan into the brush.

           POLICE STATION

           WE TRACK BEHIND ——
           A man in a fuzzy hat.
           He walks with purpose down an aisle.
           Then turns sharply to reveal ——

           A severe face.
           Untamed black eyebrows.
           Cruel, unfeeling eyes.
           A big, bushy mustache.

           This is SHAZBOR (38).

           Shazbor speaks in a fictive Slavic tongue.
           He is subtitled in English.
           (Throughout, this is indicated with underlining):

                                 SHAZBOR
                        Good evening, Officers of the 
                        Polizei. By now, you have heard 
                        that two American cabbage smugglers 
                        have escaped confinement and have 
                        taken shelter in the woods.

           He looks sternly around the station.

           Two dozen POLICEMEN stand at attention.
           Each wears a starchy crimson uniform.
           Each sports a thick, silken beard.

                                 SHAZBOR (CONT'D)
                        I have good news and I have bad 
                        news. The good news is Officer 
                        Bkofl has been reprimanded for his 
                        negligence and will never walk 
                        again. The bad news is the cabbage 
                        smugglers are still at large.
           Shazbor unfurls a roll of paper.
           A crude sketch of Declan and Delores.

                                 SHAZBOR (CONT'D)
                        Take a good look. These are the 
                        faces of those who disobey our 
                        nation’s laws. Like ruthless dogs, 
                        we will hunt them down. Like hungry 
                        rabbits, we will destroy their 
                        cabbages. By the time we are 
                        finished, these two cabbage 
                        smugglers will wish they never had 
                        the thought to smuggle cabbages in 
                        their pants.

           Shazbor slides a bat from his belt.
           He grins toothily at his officers.

           WOODS

           The evening sky is dark and gloomy.
           Snowflakes drift from lofty treetops.

           Declan stares at his cell phone.

                                 DECLAN
                        Dammit. No reception. 

           He replaces it in his pocket.
           Behind him, Delores trudges slowly.
           Dragging her feet through the dirt.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Hurry up, honey. It’s getting cold. 
                        The faster we make it through these 
                        woods, the better.

                        If you’re having such a miserable 
                        time on our honeymoon, why don’t we 
                        just go back to the airport and get 
                        on a plane home?

                                 DECLAN
                        We can’t go back to the airport, 
                        not now. The headquarters of the 
                        National Polizei are located a mile 
                        from the airport. If we turn around 
                        now, we would be walking right into 
                        Shazbor’s arms.

           Declan scrabbles up a small hill.
           Grasping at roots and rocks.
           Heaving his suitcase behind him.

           He hoists himself to the brow.
           Squints through the dusky gloom.
           And calls down to Delores:

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Honey! Look!

           Far away: a ramshackle cottage.
           Tucked between spindly pines.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        There are hundreds of abandoned 
                        cabins throughout this country. 
                        During the war, entire families 
                        committed mass suicide because they 
                        were tired of eating cabbage, and 
                        their properties fell into 
                        disrepair. I read about it in the 
                        in-flight magazine. Come on.

           He heads down a slope.
           Toward the abandoned cabin.

                                                             CUT TO:

           CABIN

           A dilapidated living room.
           Shrouded in shadows and cobwebs.
           The floor is littered with rat turds.
           A threadbare mattress leans against a wall.

           Declan appears at a frosty window.
           He squints into the lightless cabin.

           CRASH!
           Declan smashes the glass with a rock.
           He punches away shards.
           Reaches through the window.
           And opens the cabin’s creaking front door.

           Warily, Declan and Delores enter.
           Declan flicks a light switch.
           There is no electricity.

                                 DELORES
                        I can’t see a thing.

           Declan flicks on a travel flashlight. 
           And shines its beam over clapboard walls.
                                 DECLAN
                        It’s not a four-star hotel, but at 
                        least we won’t have to sleep in the 
                        cold.

                        stayed at the Four Seasons Resort 
                        and Spa. Rhonda said she tried to 
                        count the palm trees from their 
                        window but lost count at three 
                        hundred and twenty-six.

           Declan opens a cupboard.
           He shines his beam over tin cans.

                                 DECLAN
                        White beans and pickled herrings, 
                        Delores. The people who lived here

                        committing mass suicide. What do 
                        you want for dinner, white beans or

                                 DELORES
                        Rhonda said the restaurant at the 
                        Four Seasons Resort and Spa in Bora 
                        Bora served locally-sourced lagoon 
                        fish.

                                 DECLAN
                        I thought we agreed to an 
                        economical honeymoon. We have to 
                        save some money if we want to build 
                        that addition to our house. 
                        Besides, Bora Bora has become an 
                        overpriced and overcrowded tourist 
                        destination. We would have been 
                        miserable in Bora Bora.

           Declan peels open a can of herring.
           Gingerly, he gives it a sniff.

           THAT NIGHT

           Delores and Declan lie on the mattress.
           Declan is fast asleep.
           A rat scuttles past his foot.

           Delores is wide awake.
           She has worn her cabbage pants to bed.
           She stares through the gloom at a wall poster.
           It features a painted portrait of Shazbor.
           He wears a fuzzy hat and stern frown.
           A caption reads:

           Delores elbows Declan.
           He grunts.

                        Declan? I can’t sleep.

                                 DECLAN
                        Try thinking about all the other 
                        people in the world who can’t 
                        sleep, either. All around the world 
                        right now, people are brewing 
                        coffee and driving to work and 
                        clipping their toenails. I find 
                        that thought very comforting.

           Delores stares into the rafters.

                                 DELORES
                        Maybe I should sacrifice myself to

                        If Shazbor catches us, he’ll kill

                        myself, maybe he’d let you go home 
                        to America. Wouldn’t you like to go 
                        home to America, honey?

                                 DECLAN
                        If you sacrifice yourself to

                        your fingertips, Delores. I like

                        you’re mistaken. Shazbor will also 
                        beat you with a rusty bat and shoot 
                        you in a public demonstration.

           Delores wiggles her fingertips.
           Deciding if she needs them.

                        with myself if I had to go back to 
                        America without you.

                        Yes, you do. You’d do all the 
                        things you did before you met me, 
                        Declan. You’d go back to working at 
                        Paragon Analytics, and you’d play 
                        canasta with Gunther on the 
                        weekends, and you’d watch Jeopardy! 
                        every evening at 7:30 p.m., and 
                        you’d open all the wedding gifts we 
                        haven’t opened yet. Martina said 
                        she bought us a stainless steel 
                        mandoline slicer. I bet you’d have 
                        a lot of fun slicing cucumbers into 
                        little juliennes with that 
                        mandoline slicer.

           Declan rolls to face Delores.
           He looks intently into her eyes.

                        Tomorrow morning, we’ll fill our 
                        satchels with cans of beans and 
                        we’ll steal forks and spatulas from 
                        this cabin. We’ll leave at the

                        can through the woods.

           Delores nods.
           She takes Declan’s face in her hands.
           And kisses him.

           WOODS

           Morning sun dapples the forest.
           Declan and Delores trek between pines.
           Suitcases rolling over pebbles and twigs.

           Declan’s satchel is full of canned herring.
           His pockets are full of spatulas and forks.
           Delores’ pants are full of cabbages.

                        Honey? Can I ask your opinion on

                                 DECLAN
                        Not now. The altitude is higher 
                        here than it is back home. In 
                        higher altitudes, the body 
                        increases its respiration rate in 
                        an effort to bring in more oxygen. 
                        We need to conserve our breaths.

                        No, I don’t.
                                 DELORES
                        Let’s suppose you’re hosting a 
                        Thanksgiving dinner for all your 
                        friends and family, and all your 
                        guests have finished eating turkey 
                        and are ready to eat dessert. 
                        That’s when you stand up and say: 
                        “Excuse me, I hope everyone has 
                        saved room for dessert!” Then you 
                        go into the kitchen and you come 
                        out holding an enormous turkey. And 
                        now everyone’s confused because 
                        they’ve just eaten a lot of turkey 
                        and they couldn’t possibly eat any 
                        more. And then you say “Just 
                        kidding! It’s not a turkey. It’s a 
                        cake shaped like a turkey!” And 
                        everyone is okay with this, because 
                        who doesn’t like cake? But then you 
                        cut into the cake with a knife and 
                        to everyone’s surprise, it’s not a 
                        cake shaped like a turkey after 
                        all, it’s just a frosted turkey. 
                        Wouldn’t that be just devastating? 
                        A frosted turkey. So disappointing.

                                 DECLAN
                        Don’t move a muscle.

           Declan’s face has gone white.
           He holds up a hand.

           Beneath a pile of leaves, something gleams.
           Declan squats low.
           And brushes aside dirt to reveal ——

           A BEAR TRAP.
           Its steel jaws are open wide.
           Its teeth are jagged and sharp.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        It’s a trap. During the war, the 
                        military placed all kinds of traps 
                        around the forests to dissuade 
                        enemy combatants from invading.

           Declan picks up a stick.
           And prods the bear trap.

           SPROINNNG!
           The trap SPRINGS off the ground. 
           Its jaws CLAMP around the stick.
                                 DELORES
                        Goodness, Declan!

                                 DECLAN
                        There are three types of traps: a 
                        leg-hold trap catches the target by 
                        its limb, ensuring the animal’s 
                        pelt remains unspoiled. A Conibear 
                        trap slams shut on the animal’s 
                        body. A snare trap tightens as the 
                        target tries to free itself, 
                        resulting in restraint or death by 
                        slow strangulation.

                        I didn’t know you knew so much 
                        about traps.

                                 DECLAN
                        Sometimes after you go to bed at 
                        night, I read books about the North 
                        American fur trade. Come along. We 
                        must keep our eyes open and remain 
                        vigilant.

           Declan takes Delores’ hand.
           And helps her over the trap.

           Shazbor’s officers march through the woods.
           Red jackets peeking through evening fog.
           Torches glowing through the gloom.

           Shazbor tramps up the brow of a hill.
           And frowns when he reaches the top.

           He whips little binoculars from his coat.
           Holds them to his nose.
           And gazes upon THE ABANDONED CABIN.

           CABIN

           Shazbor’s men have spread through the cabin.
           Upending chairs.
           Jabbing bayonets into sofa cushions. 
           Flinging open cupboards and drawers.

           Shazbor stands amidst the bustle.
           Stroking his furry mustache.
           An OFFICER approaches timidly.

                                 OFFICER
                        Shazbor? We must continue. It is 
                        clear no one has been here for a 
                        long time.

           But Shazbor’s eyes narrow.
           His nostrils flare.

           Slowly, he lowers himself to a knee.
           Pulls a latex glove from his pocket.
           And snaps it deliberately over his hand.

           Then, Shazbor reaches between floorboards.
           And extracts a tiny green leaf.
           Its edges are scalloped.
           Its surface is veined.

                                 SHAZBOR
                        If that is so, how do you explain 
                        this?

           Shazbor holds the leaf to his nose.
           He grimaces at the smell.

           Then peers through the broken window.
           Into the dense, endless woods.

           Declan and Delores traipse through the woods.
           Ducking under low branches.

           Declan climbs the cottage’s porch steps.
           He stoops to pick up a heavy rock.
           And raises it to a window when ——

           THE FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN.
           AND A WOMAN BURSTS FROM THE COTTAGE.
           AN IZHMASH MBO-3 RIFLE IN HER HANDS.

           Her cheeks are ruddy and plump.
           Her hands are as big as hamhocks.
           This is JELENKA (42).
                                 JELENKA
                        WHO ARE YOU?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN 
                        MY YARD?!

           She waves her rifle at Declan and Delores.
           Staring suspiciously down its barrel.

           Declan and Delores raise their hands.

                                 DELORES
                        Please! Don’t shoot!

                                 DECLAN
                        We are hikers! We’re from America! 
                        We got lost in the woods! We speak 
                        English!

                                 DELORES
                        We thought your house was an 
                        abandoned cabin!

           CLICK-CLACK!
           Jelenka pumps the rifle. 
           Finger poised over its trigger.

                                 JELENKA
                        You are smuggler?

                                 DECLAN
                        No! Not smuggler!

                                 JELENKA
                        You smuggle cabbage?

                                 DECLAN
                        No! No cabbage!

                                 JELENKA
                        On news, they tell of dangerous 
                        criminals in woods who smuggle 
                        cabbage at night. This is you? 

                                 DELORES
                        Don’t be outrageous! Do we look 
                        like smugglers to you?

           Jelenka looks Declan and Delores over.
           She clocks Delores’ massive, bulky pants.

                                 JELENKA
                        What is in your pants?

                                 DELORES
                        Excuse me?
                                 JELENKA
                        Your pants are big and have lumps.

                                 DECLAN
                        My wife suffers from tumors that 
                        grow upon her legs. It’s a terrible 
                        ailment and it is rude to comment 
                        upon them. 

           Slowly, Jelenka lowers her rifle.
           Her eyes dart nervously around the yard.

                                 JELENKA
                        If you are not smuggler, you must 
                        not be out in woods so late.

           Jelenka steps into her house.
           Motioning for Declan and Delores to follow.

                                 JELENKA (CONT'D)
                        Quick. Inside now. Come. We are 
                        having chicken soup and chipped 
                        beef.

           Declan and Delores share a look.
           Then follow Jelenka into her house.
           Jelenka shuts the door behind them.

                                                             CUT TO:

           KITCHEN

           A cramped and cozy kitchen.
           Shelves laden with cookbooks and tchotchkes.
           The air is damp with steam.

           Jelenka stirs chicken soup at a stove.
           Declan and Delores sit at a wooden table.
           YAROSLAV (44) and TÍMOTEJ (8) sit opposite.

                                 DECLAN
                        Thank you for inviting us for 
                        dinner with your family, Jelenka.

                                 DELORES
                        You have a beautiful little boy.

           Jelenka pats Tímotej on the head.

           But Tímotej is not a beautiful little boy.
           His skin is pale and gray.
           He has no eyebrows.
           He stares at Delores.
                                 YAROSLAV
                        Outside, the woods are dangerous. 
                        Each night, smugglers come through 
                        woods with cabbages. They are men 
                        without morals. Men without souls.

                                 DECLAN
                        On the airplane, I read that the 
                        citizens here harbor an intense 
                        hatred for the taste of cabbage. 
                        Why would it be profitable for 
                        anyone to smuggle cabbages into 
                        this country?

                                 YAROSLAV
                        Vlà, it is true: those who lived 
                        through war hate the cabbage very 
                        much. But now, those men grow old, 
                        and their children buy cabbage on 
                        the black market.

                                 JELENKA
                        Young people, they do not remember 
                        the war. They do not know the 
                        memories awakened by the smell of 
                        cabbage. They do not respect the 
                        history of our nation.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        This is why we teach Tímotej his 
                        history. Tímotej is a good boy who 
                        hate the cabbage.

                                 JELENKA
                        Tímotej hate the cabbage even more 
                        than his dada, nó?

           She pinches Tímotej’s cheek.

           Tímotej does not speak.
           He keeps staring at Delores.
           Delores shifts in her chair.

                                 JELENKA (CONT'D)
                        Okay! Dinner is ready!

           Jelenka carries a plate of beef to the table.
           She ladles broth into bowls.
           Then takes a seat.

                                 JELENKA (CONT'D)
                        Now, let us pray.

           They all hold hands.
           They all shut their eyes.

                                 JELENKA (CONT'D)
                        Father in heaven, bless our daily 
                        soup and our gorgeous son, Tímotej. 
                        Help the polizei find the men who 
                        smuggle cabbage on news, and may 
                        their fingertips be cut from their 
                        fingers and may they be beaten 
                        until their hair is wet with blood.

                         DECLAN
                                                       DELORES
           Amen.
                                            Amen.

                                 JELENKA
                        Let us eat.

           Delores opens her eyes.
           Tímotej is still staring at her.

           Yaroslav spears himself a slice of beef.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        Declan and Delores, please. Tell us 
                        something about your lives.

                                 DECLAN
                        Very well. I work as an assistant 
                        analytics manager, and Delores 
                        sells custom knitwear on the 
                        internet.
                                 DELORES
                        We just got married in August. 
                        We’re on our honeymoon! And what a 
                        marvelous honeymoon it has been so 
                        far.

                                 DECLAN
                        Very relaxing.

           Tímotej stares at Delores.
           Delores takes a sip of soup.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        It is good to be happy. I remember 
                        many years ago when me and Jelenka 
                        were happy couple. You remember 
                        this, Jelenka?

                                 JELENKA
                        Vlà, vlà.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        But it is not so anymore. In our 
                        country, we have a saying: daylight 
                        is brief and soon comes the endless 
                        shadow. This saying means that when 
                        a marriage begins, everything is 
                        possible. But soon, a man must buy 
                        house for his wife or he is not a 
                        good man, vlà? And soon a woman 
                        must birth child or she is not a 
                        good woman, vlà? And soon a father 
                        must go to lumberyard each day 
                        sawing logs or he is not good 
                        father, vlà?

                                 JELENKA
                        Vlà, vlà.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        And one day, a man and a woman wake 
                        up and they see their hair is gray 
                        and their middles are fat and their 
                        forest is full of smugglers and all 
                        night long they cannot sleep, 
                        bathed in shadow.

           Yaroslav and Jelenka shake their heads.
           They gaze into the middle distance.

                                 DELORES
                        What a beautiful saying.

           A long and silent beat.
           Declan clears his throat.

                                 DECLAN
                        Tímotej, do you like trains? When I 
                        was your age, I liked trains.

           But Tímotej does not answer.
           He saws his beef with a serrated knife.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        Tímotej, did you hear? The American 
                        has asked you a question. What do 
                        you say, Tímotej? Do you like 
                        trains?

                                 JELENKA
                        Choo-choo, Tímotej. What do you 
                        say? 

           But Tímotej only chews his meat.

                                 JELENKA (CONT'D)
                        We are sorry. Tímotej is a quiet 
                        boy. Tímotej does not speak unless 
                        he has something he wants to say.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        Come, Tímotej. Do not be unkind. 
                        Say something to our new American 
                        friends.

           At last, Tímotej looks up sharply.
           He fixes his clear eyes on Delores.
           As if he’s looking into her soul.

                                 TÍMOTEJ
                        Cabbages.

           His voice is quiet and sinister.

                                 DELORES
                        What did he say?

                                 YAROSLAV
                        He say cabbages.

                                 TÍMOTEJ
                        Cabbages.

                                 JELENKA
                        Cabbages? Why do you say cabbages, 
                        Tímotej?
                                 DECLAN
                        What are they saying, Delores?

                                 TÍMOTEJ
                        I smell cabbages.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        The boy says he smells cabbages.

           Delores and Declan squirm.
           Tímotej clutches his knife in a fist.
           Declan and Delores gulp.

           At last, Jelenka laughs.

                                 JELENKA
                        You must understand. In school, 
                        they teach Tímotej of the war. All 
                        day long, Tímotej learns of his 
                        ancestors who had only cabbage to 
                        eat. Now, thoughts of cabbage is 
                        all that fills Tímotej’s head. 
                        Tímotej believe he smell cabbage 
                        everywhere. Sometimes in middle of 
                        night, we are awakened by his 
                        screams: “Cabbages! Cabbages!”

                                 YAROSLAV
                        “Cabbages! Cabbages!”

                                 JELENKA
                        Pay Tímotej no mind. Who would like 
                        more beef?

           But Tímotej lifts a tiny finger.
           And aims it at Delores.

                        Tímotej! Do not say such things.

                                 TÍMOTEJ
                        She has cabbages in her pants!

                                 YAROSLAV
                        Now you have taken things too far!

                                 JELENKA
                        This is grave insult! This poor

                                 DECLAN
                        Delores? What’s happening?

                                 TÍMOTEJ
                        But Mamà!

           Yaroslav lifts a palm.
           And WHACKS Tímotej in the back of the head. 
           Tímotej erupts into tears.

                                 DELORES
                        Oh, dear. Oh, no. Don’t do that. 

                                 DECLAN
                        He didn’t do anything wrong. He has 
                        an active imagination.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        Think about what you have said!

           Jelenka points to the door.
           Bawling, Tímotej slides off his stool.
           And sprints out of the room.

                                 JELENKA
                        We are sorry. We do not know what 
                        get into Tìmotej. The boy gets such 
                        wild ideas. How crazy to think he 
                        smell cabbages in this house.

                                 YAROSLAV
                        Unless, of course, you have

                                 DECLAN
                        Us? No! No cabbages in these pants!

                        What even is cabbage?

           Everyone laughs.
           Declan is sweating profusely.
                                 DECLAN
                        Well, this has been a delicious 
                        dinner, but I think it’s time we 
                        say goodbye to our new friends and 
                        head out for a hike. How does a 
                        hike sound, Delores?

                                 DELORES
                        I’m not done with my soup.

                                 DECLAN
                        Well, finish your soup quickly, 
                        Delores! We’re going on a hike!

                                 YAROSLAV
                        You cannot hike now. It is night. 
                        Night is when the smugglers come.

                                 DECLAN
                        Thank you both for the wonderful 
                        meal and marital advice. It was so 
                        nice to meet you and your whimsical 
                        child, but if my wife does not 
                        hike, the tumors on her legs grow 
                        larger.

                                 JELENKA
                        Please, no. We beg of you. You must 
                        stay the night. It is too dangerous 
                        to go out into the woods. You do 
                        not want to risk crossing paths 
                        with a dangerous cabbage smuggler, 
                        do you?

           Declan and Delores shake their heads.

                                 JELENKA (CONT'D)
                        Good. You will sleep in room next 
                        to Tímotej.

                                                            SMASH TO:

           GUEST ROOM

           A sparsely decorated room.
           A crucifix hangs above a chest of drawers.
           Framed embroidery on the wall reads:

                                   DAYLIGHT IS BRIEF
                                     AND SOON COMES
                                  THE ENDLESS SHADOW.

           Delores and Declan sit on a pine bed.
           Their Samsonite suitcases at their feet.
           They whisper:

                                 DECLAN
                        He’s onto us. 

                                 DELORES
                        Who’s onto us?

                                 DECLAN
                        Tímotej is onto us. He is a 
                        ferociously perceptive child. We 
                        must get out of here. It is a bad 
                        idea to linger too long in a house 
                        with someone who is convinced you 
                        have cabbages in your pants, 
                        especially in a country that hates 
                        cabbages.

           He crosses to a window.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        I have a plan. We will climb out 
                        this window and run as fast as we 
                        can. When we’re back in the forest 
                        and far from this house, we’ll bury 
                        ourselves in a pile of leaves and 
                        fall asleep.

                                 DELORES
                        That sounds like a dangerous plan. 
                        Jelenka and Yaroslav said there are 
                        cabbage smugglers in the woods.

                                 DECLAN
                        There aren’t any cabbage smugglers 
                        in the woods. You are the cabbage 
                        smuggler, Delores. You have 
                        cabbages in your pants.

                                 DELORES
                        I have cabbages in my pants? Oh, 
                        please, Declan. As if! Rich. That’s 
                        just rich.

           Declan pries open the window.
           He peers down from the house’s second floor.
           Outside, wind whips through the trees.

                                 DECLAN
                        It’s too far to jump. We’ll need to 
                        fashion a rope out of curtains.

           Declan yanks curtains off a rod.
           And starts tying them hastily together.
                                 DELORES
                        Honey? What do you think of the 
                        name Tímotej?

                                 DECLAN
                        I don’t like it. Help me, Delores.

           Delores helps tie knots in the curtain. 

                                 DELORES
                        One day, if we have a little boy, I 
                        think I’d like to name him Tímotej.

                                 DECLAN
                        Why would we name our little boy 
                        Tímotej? 

                                 DELORES
                        Everyone names their boys Noah or 
                        William or Owen or James. Very few 
                        little boys are named Tímotej.

                                 DECLAN
                        There’s a good reason for that. I 
                        read in Business Insider that 
                        employees with easier-to-pronounce 
                        names are far more likely to occupy 
                        higher-status positions in the 
                        workplace. Besides, I thought we 
                        were naming our child Declan Jr.

           Declan knots the curtains to a bedpost.
           He lowers the makeshift rope out the window.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go.

                                                             CUT TO:

           OUTSIDE

           A second-story window creaks open.
           Declan pops his head outside.

           He looks around.
           The coast is clear.

           Declan pitches two suitcases out the window.
           Then climbs over the sill.
           He rappels down the wall.
           Gripping the rope with tight fists.
           Until his sneakers touch the ground.

           Delores appears at the window. 
           She climbs over the sill.
           Squeezes her bulky rear through the window. 
           And lowers herself down the rope.

                                                             CUT TO:

           WOODS

           Declan and Delores dash through the night.
           Down a winding, wooded trail.
           Sneakers splashing in shallow mud.

           Declan looks behind him.
           The woods are still and silent.

           JUST THEN ——
           Declan steps on a twig and ——
           FWIP!
           A THICK ROPE WRAPS HIS ANKLE and ——
           ZIPPPP!
           A WEBBED NET FALLS FROM THE TREETOPS.
           ENSNARING DECLAN.
           YANKING HIM HIGH INTO THE AIR.

                                 DECLAN
                        AUUUGH!

           THE NEXT SECOND ——
           FWIP!
           Delores steps on a twig and —— 
           ZIPPPP!
           A WEBBED NET FALLS FROM THE TREETOPS.
           ENSNARING DELORES.
           YANKING HER HIGH INTO THE AIR.

                                 DELORES
                        AUUUGH!

           Declan and Delores flail.
           Trapped in the nets.
           Suspended upside-down.
           Six feet off the ground.
           Bodies contorted into pretzels.
           Arms pinned to their sides.

                        Help! I can’t move! Where are we?

                        Stay calm! We have to stay calm!

                                 DELORES
                        I can’t feel my feet!
                                 DECLAN
                        We’re stuck in a Malaysian Rubber 
                        Tree Net Trap. These traps were set 
                        by the military during the war. The 
                        parliament here has a long history 
                        of positive international relations 
                        with the Malaysians, and over many 
                        years these people learned from the 
                        indigenous tribes of Sarawak how to 
                        construct effective net traps. 
                        Struggling only makes things worse.

                                 DELORES
                        I feel my head filling up with 
                        blood. What are we going to do?

                                 DECLAN
                        I don’t know, Delores. If Shazbor 
                        finds us stuck in these traps, 
                        we’ll be sitting ducks.

           Declan and Delores writhe.
           Flailing against the trap’s ropes.
           Grunting and groaning.

           JUST THEN ——
           A sound in the underbrush.
           The crunch of dry leaves.
           The rustle of bushes.

                                 DELORES
                        What was that?

                                 DECLAN
                        Shh. Someone’s coming.

                                 DELORES
                        Is it Shazbor?

           Declan and Delores freeze.
           Breaths held tight.
           Ears perked.
           Listening to approaching footsteps.

                                 DECLAN
                        Delores? If this is the last time 
                        we get to talk before we’re thrown 
                        in a gulag, I want you to know 
                        something. I want you to know I 
                        love you very much. I want you to 
                        know I’m happy I married you.
                                 DELORES
                        Oh, Declan. That’s such a sweet 
                        thing to say.

                                 DECLAN
                        Are you happy you married me?

           JUST THEN —— 
           SNAP!
           The footsteps are near.
           Declan and Delores hold their breaths.
           They stare with wide eyes as ——
           The bushes part and ——

           A FIGURE emerges from the woods.
           Moonlight falls upon a small, wan face.
           Two gray eyes twinkle in the dark.

           This isn’t Shazbor.
           This is ——

                        Tímotej?

           Tímotej glares up at Declan and Delores.
           He wears flannel pajamas.
           He holds his STEAK KNIFE in his tiny hand.

                                 DECLAN
                        Dear God, he has a knife.

                                 DELORES
                        Hello there, Tímotej. I like your 
                        pajamas.

           Tímotej takes a step forward.
           Moonlight glints off his knife.

                                 DECLAN
                        Tímotej. Please. Listen. Just put 
                        the knife down and no one will get 
                        hurt.

                                 DELORES
                        Please, Tímotej. Please don’t hurt 
                        us. Not while we’re on our 
                        honeymoon.

           Slowly, Tímotej kneels in the dirt.
           He grips a wire that supports the traps.
           And saws through it with his knife.

           TWIINNG!
           The wire SNAPS ——
           Rope uncoils ——
           The traps loosen and ——

           FWUMP!
           DECLAN AND DELORES FALL FROM THE NETS.
           LANDING IN A TANGLE OF ROPE.
           GRUNTING AS THEY SPLAT IN MUD.

           Finally, they look up at Tímotej.
           The boy stands over them majestically.

                                 DELORES (CONT'D)
                        Tímotej. You —— you saved us.

           Tímotej doesn’t blink.
           He hasn’t blinked since we’ve met him.

                                 TÍMOTEJ
                        If our country does not learn 
                        compassion, we will soon be no 
                        better than those who once 
                        oppressed us. They say we must 
                        learn to live in shadow, but there 
                        is never a shadow without a light.

           With that, Tímotej turns on his heel.
           And runs back toward his house.
           Ducking through brambles.
           Until he’s swallowed by woods.

           Declan and Delores gaze after him.

                                 DELORES
                        What do you think he said?

           MORNING

           Dawn’s light sifts through the canopy.  
           Declan and Delores lie half-buried in leaves.

           Delores rubs her sleepy eyes and sits up.

           She checks to make sure Declan is asleep.
           Then presses two fingertips together.
           And whispers in a tiny voice.
           Pretending her fingers are worms:

                                 DELORES
                        Good morning, beautiful. I was 
                        thinking today maybe we could go 
                        for a hike inside an apple!

           Declan stirs.
           Delores stops pretending her fingers are worms.
           She rolls over and spoons Declan.

                                                             CUT TO:

           AFTERNOON

           Declan and Delores hike through woods.

           The trees and air have begun to thin.
           The forest is lively with birdsongs.
           Sunbeams pierce the leafy canopy.

           Declan uses a branch as a walking stick.
           Jabbing it into soft dirt.

                                                             CUT TO:

           ELSEWHERE

           Shazbor’s officers huddle in the woods.
           Frowning at the spent Malaysian net trap.

           Shazbor takes a knee in the dirt.
           And picks up a handful of rope.

                                 SHAZBOR
                        As you can see, we are dealing with 
                        exceptional smugglers. There are 
                        not many smugglers in the world 
                        capable of cutting themselves free 
                        of a Malaysian Rubber Tree Net 
                        Trap.

           He stands tall to face his officers.
                                 SHAZBOR (CONT'D)
                        But it will not be long before they 
                        stumble upon a West Burmese Neck- 
                        Snapping Trap. Not even the most 
                        talented smugglers can break free 
                        of a West Burmese Neck-Snapping 
                        Trap.

           Shazbor laughs at the thought.
           On cue, his officers laugh, too.
           Slapping their knees.
           Wiping their eyes.
           As their chuckles rise into the tall pines ——

                                                             CUT TO:

           CLEARING

           A chilly evening.
           A fire smolders in a firepit.
           Above, a twinkling expanse of stars.

           Declan and Delores sit on their suitcases.
           Shivering in the cold.

           Delores has drawn a grid in the dirt.
           They’re playing tic-tac-toe with a stick.
           Delores marks a box with an X.

                                 DELORES
                        Three in a row, tic-tac-toe!

                                 DECLAN
                        Dammit!

                                 DELORES
                        That’s twenty-four wins for me and 
                        two draws. You know something, 
                        honey? This may not be how we 
                        imagined our honeymoon would go, 
                        but we’re having fun, aren’t we?

           She etches a tally into a rock.
           Declan sighs.

                                 DECLAN
                        I’m not having any fun at all. I’m 
                        not good at this game and I’m on 
                        the run from the law.

                                 DELORES
                        No one likes a sore loser, honey. 
                        Besides, who cares if you’re no 
                        good at this game?

                        You’re good at so many other 
                        things, like unclogging the sink 
                        and emergency preparedness and 
                        accepting compliments.  

                                 DECLAN
                        That’s kind of you.

                                 DELORES
                        See? And you’re good at directions. 
                        You always know exactly which way 
                        we’re walking. Sometimes I wish you 
                        were born in 1683. You would have 
                        made a very good pirate on the high 
                        seas if you were born in 1683. Your 
                        life would have been very exciting.

           Delores draws a fresh grid in the dirt.
           She marks a square with an X. 

                                 DECLAN
                        I think my life is exciting just 
                        the way it is. Did I tell you that 
                        last week, Mr. Yang said I’ve been 
                        doing an excellent job? He said 
                        he’s thinking about promoting me to 
                        senior analytics manager. That’s 
                        exciting, isn’t it?

                                 DELORES
                        It’s your turn, Declan.

                                 DECLAN
                        Mr. Yang said I’d be responsible 
                        for conducting analysis and 
                        providing actionable insights to 
                        support achievement of brand 
                        objectives. It would come with a 
                        very good raise and better 
                        benefits, too.

           Declan marks a square with an O.

           JUST THEN ——
           A footfall sounds in the woods.
           Declan sits up straight.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Listen, Delores.

                                 DELORES
                        I am listening.
                                 DECLAN
                        Listen harder. Do you hear that?

           They listen.
           The CRUNCH of leaves.
           The SNAP of twigs.

           Declan and Delores stand slowly.
           Wide eyes gleaming in moonlight.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        It’s Shazbor. This time, I’m sure 
                        of it.

           Slowly, Declan reaches into his satchel.
           He pulls out a fork.
           He clutches it in a tight fist as —— 

           THE FOOTSTEPS GROW NEARER.
           THE BRAMBLES PART.
           AND SOMETHING STEPS INTO THE CLEARING.

           IT’S ABSOLUTELY COLOSSAL.
           IT TOWERS ON TWO HIND LEGS.
           IT HAS TWO EARS.
           KNIFELIKE TEETH.
           A SHINY BLACK NOSE.
           IT’S A KAMCHATKA BROWN BEAR.

           Delores and Declan SCREAM.
           The bear ROARS.

                                 DELORES
                        Fork him, Declan!

           Declan raises his fork.
           He grits his teeth.
           And RUNS AT THE BEAR.

                                 DECLAN
                        RAAAAAAH!

           Declan stabs the bear in the shoulder.

                                 BEAR
                        OW! WHAT THE HELL, MATE!

           The bear has an Australian accent.
           Declan freezes, dumbfounded.

           The bear staggers about the clearing.
           Yowling in pain.
           It drops to its knees.
                                 BEAR (CONT'D)
                        BLOODY HELL!

           The bear pries the fork from its shoulder.
           Then grabs hold of its enormous head.
           AND YANKS IT OFF ITS SHOULDERS.

           This, we see now, is not a bear.
           This is a man in a bear suit.
           His sweaty hair is plastered to his forehead.
           His face is contorted in pain.
           This is NORMAN (50).

                                 BEAR/NORMAN
                        Wanker! You stabbed me with a fork!

                                                             CUT TO:

           LATER

           Declan, Delores and Norman sit around the fire.
           They eat steaming bowls of beans.

           Norman still wears his gutted bearskin.
           Its severed head sits at his feet.

           In the moonlight, we see Norman is handsome.
           Stubble flecks a masculine jaw. 
           His voice is gruff and gravelly.

                                 DECLAN
                        I’m sorry I stabbed you with a 
                        fork.

                                 NORMAN
                        I forgive you. I know you only did 
                        it because you mistook me for a 
                        bear.

                                 DECLAN
                        Which reminds me, Norman, I don’t 
                        believe you’ve told us why it is 
                        you’re dressed in the skin of a 
                        bear?

           Norman looks between Declan and Delores.
           Then lowers his voice.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’ll tell you, but you have to 
                        promise me you aren’t polizei. You 
                        aren’t polizei, are you?
                                 DECLAN
                        We’re not polizei.

                                 DELORES
                        Cross my heart and hope to die 
                        we’re not polizei.

                                 NORMAN
                        I knew you weren’t polizei. I was 
                        just testing you.

           Norman reaches for a zipper at his throat.
           And unzips the bear suit to his navel.
           Out tumble FIVE RIPE RED CABBAGES.

                                 DELORES
                        Cabbages!

                                 DECLAN
                        You’re a cabbage smuggler?

                                 NORMAN
                        That’s right. Red. Napa. Savoy. 
                        Cannonball. If it’s in the crucifer 
                        family, I’ll smuggle it. The black 
                        market in this country is strong. 
                        You wouldn’t believe how much the 
                        kids here are willing to pay for a 
                        ripe head of premium January King. 
                        Only trouble is, the polizei are 
                        onto me.

           Norman pulls off his bear paws.
           He holds up his hands.
           He only has two knuckles on each finger.

           Declan gasps with horror.
           Delores gasps with amazement.

                                 NORMAN (CONT'D)
                        Couple months ago, I’m entering the 
                        country with eight dry gallons of 
                        choy sum when this bloke Shazbor 
                        stops me at the border. Next thing 
                        I know, I’m locked in a gulag and 
                        Shazbor is cutting off my 
                        fingertips one by one with a paring 
                        knife. I manage to escape on a 
                        donkey cart and run into the woods, 
                        only to find myself face-to-face 
                        with a Kamchatka brown bear. Of 
                        course, I have no choice but to 
                        kill the thing with a sharp log.

                                 NORMAN (CONT'D)
                        And that’s when I get the idea to 
                        start wearing the bear as a suit. 
                        The Kamchatka brown bear is a 
                        national symbol here. I reckon if 
                        Shazbor comes looking for me, he’ll 
                        mistake me for a Kamchatka brown 
                        bear and leave me be. And that is 
                        why I’m dressed as a bear. 

                                 DELORES
                        Goodness, Norman. How clever. I 
                        wish I had a bear suit to wear, 
                        too.

                                 DECLAN
                        Don’t even think about it, Delores.

           Delores smiles at Norman.
           She’s a little smitten.

                                 NORMAN
                        Anyway, enough about me and why I’m 
                        dressed as a bear. Why don’t you 
                        tell me about yourselves. How long 
                        have you two been smuggling 
                        cabbages?

                                 DELORES
                        Us? Oh, no. We are hikers with 
                        tumors. We don’t smuggle cabbages.

                                 DECLAN
                        That’s right. No cabbages here.

                                 NORMAN
                        Come now. I know a fellow cabbage 
                        smuggler when I see one.

                        A man doesn’t spend five years 
                        smuggling cabbages across foreign 
                        borders without developing the 
                        ability to identify how many 
                        cabbages someone’s smuggling in her 
                        pants. If I’m not mistaken, I’d say 
                        the pretty missus here has exactly 
                        thirty-nine heads of illegal 
                        contraband in her dungarees. I know 
                        a thing or two about what’s inside 
                        a woman’s dungarees. 

           Norman winks at Delores.
           Delores blushes.

                                 DECLAN
                        Well, Norman, it was such a 
                        pleasure to meet you, but dinner 
                        has ended and it’s time we part 
                        ways.

                                 DELORES
                        But we haven’t finished talking to 
                        Norman.

                                 DECLAN
                        Yes we have, Delores. Don’t worry 
                        about cleaning your spoon, Norman, 
                        I’ll clean it later.

                                 NORMAN
                        Listen, you two. Thirty-nine 
                        cabbages is a heck of a lot of 
                        cabbages to be smuggling through 
                        these woods. If Shazbor catches you 
                        with thirty-nine cabbages in your 
                        pants, God help you. I reckon your 
                        best bet is to travel with me. I 
                        know these woods like the back of 
                        my hand.

           He holds up a mutilated hand.

                                 NORMAN (CONT'D)
                        There’s a campground a few miles 
                        northeast where we can sleep 
                        tomorrow night. Five miles west, 
                        you’ll find a train station. You 
                        can get on a train there and escape 
                        across the border. I keep a map in 
                        my bear suit. I can help you. I can 
                        show you the way.

           He looks earnestly at Declan and Delores.
                                 NORMAN (CONT'D)
                        Stick with me. You can trust me.

                                                            SMASH TO:

           LATER

           Declan and Delores stare into glittering stars.

                                 DECLAN
                        We can’t trust him.

           They lie awake beside the smoldering fire. 
           Nearby, Norman sleeps in his bear suit.
           He uses the bear’s severed head as a pillow.

                                 DELORES
                        Why not? I like Norman. He seems 
                        creative and trustworthy.

                                 DECLAN
                        If there’s one thing Norman does 
                        not seem, it’s trustworthy. He’s an 
                        international smuggler. 
                        International smugglers are not 
                        trustworthy.

                                 DELORES
                        And how many untrustworthy 
                        international smugglers do you 
                        know?

                                 DECLAN
                        Just one, Delores, and he’s 
                        sleeping over there in a suit made 
                        out of a bear.

                                 DELORES
                        Open your mind and heart, Declan. 
                        You never know what positive things 
                        will happen when you choose to 
                        travel with an attractive man in a 
                        bear suit.

                                 DECLAN
                        Now listen to me, Delores. We are 
                        not traveling with Norman, and he’s 
                        not especially attractive. Now, I 
                        have an idea. In the middle of the 
                        night, we’ll steal Norman’s map and 
                        run as fast as we can to that train 
                        station, and we’ll get on a train 
                        and get the hell out of here by 
                        morning.
                                 DELORES
                        Declan, have you ever noticed all 
                        your plans involve jumping out 
                        windows and stealing maps from 
                        bears? Sometimes it feels like 
                        you’re running from something.

                                 DECLAN
                        That’s right, Delores, I’m running 
                        from a man with a rusty bat.

           Delores gazes into the twinkling galaxy.

                                 DELORES

                        let me make some plans sometimes, 
                        too.

                                                            SMASH TO:

           WOODS

           Declan, Delores, and Norman hike along a pass.
           The ground is rocky and steep.
           Distant mountains reach for a misty sky.

           Declan is carrying both suitcases.
           Behind him, Delores and Norman are giggling.
           Their chemistry is undeniable.

                                 DELORES
                        Do another one, Norman!

           Norman cups his hands around his mouth.
           And unleashes a booming BEAR ROAR.
           It echoes through a cool, crisp morning.

           Delores claps her hands.

                                 DELORES (CONT'D)
                        Incredible! One more!

           Norman ROARS AGAIN.

                                 DELORES (CONT'D)
                        Wow, Norman! How on Earth did you 
                        learn to make such accurate bear 
                        sounds with your mouth?
                                 NORMAN
                        One time while smuggling weapons 
                        over the Zarafshans, I had to hide 
                        from the Tajik mountain police in a 
                        cave with a family of Eurasians. I 
                        learned to communicate by imitating 
                        their howls. It’s easier than it 
                        looks. Just cup your hands over 
                        your mouth and pretend your cubs 
                        are endangered. Go on. Try it.

           Delores cups her hands around her mouth.
           She ROARS.

                                 NORMAN (CONT'D)
                        Amazing, Delores. You’re telling me 
                        you’ve never done a bear roar 
                        before?

                                 DELORES
                        Never ever. How was that?

                                 NORMAN
                        You’re a natural. If I didn’t know 
                        better, I’d have guessed you’ve 
                        been roaring your whole life.

           Delores ROARS again.

           Ahead, Declan spins around.
           Brow knit with irritation.

                                 DECLAN
                        Hey! Keep it down back there! If 
                        you two keep howling like bears, 
                        Shazbor will hear us.

                                 NORMAN
                        Relax, mate. If Shazbor hears us, 
                        he’ll think we’re bears. Don’t 
                        stress, mate. I think you need to 
                        chill out.

                                 DELORES
                        Yeah! Chill out, Declan.

           Delores and Norman giggle.
           Declan glowers.

           Then, he braces his core.
           Clenches his fists.
           And ROARS AS LOUDLY AS HE CAN.

           His roar echoes off the mountains.
           It’s all very intense and a little weird.
           His face is crimson.

           Declan turns on his heel.
           And marches on ahead.

                                                             CUT TO:

           POND

           A deep, emerald pond in the mountains.
           Fringed with tall grasses.
           A waterfall cascades from tall boulders.

           Declan wheels the suitcases along the bank.
           Forks and spatulas rattle in his pockets.

           Behind him, Norman and Delores walk together.

                                                             CUT TO:

           CAMPGROUND

           A campground in the basin of mountains.
           A few crude cabins around a firepit.
           From behind tall weeds, the waterfall hisses.

           Declan, Delores and Norman sit on logs.
           They eat steaming bowls of beans.

                                 DELORES
                        Norman? Can I ask you a personal 
                        question?

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m an open book.

                                 DELORES
                        In your opinion, what would you say 
                        is the most disappointing dessert 
                        in the world?

           Norman scratches his stubbled chin.

                                 NORMAN
                        That’s a good question. I reckon if 
                        I had to choose just one 
                        disappointing dessert, I’d have to 
                        go with a frosted turkey.

                                 DELORES
                        You would?!
                                 NORMAN
                        Just a big turkey slathered in 
                        chocolate frosting. I reckon that’d 
                        be right disappointing, don’t you? 
                        Cutting into a cake shaped like a 
                        turkey only to find out it’s just a 
                        frosted turkey after all?

           Delores beams.

                        You’ll never believe this, Norman, 
                        but that’s my answer, too!

                                 NORMAN
                        I don’t believe it! 

                                 DELORES
                        I was just telling Declan the other 
                        day just how disappointing it would 
                        be to cut into a cake shaped like a 
                        turkey only to find out it’s just a 
                        frosted turkey. Tell him, Declan!

                                 DECLAN
                        It’s true. Delores thinks the most 
                        disappointing dessert is a frosted 
                        turkey.

                                 NORMAN
                        I reckon great minds really do 
                        think alike, don’t they?

           He winks at Delores.
           Delores winks at Norman.
           Declan stands from the bench.

                                 DECLAN
                        Well, I think Delores and I are 
                        going to hit the hay. Good night, 
                        Norman. Come on, Delores. It’s time 
                        for bed.

           But Delores shakes her head.

                                 DELORES
                        Go ahead, Declan. I’m going to stay 
                        up a little longer with Norman.

           She shrugs at Declan.
           Declan grits his teeth.

                                                             CUT TO:
           SIMPLE CABIN

           Declan lies on a stiff mattress.
           Wide awake.
           Outside, Delores and Norman are laughing.

           Declan rolls over.
           And pulls a pillow over his head.

           MORNING

           Delores and Declan sit by the firepit.
           Declan studies Norman’s crinkled map.
           Tracing a route with his finger.

                                 DECLAN
                        If my calculations are correct, I’d 
                        say we’re eight-and-a-half miles 
                        from the edge of this forest. If we 
                        make good time, I think we could 
                        make it to the train station by 
                        evening.

                                 DELORES
                        Where’s Norman? Is Norman still 
                        asleep?

                                 DECLAN
                        By tomorrow morning, we could be on 
                        a train out of this place.

                                 DELORES
                        I wish Norman were awake.

           JUST THEN ——
           A cabin door swings open.
           And Norman strides out, completely naked.
           Just a cabbage leaf over his crotch.

           His bear suit is folded under one arm.
           His cabbages tucked under the other.

                                 NORMAN
                        G’day, mates!

                        There he is! G’day, Norman!

           Delores bats her eyelashes.

                                 DECLAN
                        Norman, why aren’t you wearing your 
                        bear suit? You should be dressed 
                        and ready to start hiking.

                                 NORMAN
                        Sounds good. Just give me one hour 
                        to air out my bear suit and then 
                        I’ll be ready to head out.

                                 DECLAN
                        We don’t have an hour to wait for 
                        your bear suit to air out. Put your 
                        bear suit on right now, Norman. 
                        We’re heading out.

                                 NORMAN
                        This bear suit gets moist if I 
                        don’t air it out once a week. I’m 
                        just going to lay it out on the 
                        shore of that pond while I take a 
                        dip.

                                 NORMAN
                        Look, mate. If you’ve never worn a 
                        bear suit for three weeks straight, 
                        you don’t know how moist a bear 
                        suit can get. Trust me on this one. 
                        I’ll be in the water.

           Norman heads down a rocky path to the pond.
                                 DELORES
                        Honey, do you want to take a dip

                        and nutritious continental

           POND

           Delores runs down a trail to the waterfall.
           Tears streaming down her face.

           On the shore, Norman’s bearskin is airing out.
           Five cabbages stacked beside it.

           Norman floats on his back in the pond.
           Buck naked.
           Sun glinting off his tanned skin.
           He calls out to Delores:

                        again. Don’t look. I’m taking off 
                        my pants.

           Delores steps to the edge of the pond.
           Norman shields his eyes.

           Delores reaches into her pants.
           And pulls out an armful of cabbages.

           She sets them carefully on the bank.
           Then reaches back into her pants.
           And pulls out more cabbages.
           Then reaches back into her pants.
           And pulls out more cabbages.
           Then reaches back into her pants.
           And pulls out more cabbages.

           She stacks all thirty-nine cabbages in a pile. 

           Then strips to her underwear.
           Folds her clothes on the shore.
           And wades into the pond.

           Delores swims to Norman.
           And floats on her back in the cool water.

                        Norman? Have you ever made a big 
                        mistake?

                                 NORMAN

                        I mean a really big mistake.

                                 NORMAN
                        One time, I was smuggling fifty 
                        bricks of cocaine in a cement truck 
                        full of linseeds when I discovered 
                        I am deathly allergic to linseeds. 
                        I spent three weeks in a hospital 
                        in Managua, and to this day I can’t 
                        feel the tips of my ears. 

                                 DELORES
                        That’s horrible, Norman. I have 
                        allergies, too.

                                 NORMAN
                        We have a lot in common.
           Delores gazes pensively into the sky.
           Watching the sun dip behind dark clouds.

                                 DELORES
                        What if I wasn’t supposed to marry 
                        Declan?

                                 NORMAN
                        Why do you say that?

                                 DELORES
                        Declan’s a lovely man, and very 
                        punctual. But the truth is we met 
                        when we were young. I was still 
                        getting my online knitwear shop off 
                        the ground, and Declan was already 
                        a junior analytics associate. He 
                        made things simple. It was all so 
                        simple. We dated for a few years, 
                        and soon we were renting an 
                        apartment in the city and then we 
                        bought a house in the suburbs, and 
                        we got engaged and we planned a 
                        wedding and the next thing we knew 
                        we were married. But sometimes, 
                        late at night, I worry that there 
                        are things that people do that I’ll 
                        never get to do because I’m married 
                        to Declan.

                        I don’t know. I’ve always wanted to 
                        swim with jellyfish in Bora Bora,

                        We can climb Denali, or

                        Easy! Next month, we’ll pack our 
                        bags and we’ll travel to Mount

                        cheese sandwiches, and we’ll sleep 
                        at the summit and look out on the 
                        world through binoculars. There’s a 
                        pretty epic view from the summit of

                        Epic. It sounds epic.

                        Then it’s a date.

           Norman winks at Delores.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m going to dive now.

           He dives beneath the pond’s surface.
           Kicking propulsively.
           Until he’s vanished beneath the water.

           Delores drifts on her back.
           Mottled sunlight on her face.

           A moment later, Norman resurfaces.

                                 NORMAN (CONT'D)
                        Delores! Guess what! You’ll never

                        Just hold your nose and let 
                        yourself fall. Let the water do the 
                        work.

           Delores pinches her nose.
           Squeezes her eyes shut.
           Then ducks beneath the water.
           WE FOLLOW DOLORES as she sinks to ——

           THE BOTTOM OF THE POND

           Hair swirling.
           Bubbles streaming from her nose.
           Sinking into the depths until ——

           Delores’ feet touch the pond’s floor.
           She opens her eyes.
           And looks about the murky water.

           The pond is hazy and green.
           There are no jellyfish in sight.

           Dolores pushes off the pond’s floor.
           Flutter-kicking furiously.
           Until she bursts through the surface of the ——

           POND

           And spits out a mouthful of water.

                                 DELORES
                        Norman? Where are the jellyfish? I

           Delores wipes water from her eyes.
           Norman is no longer in the water.

           AND THEN ——
           Delores spots Norman on the shore.
           He’s hurriedly pulling on his bear suit.
           He zips it halfway up his chest.
           And STUFFS IT FULL OF DELORES’ CABBAGES.

                        Norman?!

           Norman zips the bear suit to his chin.
           And yanks its fuzzy head over his own.

                        Norman! What are you doing?

           Norman turns on his big bear feet.
           And bounds up the trail from the waterfall.

                        HEY! COME BACK HERE!

           Delores thrashes toward the shore.
           Kicking frantically.
           Gulping down mouthfuls of water.

                                                            SMASH TO:

           CAMPGROUND

           Declan is sitting on a rock.
           Glumly reading Norman’s map when ——

           The bushes rustle.
           And Norman BARRELS across the campground.
           Bear suit lumpy with cabbages.

                                 DECLAN
                        Norman?!

           Norman sprints wordlessly past Declan.
           He crashes into the underbrush.
           And disappears into the woods.

           THE NEXT SECOND ——
           Delores runs up the trail from the pond.
           Soaking wet.
           Pulling on clothes. 
           Face crumpled in anguish.

                                 DELORES
                        My cabbages, Declan! He’s stolen my

           Declan doesn’t wait a beat.
           He leaps to his feet.
           And TAKES OFF after Norman into the ——

           WOODS

           Norman bounds through the forest.
           Dodging pines.
           Leaping over rocks.
           Swatting branches with his bear paws.

           Behind him, Declan and Delores run.

                                 DECLAN
                        Come back here, you!

           Norman leaps over a small brook.
           And claws effortlessly up a hill.

           Declan grits his teeth.
           Head bowed with determination.
           Fanny pack bouncing on his gut.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Those are my wife’s cabbages! You 
                        come back here right now with my 
                        wife’s cabbages!

           Norman leaps over a fallen branch.
           Then bounds deftly around a tree.
           And charges into a thorny bush when ——

           SPPPPROOIING!

           A LOOP OF ROPE SNARES NORMAN’S NECK.
           A MASSIVE LOG SWINGS FROM THE TREETOPS.
           NO TIME TO DUCK.

                                 NORMAN
                        AUUUUGH!

           THE LOG SMACKS NORMAN IN HIS BEAR HEAD.
           CRUNCH!
           NORMAN’S BEAR HEAD LOLLS ON HIS BEAR NECK.
           HIS BEAR BODY CRUMPLES UNNATURALLY.
           HIS BEAR KNEES GIVE OUT.
           AND NORMAN’S BODY FALLS TO THE GROUND.
           SMACKING THE DIRT.
           CABBAGES TUMBLING FROM HIS BEAR SUIT.

           Declan and Delores slow to a stop.
           Chests heaving with shallow breaths.
           Declan stares in disbelief at Norman’s body.

                                 DECLAN
                        It’s a West Burmese Neck-Snapping 
                        Trap. These traps are banned in 
                        fifty-three countries and violate 
                        five United Nations conventions. 

           Delores approaches the sprung trap.
           She crouches beside Norman’s remains.
           And shuts the bear’s eyelids.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, Delores. I’m sorry you 
                        lost your mate.

                        He wasn’t my mate. I don’t even 
                        know if he was my friend.
           Delores picks up the scattered cabbages.
           And crams them back in her pants.

                                                             CUT TO:

           NIGHT

           Drizzle falls from the treetops.
           Hissing on ferns and fallen leaves.

           Declan and Delores trudge through the rain.
           Lost in melancholy thought.
           Delores’ pants are once again full of cabbages.

                                                             CUT TO:

           CAVE

           Declan and Delores crouch in an animal cave.
           Hugging their knees to their chests.
           Shivering in the cold.
           They’ve left their suitcases behind.

                                 DECLAN
                        Honey? When we get home, I was

                        cubic foot clipping bag, which is 
                        the largest clipping bag amongst 
                        its competitors.

           They gaze into the curtain of drizzle.

                                 DELORES
                        Honey? I think I should probably 
                        thank you.

                                 DECLAN
                        Thank me? For what?

                                 DELORES
                        For chasing Norman through the

                                 DELORES
                        No. You could have Norman get away 
                        with my cabbages. You didn’t have 
                        to chase him. But you did. And the 
                        reason you did is because you know 
                        just how important it is for a lady 
                        to keep cabbages in her pants.

                                 DECLAN
                        I don’t understand for one second 
                        why it’s important for a lady to 
                        keep cabbages in her pants.

                                 DELORES
                        Then that’s even better.

           Delores kisses Declan on the cheek.
           Then lies back on the cave floor.

                        I’m sorry I messed up our wedding 
                        dance, Declan. I shouldn’t have had 
                        so many champagnes.

           She shuts her eyes.
           Declan watches raindrops pelt the forest.

           Shazbor’s men trudge through the onslaught.
           Umbrellas over their heads.
           Thwacking away branches with their bats.

           En masse, they stop when they see ——

           Norman’s body face down in the mud.
           His bear suit drenched with rainwater.

                                 SHAZBOR
                        It is a Kamchatka brown bear.

                                 OFFICER
                        It is dead?

           Shazbor squats beside the mangled bear.
           Somberly, he removes his hat.
           His officers remove theirs.

                                 SHAZBOR
                        During the war, these traps were 
                        set the woods to protect our 
                        national treasures from intruders.

           He makes the sign of the cross.

                        Sometimes, the things we do to save 
                        ourselves destroy us in the end.

           Shazbor scoops damp dirt in his palm.
           And scatters it over Norman’s body.

           His officers gather around.
           Dutifully, they collect handfuls of soil.
           And toss them over the bear’s cadaver.

           The night’s storm has passed.
           A dewy morning soaks the sylvan mountains.

           Declan and Delores emerge from the cave.
           Rubbing sleep from their eyes.

           MOUNTAINS

           Birds twitter in pine branches.

                        Declan? Why don’t we ever climb 
                        mountains back home in America? 

                                 DECLAN
                        Climbing mountains is a risky 
                        outdoor activity, Delores. Last 
                        year, one-hundred Americans and 
                        forty-three Canadians fell to their 
                        deaths from mountains. I don’t want 
                        us to be part of a statistic.

                                 DELORES
                        Isn’t there anything you’ve always 
                        wanted to do that we’ve never done 
                        before?
                                 DECLAN
                        Of course there are. Lot of things. 
                        But just because there are things 
                        we’ve always wanted to do doesn’t 
                        mean we should do them.

                                 DELORES
                        And why not?

                                 DECLAN
                        If we do all the things we’ve 
                        always wanted to do together, we’ll 
                        have done all the things we’ve 
                        always wanted to do together and 
                        there won’t be anything left for us 
                        to do together. And then what are 
                        we supposed to do?

                        I suppose you have a point.

           They step to the edge of an overlook.
           And gaze across a staggering vista.

           A majestic panoply of clouds.
           Mountains rise from a rolling sea of pines. 
           Sunkissed mountains vanish into fog.

           In a distant valley below, we clock:
           A LITTLE VILLAGE.
           Rural and quaint.
           Nestled in a copse of trees.
           Bisected by train tracks.

           Delores takes Declan’s hand.

           Declan and Delores walk through the town.
           The streets are cobbled.
           Lined with thatched cottages.
           Flowers spill from balconies.
           Flags flap in an afternoon breeze.

           A few burly VILLAGERS stand on ladders.
           Stringing fairy lights over the street.
           Others pass in a rickety donkey cart.
           Singing a tuneless chorale:

                        Burn the cabbage, burn it all! 
                        Death to the wicked vegetable!

           Delores waves at the villagers.
           The villagers wave back.

                        Hello, villagers!

                        Shh. We mustn’t draw attention to 
                        ourselves, Delores. We can’t trust 
                        anyone.

           They approach a run-down train station.
           Then trot up concrete steps and enter the ——

           Grass peeks through concrete floors.
           Gesso peels from brick walls.
           Old Soviet agitprop shows through thin paint.

           Behind a glass window sits a BOOKING CLERK (19).
           She smacks gum while she reads a magazine.
           She looks up as Declan and Delores approach.

                        Good afternoon. Can I be of

                        country other than this one,

                        Yes, we have many trains out of 
                        this country. Would you like direct

                                 BOOKING CLERK
                        Would you like one-way train or

           Declan pinches the bridge of his nose.

                                 DECLAN
                        Perhaps I am not making myself 
                        clear. We are trying to get across 
                        the border as fast as is humanly 
                        possible. It doesn’t matter to us

           The clerk clicks her mouse several times.
           Declan taps his toes.

           The clerk clicks her mouse.
           And turns to a chunky printer.

                        The train leaves in four weeks at 
                        8:31 in the night. I am printing 
                        the tickets now.

                                 DECLAN
                        What did you say?

                                 BOOKING CLERK
                        I am printing the tickets now. 
                        Please be patient, sometimes the 
                        printer is slow.

                                 DECLAN
                        Did you say the train leaves in 
                        four weeks?

                                 BOOKING CLERK
                        This is correct, the train leaves 
                        in four weeks and will be facing 
                        backwards. 

                                 DECLAN
                        No, that’s no good.

                                 BOOKING CLERK
                        I can look for a facing forwards 
                        train, but I warn you it may not 
                        leave so soon.
                                 DECLAN
                        I don’t care which way the train is 
                        facing! We can’t wait four weeks 
                        for our train to leave. We need to 
                        be on the next train out of here.

                                 BOOKING CLERK
                        This is correct, the next train out 
                        of country leaves in four weeks.

                                 DECLAN
                        Well, that can’t be true. There 
                        must be a train, any train, to any 
                        country that is not this country 
                        any time sooner than four weeks.

           The clerk checks her computer again.
           Then shakes her head.

                                 BOOKING CLERK
                        I am sorry, no train is leaving

                        this is Buburu Kapusta.

           The agent’s eyes light up.

                                 BOOKING CLERK
                        You do not know of Buburu Kapusta? 
                        Buburu Kapusta is one month 
                        national festival in celebration of 
                        how much we dislike the cabbage. In 
                        villages all across country, people 
                        gather in town square and all 
                        cabbages found by the polizei in 
                        the last six years are burned in a 
                        fire. We have a funny man named 
                        Buburu Kapusta with a cabbage for a 
                        head and we beat him with a stick. 
                        There is food and clapping for one 
                        month, and any person struck by a 
                        pussywillow stick must dance. 
                        Buburu Kapusta is such great fun.

                        No one wants to leave country when 
                        it is the month of Buburu Kapusta, 
                        and this is why there are no 
                        trains.

           The booking clerk smiles.
           She hands the tickets over the counter.

                        You are very lucky to be here for 
                        Buburu Kapusta.

                                                            SMASH TO:

           EVENING

           Declan and Delores sit on a curb.
           Delores licks an ice cream cone.
           Declan checks his death watch.

                                 DECLAN
                        14,265 days left on Earth.

           He rests his chin in his hand.

           VILLAGERS have begun to stream into the street.  
           Many wear fanciful animal masks.
           Children skip about their parents’ ankles.
           Some carry hand-sewn dolls with cabbages for heads. 

                                 DELORES
                        Would you like a lick of my ice 
                        cream, honey?

                                 DECLAN
                        I’m in no mood for a lick of ice 
                        cream.

                                 DELORES
                        Are you sure? I think it’s made 
                        from fermented sheep’s milk.

                                 DECLAN
                        Goddammit, Delores! Aren’t you even 
                        the least bit concerned we’re going 
                        to be stuck in this country forever 
                        and shot in a public square?

                                 DELORES
                        Of course I’m concerned, Declan. 
                        But there’s nothing much we can do 
                        about it now, is there? Besides, 
                        there’s a national festival 
                        happening in every small town.

                                 DELORES (CONT'D)
                        No matter how bad things might be, 
                        I’ve always found my spirits can be 
                        lifted by a national festival.

           Slowly, Declan gets to his feet.
           He points across the street.
           WE FOLLOW his finger to see ——

           SHAZBOR STANDING AMIDST THE CROWD.
           FLANKED BY HIS OFFICERS.
           RED UNIFORMS PEEKING THROUGH THE CROWD.

                                 DECLAN
                        Look, Delores. That’s Shazbor. I 
                        recognize him from that poster in 
                        the abandoned cabin. He’s caught up 
                        with us. Quick. Get up.

           Delores crams her ice cream in her mouth.
           Declan pulls her to her feet.

           By now, the street has filled with revelers.
           They wave pussywillows and ring bells. 
           Singing in atonal unison:

                                 VILLAGERS
                            (singing)
                        Burn the cabbage, burn it all! 
                        Death to the wicked vegetable!

           Declan and Delores duck into the throng.
           And follow the parade down the street.
           Then march around a corner into a ——

           TOWN SQUARE

           VENDORS sell link sausages and onion rolls.
           A KLEZMER BAND plays gusles and duduks.
           ACROBATS perform backflips off rubber balls.
           WOMEN beat a cabbage-headed effigy with sticks.
           DANCERS link arms as they waltz around ——

           A RAGING BONFIRE.

           VILLAGERS toss cabbages into its flames.
           They ignite to spirited CHEERS.
           Sparks drift toward distant stars.

           Delores and Declan weave through the crowd.
           Faces lit by the bonfire’s glow.
           Declan steals a glance behind him.
           Through a sea of smiling faces, he see ——

           Shazbor’s fuzzy hat.
           Bobbing above the crowd like a buoy.

                                 DECLAN
                        Keep moving, Delores.

           Declan and Delores lower their heads.
           And weave through the mob.
           Dodging elbows and shoulders.

           Suddenly, a LITTLE GIRL runs up to Declan.
           A gnarled pussywillow switch in her hand.
           She WHACKS it against Declan’s arm.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Ow!

                                 LITTLE GIRL 
                        I CHOOSE YOU!

                                 DECLAN
                        Why did you do that?

           Declan rubs his stinging arm.
           The little girl giggles.
           A village ELDER in a donkey mask approaches.

                                 ELDER
                        The child has struck you with a 
                        pussywillow! On Buburu Kapusta, it 
                        is tradition that when he is struck 
                        by a pussywillow, a man must find a 
                        woman and dance! 

                                 DECLAN
                        I don’t want to dance.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dance! Dance! You have been struck!

                                 ELDER
                        Dance! You must dance! Dance!

           The elder claps his hands.
           Villagers gather.
           Forming a circle around Declan and Delores.

                                 VILLAGERS
                        DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! 
                        DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE!

           As if on cue, the band strikes up a polka.
           Flugelhornists toot their flugelhorns.
           Balalaikists pluck their balalaikas.
           OOM-PAH-PAH! OOM-PAH-PAH!
                                 DECLAN
                        This is ridiculous. I don’t want to 
                        dance. Dancing will not help us 
                        right now.

                                 DELORES
                        I don’t think we have a choice, 
                        Declan. I think these people want 
                        us to dance.

           Declan sighs.
           Then turns to face Delores.

                                 DECLAN
                        Do you remember the moves?

                                 DELORES
                        I think so.

           Declan takes Delores in his arms.
           He places a hand on her waist.

           They begin to two-step.
           Swaying to the beat.
           Their footsteps quick and agile.

           This is their wedding dance.
           They know it by heart.

           WE ORBIT DECLAN AND DELORES AS ——
           They complete a shuffle ball change.
           Then a flap ball change.
           Then a paddle-and-roll.

           The band plays faster.
           OOM-PAH-PAH! OOM-PAH-PAH!

           Delores TRUST FALLS into Declan’s arms.
           Then CRAWLS between his legs.

           The villagers cheer through their masks.
           Clapping to the rhythm.
           OOM-PAH-PAH! OOM-PAH-PAH!

           Declan and Delores do a Maxie Ford. 
           Then a a triple twinkle.
           Then a Shirley Temple.
           Then a dazzling buena onda.

                                 DELORES (CONT'D)
                        I won’t let you down this time.

           Declan gives Delores a spin.
           Then tosses her in the air.
           And catches her in his arms.

           He gives her a deep and glorious DIP.
           Then pulls her to his chest.
           And plants a passionate kiss on her lips.

           They gaze into one another’s eyes.
           Out of breath.
           Chests heaving.
           Waiting for the villagers’ applause. 

           But the villagers don’t applaud.
           The square is dead silent.
           The band has stopped playing.
           A hundred eyes stare at Declan and Delores.

                                 DECLAN
                        What happened to the music?

           Slowly, Delores looks down to see —— 
           A CABBAGE HAS FALLEN FROM HER PANTS.

                                 DELORES
                        Oh.

           SUDDENLY, A COMMOTION AS ——
           Shazbor fights through the crowd.
           Bushy eyebrows knit.
           Red-coated officers in tow.

                                 DECLAN
                        Delores?

                                 DELORES
                        What is it, honey?

                                 DECLAN
                        I think we should run.

           Delores picks up the rogue cabbage.
           And stuffs back in her pants.

           Declan grabs her hand.
           And yanks Delores through the square.

           They shove angry villagers aside.
           And dash toward the edge of the square.
           Sneakers squeaking on cobblestone.

           BEHIND THEM ——
           Shazbor raises a stubby finger.
           And growls through his beard:
                                 SHAZBOR
                        STOP THEM! THEY HAVE CABBAGES!

                                                            SMASH TO:

           OUTSKIRTS

           Declan and Delores sprint through the village.
           Passing cottages and grain silos.
           Chained dogs BARKING as they run.

           Delores looks behind her to see ——
           SHAZBOR’S ARMY IN HOT PURSUIT.
           FOLLOWED BY A MOB OF MASKED VILLAGERS.
           THEIR RUSTY BATS AND TORCHES RAISED HIGH.

                                 DECLAN
                        This way!

           Declan and Delores take off down an alley.
           And hotfoot it down an unpaved road.
           Kicking up clouds of dust.

           Declan hurdles over a wooden fence.
           And helps Delores scramble over it.
           Hand-in-hand, they run.
           And run.
           And run.
           And run.

           Until they’re out of breath.
           Until they’ve reached the edge of town.
           Until the road is overgrown with weeds.

           Finally, Declan and Delores slow.
           Before them: a vast field of grain.
           Through dim twilight, they see ——

           A CHURCH MADE OF HAY.

           Majestic against a twilit sky.
           Spires and buttresses made of hay.
           A hay roof crowned with hay gargoyles. 
           Hay windows lit from within.

                                 DELORES
                        Why, it’s that church you read 
                        about in that in-flight magazine.
           Declan and Delores smile at each other.
           Then join hands.
           And make a break for the church.
           Dusk’s light catching the bulges of Delores’ pants.

                                                            SMASH TO:

           CHURCH

           Delores sits on a hay bale.
           Chin in hand.

           Everything in the church is made of hay.
           Hay pews, hay altar, hay Jesus, hay cross.

           Declan stands at a window.
           Peering anxiously into the night.

                                 DELORES
                        Are they still out there?

           IN THE DISTANCE ——
           Shazbor’s men have the church surrounded.
           Some sit in folding chairs.
           Their torches flicker in the inky night.
           Bkofl is amongst them, in a wheelchair.

                                 DECLAN
                        They’ve set up folding chairs. 

                                 DELORES
                        I hope they don’t try to come in 
                        here.
                                 DECLAN
                        They won’t. The nuns won’t let 
                        them. This church is one of the 
                        world’s last bastions of peace. I 
                        read in the in-flight magazine that 
                        during the war, the church served 
                        as a provisional demilitarized 
                        zone. Any soldier seeking refuge 
                        from the horrors of armed combat 
                        was welcomed, no matter which side 
                        he was fighting for. We’ll be safe 
                        as long as we stay inside this 
                        church.

                                 DELORES
                        How long do you think we’ll have to 
                        stay here?

                                 DECLAN
                        I don’t know, Delores. We’ll stay 
                        here until Shazbor realizes we’re 
                        not coming out and goes home.

           Declan crosses the nave. 
           A rope hangs from the apse.
           Declan grabs it.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        We should eat something. I wonder 
                        what the nuns are cooking for 
                        supper. I’ll ring for a nun.

           Declan yanks the rope.
           A large brass bell rings.
           GONG! GONG! GONG!

                                 DELORES
                        Shazbor could be waiting out there 
                        for a long time. If he doesn’t 
                        leave in a few weeks, we might miss 
                        the Feigenbaums’ annual Fourth of 
                        July barbecue.

           JUST THEN ——
           A NUN (55) appears at the door.
           She bows her head in somber greeting.

                                 NUN
                        You rang for a nun?

                                 DECLAN
                        We did, Sister.
                                 NUN
                        Are you finding your asylum 
                        pleasant?

                                 DECLAN
                        Quite pleasant, thank you.

                                 NUN
                        Will you be warm enough tonight, or 
                        do you need more hay?

                                 DELORES
                        I think we have plenty of hay.

                                 NUN
                        Vlà. Very good. May the Lord have 
                        mercy on your souls.

           She makes the sign of the cross.
           Then turns to leave.

                                 DECLAN
                        Wait! Sister!

           The nun turns back.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Please. We are very hungry.

                                 DELORES
                        We’ve been eating white beans and 
                        pickled herring for days.
                                 DECLAN
                        Tell us, what are the sisters 
                        serving in the refectory tonight?

                                 NUN
                        Tonight, we eat a warm repast of 
                        cornmeal and stewed meat. We eat 
                        simply here, but our hearts and 
                        souls are full.

                                 DECLAN
                        Cornmeal and stewed meat sounds 
                        excellent, Sister. Thank you.

                                 DELORES
                        We’ll be right down.

           The nun looks down at her feet.

                                 NUN
                        I am sorry, but you may not eat 
                        with us tonight. Tonight’s repast 
                        is for those who are... clean.

                                 DECLAN
                        Clean?

                                 NUN
                        Vlà. Your wife lives in sin. Your 
                        wife has cabbages in her pants.

                                 DELORES
                        Cabbages? In my pants? Don’t be 
                        outrageous!

                                 DECLAN
                        Give it up, Delores.

           Delores folds her arms and huffs.
           Declan crosses to the nun.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        Please, Sister. We’ve been running 
                        from the polizei for many days. We 
                        need to eat something. Don’t you 
                        have anything you can spare us?

                                 NUN
                        I am sorry. May the Lord have mercy 
                        on your souls.

           With a bow, the nun turns and exits.
           A sorrowful quiet hangs in her wake.
                                 DECLAN
                        Well, that’s just ridiculous. I’ve 
                        never heard of nuns who won’t share 
                        their food.

                                 DELORES
                        I can feel my stomach eating 
                        itself.  

                                 DECLAN
                        We could be stuck here for a long 
                        time, and we can’t go outside or 
                        Shazbor will kill us. This is not 
                        good. This is not good at all.

           Declan kicks a pile of hay.
           Delores sighs.

                                 DELORES
                        You probably wish you never married 
                        me, don’t you?

                                 DECLAN
                        Don’t say that.

                                 DELORES
                        It’s true, isn’t it? If you’d 
                        married someone else, you could 
                        have gone to museums and eaten eggs 
                        and yogurt on your honeymoon. 
                        Instead, here you are starving to 
                        death in a church made of hay. This 
                        is all my fault, isn’t it?

           She buries her head in her hands.
           Her shoulders begin to rock.
           Declan puts a hand on her back.

                                 DECLAN
                        Oh, Delores. Don’t cry.

                                 DELORES
                        I’m not crying. I have to sneeze.

           Delores SNEEZES.

                                 DELORES (CONT'D)
                        Goodness. I think Dr. Kane was 
                        right. I really am quite allergic 
                        to hay.

                                 DECLAN
                        What?
                                 DELORES
                        Dr. Kane told me I have very 
                        serious allergies to hay. I think 
                        all the hay in this church is 
                        making my hay allergies flare up.

                                 DECLAN
                        You’re allergic to hay?

                                 DELORES
                        Isn’t it funny how you and I have 
                        spent so much time together and yet 
                        we’re still learning new things 
                        about each other? I feel rather 
                        lightheaded.

           Indeed, Delores looks quite ill.
           She sneezes three more times.
           Her face has begun to turn green.

                                 DECLAN
                        You don’t look so well, Delores.

                                 DELORES
                        Dr. Kane said if I’m in contact 
                        with hay for more than twenty-four 
                        I could lose my eyesight. 

                                 DECLAN
                        YOUR EYESIGHT?!

                                 DELORES
                        It’s a serious allergy. 

           She sneezes again.

                                 DECLAN
                        Oh, no no, no. This is worse than 
                        not good. This is very not good. If 
                        we don’t die of allergies we’ll die 
                        of starvation, and if we don’t die 
                        of starvation we’ll die of bat. 
                        What are we going to do?

                                 DELORES
                        I don’t know.

                                 DECLAN
                        Me, neither.

           Declan sits on a hay bale.
           He bows his head, dejected.
                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve lived my whole life trying to 
                        have an answer for everything. But 
                        for the first time, I don’t have a 
                        clue what to do next. I’ve tried 
                        everything I can think of to get us 
                        home. I’m starting to think that 
                        maybe, somehow, we weren’t meant to 
                        get out of this church alive.

           A long, mournful beat.
           Then, Delores reaches into her pants.
           And pulls out a wilted cabbage.

                                 DECLAN (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DELORES
                        There’s one thing we can do. If we 
                        eat all the cabbages that are 
                        inside my pants, Shazbor will never 
                        be able to prove that we ever had 
                        any cabbages at all! That way, we 
                        can walk out of this church and get 
                        on an airplane and fly home to 
                        America and there won’t be a thing 
                        Shazbor will be able do about it.

                                 DECLAN
                        That’s what I’ve been saying for 
                        days, Delores.

                                 DELORES
                        I knew all these cabbages would 
                        come in handy. It’s a good thing I 
                        put them in my pants.

           She hands the cabbage to Declan.
           Then pulls another from her pants. 

           They raise the cabbages to their lips. 
           And bite into them.

           Declan chews his bite.
           And gulps it down.
           Then takes another big bite.
           Masticating furiously.

           He looks over at Delores.
           She has stopped eating her cabbage.

                                 DECLAN
                            (mouth full)
                        Why aren’t you eating your cabbage?

                        What do you mean you can’t eat any 
                        more cabbage? You’ve hardly eaten 
                        any cabbage. We have thirty-nine 
                        whole cabbages to eat.

                                 DELORES
                        I don’t especially care for the

                                 DECLAN
                        After all this, you don’t care for 
                        the taste of cabbage?

                                 DELORES
                        Not these cabbages. These cabbages 
                        are soggy because they’ve been in 
                        my pants.

                                 DECLAN

           Delores huffs.
           Declan takes her hand.
           Red spots have appeared on her skin. 

                                 DECLAN
                        Listen, Delores. Listen to me very 
                        closely. Do you know how the people 
                        of this country made it through the 
                        war when all they had to eat were 
                        cabbages?

                                 DELORES
                        I don’t want to know. I want to die

                                 DELORES (CONT'D)
                        The way the people made it through 
                        the war was by pretending each 
                        cabbage tasted like another food. 
                        They pretended they were eating 
                        cabbages that tasted like pork 
                        chops and cabbages that tasted like 
                        cinnamon ice cream and cabbages 
                        that tasted like maple syrup. Watch 
                        this.

           Declan holds a soggy cabbage to his lips.
           And bites into it.
           Rubbing his belly luxuriously.

                                 DECLAN
                        Mmm! Delores! You’ll never guess 
                        what this one tastes like.
                        It tastes like strawberries. Like 
                        juicy strawberries with whipped 
                        cream on top. You have to try it.

           Declan hands Delores the cabbage.
           Delores takes a bite.

                                 DELORES
                        It tastes like cabbage to me.

                                 DECLAN
                        No, it doesn’t. Pretend it’s 
                        something else. Anything else.

           Declan snatches Delores’ cabbage.
           And bites into it.

                        Mm. This one delicious. This one 
                        tastes like... like brie and 
                        saltine crackers!

                                 DELORES
                        Let me try.

           Delores snatches the cabbage back.
           And bites into it.
           A smile creeps across her face.

                        You’re right, Declan. I taste it 
                        now. Like brie and saltine cracks 
                        in a hot air balloon over the South 
                        of France!
                                 DECLAN
                        That’s right! That’s exactly right. 
                        Try another!

           Delores pulls another cabbage from her pants.
           And bites into it.

                        What does that one taste like?

                                 DELORES
                        This one tastes like goat meat from 
                        a village in the middle of 
                        Bangladesh after a long day of 
                        hiking, and it’s cooked in 
                        Himalayan spices and we’re singing 
                        songs with our sherpas. 

                                 DECLAN
                        That’s right, Delores. That’s 
                        right.

           Delores reaches into her pants.
           She pulls out an armload of cabbages.
           They tumble out into the hay.

           Declan bites into one and grins.

                        Oh, Delores! This one tastes like 
                        warm moussaka with béchamel sauce 
                        on a cliffside restaurant on the 
                        Almafi coast! And we have a 
                        daughter, and she’s eating macaroni

                        our daughter has just taken the SAT

           Declan and Delores chew.
           Savoring the taste of the leaves. 
           At last, they open their eyes.
           The cabbages are all but devoured.
           Leaves scattered everywhere.

                        Boy, Delores. I’m getting pretty

                        much in a long time.

           Declan and Delores smile at each other.
           Their teeth are flecked with cabbage.

           FIELD

           Dawn’s golden light floods the field.

           Shazbor and his officers are fast asleep.
           Slumped in their folding chairs.

           Declan and Delores sleep in a pile of hay.
           Delores’ face is covered in spots.

           Her pants are slack and empty.
           All the cabbages have been eaten.

           Groggily, Declan wakes.
           He brushes hay from his hair.
           And gives Delores a gentle shake.

                                 DECLAN
                        Delores? Honey? Wake up. It’s 
                        morning.

           Delores’ eyes flutter open.
           She squints into a waxing daybreak.

           FIELD

           The church’s front doors creak open.
           Declan and Delores step from within.
           Shielding their eyes from daylight.

                                 SHAZBOR O/S
                        HALT! HANDS UP!

           Declan and Delores stop in their tracks.
           And raise their hands high.

           Shazbor is striding toward them.
           Clutching his rusty bat.
           Flanked by two OFFICERS.

           They march up to Declan and Delores.
           Glaring from beneath their furry hats.

           Shazbor stops a foot from Declan and Delores.
           Then looks them up and down.
           Frowning at Delores’ limp, flaccid pants.

                                 SHAZBOR
                        Frisk them.

           Shazbor’s OFFICERS crouch.
           And frisk Declan and Delores brusquely.
           Patting their thighs and knees and ankles.

           Finally, the officers stand.
           And shake their bushy heads.

                                 OFFICER 1
                        We are sorry, Shazbor.

                                 OFFICER 2
                        These two have no cabbages.

           Shazbor grits his teeth.
           He eyes Delores suspiciously.
           Then nods.

                                 SHAZBOR
                        Very well. I hope you two have had 
                        a wonderful stay in our country. Do

                        That’s it? We can go?
           Shazbor nods.

           He slides his bat into its holster.
           Mustache drooping with resignation.

                                 SHAZBOR
                        You may go.

           She exhales a woeful sigh.

           Declan reads an in-flight magazine.
           Delores is asleep on his shoulder.

           Delores stands at a stove.
           Wearing a sundress and apron.
           Her cheeks and lips are rouged.

           Delores stirs the cabbage stew.

           BACKYARD

           A Midwestern sun hangs low in the sky.
           COUPLES mingle in skirts and polos.
           Nibbling at crudités off paper plates.

           Declan stands at the edge of the lawn.
           His hair is neatly combed.
           His shirt is tucked into chino shorts.

           Declan checks his death watch.
           He has 13,998 days left on Earth.

                        Declan?

           Declan looks up.

           Delores is crossing the lawn toward him.
           She wears a brimmed hat.
           She holds a cabbage stew in a casserole.

                                 DECLAN
                        Delores. You look nice.

                                 DELORES
                        Thank you, Declan. I like your 
                        shorts.

                                 DECLAN
                        Thank you. I didn’t have any good 
                        chino shorts in my closet, so I 
                        bought some at Bloomingdale’s. When 
                        it comes to shorts, you can never 
                        go wrong with chino, I always say.

           Declan opens his arms.
           He gives Delores a tentative hug.

                        How are you?

                                 DECLAN
                        Good, Delores. Really good, 
                        actually. I got it. I got the 
                        promotion.

                                 DELORES
                        You did?!

                                 DECLAN
                        You’re looking at the Senior

                        That’s wonderful, Declan! Just 
                        wonderful! I’m happy for you. 
                        Really.

                                 DECLAN
                        I have my own office on the sixth 
                        floor near the elevators. And the 
                        benefits aren’t too shabby. I put 
                        some money toward that lawnmower I 
                        was telling you about. I can cut 
                        the lawn in two-thirds the time it 
                        used to take. And the capacity of 
                        the clipping bag is unparalleled. 
                        You should come over sometime. I’d 
                        love for you to see how good the 
                        lawn is looking, if you’d like.

                                 DELORES
                        I would like that, Declan. I’d like 
                        that very much.

                                 DECLAN
                        How about Thursday?

                        Thursday? Oh, no. Thursday’s no

                                 DECLAN
                        Friday?

                                 DELORES
                        Friday’s no good either. I’m afraid 
                        it will be a while before I can 
                        come over, Declan. Tomorrow, I’m 
                        traveling with my mountaineering 
                        group to Hawaii to scale Mauna Kea. 
                        I’ll be back in a month, and then 
                        I’ll come over to see the lawn, 
                        how’s that?

           They smile at each other.
           A hint of sadness in their eyes.

           JUST THEN ——
           CRAIG (33) and RHONDA (32) approach.
           Craig wears a tribal shirt.
           Rhonda wears a colorful sarong. 
           They hold cups of wine and plates of sausages.

                        Well, well, well, look who couldn’t 
                        stay away from our barbecue! If it 
                        isn’t Declan and Delores!

                                 DECLAN
                        Hi, Craig. Hi, Rhonda.

                                 CRAIG O/S
                        How’s married life treating you?

           Craig punches Declan in the arm.
           Everyone laughs.

                                 DELORES
                        Here. I brought you a dish made of 
                        cabbages and cubed beef. The 
                        British call it bubble and squeak.

                                 RHONDA
                        How interesting.

           Delores hands Rhonda the casserole.

                                 DECLAN
                        I love your dress, Rhonda.    
                                 RHONDA
                        Do you? I got it during our 
                        honeymoon in Bora Bora. I saw a 
                        native Bora villager wearing it and 
                        I said, “Craig, I just have to have 
                        that dress,” and we bought it off 
                        her back for just fifty French 
                        Pacific francs.

                                 CRAIG
                        What a steal! Later that night, we 
                        went snorkeling in a coral garden.

                                 RHONDA
                        But enough about our amazing 
                        honeymoon. We want to hear about

                        Remind me —— where is it you went 
                        again? Somewhere cold and dreary?

           Declan shakes his head.

                                 DECLAN
                        Oh, no. We went to the most 
                        beautiful place on Earth.

                                 RHONDA
                        That can’t be true. Bora Bora is 
                        the most beautiful place on Earth.

                                 DECLAN
                        We went somewhere more beautiful 
                        than Bora Bora. We went to a place 
                        like no other place on Earth. We 
                        went to a place where you can do 
                        anything you’ve ever dreamed of 
                        doing.

                        We rode camels through a desert and 
                        hot air balloons across the sky. We 
                        played capture the flag and saw a 
                        female moose.

                                 DECLAN
                        We visited sherpas, and built 
                        castles made of peonies and we 
                        danced and sang and ate every food 
                        we could think of.

                        you’ve tried the little sausages 
                        we’ve got going around.

                        Oh, yes! You must try the sausages. 
                        They were serving them in our hotel 
                        in Bora Bora and we said, “Oh my 
                        God, we just have to buy some of 
                        these sausages and serve them at

                        No, thank you, Rhonda. But I’m 
                        afraid I’ve already eaten 
                        everything there is to eat, and I’m 
                        very full. We ate an entire 
                        marriage in a single night. I 
                        couldn’t possibly imagine eating 
                        another bite.

           Declan and Delores share a smile.
           Rhonda and Craig share a look.

           JUST THEN ——
           POP POP POP!
           Fireworks BURST over the Feigenbaums’ roof.
           Strobing the lawn in red, white, and blue.

           Couples trot to the edge of the yard.
           Craning their necks to watch the display.

                        Fine by me. To Shazbor, then!

           Rhonda and Craig clink plastic cups of wine.
           Then turn to face the fireworks.

           Delores holds out her hand.
           Declan takes it.
           They crane their necks.
           And gaze into the evening sky.
