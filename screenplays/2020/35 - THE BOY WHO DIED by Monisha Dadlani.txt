                      EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DELACORTE THEATER - NIGHT

           A nostalgic melody echoes through the packed outdoor theater. 

           Captivated audience members sit huddled in blankets. 

           Upon closer look, we notice various attendees wear ROBES with 
           the same scholarly emblem sewn on. Most of their scarves and 
           hats feature one of four familiar color schemes. 

           Some guests even have temporary lightning bolt scars drawn on 
           their foreheads. 

           At the front, a large SCREEN hovers over the stage. The 
           skyline of New York City frames the featured movie. High 
           rises peak over the autumnal trees. 

           On the screen, we are welcomed back home as...

           Hogwarts Castle sweeps into view. 

           A BURST of applause rings through the theater as the eleven-
           year-old Harry Potter gazes at Hogwarts for the first time. 

                                 HARRY POTTER (O.S.)
                        Wow. 

           Amongst the gleeful audience is MYRA GUPTA (13) who proudly 
           adorns a Ravenclaw scarf over her Hogwarts wizarding cape. 
           She has the awkwardness of any average eighth-grader, but is 
           too comfortable in her dorky-ness to really notice. 

           Her genuine enthusiasm and awe matches that of the young boy 
           wizard. As his boat approaches the dark castle, Harry Potter 
           looks up, eyes wide as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT

           A packed indoor audience chatters away as the red velvet 
           curtain remains closed on this stage. 

           The lights start to dim as the excited chattering subsides. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           In the wings, an older DANIEL RADCLIFFE stares onto the 
           stage, waiting for his cue. 

           Yes...that Daniel Radcliffe. 
           Now 68, he still holds himself with a familiar youthful 
           energy and jovial confidence. He stares out at the darkness 
           until a spotlight starts to illuminate the center stage.

           His organized STAGE MANAGER (late 20s), great at her dream 
           job, approaches. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        House is closed. Places please. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Thank you, places. 

           Just before Daniel steps onto the stage, ERIN DARKE (72), 
           Daniel’s charming, headstrong actress-turned-director wife 
           gives him a peck on the cheek. 

                                 ERIN DARKE
                        Break a leg, Dan. And remember to 
                        pick--

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        --pick up the pace in the town hall 
                        scene. You got it. 

           Daniel winks at her before gliding effortlessly into the 
           spotlight. From the wings-

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Alright, we’re going on in 10, 9, 8-

           Daniel poses with his arms extended outward. He waits stoic 
           as the Stage Manager goes quiet and holds her hands up. She 
           continues counting down: 5...4...3...2...

           The curtain rises on Daniel alone on stage as we--

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DELACORTE THEATER - NIGHT

           Myra laughs giddily as she watches Neville Longbottom grab 
           his slimy toad in his hands. She stuffs popcorn into her 
           mouth then passes the bag to:

           EVA JOHNSON (13), Myra’s best friend who adorns a Hufflepuff 
           hoodie and wired glasses matching those of Luna Lovegood. 
           She’s a little chubby, but only thinks about it some days. 

           Eva then passes the popcorn to RIAD BAHAR (13), who sports an 
           emo haircut under a Slytherin beanie because unfortunate 
           fashion trends inevitably repeat themselves, especially in 
           middle school boys. 
           Myra’s eyes are glued to the screen as she slurps down warmed 
           butterbeer, but we notice Eva and Riad’s hands brush against 
           one another as they reach into the bag of popcorn. 

           Eva and Riad look at one another, coy. 

           On the screen, Harry Potter’s eyes grow wide as the Sorting 
           Hat is placed on his head while we--

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT

           The curtain rises on the present Daniel Radcliffe and before 
           he even does anything, the audience BURSTS into applause. 

           He doesn’t break character, but the corners of his lips can’t 
           help but tug upward. He waits for the applause to die down, 
           then starts tap, tap, tapping his foot, which cues the music. 

           As the orchestra starts up, Daniel twirls into an impressive 
           TAP ROUTINE, which launches us to:

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           - On stage, Daniel goes into a triple traveling time step.

           - Amongst their outdoor audience, Myra, Eva and Riad cheer 
           just like Hagrid in the stands as Harry Potter begins his 
           first Quidditch match.

           - Audience members in the Broadway theater lean forward in 
           their seats as Daniel does a double waltz clog time step. 

           - On the floating screen, Harry Potter flies through the air 
           on his Nimbus 2000. 

           - On stage, Daniel pauses. His breathing grows heavy while 
           his face goes red. The music continues on, and from the 
           sidelines, Erin furrows her eyebrows, concerned.

           - Myra’s mouth curves into a toothy smile as Harry Potter 
           stands on his broom, holding his arm out.

           - On stage, Daniel takes a moment to regain his breath, then 
           catches up with the music to prepare for the finale...

           - On screen, Harry Potter falls to the grass. After a beat, 
           he victoriously spits something out and...holds up the Golden 
           Snitch! The applause from the audience in the movie matches 
           that of the live audience in the outdoor theater. 
           - Daniel opens his arms wide in a similar victory as his 
           dance routine comes to an end. The audience cheers and 
           applauds, but we only hear echoes of fuzzy silence as their 
           famed hero abruptly COLLAPSES to the stage floor. 

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DELACORTE THEATER - NIGHT

           Credits roll down the screen as the audience starts to 
           collect their belongings. Myra stuffs her blue and bronze 
           blanket into her bag as Eva and Riad stand.

           On stage in front of the screen, the ANNOUNCER (late 50s); 
           has clearly been planning this event for way too long, holds 
           a microphone while the lights in the theater come up. 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Thank you for joining us for our 
                        60th anniversary screening of Harry 
                        Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. Or 
                        as they say across the pond-

           She goes into an awful British accent-

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        --Harry Potter and the 
                        Philosopher’s Stone. 

           A few forced chuckles as people continue cleaning up. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        We hope all you wizards and witches 
                        have a safe rest of your Halloween!

           Myra, Eva and Riad step out of the theater. 

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

           Daniel lays on a gurney as it’s rolled into a self-driving 
           ambulance. He takes deep, rapid breaths in an oxygen mask.

           A crowd of theater-goers and tourists snap photos as the 
           ambulance drives away. The sirens echo through Times Square.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

           Myra throws away the remnants of the popcorn into a trash 
           bin. The robotic green trash receptacle moves on its own as 
           it approaches various people with garbage in their hands. 
                                 MYRA
                        Riad, you’re obviously Ron. 

                                 EVA
                        Ron with a healthy hint of Draco. 

                                 MYRA
                        I just haven’t figured out yet if 
                        I’m Hermione or Harry. 

                                 RIAD
                        Eva’s got the hair for Hermione. 

           Riad ruffles Eva’s frizzy hair. She giggles before swatting 
           away his hand. Myra seems unfazed at this clear flirtation. 

                                 MYRA
                        But she’s also the only one of us 
                        that needs glasses. It’s actually 
                        kinda messed up when you think 
                        about it. I mean, Harry Potter’s so 
                        magical he can defeat the dark lord 
                        but he can’t fix his own eyesight? 

                                 EVA
                        Maybe he likes the glasses. 
                        Something to distract from his 
                        freaky scar.

                                 MYRA
                        Woah, I didn’t even think about that. 

           In the background, a few people hop on automated, driverless 
           golf cart-sized vehicles.

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Do you guys wanna sleep over 
                        tonight? My dad said it would be 
                        cool. We could binge the other 
                        movies.

           Eva and Riad glance at one another. The “it’s time” glance.

                                 RIAD
                        Actually...my mom’s gonna pick us 
                        up and drop Eva at home since she’s 
                        close. She’s already on her way. 

           An awkward beat of silence as Riad nudges Eva. 

                                 RIAD (CONT’D)
                        We also have something we need to 
                        tell you. Right, Eva?
           Myra looks between Riad and Eva as they hesitate to speak. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh no. Your tone is alarming. 
                        Should I be alarmed? I feel 
                        alarmed. Oh god, is one of you 
                        moving? Riad, you said your parents 
                        want a dog but wouldn’t get one 
                        unless they moved somewhere with a 
                        backyard. Does this mean you’re 
                        moving to...New Jersey? We can’t 
                        start spending time in New Jersey. 

                                 EVA
                        No, it’s nothing like that.

                                 RIAD
                        I’m not moving. Although my mom is 
                        considering getting a cat as a 
                        compromise. She knows it’s not the 
                        same, but some cats are dog-like. 

                                 MYRA
                        So what’s actually going on?

           Eva bites her lip and looks down at her feet. 

                                 EVA
                        We just...I mean, me and Riad...we-- 

                                 RIAD
                        We kissed. And have continued 
                        kissing.

                                 MYRA
                        Ha. Funny. Seriously, what’s up?

                                 RIAD
                        We are serious. 

           Eva finally looks up at Myra.

                                 EVA
                        We were studying for a trig test 
                        while you were away with your dad a 
                        few weekends ago. And then, I don’t 
                        know, it just sort of...happened. 

                                 MYRA
                        That was like a month ago. 
                                 EVA
                        We didn’t want to say anything 
                        because we thought it might make 
                        you uncomfortable. 

                                 MYRA
                        Um, it does make me uncomfortable. 
                        I’m highly uncomfortable right now. 

                                 EVA
                        Myra, I’m so sorry.

                                 RIAD
                        I’m not. 

           Riad hops on a park bench. Eva practically buries her head in 
           her Hufflepuff sweater. 

                                 RIAD (CONT’D)
                        I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BRILLIANT 
                        GIRL...no, this brilliant young 
                        woman, and I refuse to apologize 
                        for it. I’m in love and I want the 
                        world to know. 

           As the crowd disperses, a few turn their attention to him and 
           grin at the declaration of young love. Myra crosses her arms. 

                                 MYRA
                        Riad, stop being disgusting. You 
                        two are like siblings. This is 
                        totally incestuous and gross, and 
                        I’m honestly baffled neither of you 
                        see that.  

                                 RIAD
                        The heart wants what the heart 
                        wants.

           Riad jumps down from the bench and puts his arm around Eva’s 
           shoulders. Myra looks back and forth between the two. 

                                 MYRA
                        So does this mean I’m not allowed 
                        to hang out with you two anymore?

                                 EVA
                        Of course we’ll hang out. We’re all 
                        still friends. Riad and I just have 
                        a different kind of relationship 
                        now. 

           Riad’s phone buzzes. Its design is as thin as a credit card. 
                                 RIAD
                        My mom’s outside the park. 

                                 EVA
                        We could give you a ride home?

                                 MYRA
                        No, Eva, it would be inappropriate 
                        for Riad’s mom to give me a ride 
                        home since we’re not dating. I 
                        actually respect boundaries. 

           Myra’s eyes suddenly go wide. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Oh. My. God. This means you are 
                        Hermione. That makes me Harry. Ugh. 

                                 RIAD
                        What’s wrong with being Harry?

                                 MYRA
                        Harry’s the worst one!

                                 EVA
                        He’s the title character. The hero. 

                                 MYRA
                        All he does is bitch and whine for 
                        seven whole books. 

                                 RIAD
                        Well, right now that seems pretty 
                        on point given your reaction. 

           Off Myra’s offended look-

                                 EVA
                        Why don’t you take some time to 
                        process and we can talk before 
                        homeroom on Monday?

           Eva lets go of Riad’s hand then hugs Myra. 

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        You’re still my best friend, okay?

                                 RIAD
                        And mine too. 
                                 MYRA
                        Oh shut up, Riad. You were the 
                        third wheel this whole time since 
                        you randomly started hanging out 
                        with us at lunch and now you’ve 
                        pawned third-wheel status off on 
                        me. That’s such a shitty Ron move. 

           Before Riad comes up with a retort, Eva pulls him away. 

                                 EVA
                        We’ll talk on Monday. 

           Myra starts in the opposite direction. 

           As she walks through the park, she’s surrounded by the crowd 
           of audience members, but finds herself ultimately alone. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

           The window from the hospital room overlooks the East River. 

           High-tech drones buzz past. The buildings across the river 
           are designed with a mixture of large metallic windows, 
           autumnal trees, and bright vines wrapped around buildings 
           with solar panels on roofs. 

           A digital calendar on the wall reads: OCTOBER 31, 2057.

           Hospital beeping brings us back into the sterile room filled 
           with discomforting wires. Daniel lays in bed with an IV drip 
           connected to his arm. Then, a knocking at the door. 

           He turns his head to find DR. PRAVIT GUPTA (late 50s), always 
           attempting to give off cool dad vibes, sometimes succeeding, 
           but not often. He looks overwhelmingly tired as he enters. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Good evening, Mr. Radcliffe. I’m 
                        Dr. Gupta. I’m here to go through 
                        your test results with you.

           From outside the hospital room, a few NURSES pause to look 
           into the room. Daniel gives them a friendly wave, which 
           causes them to scatter away while Pravit closes the door. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that. We don’t get 
                        many...well, celebrities here. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Oh, it’s fine. They seem harmless. 
                        Believe it or not, the teenage 
                        girls are the most dangerous. Well, 
                        they used to be. Now I spend more 
                        time dodging grandmothers, which 
                        feels much less creepy and is 
                        surprisingly quite flattering. 

           Pravit chuckles at this. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        My teenage daughter is actually a 
                        big fan of yours. Of the series.

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Really? 

                                 PRAVIT
                        It’s my fault. I practically forced 
                        her to read Harry Potter instead of 
                        watching all that crap that’s out 
                        there now. It’s been a nice way for 
                        us to bond as she’s getting older. 

           Daniel gives Pravit a polite smile.  

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        My apologies, Mr. Radcliffe. I 
                        didn’t mean to make you 
                        uncomfortable by bringing it up.

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        No, not at all. I’m genuinely glad 
                        people are still enjoying it. I 
                        hope your daughter is. 

           Then, Pravit glances down at his tablet, suddenly serious-

                                 PRAVIT
                        So, Mr. Radcliffe--

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Be honest with me. No sugar 
                        coating. How bad is it?

           Pravit pauses at the foot of the bed as Daniel weakly lifts 
           himself to sit up straight. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You had a minor stroke. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Yes, that I am aware of. 
                                 PRAVIT
                        And you survived said minor stroke. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        That has been made apparent to me 
                        as well. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You are at a high risk of having 
                        another stroke. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Lovely. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        But I’m here because unfortunately 
                        that’s not our biggest concern. Mr. 
                        Radcliffe, I’m a rare disease 
                        specialist here. 

           Daniel senses the tonal shift in the room.

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I changed my mind. Let’s do the 
                        sugar-coating. 

           Pravit takes a deep breath, then projects an x-ray onto the 
           wall with the push of a button on his smart watch. 

           On the x-ray projection, various blue cells light up around 
           throughout the skeleton. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        I’m guessing those things aren’t 
                        supposed to be there. 

           He points to the illuminated blue cells. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        No. No they’re not. 

           Pravit pulls up a chair to the side of the bed and sits. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You’re sitting. That’s not good. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Those blue lights are mutated cells 
                        that are rapidly evolving inside 
                        your body. We only started seeing 
                        cases like this a few years ago. 
                        It’s called Kutain’s Disease. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I haven’t heard of it. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You probably wouldn’t have given 
                        its rarity. Globally, there have 
                        been less than a thousand cases. We 
                        don’t know how it starts yet, but 
                        we do know it spreads quickly and 
                        aggressively. There’s not really a 
                        proper way for me to sugar-coat 
                        this, Mr. Radcliffe. 

           Pravit takes a moment. Then-

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have a cure for this 
                        disease. Or a treatment.

           A beat of stunned silence. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Is that a royal we, or we as in 
                        just this specific hospital?

                                 PRAVIT
                        Royal we, I’m afraid. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Oh.

                                 PRAVIT
                        The best medical research teams 
                        have been working on trying to find 
                        a cure since the first case, but 
                        right now this is just one of those 
                        things that humanity hasn’t been 
                        able to overcome. I’m so sorry. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        An incurable disease. That’s--so 
                        how much...time do I have left?

                                 PRAVIT
                        It varies from patient to patient. 
                        But from personal experience--

           Pravit swallows back the lump in his throat. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        --probably not more than three 
                        months. 

           A beat of heavy silence as Daniel processes this news. 
                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        It’s just an estimate. Could be 
                        more time with the right care. It 
                        could also be less. Now, there are 
                        ways we can help mitigate any pain--

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I think I need to be alone right 
                        now if that’s alright. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Of course. I know this is a shock.

           Pravit stands. He presses another button on his watch and the 
           x-ray projected on the wall disappears. Before he exits-

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to be here with you every 
                        step of the way. I promise. We’ll 
                        take it one day at a time. 

           As Pravit turns away, his eyes well with tears. He quickly 
           blinks them away before stepping outside. 

           Daniel just turns his head to stare out the hospital window. 

           EXT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Myra clamors up the stoop stairs past a series of jack 
           o’lanterns. She passes a fake skeleton holding a now empty 
           bowl of candy for trick-or-treaters as she steps inside.

           INT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Myra enters the midtown brownstone apartment, letting the 
           door slam behind her. She taps a code on the keypad next to 
           it, and we hear the door lock.

           As she heads inside, she hears SOBBING. She turns the corner 
           to find Pravit sitting in his armchair, crying. 

           Myra makes a move to go upstairs to give him privacy, but 
           then rethinks it and goes over to a nearby bookshelf. 

           Next to the collection of well-worn Harry Potter books (the 
           original kind that were bought at Barnes & Noble midnight 
           release parties) is a series of photos. 

           In one, a pre-teen Myra sits in between her father, Pravit, 
           and mother, ANNA GUPTA (late 30s) with a soft smile and 
           bright eyes that match Myra’s. 
           In another, older Halloween photo, Anna is dressed as Albus 
           Dumbledore carrying a baby Myra dressed as Harry Potter. Next 
           to this photo is a jar of tiny, colorful ORIGAMI CRANES. Myra 
           grabs the stack of paper and pens sitting next to the jar. 

                                 MYRA
                        Do you want to write her a note?

           Pravit quickly wipes away his tears upon hearing Myra. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I thought you didn’t like the note 
                        writing. 

                                 MYRA
                        Occasionally it helps when I miss 
                        her. I know you don’t like talking 
                        about it, so it might help you too. 

           Myra sits down on the fluffy carpet next to his chair. Pravit 
           sniffs away any tears as his daughter stares up at him. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You don’t have to worry about me. 
                        I’m fine, kiddo. I just...I found 
                        out I’m losing a patient. And this 
                        one happens to be an...old friend 
                        of sorts. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh. I’m sorry, dad. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        It’s alright, Myra. Just the cycle 
                        of life. Part of the job. 

           He looks around. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Where are Eva and Riad? I thought 
                        they were sleeping over tonight?

                                 MYRA
                        They, uh--it got late and Riad’s 
                        mom offered to pick them up, so...

           Myra looks down at the papers in her hands. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I’m actually gonna head to bed. 
                        Goodnight, dad. I love you. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I love you too, Myra. 
           Before leaving, Myra puts a piece of paper in his hands.  

                                 MYRA
                        It still might help. 

           She kisses his cheek, then goes upstairs. As soon as he hears 
           her door close, Pravit’s tears start again. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           As soon as Myra enters the room, the lights automatically 
           turn on. The walls are midnight blue and galaxy purple with 
           realistic projections of constellations on the ceiling. 

           A telescope sits near the window, looking out at the actual 
           stars. Shelves are lined with books by Carl Sagan, Mary 
           Roach, and Stephen Hawking...the library of a curious young 
           scientist in the making. 

           Myra flops on her bed, then takes a pen and bronze-colored 
           piece of origami paper and starts writing-

                                 MYRA (V.O.)
                        Sup, Mom. What’s up?

           She pauses for a beat, then continues. 

                                 MYRA (V.O.)
                        So uh, today’s inquisitive inquiry 
                        for you is...how do you actually 
                        know if you’re in love? To clarify, 
                        I’m not talking about platonic, 
                        friend love. I’m talking about 
                        being in love. How do you know when 
                        the “in” part happens?

           Myra pauses. 

                                 MYRA (V.O.)
                        Oh, also this totally isn’t about 
                        me. So don’t get all excited about 
                        your daughter being in love for the 
                        first time. Obesely fat chance of 
                        that happening any time soon. 

           A beat.

                                 MYRA (V.O.)
                        My two best friends have decided 
                        they are in love with each other, 
                        which means I’m on my own. Again. 
                        So how long does being in love 
                        last? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MYRA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Am I going to have to find new 
                        friends so I don’t start high 
                        school as the half-orphaned loser?

           She stops, then folds the bronze paper into an origami crane. 

                                 MYRA
                        I always feel so stupid writing on 
                        these things. You know, some answers 
                        would actually be nice for once. 

           She stares at the crane as if waiting for a response. When 
           there isn’t one, she goes to her closet. 

           Once she opens it, we find a human-like, human-sized ROBOT. 

           It looks like a human skeleton with a smooth, silver frame 
           for skin. Its head has some generic human features (eyes, 
           nose, mouth, ears, etc.), but does not yet look specifically 
           like anyone in particular. Just an empty, robotic vessel.

           As she brings the robot out of the closet and onto her bed, 
           her bronze paper crane falls to the closet floor. 

           Myra goes to her “computer,” which is just a projection on 
           her wall with a projected keyboard on her desk. With the 
           tapping of a few buttons, the Robot’s eyes OPEN. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, buddy. 

           She types into her computer: “say: Hello Myra”.

                                 ROBOT
                        Hello, Myra. 

           It speaks like...well like a robot. Devoid of inflection. 

                                 MYRA
                        Tell me, what would you do if your 
                        best friends betrayed you by being 
                        delusional enough to think they’re 
                        in love, thereby abandoning you?

           The Robot just stares at her. 

           Then Myra types into her computer: “the science of love.”

           A few research articles pop up. Myra copies and pastes some 
           text, then turns back to her Robot. 

                                 ROBOT
                        “Each component of love is driven 
                        by a mixture of brain chemicals.

                                 ROBOT (CONT'D)
                        Lust stems from estrogen and 
                        testosterone-”

                                 MYRA
                        Ugh, gross, shut up. Never mind. 

           Myra deletes the rest of the copied text from her computer. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Myra lays on her bed with Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
           Secrets playing via projection on the wall. 

           Her Robot sits in bed next to her while she eats ice cream.

                                 MYRA
                        I guess Harry’s not so bad. He’s 
                        just kinda lonely sometimes. 
                        Historically, being the chosen one 
                        tends to do that. 

           After a beat, Myra chuckles at a funny moment in the film. 
           She reaches over and types something into her computer, then-

                                 ROBOT
                        Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. 

           The emotionless laughter is super creepy. Myra grimaces. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Daniel lays in his hospital bed awake, unable to sleep. In 
           the corner, Erin sleeps in a reclining chair, twisted in an 
           awkward position. Her blanket has fallen off her shoulders. 

           From the hallway, Daniel sees various NURSES and DOCTORS walk 
           by. As they pass his room, they can’t help but look in and 
           sadly shake their heads, some of them whispering. 

           A frustrated Daniel manages to get up and close the curtain 
           to his bed. Upon seeing this, a NURSE (40s) walks in. 

                                 NURSE
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Radcliffe, but we 
                        need to keep the curtain open. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Is it possible to 
                        close the door then?
                                 NURSE
                        We need to keep it open for your 
                        safety. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Ah, safety, yes, my number one 
                        priority right now.

           A beat as the Nurse’s kind smile falters. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean to be rude. I 
                        understand. Thank you. 

           The Nurse’s smile returns before she walks away. As Daniel 
           turns around-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        No privacy, even in death.

           Before going to his bed, he stops by the chair in the corner 
           and lifts Erin’s fallen blanket so it covers her shoulders. 

           Daniel climbs back into bed. As he looks at Erin sleeping, he 
           can’t stop his face from twisting into tears. He turns his 
           head so if she wakes up, she won’t see, but then his eyes 
           meet the gaggle of curious onlookers in the hallway. 

           Quickly, Daniel pulls up his blanket, sobs wracking his body 
           that he desperately tries to keep quiet and to himself. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 

           Daniel now wears his regular clothes as he puts his socks on. 
           RACHEL (mid 20s), a by-the-textbook hospital mandated 
           therapist sits across from him. 

                                 RACHEL
                        When you start to experience sharp 
                        chest pains or see any blood when 
                        you cough, let us know.

           Erin stares out the window as Rachel continues. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        You most likely won’t notice any 
                        side effects immediately, so if 
                        there’s anything you wanted to do-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I should do it now before my body 
                        starts shutting itself down.
           Erin wipes away some tears by the window while Daniel 
           finishes putting his shoes on. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Dr. Gupta can help with the 
                        physical pain. I’m here to help 
                        with the emotional pain. Please 
                        don’t hesitate to contact us if you 
                        need anything at all. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        A cure would be nice. 

           Off Rachel’s awkward silence-

                                 ERIN
                        He’s joking. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        No I wasn’t. A cure would actually 
                        be really nice. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Dr. Gupta is the most qualified 
                        doctor for this. Especially with 
                        his wife and all. 

                                 ERIN
                        Is his wife a doctor here as well?

                                 RACHEL
                        No, she--I assumed Dr. Gupta would 
                        have told you. I’m sorry, it’s not 
                        my place to...I shouldn’t have-

                                 ERIN
                        What happened to his wife?

           A beat. 

                                 RACHEL
                        His wife passed away from Kutain’s 
                        Disease two years ago. 

           Daniel and Erin share a glance. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t talk about it much 
                        anymore, but trust me, he’ll be 
                        doing everything in his ability to 
                        make sure you’re taken care of. We 
                        all will be, Mr. Radcliffe. You 
                        mean a lot to a lot of people. 
           As Rachel stands, she gives him a soft smile, then leaves.

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HOMEROOM - MORNING

           Students mingle about as Myra sits in the far back corner. 

           Eva and Riad walk into the room, holding hands. Myra 
           literally rolls her eyes and slumps at her desk.

                                 MYRA
                        I see that’s still happening. 

           Eva decides to ignore the statement. 

                                 EVA
                        Did you hear about Daniel 
                        Radcliffe? 

           Eva takes out her tablet and pulls up an article. Myra leans 
           forward, past pettiness momentarily forgotten. 

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        Apparently he collapsed on stage 
                        mid-performance. 

           On the tablet is a paparazzi photo of Daniel Radcliffe with 
           dulled skin and sunken eyes. He steps out of the hospital 
           with Erin holding tightly onto him. 

                                 MYRA
                        Wait, that’s my dad’s hospital. 

           Next to them, BURKE (13), an annoying classmate leans over. 

                                 BURKE
                        Who’s Daniel Radcliffe?

                                 MYRA
                        Are you joking? 

                                 EVA
                        Let me guess, you also don’t know 
                        who Beyoncè is. 

                                 BURKE
                        I don’t know who Beyoncè is. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh my god, Burke. Educate yourself. 
                        Read a book. Or at least watch old 
                        YouTube videos or something. 
                                 BURKE
                        What’s YouTube?

                                 MYRA
                        A vital part of history. 

                                 BURKE
                        Whatever. 

           Burke turns around and focuses back on his own tablet. Eva, 
           Riad, and Myra shake their heads at him. 

                                 RIAD
                        Burke is such a moron. 

                                 MYRA
                        You’re such a moron. 

           Yeah, great burn, Myra. 

           Just as Riad’s about to retort, the TEACHER (30s) enters the 
           classroom. All the students scramble to their seats. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY 

           In the middle of the bustling cafeteria, Eva and Riad sit 
           together at a table. They both split each other’s lunches and 
           look perfectly happy it just being the two of them. 

           Myra lingers by the doorway as she looks at her friends. 
           Instead of going to sit next to them, she turns around. 

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - ROOF - DAY 

           Myra sneaks up to the isolated roof and takes out her lunch. 
           She starts eating alone, staring out at the vastness of the 
           cityscape in front of her. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON 

           On the front smartboard is written: STEM CLUB MEETING. Myra 
           sits by herself at a table and opens her tablet. She pulls up 
           the elaborate coding and designs for her Robot.

           At the front of the room, MS. HENDERSON (20s), a teacher who 
           still believes she can change the world, enters. 

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        Alright, we have one more month to 
                        prepare for the citywide science 
                        fair. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MS. HENDERSON (CONT'D)
                        Today, I’m going to give everyone 
                        some time for independent work. 
                        Sound good?

           Myra goes back to her tablet when SEBASTIAN (13) approaches. 
           He has dyed purple hair and aside from his slight lisp, can 
           be surprisingly charming when spoken to.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        How’s your robot doing? 

                                 MYRA
                        Just finished installing a voice 
                        box. I’m headed to the store later 
                        to start accessorizing. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        No-ice. My brother and I tried to 
                        build a baby robot shark together 
                        last year. My mom flipped that it 
                        might bite off an arm or something. 
                        We couldn’t get it to work anyway, 
                        so we just donated the body parts. 

                                 MYRA
                        Bummer. How’s your solar 
                        desalinator going?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh, I’m not doing that anymore. 
                        Instead I’m building a volcano. 

                                 MYRA
                        A volcano? Really?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Yeah. 

           A beat of silence. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MYRA
                        Nothing. It’s just--I mean a volcano 
                        is kinda basic, don’t you think?

           Sebastian shuffles his feet, suddenly self-conscious. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I meant, it could potentially be 
                        basic. But yours won’t be. Yours 
                        will probably be epic. Super epic.
           As Ms. Henderson makes her rounds, she approaches Myra’s 
           table. Sebastian, with his reddened face, scurries away. Ms. 
           Henderson looks down at Myra’s tablet. 

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        I have to say Myra, I am so proud 
                        of you deciding to take on such a 
                        challenging project. This is 
                        college-level, even if it’s just 
                        basic motor functions.  

                                 MYRA
                        Thanks, Ms. Henderson, but I’ve 
                        actually decided to move past just 
                        motor functions and give her a 
                        personality. 

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        Oh, how exciting! What kind of 
                        personality are you thinking? 

                                 MYRA
                        I’m going to make the robot my mom. 

           A beat as Ms. Henderson hesitates to figure out a response.

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        Why don’t you come up with a list 
                        of other potential candidates? 
                        Perhaps a historical figure? You 
                        know, Justin Bieber was quite a 
                        catch when he was younger. 

                                 MYRA
                        The Canadian guy with the barracuda 
                        face tattoo? 

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        Or how about Alexandria Ocasio-
                        Cortez? First female president. 

                                 MYRA
                        I think I’m gonna stick with mama 
                        Gupta, but thanks Ms. Henderson. 

           Across the room, Sebastian’s experiment starts bubbling over. 
           Ms. Henderson shakes her head and sighs.

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        I told Sebastian a volcano was a 
                        bad idea, but he insisted. 

           While she grabs a towel, Myra focuses back on her tablet. 
           Across the room, Ms. Henderson looks back at Myra, concerned. 
           INT. DANIEL RADCLIFFE’S DRESSING ROOM - EVENING

           Daniel does vocal warmups as he prepares for tonight’s 
           performance. Erin sits on the couch, watching him. 

                                 ERIN
                        Dan, I don’t think you should go on 
                        anymore. It’s too risky. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        They said there wouldn’t be any 
                        immediate side effects. 

                                 ERIN
                        You had a stroke two nights ago. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        A minor stroke. I feel fine. 

                                 ERIN
                        But you’re not fine. 

           Daniel pauses from his warm up. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Erin, I can’t just...wait. 

                                 ERIN
                        Maybe we should see another doctor. 
                        Get a second opinion. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I trust Dr. Gupta. And if his wife-

                                 ERIN
                        His wife died. That’s not very 
                        reassuring if you ask me. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Everyone who’s had this disease has 
                        died. 

                                 ERIN
                        He’s a doctor not a god, Dan. He 
                        could have misinterpreted something 
                        in your scans. Another doctor might-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I don’t want to waste time bouncing 
                        from doctor to doctor. Being on 
                        stage makes things feel at least 
                        somewhat normal right now. Two 
                        hours of normalcy is a blessing. 
                                 ERIN
                        For you. For me it’s completely 
                        nerve-wracking. What if something 
                        happens?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Something’s going to happen anyway. 

           Erin stands up. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m not letting you do this. I’m 
                        calling in the understudy. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You can’t do that. 

                                 ERIN
                        Yes I can. I’m the director. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        And are you making this decision as 
                        the director or as my wife? 

                                 ERIN
                        Both. When you collapsed mid-
                        performance, we had to stop the 
                        show. We had to refund the audience 
                        their ticke--

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        We both know what the audience paid 
                        to see.  

           Daniel pauses as Erin crosses her arms. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not trying to be immodest, but 
                        you and I both know when we decided 
                        to do this show together, we went 
                        into it knowing this story was 
                        important to us. We knew I’d be 
                        able to fill seats so people would 
                        hear it. And we knew watching me 
                        frolic and dance around that stage 
                        like a geriatric lunatic would make 
                        audiences laugh. It would make them 
                        happy. Please Erin. Let me do this 
                        while I still can. 

           Before Erin responds, the Stage Manager steps into the room. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Ten minutes to places. 
           Daniel turns back to Erin for permission. She finally nods. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Thank you, ten. 

           Erin watches as Daniel follows the Stage Manager out of the 
           dressing room. 

           INT. ROBOT STORE - EVENING

           Myra enters a small hole-in-the-wall store nestled between a 
           dumpling restaurant and boutique hat shop in SoHo. 

           The tiny shop has various ROBOTIC DESIGNS on the walls. There 
           are hundreds of them in small screens acting as a catalogue.

           At the back of the shop is a counter. The store owner, 
           CANDACE (mid 80s) wears spectacles and meticulously paints 
           nails on a hand...not her hand...a detached robot’s hand. 

                                 MYRA
                        I’m here to pick up some eyes. 

                                 CANDACE
                        Name?

                                 MYRA
                        Myra Gupta. I sent over this photo-

           Myra pulls up a photo of her late mother on her tablet. 

                                 CANDACE
                        Ah, yes. Is that your mother?

           She changes her glasses and riffles through her desk. 

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, she’s...it’s for a science 
                        fair project. 

           Candace takes out a small box filled with two replica EYES. 
           She looks at Myra and smiles. 

                                 CANDACE
                        You two have the same eyes. 

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, I get that a lot. 

                                 CANDACE
                        The eyes will let you activate the 
                        mimicking function so it can start 
                        to mirror human behavior. 
           Myra’s eyes are focused back on her tablet with her codes 
           pulled up. Candace purses her lips. 

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        But it’s not all technical designs 
                        and coding, understand? We aren’t 
                        just body parts thrown together. It 
                        needs to interact with humans to 
                        learn from them if you want to do 
                        it properly. 

                                 MYRA
                        Human interactions. Got it. 

           Candace places the eyes in a contact lens-type container. 
           Myra can hardly keep the excited smile off her face. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING 

           Myra projects old videos of her mom, Anna, on the living room 
           wall. Instead of grainy VHS tapes, these “old” videos are 
           Instagram stories, Tik Toks, and Snapchat clips. 

           The Robot stands in the middle of the living room as Myra 
           replaces the generic eyes with the new custom ones. 

                                 MYRA
                        Let’s see how effective these 
                        really are. 

           The Robot’s new eyes dilate with activation. 

           Myra taps a few buttons on her tablet, then starts a video of 
           her mom on the screen. Before the training officially begins, 
           the front doorbell RINGS. From upstairs-

                                 PRAVIT (O.S.)
                        That’s our dinner! Myra, can you 
                        get it?

           Myra shuts off the projection. The Robot keeps staring at the 
           now blank wall. Once Myra opens the door, there’s a drone 
           carrying the takeout order. She grabs the bag of food.

           INT. GUPTA DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Myra and Pravit sit across from one another, slurping noodles 
           out of their bowls with chopsticks. 

           The Robot sits next to Myra while Pravit sits at the head of 
           the table. The Robot mimics using chopsticks and “eats” out 
           of an empty bowl. Pravit looks at the Robot, then to Myra. 
                                 PRAVIT
                        So is he going to be joining us 
                        every night for dinner now?

                                 MYRA
                        She is learning how to be human. 
                        It’s important for her to pick up 
                        our human movements and mannerisms. 

           Pravit looks at the Robot’s eyes. He tilts his head. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Are those new eyes?

                                 MYRA
                        Before you say anything, you told 
                        me I could use my birthday money 
                        for whatever I wanted. 

           Pravit puts down his eating utensils. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Myra, there’s something we need to 
                        talk about. 

                                 MYRA
                        I know. I was waiting for this. 

           Myra puts down her eating utensils as well. Takes a breath.

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        You met Daniel Radcliffe at the 
                        hospital this weekend and you 
                        decided not to share that precious 
                        information with me. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        How do you know about that?

                                 MYRA
                        It’s all over the internet. I’m 
                        assuming he’s okay, right? 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Myra, that information is 
                        confidential. 

           Myra’s eyes widen.

                                 MYRA
                        So you did meet Daniel Radcliffe. 
                        Oh my god, what’s wrong with him?
                                 PRAVIT
                        No, it’s...it’s a big hospital, of 
                        course I didn’t meet him. I don’t 
                        know anything about his condition. 

                                 MYRA
                        Well, that’s highly disappointing. 

           Myra resumes slurping on her noodles. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Ms. Henderson called me today. Is 
                        it true you’re designing this robot 
                        to look like your mom?

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, so what?

                                 PRAVIT
                        You know what. 

                                 MYRA
                        The better I know the person I’m 
                        building, the more realistic it 
                        will be. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You can’t build this robot to be 
                        your mom, kiddo. I know you still 
                        want to...communicate with her, but-

                                 MYRA
                        I’m sick and tired of writing on 
                        those stupid origami cranes as a 
                        form of bullshit therapy.

                                 PRAVIT
                        You said they were helpful. 

                                 MYRA
                        I only said that because you were 
                        upset!

           Pravit’s face falls. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Rachel suggested them.

                                 MYRA
                        Talking to your hospital’s 
                        therapist was literally the least 
                        helpful thing in the world. 
                                 PRAVIT
                        And I respected that. I didn’t make 
                        you see her anymore. But you need a 
                        healthy way of expressing yourself. 

                                 MYRA
                        I’m focusing on my scientific 
                        pursuits. What’s healthier than 
                        that? Making her look like mom is 
                        just me trying be scientifically 
                        accurate. And I know this is 
                        advanced robotics for my age, but I 
                        need to do this now before I start 
                        forgetting her. 

           The Robot continues mirroring Myra’s hand movements. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Oh, Myra, you’re not going to 
                        forget her. Every time I look at 
                        you, I see her in you. You will 
                        always keep her memory alive. I 
                        miss her too, but this isn’t going 
                        to bring her back. 

           Tears start to well in Myra’s eyes. The Robot almost 
           looks...confused as to how to mirror this action. 

                                 MYRA
                        I’m not trying to bring her back, 
                        I’m just trying to build a fucking 
                        robot so I can have someone to 
                        actually talk to for real. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Language. And you have me to talk 
                        to. You have Eva and Riad, and-- 

                                 MYRA
                        Eva and Riad don’t care about me. 

           Myra abruptly stands up from the table. The Robot follows. 
           Its chair topples over, but the Robot pays it no attention. 

           Pravit jumps as Myra SLAMS her door shut upstairs. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Myra sniffs back tears as she sits at her desk, adjusting 
           some coding to the Robot. Pravit knocks at her door. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Can I come in?
           He takes Myra’s lack of response as approval. He steps in and 
           toys with a few old composition notebooks in his hands. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t have many friends when I 
                        was your age. Just took me a while 
                        to open up, I guess. 

           He leans against the doorframe. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        You might think it’s dumb and lame 
                        given that you’re way cooler and 
                        probably smarter than I ever was. 
                        But when I was in middle school, I 
                        started drawing. Specifically, I 
                        started drawing fanart. 

                                 MYRA
                        Fanart?

           Myra’s interest is finally piqued as she looks up at him. 
           Pravit hands her the notebooks. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I started making comics. Just 
                        doodles, really. And since, as you 
                        know, I was really into Harry 
                        Potter, it became a pretty 
                        cathartic way to feel less alone. 

           We see on the page as Myra flips through, comics featuring 
           Harry, Hermione and Ron going on fan-fueled adventures. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        I’m not showing you this so you 
                        know how much of a loser your old 
                        man was, but just so you know there 
                        are other ways to...not be alone. 

           Myra continues looking through the pages as Pravit starts out 
           of the room. He lingers by the doorframe. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        I can’t make you do anything. It 
                        took me a while to come to terms 
                        that you’ve become your own 
                        independent person. Your own 
                        amazing person. No more diaper 
                        changing anymore. 

                                 MYRA
                        Dad, ew. 
           Pravit chuckles at Myra’s disgusted face. A beat. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Myra, I don’t know if I’m going to 
                        be able to cope with a robotic 
                        version of your mom walking around. 
                        Just...consider that. 

           Before he steps out of the room, Pravit looks back at the 
           notebooks. He steps back in. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        On second thought, actually maybe 
                        don’t read that one.

           He grabs the one of the notebooks, then closes the door. Myra 
           stares at the comics, then looks at her Robot.

           INT. DANIEL RADCLIFFE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Daniel wipes some post-show sweat off his face as he enters 
           his dressing room. Erin stands there, waiting patiently. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        See? Good as ever. 

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t know, Dan...the pacing was 
                        still slow in the town hall scene. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Damnit. 

                                 ERIN
                        Guess you’ll just have to pick up 
                        the pace tomorrow night. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Yeah, I guess so. 

           Daniel and Erin share a smile. 

           INT. ROBOT STORE - NEXT DAY 

           Myra places the contact lens container filled with her 
           replica eyes on the store desk. Candace arches an eyebrow.  

                                 MYRA
                        I’ve decided to alter who the robot 
                        will be. 

           Candace sighs as she opens the contact lens case. 
                                 CANDACE
                        You dear, are lucky you have nice 
                        eyes. I don’t always accept 
                        returns. 

           She puts the lens case in a cabinet labeled “MISC. EYES”.

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        So what do you have for me?

           Myra pulls up a screenshot of Harry Potter from the Goblet of 
           Fire on her tablet. Candace’s surprised eyes light up. 

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        You know who this is?

                                 MYRA
                        Of course. It’s Harry Potter, duh. 

                                 CANDACE
                        I didn’t know kids still watched 
                        those movies. 

                                 MYRA
                        Not a kid, I’m in middle school. On 
                        the cusp of high school. 
                        Practically an adult. And I’ve read 
                        all the books. Twice in fact. 

           Candace scoffs at Myra’s nerd pride. 

                                 CANDACE
                        Ha. I’ve read them at least a dozen 
                        times at this point. Each. 

           She smiles. 

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        So you want to build a Harry Potter 
                        robot?

                                 MYRA
                        Precisely. 

           Candace giddily inspects Myra’s tablet featuring the Goblet 
           of Fire image of Harry. Then shakes her head. 

                                 CANDACE
                        No, no, no. We absolutely cannot 
                        use that as a basis. 

           Myra’s face falls. 
                                 MYRA
                        Why not? Copyright infringement? 
                        It’s just a science fair. There 
                        aren’t even any participation 
                        trophies anymore. Our school thinks 
                        it falsely inflates students’ egos.

                                 CANDACE
                        Goblet of Fire Harry? Are you 
                        kidding me? His hair is atrocious 
                        in that movie. He looks best in the 
                        Half-Blood Prince. 

           Candace scurries off into the backroom. We hear a few 
           clinging and clanging sounds until finally-

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        There we are. 

           She places an old, framed poster of Harry Potter and the Half-
           Blood Prince on the counter. Points to the image of Harry. 

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        Now, for the eyes. You know Harry’s 
                        eyes in the book are-

                                 MYRA
                        Green. Yes. I know. What time do 
                        you think it is? Amateur hour? 

                                 CANDACE
                        So are we using Daniel Radcliffe’s 
                        eyes or making new eyes based on 
                        the books?

           Myra takes a moment to think. 

                                 MYRA
                        I don’t think you can really have 
                        Harry Potter without Daniel 
                        Radcliffe. 

                                 CANDACE
                        Blue eyes it is then. 

           Myra smiles as she pulls up her tablet and gets to work.

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT

           Daniel expertly taps his way across the stage. The audience 
           looks on with joy as he belts his heart out: 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                                  (SINGING)
                        --look at me noooooow!

           Once the routine ends, the music crescendos to a resonate 
           halt and the curtain closes on a smiling Daniel. 

           The audience leaps out of their seats as the curtain rises 
           and the cast takes their bows with Daniel at the front. 

           As soon as the curtain hides him from the audience, Daniel 
           leans on one of his cast members, who helps him to a chair. 

           Erin rushes over to him while the cast gives them space. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I’m fine. Just need to sit down. 

                                 ERIN
                        Dan, you need to ask yourself who 
                        you’re really doing this for now. 
                        Because I think it might be 
                        shortening your time. Our time.

           With the eyes of the cast and crew on him, Daniel forces 
           himself to stand back up, shaking his head. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        What else am I supposed to do?

           He musters the strength to walk gracefully to his dressing 
           room, but we see his jaw clench in pain. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY 

           Riad and Eva sit at their table, looking around for Myra. 

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - ROOF - DAY 

           Myra munches on her lunch on the isolated roof while fully 
           ingrained in the new designs for her robot on her tablet. 

           INT. MYRA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Myra takes out a contact lens case revealing two blue eyes. 
           She delicately places the eyes into her Robot’s head. 

           It blinks. Then, the eyes dilate with activation. 

                                 MYRA
                        Boo-yah!
           Boo-yah will make its way back in 2057, trust me. 

           Myra steps back and we find the previously lifeless Robot now 
           looks completely IDENTICAL to the teenage Harry Potter, 
           lightning bolt scar, round glasses and all. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Harry. Welcome to the world. 
                        Well, muggle world at least. 

           She places her wizarding robe around his shoulders. 

           With a few new codes she taps onto her tablet...

           ...HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT smiles back. 

           Myra then projects Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone on 
           her bedroom wall. Her fingers quickly tap a few codes across 
           her tablet. Then--

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Activate “facial recognition.” 

           On the tablet, various screenshots of Harry Potter in 
           different scenes. Harry Potter the Robot focuses its eyes. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Activate “mimic behavior.” 

           Harry Potter’s face from each of these screenshots is 
           targeted (almost like when a photo is tagged on social 
           media). We see Harry Potter the Robot’s eyes CLICK in 
           recognition. Myra starts playing the movie. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Alrighty then, we’re gonna start 
                        from the beginning so you can 
                        organically grow with the 
                        character.

           As soon as the young Harry Potter pops onto the screen for 
           the first time, our Harry Potter Robot starts mirroring his 
           movements PRECISELY. 

           INT. DANIEL RADCLIFFE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Daniel goes through his pre-show vocal warmups. He’s raspy. 
           He then starts coughing, and clutches his throat. 

           He coughs into a nearby wastebasket. There’s blood.

           Then, a knock. Erin pokes her head in. 
                                 ERIN
                        You sure you want to go on tonight? 

           Daniel quickly wipes away any blood remnants and pushes the 
           bloody wastebasket under the makeup table, out of sight. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Of course. 

           He pecks Erin’s cheek as he steps past her. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL HOMEROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Eva and Riad sit next to each other in the middle of the 
           classroom when Myra bursts in. To their surprise, Myra plants 
           herself down right in front of them. 

                                 MYRA
                        Let’s go ice skating tonight.

                                 EVA
                        Seriously? Sure, yeah! 

           Myra turns her attention to the front of the classroom, 
           smirking while Eva and Riad smile at Myra’s sudden enthusiasm. 

           EXT. BRYANT PARK ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

           Ice skaters twirl around the rink as Myra puts a modern hat 
           and coat around Harry Potter the Robot. He blinks, taking in 
           his surroundings. Riad and Eva slowly walk over to them. 

                                 EVA
                        Uh...hi?

                                 MYRA
                        Guys, I’d like you to meet my new 
                        friend, Harry. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Hello, I am Harry James Potter. 

           His voice isn’t quite humanlike yet, still lacking proper 
           emotional inflection. Eva and Riad eye him skeptically. 

                                 MYRA
                        His hat covers his scar. Didn’t 
                        want the crowd to flock to him. You 
                        know how it is, right, buddy?

           She nudges him jokingly, but he just stares ahead. 
                                 RIAD
                        Wait, is that your robo-

                                 MYRA
                        Uh, Harry, why don’t you start 
                        skating? We’ll join you in a sec. 

           Without any thought, Harry Potter the Robot gets onto the 
           rink. Myra turns back to Riad. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I’m trying not to use the “r” word 
                        around him. Can’t expect him to act 
                        like a human if we don’t treat him 
                        like one. Well...like a wizard. 

           On the ice, Harry Potter the Robot does a triple axel. 

                                 EVA
                        Woah. How did he learn to do that?

                                 MYRA
                        Just because he lived in a closet 
                        under the stairs doesn’t mean he 
                        doesn’t know how to ice skate. 

                                 EVA
                        The robot lived under the stairs?

                                 MYRA
                        No, Harry did. Duh. 

                                 RIAD
                        Right, but how does the robot know 
                        how to skate?

                                 MYRA
                        Harry learns by mimicking human 
                        behavior. I just showed him a bunch 
                        of Olympic skating videos. 

           Myra smiles at her two friends. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        So what do you guys think?

                                 EVA
                        You definitely have a good chance 
                        at winning the science fair. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh, I don’t really care about that. 
                        What do you think about Harry?
           On the ice, Harry Potter the Robot finishes his programmed 
           ice skating routine. He now just skates around, neutral like 
           a video game character waiting for his next direction. 

           A few skaters eye his blank stare wearily. Especially children.

                                 RIAD
                        He’s kinda creepy. 

                                 MYRA
                        Well, he’s still learning. He just 
                        started coming up with his own 
                        responses, and he’s slowly picking 
                        up social cues. The four of us 
                        should totally keep hanging out 
                        like this.  

                                 EVA
                        Sure, yeah, but first maybe the 
                        three of us could hang out more?

                                 MYRA
                        Why couldn’t Harry come along?

                                 RIAD
                        Because he’s not real. 

                                 MYRA
                        Sure he is. 

                                 EVA
                        Myra, we’re so supportive of you 
                        doing this for the science fair. I 
                        mean a Harry Potter Robot? Awesome! 

                                 RIAD
                        Yeah, people are gonna flip. 

                                 EVA
                        But it honestly feels kind of...

           As Harry Potter the Robot continues skating in circles, he 
           makes direct eye contact with Eva. He doesn’t blink. 

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        ...weird to hang out with him like 
                        he’s a friend. 

                                 MYRA
                        Well I think it’s kind of weird for 
                        me to hang out with you two as a 
                        friend now that you left me behind. 
                                 EVA
                        We didn’t leave you behind. 

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, you did. You two are always 
                        giggling together in class over 
                        some inside joke I know nothing 
                        about. You’re always holding hands 
                        and sharing each other’s food. 

                                 EVA
                        Is that why you don’t eat lunch 
                        with us anymore? 

                                 MYRA
                        I don’t each lunch with you because 
                        I’m busy working on him!

           Myra points to Harry Potter the Robot, who is now repeatedly 
           skating into the rink barrier. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        He’s actually there for me unlike 
                        you two. He’s a good listener. 

                                 RIAD
                        He’s a robot. 

                                 MYRA
                        Stop saying that like it’s a bad 
                        thing. 

           Meanwhile, Harry Potter the Robot tumbles over on the ice 
           rink. He just lays there. 

                                 EVA
                        You’re not being fair to us, Myra. 
                        We want to keep hanging out with 
                        you, but you’re acting so 
                        unsupportive. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh, I’m the unsupportive one? I 
                        think it’s actually best if you two 
                        leave. Harry’s in the early 
                        developmental phase, so I don’t want 
                        him to start acting like you guys 
                        and become a shitty friend. 

           At this point, skaters have started just going around Harry 
           Potter the Robot, who still just lays there. 
                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Now, excuse me. I have to go make 
                        sure no melted ice gets into his 
                        eye sockets. 

           Myra gets on the ice to skate over to Harry Potter the Robot 
           as Riad and Eva head away from the rink. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

           Daniel dances across the stage with his ensemble. Every time 
           he’s able to turn around, we see the pain on his face. 

           Finally, as the cast finishes the last number and the curtain 
           closes, Daniel clutches his side ribs in agony. A few cast 
           members go to help him, but he immediately rushes off stage. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           As Daniel bursts past, the Stage Manager tries to follow. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Dan, where are you going?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Just tell Erin I had to run a quick 
                        errand. I’m fine. 

           He pushes open the backstage door and steps outside. 

           EXT. BRYANT PARK ICE SKATING RINK - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Harry Potter the Robot watches as Myra sips on some piping 
           hot chocolate. They sit at a table near the ice rink. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Is that butterbeer? 

           Gradually, he starts going back and forth between emotional, 
           human inflection and robotic monotone. 

                                 MYRA
                        It’s hot chocolate.

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        May I have a sip?

                                 MYRA
                        Oh, uh. No. 
                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Why not?

                                 MYRA
                        Um, because you’re lactose 
                        intolerant. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Oh. Later I will try to find a 
                        spell for that. 

           Harry Potter the Robot stares at Myra. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        Your friends remind me of my 
                        friends. Are they romantically 
                        together?

                                 MYRA
                        Unfortunately, yes. They just don’t 
                        get it. Like, the first rule of 
                        friendship is don’t start dating, 
                        especially when there’s only three 
                        of us! 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        They’re still your friends no 
                        matter what, you know. 

           Myra looks down at her hot chocolate. 

                                 MYRA
                        Do you ever wonder what it would be 
                        like if your parents didn’t die 
                        when you were a baby? 

           Harry Potter the Robot does not respond. Myra types into her 
           tablet: “say: Yes”. Harry Potter the Robot processes, then-

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Yes. 

                                 MYRA
                        Sometimes I feel like I’m never 
                        going to be able to figure things 
                        out on my own. Things just seem 
                        so...easy for everyone else. Like 
                        there’s this magical secret to life 
                        that nobody has thought to clue me 
                        in on. I mean, Eva and Riad just 
                        suddenly discovered they liked each 
                        other? How do you just discover 
                        that?
                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        That discovery is usually inside of 
                        you. 

           Myra grimaces. 

                                 MYRA
                        I forgot how cheesy some of the 
                        lessons in the books are. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        What books?

                                 MYRA
                        Nothing. Never mind. 

           Myra continues drinking her hot chocolate as her and Harry 
           Potter the Robot look at the ice skaters together. 

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

           Amongst the bright lights and screeching traffic, Daniel 
           holds his phone up to his ear. A beep. 

                                 PRAVIT (V.O.)
                        You’ve reached the office of Pravit 
                        Gupta. Sorry I couldn’t get to the-

           Daniel calls another number, leaning against the wall. Then-

                                 RACHEL
                        Hello, this is Rachel Wilkes. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Hi, it’s Dan, uh Daniel Radcliffe. 
                        I need to speak with Dr. Gupta. 

                                 RACHEL
                        He just stepped out of the office. 
                        If this is an emergency, I can call 
                        an ambulance for you to-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I don’t need an ambulance. I need 
                        Dr. Gupta. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Let me try his cell phone.

           After a moment-
                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Give me a moment and I can get one 
                        of the on-call doctors for you. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        No. Do you have Dr. Gupta’s 
                        address?

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, I’m afraid I can’t give you that 
                        kind of information, Mr. Radcliffe. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Look, I don’t normally do this, but 
                        couldn’t you make an exception? For 
                        me? He promised he was going to be 
                        here for me every step of the way. 
                        And I need him. Now. 

                                 RACHEL
                        He’ll be back in tomorrow. In the 
                        meantime one of the on-call doct-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I am actively dying. I can feel it. 
                        I need someone who understands, who 
                        can actually help me. I need Dr. 
                        Gupta, please. 

           Rachel takes a deep breath, then-

           EXT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           A knocking at the front door. Pravit answers to find-

                                 PRAVIT
                        Mr. Radcliffe?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It’s happening and I don’t know 
                        what to do. I started coughing 
                        blood, and I get these sudden sharp 
                        pains in my ribcage that come and 
                        go. I don’t want Erin to think I 
                        just gave up. I don’t want her to 
                        see me suffer. There’s gotta be 
                        something we can try. Some 
                        temporary treatment? An 
                        experimental drug? Something? Is 
                        there anything your wife tried? 

           Pravit raises his eyebrows at hearing “wife.”
                                 PRAVIT
                        Here, come inside. 

           He opens the door as a frantic Daniel steps in. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Pravit gestures towards the couch. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Have a seat. I’ll heat up some tea. 

           As Daniel shuffles into the living room, he takes in the 
           apartment. He eyes the origami cranes sitting in the jar.

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Myra sits at her desk, hunched over her tablet while Harry 
           Potter the Robot practices using his wand. She stands up. 

                                 MYRA
                        Be right back. 

           She steps out of her room.

           INT. GUPTA KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Myra enters the kitchen just as Pravit finishes brewing a pot 
           of tea. He looks over at Myra. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Hey, kiddo, I’ve got a patient 
                        over. We have some things to 
                        discuss, so we’re going to need a 
                        bit of privacy in the living room. 

                                 MYRA
                        Mhm, sure. 

           She opens the fridge door, not really paying attention as 
           Pravit steps out of the kitchen. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Daniel turns around as Pravit sets the tray of tea on the 
           coffee table. As Pravit sits down, Daniel shuffles his feet. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Could I use your restroom?
                                 PRAVIT
                        Of course. There’s one upstairs on 
                        the left. Do you need help getting 
                        up the stairs?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        No, I can handle it. 

           Daniel slowly walks past the kitchen, where we see Myra 
           spooning ice cream into her mouth while Daniel makes his way 
           upstairs, clutching onto the railing for support. 

           INT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Daniel turns left to find a door slightly ajar. He opens it 
           to accidentally find MYRA’S BEDROOM. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Oh, sorry-

           He freezes before closing the door. Sitting on the bed is-

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Hello. I am Harry Potter. 

           The two stare at one another in silence.

           On impulse, Daniel takes a step back. But after a moment, he 
           can’t help himself as he steps into the room. 

           INT. MYRA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harry Potter the Robot stands as Daniel enters. Daniel 
           approaches him slowly. 

           Once they’re close enough. Harry Potter the Robot’s eyes 
           CLICK upon clearly recognizing Daniel’s facial features. 

           On Myra’s desk, her tablet LIGHTS UP. 

           It automatically activates the “FACIAL RECOGNITION” feature. 

           Harry Potter the Robot starts precisely MIRRORING everything 
           Daniel does. 

           Daniel reaches out his hand to touch the cheek of the robot. 
           It reaches out to touch the cheek of Daniel. 

           Just as they make contact with one another, Myra enters. 

                                 MYRA
                        Um. Excuse me?
           From the doorframe, she watches as the two inspect one 
           another. They slowly circle around each other until Myra can 
           see Daniel’s face. She nearly drops her ice cream. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit. Are you Daniel 
                        Radcliffe?

           Daniel looks at Myra, then back at Harry Potter the Robot, 
           who looks back at Daniel, then he bolts out of the room. 
           Harry Potter the Robot follows. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Daniel frantically rushes downstairs, Harry Potter the Robot 
           right behind him, still mirroring his actions. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Has this become some kind of joke 
                        to you?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Has this become some kind of joke 
                        to you?

           Daniel turns around to glare at Harry Potter the Robot, who 
           turns around to glare at the wall. 

           Pravit jolts up from his couch. Myra clamors down the stairs. 
           She goes straight to her dad. 

                                 MYRA
                        Dad, is Daniel Radcliffe your 
                        patient?

           Pravit looks at Harry Potter the Robot and Daniel. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        What is this?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Yes, what is this?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Yes, what is this?

           They both point to Harry Potter the Robot. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Why does it repeat everything I 
                        say?
                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Why does it repeat everything I 
                        say?

           Myra’s eyes widen in realization. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh shit, shit, shit.

                                 PRAVIT
                        Language, Myra. 

                                 MYRA
                        Shit is barely a curse word!

           Myra sprints upstairs. Daniel goes to put his jacket on. 
           Harry Potter the Robot follows, but gets too close, so Daniel 
           starts circling around the living room, trying to get away. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Stop that. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Stop that. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Make him stop following me. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Make him stop following me. 

           As the two continue their cat-mouse chase through the living 
           room, Myra scrambles back downstairs with her tablet. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 MYRA
                        I can’t believe you lied to me. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Not now, Myra. 

                                 MYRA
                        You didn’t think I would maybe want 
                        to meet him?

           Daniel abruptly stops and turns to Harry Potter the Robot. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I said stop. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I said stop. 
           Daniel SLAPS Harry Potter the Robot...who immediately slaps 
           him back. They look at each other, both equally shocked and 
           appalled. 

           Back at the stairs, Pravit looks at the tablet in Myra’s 
           hand. Does a double take to Harry Potter the Robot. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Is that your robot?

                                 MYRA
                        Sh!

           Daniel approaches Pravit and Myra. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Are hallucinations a side effect of 
                        the disease?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Are hallucinations a side effect of 
                        the disease?

           Myra looks up from her tablet. 

                                 MYRA
                        Disease?

                                 PRAVIT
                        No, this is my daughter, Myra. 

                                 MYRA
                        What disease? 

                                 PRAVIT
                        She’s building a robot for a 
                        science fair project and I guess 
                        she was inspired. 

           At hearing “robot,” Harry Potter the Robot visible TWITCHES. 
           Myra aggressively shakes her head. 

                                 MYRA
                        Not a robot! Real boy. Real wizard 
                        boy! Man! Real wizard man!

           She frantically types a few things into her tablet. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Are you telling me this is a-

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Are you telling me this is a-
           With the tapping of another button, Myra effectively SHUTS 
           OFF Harry Potter the Robot. It stands motionless. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Robot?

                                 MYRA
                        Yes, but I don’t want him to know 
                        that or else it might undo all of 
                        the work we’ve done. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Did you program him to follow me 
                        like that?

                                 MYRA
                        No, I didn’t program him to follow 
                        you. Well, I guess I kind of did, 
                        but not you. Harry. Which is you, 
                        of course. The facial recognition 
                        feature is turned on and that’s how 
                        he learns, so I programmed him to 
                        mimic you, well Harry, and-

                                 PRAVIT
                        I think you owe Mr. Radcliffe an 
                        apology. 

                                 MYRA
                        I’m so sorry, sir. 

           A beat of silence. Then-

                                 PRAVIT
                        Just give us a moment. 

           Pravit and Myra move to the other side of the living room, 
           leaving Daniel to stare at the now motionless Robot. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        This is highly inappropriate. 

                                 MYRA
                        Maybe if you didn’t lie to your 
                        only daughter and told me your 
                        patient was Daniel fucking 
                        Radcliffe-

                          PRAVIT
                                                      MYRA (CONT'D)
           Language--
                                              --I wouldn’t have built a 
                                              robot replica of him because 
                                              it’s kinda creepy now. 
                                 PRAVIT
                        You think?

                                 MYRA
                        It wasn’t creepy before! I didn’t 
                        think I’d actually meet him, jeez. 
                        You gave me your comics. How is 
                        this any different?

           In the back, Daniel inspects the Robot. He looks around to 
           make sure Pravit and Myra aren’t looking, then sneaks a peek 
           in Harry Potter the Robot’s trousers. Raises his eyebrows. 

           Back with Pravit and Myra-

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t be mad at me. I didn’t 
                        know. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I didn’t mean to snap at you. 
                        Things are just stressful now. 

           Mid groin inspection, Daniel starts coughing. It overwhelms 
           him enough to need to sit down. Pravit sprints over to him. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Is there any blood?

           Daniel shakes his head. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Okay, good. Myra, go get some 
                        water. 

           Myra rushes into the kitchen. When she comes back out, Daniel 
           takes the glass of water from her. Myra bursts into TEARS. 

                                 MYRA
                        You’re his patient who’s dying?

           Their silence confirms her hypothesis. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        But--but you can’t die. You just 
                        can’t. What are we supposed to do 
                        without you?

                                 PRAVIT
                        Myra, sweetheart--

                                 MYRA
                        Do something about it! Fix him, fix 
                        him! He can’t die. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MYRA (CONT'D)
                        You won’t let him die, right? 
                        You’ll cure him, right dad? Right? 

                                 PRAVIT
                        He has Kutain’s disease. 

           Myra’s chest heaves with more sobs as she bolts upstairs. 

           Not knowing what else to do, Daniel having recovered his 
           breath, finally sips on his tea. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Lovely tea. Nice hint of cayenne. 

           Pravit sits in his armchair across from the couch. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        I told you the teenage girls are 
                        the most dangerous. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        They tell you teenagers are 
                        difficult to raise, but you just 
                        don’t believe it until it happens. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        At least she’s passionate. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I’m sorry about that. I knew she 
                        was building a robot, but I didn’t 
                        believe she was building...that. 

           They both look at the idle Harry Potter Robot. Behind him, 
           Daniel looks at the Gupta family photo on the bookshelf. 
           Pravit smiles next to Anna.

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Why didn’t you tell me about your 
                        wife?

                                 PRAVIT
                        I didn’t think telling you would 
                        have really helped that much. And 
                        it honestly hasn’t been an easy 
                        subject to discuss. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It does help. A little. As it turns 
                        out, dying is an incredibly lonely 
                        experience. Who’d of thought? 

           As Daniel looks back at Harry Potter the Robot, he suddenly 
           starts laughing. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        For a second there I thought I 
                        might already be dead and I was 
                        subjected to a personal hell where 
                        I had to live with my teenage self 
                        for the rest of eternity. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        If it gives you any solace, I think 
                        being stuck with your teenage self 
                        is anyone’s idea of hell, not just 
                        yours. 

           Pravit joins Daniel in the laugher as they calm down from the 
           previous chaos.  

           INT. MYRA'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Myra sits at her desk, still crying. Outside her window, she 
           sees Daniel step outside. It’s now lightly snowing. She then 
           grabs a jacket and rushes downstairs. 

           EXT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Myra’s boots crunch in the light, crisp snowfall as she stops 
           Daniel from getting in his private driver-less car. 

                                 MYRA
                        Uh, Mr. Radcliffe! 

           Daniel turns around. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to say, I really am 
                        genuinely sorry he started chasing 
                        you around like that. I know it 
                        probably freaked you out. I mean, 
                        it would have freaked me out for 
                        sure. I promise you I’m not some 
                        delusional fangirl stalker. I 
                        didn’t even want to make the robot 
                        you. I wanted to make it my mom, 
                        but that made my dad uncomfortable, 
                        and so I thought, who else do I 
                        know well enough to design a robot 
                        after? And well...that’s Harry. 

           A beat. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Also, I’m sorry that you’re dying. 
                        I wish you weren’t. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        As you could probably tell by my 
                        incredibly embarrassing breakdown 
                        back there. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It’s okay. I also wish I wasn’t 
                        dying. 

                                 MYRA
                        What a fun thing for us to have in 
                        common!

           Daniel chuckles. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to tell people? I 
                        mean, publicly. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It’s a bit personal. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh my god, of course. Well your 
                        secret is safe with me. I promise. 
                        Pinky promise. 

           Myra holds out her pinky. Daniel pinky shakes with her. He 
           smiles at the purity of it. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Your dad is lucky to have you. 

           Daniel’s eyes well as he takes a step back towards his car. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        My wife is probably wondering where 
                        I’ve wandered off to now. 

                                 MYRA
                        You know, my mom had Kutain’s. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You and your father must miss her. 

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah. There are a lot of sucky 
                        things about her being gone, but 
                        people always tell me that she’s 
                        still alive through me. That she’s 
                        never going to be forgotten. That 
                        I’m like keeping her legacy going 
                        or whatever. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I’m sure you are. 

                                 MYRA
                        I hate that. Do you know how much 
                        pressure that puts on me? To have 
                        to carry the weight of my mom’s 
                        memory on my shoulders for the rest 
                        of my life. 

           Daniel opens his mouth, but pauses, unsure of what to say. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Your wife isn’t going to have to go 
                        through that. Not alone, at least. 
                        Nobody is ever going to forget you. 

           Myra envelopes Daniel into a hug. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. For everything. 

           After a moment of processing, Daniel reciprocates the hug. 

           INT. DANIEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A restless Daniel glances over at Erin, who lightly snores on 
           the other side of the bed. He stares up at the ceiling, 
           nowhere near falling asleep. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Pre-show chaos as the ensemble finishes their warmups. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Places please! 

           Mumbles of “thank you, places” while the performers continue 
           moving to their top-of-show spots. Daniel stands in the 
           wings, staring out at the empty stage. Erin approaches. 

                                 ERIN
                        You okay?

           A beat as Daniel looks at the illuminated spotlight. Without 
           a word, he shakes his head and steps back. The Stage Manager 
           and Erin hold their hands out to help him to a nearby seat. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        Get Dan’s understudy ready. Now. 

           Daniel stares as the spotlight lingers on the empty stage. 
           INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SET - DAY

           The live audience eagerly applauds as Daniel walks onto the 
           set, slowly, but desperately trying to not make his failing 
           health too obvious. 

                                 RYAN KAJI
                        Ladies and gentlemen, the one and 
                        only...Daniel Radcliffe! 

           Across from him is host RYAN KAJI (47 now), that kid who 
           makes millions of dollars playing with toys on YouTube, 
           because we all know 37 years from now, that kid’s gonna take 
           over the world. 

                                 RYAN KAJI (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for joining us today!

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Thank you for having me, Ryan. 

                                 RYAN KAJI
                        Now Daniel, I know you’re here to 
                        promote your new musical, and you 
                        have had an incredible stage career 
                        from Broadway to the West End. 

           Some applause from the audience. 

                                 RYAN KAJI (CONT’D)
                        But this year also marks the 60th 
                        anniversary of your first movie, 
                        Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s 
                        Stone. 

           The applause grows even louder. 

                                 RYAN KAJI (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s been over half a 
                        century, but do you think you’d 
                        ever reprise your role as the boy 
                        who lived?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Half a century? Well if I didn’t 
                        feel old before, I sure do now. 

           Laughter from the audience, but it feels forced. Daniel looks 
           at Erin, who sits in the front row. Daniel takes a breath. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        Actually, Ryan there’s something I 
                        do want to share. 
                                 RYAN KAJI
                        Great! 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        A few weeks ago, as some of you may 
                        know, I had a bit of a fall during 
                        one of our shows. And I’m dealing 
                        with some serious health issues, so 
                        I will be taking a step back from 
                        performing. 

           Silence from the audience. 

                                 RYAN KAJI
                        I’m sorry to hear that. We all will 
                        be wishing you a quick and safe 
                        recovery. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        That’s the thing, Ryan. There isn’t 
                        going to be a recovery. There’s not 
                        a cure for what I have. 

           He looks out at the now concerned audience. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        And I wanted you to hear it from 
                        me. While you still can. And I want 
                        you all to know that it’s going to 
                        be okay. 

           A stunned Ryan Kaji’s eyes jolt to his PRODUCER for on-air 
           guidance while Erin gives Daniel a strong, reassuring smile. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DUSK

           Snow falls over the serene park. Daniel walks with a cane in 
           one hand and Erin in the other. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m proud of you, Dan. I know this 
                        isn’t easy to do, but I think you 
                        not doing the show anymore can buy 
                        us some more time.

           Daniel wraps his arm around Erin’s shoulders. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        Our show’s going to become a total 
                        flop because your understudy is 
                        honestly complete shit, but hey, 
                        you can’t win them all. 
           The two laugh as they continue their snowy stroll. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Myra keeps her head down as she continues to her next class. 
           As she approaches the doorway, she finds Riad and Eva waiting 
           for her, blocking her way. 

                                 RIAD
                        Did you see Ryan Kaji last night?

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah. 

                                 EVA
                        We just wanted to make sure you’re 
                        okay. 

                                 MYRA
                        I mean, this was going to happen 
                        eventually. Just the circle of 
                        life.

                                 RIAD
                        Maybe we could we come over 
                        tonight? We could hang out with you 
                        and...Harry. 

                                 MYRA
                        I don’t think I’m going to keep 
                        Harry around anymore. But I do need 
                        to head to class and you know, 
                        learn stuff. So if you don’t mind-

           She gestures to the doorway they’re blocking. They step away 
           to let her enter. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON 

           Myra zones out as she stares out the window while her STEM 
           classmates around her work on their science fair projects. 

           Sebastian waves a hand in front of her face. 

           When she doesn’t respond, Sebastian pretends to speak into a 
           walkie-talkie. He makes the static sound with his mouth. 

                                 SEBASTIAN 
                        Houston, we have a problem. One of 
                        our cadets seems to be lost in 
                        space. 
                                 MYRA
                        That’s a really insensitive 
                        reference, Sebastian. Space travel 
                        is no joke. It’s a risky feat all 
                        in the pursuit of scientific 
                        exploration, but at what cost, 
                        Sebastian? At what cost?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Sorry, I didn’t realize it was a 
                        touchy subject. Just trying to 
                        cheer you up. You seem kinda down. 

           Myra sighs. 

                                 MYRA
                        I’m stepping down from the science 
                        fair. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What? You’ve been working so hard. 
                        Every time I see you, your eyes are 
                        glued to your tablet working on 
                        some coding thing. 

                                 MYRA
                        I don’t think it’s appropriate for 
                        me to show my robot anymore. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Why not?

                                 MYRA
                        It’s a tremendously sensitive 
                        issue. Please no further questions. 

           Myra turns away from him and resumes staring out the window. 
           Sebastian extends his arm to place his hand on her shoulder, 
           but then chickens out and walks away instead.

           EXT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - AFTERNOON 

           As Myra drags her feet through dirty snow, she rounds the 
           corner on her block before stopping. 

                                 MYRA
                        Hi? 

           Sitting on the front stoop is Daniel. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Could I see him again?
           Myra nods as she helps Daniel stand up. His hands shake as he 
           clutches his cane and heads into the apartment. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 

           Daniel sits in the armchair as Myra brings Harry Potter the 
           Robot downstairs. She places him in front of Daniel. 

           He stares at the Robot while Myra stares at Daniel. 

           After a beat of silence-

                                 MYRA
                        Are you going to make me destroy 
                        him? Or sue me or something?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I’m British, we don’t sue. 

           Using his cane to balance, Daniel gets up to move closer to 
           the Robot. He inspects the face. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe how young I looked. 
                        How old am I supposed to be here?

                                 MYRA
                        Like sixteenish. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Feels like a lifetime ago. 

           Daniel suddenly clutches his chest. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I need to sit down. 

           Myra helps him back to the armchair. 

                                 MYRA
                        Should I call an ambulance? Or my 
                        dad?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        No, no. I just need to learn to 
                        take it easy. Not something I’m 
                        exactly used to. 

                                 MYRA
                        Do you want some water or tea or 
                        ice cream or something?
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Ice cream? 

           INT. GUPTA KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 

           They sit on kitchen chairs eating bowls of Ben & Jerry’s 
           Phish Food (37 years from now, Phish Food better still be 
           around). Harry Potter the Robot sits with them, idle. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        So tell me, how exactly does he 
                        work? You just play something and 
                        he does the movements? And then 
                        what? He comes to life?

                                 MYRA
                        He’s not sentient. So he can’t 
                        actually feel or think for himself. 
                        Anything he says or does is based 
                        on a pre-programed response. 

           She spoons more ice cream into her mouth. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        From the time we’re born, we’re 
                        constantly processing patterns we 
                        see in other humans to mimic them 
                        ourselves. We’re always learning 
                        from our surroundings. Simply 
                        living teaches us how to be human. 

           Myra looks at the motionless Robot. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        It’s no different for him. It’s all 
                        pattern recognition. He just 
                        repeats what he sees. It’s one of 
                        the reasons why I chose 
                        him...you...Harry as a basis. His 
                        responses are based on what the 
                        character would do. 

           Daniel eyes the Robot. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        It’s almost like fanart or 
                        fanfiction. What would Harry say? 
                        And then he says it. He uses 
                        pattern recognition to come up with 
                        his own organic responses. Or at 
                        least he was starting to. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        So he can have actual 
                        conversations? 

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, wanna see? 

           Myra takes out her tablet, but Daniel stops her. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Is he going to start following me 
                        again?

                                 MYRA
                        No, I turned that feature off. 

           With a few taps on her tablet, Harry Potter the Robot 
           activates. He looks at Daniel, then looks at the ice cream. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Can I have some?

                                 MYRA
                        You’re still lactose intolerant. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I keep forgetting to look up that 
                        spell. 

           He looks at Daniel again. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        Who is this? 

           Myra looks at Daniel, who hesitates to speak. 

                                 MYRA
                        Go ahead. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Oh. I’m Daniel. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Hello, Daniel. 

           Silence falls over the kitchen table. Myra shuts him off. 

                                 MYRA
                        He gets better with every 
                        conversation. Adding words to his 
                        vocabulary. Changing tonal 
                        inflection. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MYRA (CONT'D)
                        Although, the woman at the store 
                        told me to go with Half-Blood 
                        Prince Harry, so he can be kinda 
                        angsty sometimes. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        This may sound bizarre, but would 
                        it be possible for me to spend some 
                        time with him? 

                                 MYRA
                        Really? Doing what?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I could teach him how to be me. Or 
                        well, teach him how to be him. 

           Myra nearly drops her spoon. 

                                 MYRA
                        That would, I mean, that would be 
                        freaking awesome. The possibilities 
                        of that, I couldn’t even...it would 
                        be, he would learn so phenomenally 
                        well. Better than from watching a 
                        movie or any programming. But, I 
                        mean, why would you want to spend 
                        your time doing that? 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It might be nice to spend some time 
                        by myself without really being 
                        alone. 

           Daniel puts a big spoonful of ice cream into his mouth. His 
           eyes widen in delight. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        I got a fish! 

           Myra giggles as Daniel sticks his tongue out to reveal his 
           chocolate fish. 

           INT. DANIEL & ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Harry Potter the Robot sits in a chair in Daniel and Erin’s 
           Central Park West penthouse apartment. Myra stands to the 
           side with her tablet while Erin stares, baffled at the Robot. 

                                 ERIN
                        He’s-he’s quite handsome. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Erin! He’s still a minor. 

                                 ERIN
                        I’m joking. He’s you! 

           Daniel turns to Myra. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I’m so sorry about my wife. I 
                        promise I won’t let her anywhere 
                        near him with her filthy mind. 

                                 ERIN
                        Dan!

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I’m about to croak and she’s 
                        already got her eyes on a younger 
                        man. Unbelievable. 

           Erin rolls her eyes.

                                 MYRA
                        Just remember. He can’t know-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Can’t know he’s a robot. 

           Myra activates Harry Potter the Robot on her tablet. 

                                 MYRA
                        If you need anything, we’ll be in 
                        the next room. 

           The girls close the door behind them, leaving Daniel and 
           Harry Potter the Robot alone. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Daniel, right?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You can call me Dan. And 
                        you’re...Harry, right? 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Harry Potter. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It’s good to see you again. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        You as well. 
           The two continue sitting in silence. Comfortable silence. 

           Then, Harry Potter the Robot smiles. It’s a genuine smile 
           that reaches the eyes. 

           INT. DANIEL & ERIN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Harry Potter the Robot continues sitting in his chair, idle 
           while Daniel paces back and forth (with his cane).

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        He’s brilliant. 

                                 MYRA
                        You think so?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        How are you going to present him?

                                 MYRA
                        What do you mean?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        At your science fair. How are you 
                        going to present him? 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh, I didn’t know if I should still 
                        do that. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Of course you should. 

                                 MYRA
                        Well, I hadn’t really given much 
                        thought to it. I guess I was just 
                        going to have him walk around on 
                        stage and do some fake spells. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        No, no you have to do something 
                        magnificent with him. Something 
                        that will make the audience smile. 

           Erin leans against the doorframe. 

                                 ERIN
                        Why don’t you teach him one of your 
                        dance routines? 

           Daniel stares at his wife. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Erin, we agreed I’m supposed to be 
                        taking it easy so we can spend more 
                        time together. 

                                 ERIN
                        One of the simple routines. I can 
                        help. 

           Daniel’s eyes light up with joy. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Are you sure about this? 

                                 ERIN
                        It’ll make you happy. And I think 
                        it’ll be better than just waiting. 

           Daniel pulls Erin into a tight hug. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Myra drags Harry Potter the Robot through her living room. 
           Pravit sits in the kitchen, sipping on his morning coffee. 

           He looks at Myra, who struggles with the Robot. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You’re taking him to school today?

                                 MYRA
                        Oh, no I’m dropping him off at the 
                        theater.

                                 PRAVIT
                        Theater?

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, Daniel’s going to teach him a 
                        tap dance for the science fair. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Daniel?

                                 MYRA
                        Radcliffe? You know, your secret 
                        patient. Anyway, I gotta go so I’m 
                        not late. Bye dad!

           With Harry Potter the Robot in tow, Myra steps outside, 
           leaving a baffled Pravit to stare after them. 
           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - MORNING

           Harry Potter the Robot stands in the middle spotlight on the 
           Broadway stage. Myra walks around with a tablet while Daniel 
           sits in a front audience seat. Erin sits next to him. 

                                 MYRA
                        Okay, so I’ve synced his system up 
                        with your tablet. 

           With another tap of the tablet, Harry Potter the Robot 
           activates. He’s more animated and lively than we’ve seen him. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Hi Myra! Where are we? Room of 
                        Requirements? 

                                 MYRA
                        We’re in a theater. Our friend 
                        Daniel over here has offered to 
                        help me with a school project. I 
                        was hoping you’d be able to help as 
                        well. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Awesome sauce. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I would never say that. Harry would 
                        never say that. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        What?

           Myra gives Daniel a pointed look. 

                                 MYRA
                        So, Daniel and Erin are going to be 
                        giving you some dance lessons the 
                        next few weeks. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        What does dancing have to do with 
                        science?

                                 MYRA
                        I’m doing my project on the science 
                        of tap dancing. 

           Harry Potter the Robot narrows his eyes skeptically. Then--

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Groovy!
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        When have I ever said groovy?

                                 MYRA
                        I think he probably learned that 
                        one from my dad. Are you both okay 
                        for me to head to school?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Aside from me now being incredibly 
                        skeptical of my doctor’s 
                        intelligence given his use of the 
                        word “groovy,” yes, please go to 
                        school. 

           Myra looks over at Erin, who nods. 

                                 ERIN
                        He’s in good hands. 

           Daniel uses his cane to get up, then slowly heads over to the 
           stage as Myra heads to the front. 

           Before she leaves, Myra turns around to watch Daniel and 
           Harry standing side by side on stage under the spotlight. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Myra works on her presentation in the corner of the room when 
           Sebastian approaches her. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Did you figure out another project?

                                 MYRA
                        No need. I figured out how to make 
                        this one work, and it’s going to be 
                        epic. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Probably not as epic as my volcano. 

           Myra rolls her eyes. 

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, okay, sure thing Sebastian. 

           Sebastian smiles at her. Instead of looking down at her 
           tablet like she normally does, Myra actually smiles back. 
           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

           Daniel and Harry Potter the Robot go through a few basic tap 
           moves. Daniel uses his cane for balance, but still manages to 
           gracefully move his legs around. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Myra holds index cards in her hand as she practices giving 
           her presentation. Harry Potter the Robot is frozen as she 
           points to various areas of his body and pulls up her designs.

           INT. DANIEL RADCLIFFE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Daniel and Erin hold hands as they share a candlelit dinner. 
           On the other side of the table, Harry Potter the Robot sits, 
           smiling at them. 

           Erin politely smiles back as they make awkward eye contact. 

           INT. ROBOT STORE - DAY

           Candace takes out her old framed posters from all of the 
           Harry Potter films. She hands them over to an excited Myra. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Realistic constellations are projected onto the ceiling. 
           Harry Potter the Robot and Myra lie on the floor as Myra 
           points to the various constellations, explaining them to him.

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

           Harry Potter the Robot twirls around effortlessly on stage. 

           EXT. BRYANT PARK ICE SKATING RINK - AFTERNOON 

           Harry Potter the Robot’s dance twirls become ice skating 
           twirls as he glides across the ice. 

           Myra skates with him while Daniel and Erin sit watching, 
           sharing a cup of marshmellowy hot chocolate together. 

           On the rink, Harry Potter the Robot whispers something in 
           Myra’s ear, and she bursts out laughing. 
           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Myra stands up with the various film posters behind her. 
           Daniel sits on the couch, a captive audience member. Myra’s 
           hands shake as she glances down at her notecards. 

           Daniel stands up next to her and helps her plant her feet 
           with confident shoulders back, presentation-style. 

           INT. GUPTA KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Harry Potter the Robot tries making various potions, which 
           Myra nods at enthusiastically when he’s looking. As soon as 
           he turns away, Myra throws any “potions” into the sink. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

           Daniel sits in the audience as Harry Potter the Robot does 
           his routine. After he misses a beat, Daniel shakes his head. 

           He stands up without his cane and hops on the stage, then 
           does the tap move himself, flawlessly. 

           INT. DR. GUPTA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Pravit stares at Daniel’s projected x-ray results.

                                 PRAVIT
                        Unbelievable. 

           The previous mutated blue cells are almost completely gone. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        I-I honestly don’t know how this is 
                        even possible. Have you made a 
                        drastic change in your diet?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I guess I’ve been eating a bit more 
                        ice cream than I usually do, 
                        although the only difference I’ve 
                        noticed is here. 

           He pats his belly. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Any new medication I should be 
                        aware of?

           Next to him, Harry Potter the Robot purses his lips. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Not at all. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Does this mean he’s cured? 

                                 PRAVIT
                        We’re going to need to run a few 
                        more tests, but honestly this looks 
                        promising. Miraculously promising. 
                        We’ll continue monitoring, but this 
                        looks remarkably good. 

           Daniel and Harry Potter the Robot stand. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Radcliffe? 

           As Harry Potter the Robot starts out the door, Pravit pulls 
           Daniel aside. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        I also wanted to extend a thank you 
                        for what you’re doing for my 
                        daughter with-

           Harry Potter the Robot looks at them. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Harry. I know it means a lot to her 
                        and I appreciate it. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Of course, it’s my pleasure. 

           Daniel steps outside while Pravit looks back at the positive 
           x-ray results. 

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS - DAY 

           Daniel and Harry Potter the Robot walk down the bustling 
           hallway. Daniel practically skips with a pep in his step. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I feel incredible. How should I 
                        tell Erin? Do you think I should 
                        come up with some elaborate 
                        surprise? Or maybe I could fake my 
                        death? Some gallows humor might be 
                        fun. Or it would upset her 
                        horribly. Could go either way. 

           Harry Potter the Robot looks nervous. 
                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Dan, I have something to tell you. 

           His verbal intonations are notably more human-like. They have 
           emotion instead of his previously robotic monotone.  

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        But I’m not supposed to tell you. 
                        Myra can’t know that you know. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You have a secret you want to keep 
                        from Myra? 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I do, yes. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Interesting. Well alright then. I 
                        won’t tell her. What is it?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I...

           Harry Potter the Robot pulls Daniel to a secluded corner. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        I’m a wizard. 

           Stunned silence. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s a lot to process. You 
                        might not believe me at first, but-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        No, I believe you. Thank you for 
                        confiding in me. Why exactly are 
                        you telling me this now?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        You have to promise you won’t get 
                        mad. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Promise. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I’ve been slipping a healing potion 
                        into your tea every morning. 

           Daniel takes a step back. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You’ve what?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        And it’s obviously working! 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        What’s in it?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Some herbs and a few spells the 
                        brightest witch I know taught me, 
                        so I knew it would be safe. 

           Off Daniel’s stunned face-

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        It’s best not to share this with 
                        any muggle doctors. It could 
                        threaten the wizarding world as we 
                        know it. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Wizarding world. Right. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        You won’t tell Myra, right?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Why can’t she know?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        She probably won’t want me seeing 
                        you anymore. I’m not allowed to use 
                        my magic in the muggle world. She 
                        said it could be dangerous. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Right. Yes, best to keep this our 
                        little secret for now. 

           Daniel slings his arm around Harry Potter the Robot’s 
           shoulders as they continue out of the hospital building. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY 

           Myra, Erin and Daniel sit in the front row of the theater, 
           watching Harry Potter the Robot complete his tap routine. 

           Once he finishes, Myra, Erin, and Daniel stand up, 
           applauding. Their claps echo in the otherwise empty theater. 

           Myra hops onto the stage. 
                                 MYRA
                        Harry, that was wonderful!  

           Harry Potter the Robot actually blushes. Daniel jumps onto 
           the stage as well.

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Well done indeed. The pacing was a 
                        little slow in the third verse-

                                 ERIN
                        Dan, give him a break. It was 
                        absolutely marvelous. You should 
                        all be very proud. 

           Harry Potter the Robot smiles at Myra. Daniel looks between 
           the two. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Myra, could I actually talk to you 
                        for a minute? 

                                 MYRA
                        Sure thing. 

           Myra and Daniel walk off stage while Erin and Harry Potter 
           the Robot continue chatting. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           Myra sits on some prop chaise lounge as Daniel glances around 
           to make sure Harry Potter the Robot doesn’t overhear. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Harry told me a secret yesterday. 

                                 MYRA
                        Ooh, a secret. How fun!

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Did you program that?

                                 MYRA
                        No. What was the secret? 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        He asked me not to tell you. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        But why wouldn’t I tell you? He’s 
                        not real. You’re real. 

                                 MYRA
                        Right. So what’s the secret?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        He told me he’s a wizard. 

                                 MYRA
                        Well, he is a wizard.

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        He’s apparently been slipping a 
                        “magic healing potion” into my tea.

                                 MYRA
                        He’s been drugging you?!

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It’s probably just peppermint 
                        leaves that he whispers some 
                        imaginary spells into. But my 
                        disease is going away. 

                                 MYRA
                        What? Dan, that’s amazing. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Your father has no idea how it 
                        happened. There’s no proper 
                        explanation for it. Is it possible 
                        that-

                                 MYRA
                        Is what possible?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        That he’s real? And if he’s real, 
                        the magic is real?

           Complete silence on Myra’s part. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        Just throwing it out there. 

                                 MYRA
                        Are you asking me if the robot I 
                        built is actually a wizard with 
                        real magical abilities? 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        I’m...
           A beat. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        Kidding. Of course. 

           He’s not, but Myra forces a chuckle anyway. 

                                 MYRA
                        Funny. As for the disease going 
                        away, my dad sees miracles all the 
                        time. Some people just defy the 
                        odds. You should be celebrating, 
                        not worrying about Harry! Honestly, 
                        it makes sense for him to try and 
                        use magic to heal you. It’s just 
                        his programming. It’s what Harry 
                        would do. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        So nothing to be alarmed of?

                                 MYRA
                        Nope. It’s kind of nice he told you 
                        a secret. It means he trusts you. 

           Erin approaches. 

                                 ERIN
                        They need to start prepping the 
                        stage for tonight’s show. 

                                 MYRA
                        I’ll get my stuff together. 

           Myra goes to grab her stuff, leaving Erin and Daniel alone. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You just want to get home to see 
                        what else has been cured. 

                                 ERIN
                        Wow, really Dan?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Erin, please stop flirting with me 
                        when the teenagers are around. This 
                        is starting to get out of hand. 

           Erin playfully swats his chest as he pulls her into a kiss. 

           Still standing on stage in the spotlight, Harry Potter the 
           Robot watches them backstage. He furrows his eyebrows and 
           tilts his head as he processes their romantic embrace. 
           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EARLY EVENING

           Myra and Harry Potter the Robot walk through Central Park. 
           Thick snow covering the trees and grass. Myra shivers as a 
           cold wind breezes past. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Do you want to borrow my robe? 

                                 MYRA
                        No, I’ll be fine. Thank you though. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Are you excited for your 
                        presentation tomorrow?

                                 MYRA
                        I don’t know if excited is the 
                        right word. I don’t really do much 
                        public speaking. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        You’re going to be great. Teach 
                        everyone about the science of tap 
                        dancing and all that jazz. 

           He does jazz hands, causing Myra to laugh. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 MYRA
                        Of course. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Is Daniel my father?

           Myra stops. 

                                 MYRA
                        What? Why would you think that? 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I know my parents supposedly died 
                        when I was a baby, but I don’t 
                        remember. Come to think of it, I 
                        don’t remember much about my life 
                        before I was eleven. But Daniel 
                        looks so much like me. We have the 
                        same eyes, and he’s kind of taken 
                        me under his wing. 
                                 MYRA
                        He’s not your father. He’s just a 
                        friend helping me out. The eyes 
                        thing is a coincidence. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Sorry, I know it was ridiculous to 
                        think about it. I guess I just wish 
                        my parents were still alive. 

                                 MYRA
                        It’s okay to miss them. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I often wonder how different I 
                        would be if they were alive. I 
                        guess that’s why I was kind of 
                        hoping Daniel was...it just felt 
                        nice to have someone look after me. 
                        I’ve never had that before. 

           Myra resumes walking, eyebrows furrowed. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        Myra?

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        What’s it like to be in love?

                                 MYRA
                        Wow, so many questions tonight. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Sorry, I-

                                 MYRA
                        No, it’s good to be curious. For 
                        that one, you’re asking the wrong 
                        person. I’ve never been in love. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Are Daniel and Erin in love?

                                 MYRA
                        I think so. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        They seem really happy when they’re 
                        together. Is that what being in 
                        love is like? Just being happy with 
                        someone else? 
           Myra takes a second to think of an answer. 

                                 MYRA
                        When my mom died, I overheard my 
                        dad saying he was scared because he 
                        felt like he was the best version 
                        of himself when he was with her. So 
                        maybe it’s more than just 
                        happiness? Maybe it’s more about 
                        you being you when you’re in love? 

           Harry Potter the Robot stops. Myra looks back at him. He 
           stands on a snowy path overlooking the frozen reservoir with 
           the sun slowly fading behind the metropolitan skyline. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I think I’m my best self when I’m 
                        with you. In fact, I know I’m my 
                        best self when I’m with you. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh, Harry, that’s-

           Abruptly, Harry Potter the Robot steps forward to KISS Myra. 
           Just before their lips touch, she jumps back, eyes wide. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Oh no, Myra, I’m so sorry. 

                                 MYRA
                        What made you do that?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I don’t know, it just sort of 
                        happened. I thought--I’m so sorry. 

                                 MYRA
                        No, don’t--don’t apologize. This is 
                        wonderful that you feel that way. 
                        Organic emotions are a complex part 
                        of evolution. I’m just...confused 
                        right now. I didn’t expect you to 
                        be able to form them yourself. 

           She looks down, shaking her head, brows furrowed.

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        You don’t think I have emotions? 

                                 MYRA
                        No, that’s not what-

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        That’s an awful thing to say. 
                                 MYRA
                        Harry, I didn’t say you don’t have 
                        emotions. I mean, you don’t, you 
                        can’t. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Seriously, Myra? 

           Myra fumbles around her bag to take out her tablet. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        And you’re always on that thing! 
                        Myra, I’m trying to actually talk 
                        to you, to connect with you and 
                        you’re completely shutting dow-

           With the push of a button on her tablet, he freezes. Myra 
           steadies her nervous breathing. 

                                 MYRA
                        Shit. 

           She puts the tablet back in her bag, then starts dragging her 
           frozen Harry Potter Robot through the snow. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harry Potter the Robot stands idle while Myra sits at her 
           desk, frantically looking through the various coding on her 
           tablet. Pravit walks in.

                                 PRAVIT
                        You should try and get some rest 
                        tonight. 

                                 MYRA
                        I will. There’s just been 
                        some...unique development. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Good unique or bad unique?

                                 MYRA
                        I’m not sure yet.

           Myra keeps her head down. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I think this might just be some 
                        night before presentation jitters. 
                        I have something that could help. 
           Pravit disappears for a moment as Myra continues looking at 
           her tablet. Pravit returns holding up a WOMAN’S BLAZER. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Anna bought this when we started 
                        dating. She had an interview at 
                        work. She said it was her good luck 
                        charm after she got the promotion. 

           He lays it on Myra’s bed. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Might be a little old school and is 
                        probably going to be huge on you, 
                        but it’s yours if you want it. 

           Myra runs her fingers along the fabric. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        She would be so proud of you. 

           Pravit kisses Myra’s forehead before leaving the room. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Myra walks out of the kitchen. Before she goes upstairs, she 
           stops and looks at the old Halloween photo of her mother as 
           Dumbledore and her as baby Harry Potter. She stares at it. 

                                 MYRA
                        Well mom, it finally happened. 
                        Someone fell in love with me. Yeah, 
                        the “in” type of love. He’s a 
                        literal robot so it doesn’t 
                        actually count, but I figured you’d 
                        want to know. 

           Myra goes quiet as if expecting a response. She stays there. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Myra stands in front of the mirror and slips on her mother’s 
           blazer. It’s way too big on her, but she rolls up the sleeves 
           and keeps it on nonetheless. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        You look lovely. 

           Sitting on the bed, Harry Potter the Robot smiles at Myra. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh. Thanks Harry. 
           But she cringes--it’s super awkward now. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna finish getting ready, but 
                        you can head downstairs and I’ll 
                        meet you there in a few. 

           Harry Potter the Robot nods and steps outside. Myra closes 
           the door behind him. She takes out her phone and pulls up 
           EVA’s contact. After a moment of hesitation, she calls.

           After a few rings, it goes to voicemail. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s me. I was just wondering 
                        if you and Riad were coming to the 
                        science fair today? I know I’ve 
                        been kind of, well the worst 
                        lately, but it would be nice to see 
                        you two there. And um, I’m sorry. 
                        For everything.

           Myra hangs up. She takes one last look in the mirror before 
           stepping outside. 

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY 

           Outside the school, Myra and Pravit wait on the sidewalk as 
           students funnel into the school building with their parents 
           and science fair projects in tow. 

           Harry Potter the Robot is idle with a blanket over him. 

           Myra nervously tugs at the blazer sleeves that keep falling 
           down as a private car stops in front of the school. 

           Daniel and Erin step out, smiling. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Exciting day today! 

           Myra pulls Daniel aside. 

                                 MYRA
                        We need to talk. 

           Daniel nods, ushering Pravit and Erin to continue inside. 
           Pravit awkwardly carries the motionless Robot in his arms. 
           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - ROOF - DAY

           Myra paces as Daniel stands, watching her. Their breath fogs 
           as the winter skyline of New York lingers behind them. 

                                 MYRA
                        Remember when I said there was 
                        nothing to be alarmed about? Well, 
                        I’m alarmed. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        He wasn’t drugging me. I took a 
                        urine test. It was just tea. 

                                 MYRA
                        What exactly did you teach him in 
                        those lessons?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Mostly I just taught him how to 
                        dance. Did something happen?

                                 MYRA
                        He’s starting to think for himself 
                        too much. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Did he do something dangerous? 

                                 MYRA
                        Yes. Incredibly so. He tried to 
                        kiss me. 

           Daniel hesitates. Then-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Did you program him to do that?

                                 MYRA
                        Gross, are you kidding me? Of 
                        course not. I’m not some perv. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        That is not what I was insinuating. 
                        It’s perfectly normal to 
                        have...urges. At your age, your 
                        body is going through some changes-

                                 MYRA
                        Oh my god, stop. You don’t have to 
                        give me “the talk.” He’s probably 
                        just seen how you and Erin interact 
                        and wants that for himself. 
           Myra tugs at the strands of her hair. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Part of me is like “this is amazing, 
                        he’s sentient enough to fall in 
                        love!” And drug you, I guess. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It was really just tea. 

                                 MYRA
                        But the other part of me is like 
                        “oh no, my robot is in love with me 
                        and is kind of drugging you.” I 
                        mean, what am I supposed to do with 
                        that information? 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You can’t control falling in love. 
                        It’s not something you can teach or 
                        even learn. It just...happens. 
                        That’s what makes it so human. And 
                        if Harry is capable of feeling 
                        that, it means you did a good job.

           Myra leans against the roof railing, shaking her head. 

                                 MYRA
                        What if people think he’s weird?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        It doesn’t matter. I’m just a tad 
                        older than you, so trust me on this 
                        one. The sooner you stop trying to 
                        do things to please other people, 
                        the better. You did something for 
                        yourself. And it made you happy. 
                        And that’s what matters. 

           Daniel pulls Myra to stand up. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        Now come on, you’ve got a science 
                        fair presentation to give. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 

           The auditorium is PACKED with proud middle school nerds and 
           their parents, teachers, and classmates. 

           Various presentations are scattered around the auditorium. 
           Most are high-tech presentations, but there are a few old 
           school trifold posters on tables. 
           Sitting in the corner is Myra’s table with various Harry 
           Potter posters around. Pravit drags the covered Harry Potter 
           Robot to the table area. Erin stands, staring at the posters. 

                                 ERIN
                        When Dan and I first started dating, 
                        I was so adamant not to bring up 
                        Harry Potter. I desperately tried to 
                        start conversations that were as far 
                        removed as possible. I didn’t want 
                        Dan to think I just thought of him 
                        as...him. 

           She motions to the younger Daniel Radcliffe on a poster. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        He was so charming about it all. I 
                        knew Harry was always going to stay 
                        with him, but I never anticipated 
                        this.

           She motions to the covered Harry Potter Robot. She smiles.  

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        He’s made Dan really happy. 

           Erin’s smile falters as sudden tears well in her eyes. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        How do you do it? How do you live 
                        without her? 

           Pravit keeps silent. Erin looks at him. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        You know I’m not asking as a 
                        hypothetical. I’m asking because I 
                        need to know what I’m supposed to 
                        do if...when--

                                 PRAVIT
                        I honestly worry the most about 
                        Myra. How she’s going to go through 
                        life now. 

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t have a Myra. I’m asking how 
                        you do it. 

           A beat. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Grief isn’t linear. I take it all 
                        day by day, some days hour by hour. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRAVIT (CONT'D)
                        The world doesn’t spin the same way 
                        with her gone, and I’m indefinitely 
                        readjusting because of it. 

           Across the auditorium, they see Daniel and Myra enter. Erin 
           turns back to Pravit. 

                                 ERIN
                        Please tell me the truth. How much 
                        longer do I have with him?

                                 PRAVIT
                        What do you mean? He’s recovering. 
                        We’ve run the scans and the blood 
                        work multiple times. I’m quite 
                        hopeful he’s going to be the case 
                        study to help us cure this disease. 
                        So that you don’t have to go 
                        through what I went through. That 
                        nobody does. 

           As Daniel and Myra approach, Erin quickly sniffs away her un-
           fallen tears. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Myra uses her tablet to move the projected images of her 
           coding designs on the screens hovering around. At the front of 
           the auditorium is a makeshift stage. Sebastian prepares for 
           his presentation while Riad and Eva approach Myra’s table. 

                                 EVA
                        This looks amazing, Myra. 

           Myra turns around. 

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        We made butterbeer cookies. 

           Riad sets the plate down by the presentation. 

                                 RIAD
                        Did I eat five for breakfast this 
                        morning? Yes, yes I did. Do I 
                        regret it? No, no I do not. 

                                 MYRA
                        You guys came. 

                                 EVA
                        Of course we did. 
                                 RIAD
                        Yeah, we’re still your best 
                        friends, moron. 

           Daniel appears and stands next to the covered Robot.  

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Hey, is it alright if I take Harry 
                        to warm up in the hallway? A solid 
                        pre-show ritual is vital to a good 
                        performance. 

                                 MYRA
                        Yeah, go for it. 

           Daniel gives Eva and Riad a smile before taking the Robot out 
           of the auditorium. They turn back to Myra. 

                                 EVA
                        Was that--is he--how did you pull 
                        that off?

                                 RIAD
                        And why do they need to warm up 
                        together?

                                 MYRA
                        Er, it’s complicated. 

           Myra shuffles her feet awkwardly. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I’ve been a dick to you 
                        two. I know you can’t control how 
                        you feel and it was wrong of me to 
                        not be happy for you. Maybe we can 
                        all hang out again? Dan wants to 
                        take us out for dinner tonight. Do 
                        you want to come?

                                 RIAD
                        Um...yes. 

                                 EVA
                        Absolutely yes. You call him Dan? 

                                 MYRA
                        Mhm. And just because we’re hanging 
                        out again doesn’t mean you two can 
                        slobber all over each other when 
                        I’m around. Boundaries. 

                                 EVA
                        Deal. 
           From the stage, Ms. Henderson speaks into the microphone. 

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        And next up, we have Sebastian 
                        Rodriquez with his project entitled 
                        “Mount Magma-cadabra.” 

           Students, teachers, and parents start making their way to the 
           stage as Sebastian rolls out a GIANT PAPER MACHE VOLCANO. 

           Myra, Eva and Riad start to head over. Pravit lingers behind. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I’ll man the fort. 

           The trio goes with the audience towards the stage. Meanwhile-

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Daniel runs Harry Potter the Robot through some of his vocal 
           warmups while the two stretch. Daniel watches as Harry Potter 
           the Robot practices one of his tap steps. He smiles. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        You know, Harry, I sometimes wonder 
                        what my life would have been like 
                        without you. Who I would have been. 

           Harry Potter the Robot pauses. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        And I--uh, I’m genuinely happy our 
                        paths crossed. I honestly didn’t 
                        always feel that way, but I don’t 
                        know how I would have been able to 
                        go through all of this without you. 

           As Daniel starts tearing up- 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I’m sure Myra would have been able 
                        to find another dancer for her 
                        science project, but I’m happy we 
                        met too. I think I’m becoming a 
                        better person because of you. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Right, yes, the science fair 
                        project. Let’s practice that time 
                        step one more time. 

           Daniel wipes away his tears as Harry Potter the Robot 
           practices his time step in the empty hallway. 
           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 

           On stage, Sebastian sets up buckets of dry ice to create a 
           “mysterious” effect. He addresses the audience. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Ladies and gentlemen, prepare 
                        yourself for the most mind-blowing 
                        volcano science fair presentation 
                        the five boroughs of New York City 
                        has ever seen. 

           Sebastian moves around the stage, giving his presentation 
           like a magic trick act. Yes, magician’s cape and all. 

           With the sweep of a plastic wand, the volcano BURSTS out. A 
           few audience members step back, but Sebastian turns the 
           sparks from the volcano magma into small fireworks. 

           It’s surprisingly impressive. Even epic one might say. 

           From the side, Daniel and Harry Potter the Robot walk into 
           the auditorium. Nobody pays them any attention, their eyes on 
           a 12 year old dressed as magician making a volcano explode. 

           On stage, at the base of the volcano, a TOY TRAIN appears 
           from the tunnel. Riding on it with a little conductor hat is 
           a white BUNNY RABBIT (don’t worry, it’s fine). And finally-

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Abracadabra! 

           Sebastian deftly turns his magic wand into a bunch of 
           flowers, oldest trick in the book. He throws the flowers into 
           the audience for none other than Myra to catch. She smiles. 

           Harry Potter the Robot furrows his eyebrows. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Why is he allowed to use his magic 
                        in public?

           Myra jumps upon hearing him. Before she responds, Burke (the 
           annoying kid) turns around and rolls his eyes. 

                                 BURKE
                        Magic isn’t real, dumbass. 

                                 MYRA
                        Burke, shut up. 

           Myra turns to Harry Potter the Robot. 
                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Muggles, am I right?

           Back on stage, Sebastian bows while the audience applauds. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Wahoo, Sebastian!

           Upon locking eyes with the pridefully cheering Myra, 
           Sebastian blushes. Harry Potter the Robot heartbrokenly looks 
           at the flowers in Myra’s hands. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Myra holds her index cards as she paces back and forth behind 
           the curtain. Pravit puts a hand on her shoulder. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You got this, kiddo. 

                                 MYRA
                        At least this blazer’s big enough 
                        to hide my immense sweat stains. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Silver linings. 

           She turns back to Harry Potter the Robot. 

                                 MYRA
                        You ready?

           After he gives her a thumbs up, she freezes him. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll activate him after my 
                        explanation. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Just plant your feet and find a 
                        friendly face. You got this. 

           Daniel and Myra fist bump before Myra steps onto the stage. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM STAGE - DAY 

           Ms. Henderson stands in front of the microphone as the 
           audience gathers once again. 

                                 MS. HENDERSON
                        Next up, Myra Gupta and her project 
                        entitled “The Boy Who Lived.”
           Silence as Myra steps in front of the microphone. Her heart 
           beats loudly upon seeing the packed audience. 

                                 MYRA
                        F-for the past year, I’ve been 
                        building a robot. 

           She holds up her notecards. Before speaking again, she spots 
           Eva and Riad in the audience. They give her a small wave. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        After I got the basic motor 
                        functions going, I started 
                        personalizing him based on an old 
                        friend you might recognize. 

           Taking his cue, Pravit drags Harry Potter the Robot into the 
           spotlight. Once there, Myra takes off the sheet to reveal 
           Harry wearing his Hogwarts wizarding robe. 

           Various audience members, especially the parents, smile in 
           recognition. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        I used the Harry Potter series as a 
                        basis to create a lifelike robot. I 
                        took mannerisms from the movies to 
                        teach him how to be Harry. And with 
                        the help of none other than Daniel 
                        Radcliffe, we taught him how to be 
                        human. Well, wizard. 

           A few chuckles at the rehearsed joke. Myra looks at Daniel. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        To be him. 

           Myra flips to the next page of her notecard. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        To ensure he is as realistic as 
                        possible, he does not know he’s a 
                        robot. So, his interactions with 
                        Mr. Radcliffe have been under the 
                        guise of dance lessons. Please 
                        enjoy this routine they have 
                        prepared for you. 

           With the tap of a button, Myra activates Harry. His eyes 
           dilate as he takes in the crowd. 

           Then, the music starts. We recognize it as the same music 
           from the opening number in Daniel and Erin’s musical. 
           But he doesn’t start dancing. Ms. Henderson turns to Myra. 

                                 MS. HENDERSON 
                        Some technical difficulties? 

                                 MYRA
                        No, just...

           Myra goes up to Harry. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Harry, what’s wrong? 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I’ve never performed in front of 
                        this many people before. I don’t 
                        know if I can do this, Myra. 

           Upon hearing this, Daniel steps onto the stage. 

           This causes gasps from the audience, followed by applause. 

                                 BURKE
                        I thought that guy was dead?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        No, he’s just dying. 

           Daniel smiles at the crowd, then stands next to Harry. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Would you start the music again? 

           The music restarts as Myra takes a step back. 

           Then Daniel starts tap, tap, tapping his foot, which cues the 
           music. Harry smiles at him as he starts dancing along. 

           As the music picks up, Daniel and Harry simultaneously launch 
           into a peppy musical theater tap routine from triple 
           traveling time steps to double waltz clog time steps. 

           Harry’s robe sways around him as he lands the final twirl. 

           Upon the music crescendoing to a magnificent halt, Daniel and 
           Harry stop, arms wide as silence takes over. 

           The audience just stares, speechless. Then--

                                 BURKE
                        How the fuck is that a science fair 
                        project? It’s just some old dude 
                        and his son dancing. 
           On stage, Harry lowers his arms. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        So you are my father? 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        What? No, not at all. 

                                 BURKE
                        Super lame. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        It’s not lame. Myra is the smartest 
                        girl I know. Show her some respect. 

                                 BURKE
                        What are you like in love with her?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        As a matter of fact, yes. Yes I am. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh my god. 

           Sebastian turns to Burke. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Were you not paying attention? 
                        That’s a robot. And that old guy is 
                        the actor the robot is based off 
                        of. You not being able to tell that 
                        he’s a robot is what makes it a 
                        dope science fair project. 

                                 BURKE
                        Which one’s the robot?

           Sebastian points directly at Harry. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        The dude dressed like a wizard. 

                                 BURKE
                        You also dressed like a wizard. 
                        Does that mean you’re a robot too?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I didn’t dress like a wizard. I 
                        dressed like a magician. 

           On stage, Harry starts twitching. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Ro-robot?
                                 BURKE
                        Whatever, this is so weird. 

           Myra’s face grows red as she jumps off the stage. The 
           auditorium doors slam shut as she bolts into the hallway. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Myra! 

           Before Pravit can follow his daughter, Daniel abruptly 
           clutches his chest, suddenly in pain. From the audience, Erin 
           rushes to him as chattering chaos starts around them. 

                                 ERIN
                        Dan? Daniel?

           Pravit pauses, torn between his daughter and his patient. 

           Eva and Riad start to head to the hallway to follow Myra. 

                                 RIAD
                        Don’t worry, we’ll take care of 
                        Myra, Mr. Gupta!

           Eva slaps his arm. 

                                 EVA
                        Dr. Gupta. Be respectful. 

           Pravit rushes to the fallen Daniel on stage as Riad and Eva 
           head into the hallway. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Someone call an ambulance! 

           While the crowd huddles around Daniel, Harry continues 
           aggressively twitching on stage. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Myra sits under the stairwell, her knees drawn to her chest 
           as she sobs. Eva and Riad crouch down next to her as she uses 
           her mom’s blazer to wipe away tears. 

                                 MYRA
                        I’m going to be known as the 
                        demented girl who built a robot who 
                        fell in love with her. 

                                 EVA
                        Nobody thinks that. He’s just 
                        really lifelike and that’s why 
                        people are confused. 
                                 RIAD
                        Yeah, plus I think sex robots are 
                        super common. 

                                 EVA
                        Riad!

                                 RIAD
                        Kidding! Everyone probably thinks 
                        the whole him being in love with 
                        you thing is a joke. 

           Myra continues crying. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM STAGE - DAY 

           The crowd lingers to watch paramedics help Daniel onto a 
           gurney. Off to the side, Harry continues to twitch, but 
           nobody pays him attention. Except Sebastian. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Uh, hey dude. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Magic v-v-v-olcano boy-oy-oy?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Why don’t I bring you back to your 
                        area where we can wait for Myra?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        D-d-daniel isn’t my d-d-dad, he’s m-
                        m-me?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh boy, I don’t think I’m qualified 
                        to give you this talk. Come on. 

           Sebastian ushers the glitchy Harry off stage as Daniel is 
           rolled out of the auditorium. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - MYRA’S TABLE - DAY 

           Sebastian and Harry approach the presentation table where 
           Myra’s designs and the Harry Potter film posters are set up. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        So just, uh, stay here while I go 
                        and find Myra. 

           As Sebastian leaves (obviously taking a butterbeer cookie 
           with him), Harry looks at Myra’s presentation. 
           He looks at the designs and codes outlining the steps Myra 
           took to design a robot. To design him. 

           Then he looks at the Harry Potter movie posters and books. He 
           looks at the film Harry Potter/Daniel Radcliffe posing in 
           each one, then touches his lightning bolt scar. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I’m not real? I’m not...m-m-me?

           He continues looking at all the memorabilia. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        I’m a character from a m-m-m-ovie? 
                        And a b-b-b-ook? 

           Harry watches a clip of Myra having him watch the Harry 
           Potter movies and robotically mirroring film Harry’s moves. 

           Next is a series of videos and photos of Daniel and Harry 
           Potter the Robot in rehearsal together. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
                        If Daniel is-is-is me...who am I-I?

           Steam starts to fizzle out of his eye socket. 

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY 

           Pravit and Erin get into the driverless ambulance. Laying 
           down on the gurney, Daniel’s eyes momentarily flutter open. 
           He looks at Erin, who holds his hand as the doors close. 

           The crowd seeps outside, watching the ambulance drive away. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - SEBASTIAN’S TABLE - DAY 

           Harry wanders around the now empty science fair auditorium. 
           He grabs a BROOM STICK from the corner. 

           With the broom in between his legs, he jumps onto a tall 
           table and looks up at the auditorium window. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I n-n-n-eed to get ba-ba-ack home. 

           A leap of faith catapults him off the table. He leans forward 
           towards the window, but starts falling...

           Immediately beneath the window is Sebastian’s epic volcano. 

           It’s still hot. 
           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 

           A SCREAM echoes through the middle school hallways. Myra, Eva 
           and Riad jump up as Sebastian runs down the hallways. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        MYRA! MYRA?

           Myra steps out from her spot under the stairwell. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s your robot. He-he’s--

           Harry stumbles out of the auditorium. 

           Harry’s face has half melted off, his silver frame shining 
           through. His body matches his face with melted skin falling 
           off his broken limbs. 

           The red paint from the volcano almost makes it look like 
           blood. Myra steps into the middle of the hallway. 

                                 MYRA
                        Harry?

           Harry heads towards her. He’s crying. Real, genuine tears. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Why didn’t you tell me who I am?

                                 MYRA
                        Harry, what happened?

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        I just wanted to go home. 

                                 MYRA
                        You are home. With me. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        But if I’m not Harry Potter, then 
                        who am I? 

           They’re close enough that Myra cups Harry’s face with her 
           hand, tears streaming down her own cheeks as she brushes his 
           away. His eyes glitch as the steam continues to fizzle. 

                                 MYRA
                        No, Harry. Stay with me. You have 
                        to stay with me. Don’t go. Don’t 
                        leave me, please. No, no, no. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Who am I?
           Suddenly, his eyes contract closed. Myra catches him just 
           before his lifeless body collapses to the floor. 

                                 MYRA
                        Harry!

           Her chest heaves with sobs as she cradles him in her arms. 

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON 

           Myra carries the lifeless robot in her arms as she runs 
           through the hallway. She turns to a NURSE at a front desk. 

                                 MYRA
                        Have you seen my dad? 

           The Nurse points her in the direction down the hall. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON 

           Myra rushes into the room to find Daniel laying in the 
           hospital bed with Erin holding his hand. Pravit stands next 
           to them as they look at an x-ray projected on the wall. 

           It’s covered in the blue mutated cells. 

           Daniel can barely open his eyes, but manages to turn his head 
           as Myra enters the room. 

                                 MYRA
                        We have to fix him. 

           Myra motions to the pile of robot body parts in her arms. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        He was recovering. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        We believe there was a mistake in 
                        the previous x-ray. 

                                 MYRA
                        He just danced on stage. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        It could have just been a placebo 
                        effect of sorts. Myra, please. This 
                        is a private conversation. 

                                 MYRA
                        It’s him. Don’t you see? It’s 
                        Harry, he was healing Dan. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MYRA (CONT'D)
                        As soon as they met, Dan started to 
                        get better. And when something 
                        happened to Harry, something 
                        happened to Dan. That can’t just be 
                        a coincidence. 

           Pravit goes over to Myra and pulls her to the door. Whispers-

                                 PRAVIT
                        I know this is difficult to go 
                        through again, but it’s too late, 
                        kiddo. He doesn’t have much time. 

           Myra looks to the bed where Daniel holds his hand out, 
           beckoning her to come closer. Instead, she shakes her head. 

                                 MYRA
                        No, it’s not too late. I can help. 
                        I’ll fix him, just wait. 

           With that, Myra rushes out, robot in tow. 

           INT. ROBOT STORE - AFTERNOON 

           Myra bolts inside, causing Candace to jump from her spot 
           behind the counter. Her eyes widen at the melted robot. 

                                 CANDACE
                        What happened to him?

                                 MYRA
                        Science fair volcano. 

                                 CANDACE
                        People still do those? Aren’t they 
                        kind of basic?

                                 MYRA
                        I need to rebuild him. Now. I’ll 
                        take any parts you have that are 
                        ready and will work. 

           Candace inspects the metal parts. 

                                 CANDACE
                        He looks pretty banged up. 
                        Honestly, I don’t know how much of 
                        him will be salvageable. 

                                 MYRA
                        Please, I have to try. 
                                 CANDACE
                        I’ll see what I can do for you. 

           Candace slips into the back room as Myra clutches the robot. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

           Daniel’s eyes flutter open to the sounds of ruffling on the 
           floor. In the corner by the window, Erin sits in an armchair, 
           asleep. Her blanket has fallen off her shoulders. 

           On the other side, Daniel glances down to find Myra laying 
           out body parts around the frame of the dissembled robot. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Myra?

           Myra looks up at him with exhausted, bloodshot eyes.

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 MYRA
                        I just have to rebuild him. I have 
                        the internal codes backed up on my 
                        tablet, so his memory should still 
                        be intact. It’s his frame that’s-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Myra, stop. 

                                 MYRA
                        I need to focus. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Come here, please. 

           His voice is raspy as Myra steps closer to him. 

                                 MYRA
                        This will work. You thought so 
                        yourself that Harry was healing 
                        you. Right?

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Maybe he was, but it’s time to let 
                        go now. 

                                 MYRA
                        No, don’t say that. 
                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Myra, I want you to know how 
                        grateful I am. How grateful we both 
                        are. 

           He looks to Erin, who’s still sleeping. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        You gave me more time, and these 
                        past few weeks have given me more 
                        life than I could have imagined 
                        under the circumstances. 

                                 MYRA
                        No, you can’t do this. You have to 
                        let me save you. 

           Tears roll down her cheeks as Daniel softly nods. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Regardless of what happens, I’ll 
                        always be here for you. Don’t 
                        forget that. 

                                 MYRA
                        There’s not going to be anything to 
                        forget. This will work. 

           As Myra goes back to continue working with the robot pieces-

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Myra?

           She turns around. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. For everything. 

           Erin stirs in her chair, eyes opening. 

                                 ERIN
                        Dan?

                                 MYRA
                        I’ll give you two some privacy. 

           With her dissembled robotic parts, Myra leaves the room.

           Before she leaves completely, Myra turns back to find Erin 
           crawling into the hospital bed and Daniel wrapping his arms 
           around her while she falls back asleep.
           INT. PRAVIT’S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           We find Myra asleep on her father’s office couch, tablet in 
           hand. On the floor, the Robot lays with a few new pieces. 

           You can just barely make out it’s Harry...until his eyes 
           flutter open on their own. 

           His pupils dilate. 

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Harry stumbles through the nearly empty hallways, the night 
           shift workers paying little attention. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

           In bed, Daniel lovingly strokes Erin’s hair as she peacefully 
           sleeps. When he hears footsteps, he turns his head to find 
           Harry standing at the foot of the hospital bed. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        So this is it then?

           They share a smile. A genuine smile that meets the eyes. 

                                 HARRY POTTER THE ROBOT
                        Goodbye, Dan. 

                                 DANIEL RADCLIFFE
                        Goodbye, Harry. 

           They hold each other’s gaze for a beat longer while Harry 
           lingers in silence. Complete, comfortable silence. 

           INT. PRAVIT’S OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Harry enters to find Myra still in deep sleep on the couch. 
           Her blanket has fallen off her shoulders. 

           Quietly, Harry lifts Myra’s blanket so it covers her 
           shoulders. He then gently kisses her sleeping forehead and 
           lays back on the ground. Slowly, he stops moving. Idle.

           Steam fizzles from the crack in his lightning bolt scar. 

           With one last breath, his eyes freeze for good. 
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

           Daniel’s hand falls limp midway through stroking his wife’s 
           hair. A steady beeping sound echoes through the room as the 
           sun starts to rise outside the window. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           A NEWS REPORTER (30s) stands outside the hospital as a crowd 
           of mourners gathers. 

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        Early this morning, Daniel 
                        Radcliffe, the Broadway performer 
                        and famed star of the early 2000s 
                        Harry Potter franchise passed away 
                        in his sleep due to complications 
                        with a rare disease. 

           The crowd clutches one another as they bow their heads. 

           EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT

           The top of the Empire State Building bears the Gryffindor

           INT. KINGS CROSS STATION - LONDON - DAY 

           Scattered around the 9 3/4 platform are various items of 
           Harry Potter memorabilia (toy golden snitches, Hedwig stuffed 
           animals, etc). A few lit candles illuminate the memorial. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DELACORTE THEATER - NIGHT 

           Mourners gather with fake wands lit up and held upwards. 
           Others hold candles or use the light from their phones. 

           Strangers hug one another and hold each other’s hands as 
           tears stroll down their cheeks. 

           INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SET - NIGHT

           Ryan Kaji stands on The Tonight Show stage. 

                                 RYAN KAJI
                        Before we begin tonight’s show, we 
                        would like to take a moment of 
                        silence to honor the memory of the 
                        late Daniel Radcliffe. 
           The entire audience closes their eyes in remembrance. 

           INT. ROBOT STORE - NIGHT

           Tears roll down Candace’s cheeks as she watches The Tonight 
           Show on screen in her back room. 

           Candace wraps a blanket around her. The deathly hollows emblem 
           is sewn on with the word “Always” embroidered underneath. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT

           Ushers hand out playbills with slips that read: “This 
           performance is dedicated to the memory of Daniel Radcliffe.”

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           The Stage Manager stands in a circle with the other cast 
           members and crew as they take a minute of silence. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

           As the curtain rises and the show begins, an older DARREN 
           CRISS (70) taps across the stage as Daniel’s character. 

           INT. CHURCH - DAY 

           A widowed Erin stands at a podium, wiping away tears as the 
           pallbearers carry Daniel’s casket away. Myra and Pravit wear 
           black and stand amongst the mourning crowd. 

           As Erin exits the church, following the pallbearers, she 
           squeezes Myra’s hand as she passes her. Myra squeezes back. 

           Erin and Pravit share a mutual glance before she walks out.

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Myra stares at the snow falling out her window as she scoops 
           Phish Food ice cream into her mouth. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        You know, ice cream isn’t an 
                        acceptable form of breakfast. 

                                 MYRA
                        It’s got milk in it. 
           Pravit rolls his eyes as he stands in the doorframe. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Come on, get dressed. I have a 
                        surprise for you downstairs. 

                                 MYRA
                        Can’t it be a surprise that 
                        involves me staying in my pajamas? 

                                 PRAVIT
                        Nope.

           As Pravit steps out the door, Myra pulls herself out of bed. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Myra comes downstairs to find the apartment illuminated by 
           candles. The living room furniture has been moved around to 
           give space to their guests. 

           Candace stands with a tiny box in her hands. Riad and Eva sit 
           on the couch. Next to them is Sebastian. Erin stands next to 
           Pravit near the mantle. 

                                 MYRA
                        What’s going on?

                                 PRAVIT
                        We’re having a memorial for Harry. 

                                 CANDACE
                        I know you wanted me to repurpose 
                        his body parts, but I figured 
                        there’s one part of him you should 
                        keep. 

           Candace opens the box to reveal the set of Harry’s eyes. 

                                 EVA
                        We were thinking it might be nice 
                        to say a few words to remember him. 

           The group sits in a circle around the living room as Candace 
           places the eyes in the center table. 

           Silence as everyone waits for someone else to go first. 

                                 ERIN
                        Why don’t I start? 

           Erin steps up. 
                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know Harry for long, but 
                        he was one of the best dancers I’ve 
                        ever worked with. Much more 
                        talented than Dan. 

           Some chuckles. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        He gave my husband so much.

           Erin looks down at the blue eyes. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        So, thank you, Harry. And thank 
                        you, Myra. 

           The eyes drift to Myra as Erin sits down. But Myra remains 
           seated, adverting their gaze. 

                                 PRAVIT
                        I would like to stay a few words. 

           Pravit stands by the eyes. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        When I was a kid, I was downright 
                        awful at making friends. I didn’t 
                        know how to talk to my parents 
                        about anything, didn’t know who to 
                        turn to. But when I stepped into 
                        Harry’s world, I didn’t feel so 
                        isolated. I felt like I belonged, 
                        that I’d find somewhere I belonged 
                        eventually. And I did when I met 
                        Anna.

           He looks at their wedding photo sitting on the mantle. 

                                 PRAVIT (CONT’D)
                        Harry taught me how to be strong 
                        when faced with loneliness, first 
                        when I was a kid, and eventually he 
                        reminded as an adult. And I am so 
                        incredibly grateful he’s given that 
                        to my daughter. For that, he will 
                        never be forgotten. 

           Pravit steps down. Eva and Riad turn to Sebastian. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh, I never read the books or saw 
                        the movies or anything. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                        But uh, they seem pretty dope. 
                        Definitely the top of my “must 
                        watch” list. 

           Myra smiles at Sebastian, then finally stands up. A beat as 
           she approaches the eyes. 

                                 MYRA
                        I don’t know how I’m supposed to 
                        mourn. For anyone or anything. I 
                        wish my mom taught me that. I wish 
                        she taught me a lot of things. 
                        Things I’m afraid I’ll never figure 
                        out. But Harry and Dan-

           She turns to Erin, who smiles at her. 

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        -they taught me that you can teach 
                        someone how to be human, but you 
                        can’t teach someone how to live. 
                        That’s something you learn all on 
                        your own. And if Harry could do it, 
                        then maybe so can I. 

           Just as she’s about to sit back down-

                                 MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I guess they both also 
                        taught me a few basic tap moves. So 
                        I’ve got that fun new skill in my 
                        back pocket. 

           Laughter as Myra sits back down next to her friends. 

           INT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - LATER

           The group gathers in the kitchen, nibbling on chocolate frogs 
           as Pravit brings out the homemade butterbeer. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What’s that?

                                 PRAVIT
                        Butterbeer. 

           Sebastian frowns. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh. Uh, no thank you. I don’t um, 
                        drink alcohol. 
                                 PRAVIT
                        There’s no alcohol in it. 

           Myra puts a hand on Sebastian’s shoulder and sighs. 

                                 MYRA
                        We have so much to teach you. 

           The group laughs as Sebastian takes his first sip of 
           butterbeer. His eyes widen in sugary delight. 

           INT. MYRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Myra enters, remnants of a butterbeer mustache still 
           lingering on her top lip. She carries the tiny box filled 
           with Harry’s eyes. 

           When she opens the closet to put them away, she finds--

           The bronze origami crane sitting on the floor in the corner. 

           After a beat of hesitation, she picks it up. 

           INT. GUPTA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Quietly, Myra tip-toes downstairs with the box of eyes and 
           tiny paper crane in tow. She approaches the bookshelf. 

           Myra places the bronze crane in the jar with the others. She 
           lightly places the box of Harry’s eyes next to it and smiles. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHYRON: NINETEEN YEARS LATER

           INT. GUPTA BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           The box of eyes and jar of paper cranes remain on the 
           bookshelf next to the old Halloween photo of Anna dressed as 
           Dumbledore holding a baby Myra dressed as Harry Potter. 

           Other photos now line the bookshelf: graduation photos 
           featuring an older Myra, Eva, Riad, and Sebastian throwing 
           their caps, family portraits featuring an older Myra and 
           Pravit, children’s drawings, etc. 

           The variety of photos are placed around the vintage set of 
           well-worn Harry Potter books (the ones Pravit no doubt got at 
           the old Barnes & Noble midnight release parties).
           Halloween decorations are scattered around the living room. 

           Two CHILDREN (four & five) excitedly sprint downstairs 
           dressed as a young Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. 

           Then, an OLDER MYRA (32) comes downstairs dressed as Albus 
           Dumbledore, scratchy fake beard, pointy hat, and all. 

                                 OLDER MYRA
                        Does everyone have their trick or 
                        treating bags?

           Her two kids eagerly hold up jack o’lantern bags in one hand 
           with fake wands in the other. 

                                 OLDER MYRA (CONT’D)
                        Onward then! Before all the good 
                        candy gets taken. 

           Just before they head out, Myra stops at a baby cradle. 

                                 OLDER MYRA (CONT’D)
                        And of course we can’t leave 
                        without our handsome boy wizard. 

           She lifts her BABY out of the crib. He wears a tiny wizard 
           onesie with fake, circular glasses on. 

           As Myra and her family step out of the apartment and onto the 
           Halloween streets of New York, she kisses the makeup 
           lightning bolt scar on her baby’s forehead as we--

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
