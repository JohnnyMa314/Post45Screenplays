           We HEAR the swirling bubbles of a jacuzzi.

                             FOUR SEASONS, BALI INDONESIA 1994

           The outdoor patio of a luxury suite. Dusk.

           POV CAM-CORDER VIEWFINDER:

           Amidst tropical palms and turquoise tiles, heavy condensation 
           obscures a fleshy figure seated in a jacuzzi.

           The image is wobbly and hand-held. It’s operator, ELAINE, 
           remains off camera.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Are you rolling?

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        It’s all steamy?! 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Flip the thingie open!

           The steam clears. We’re CLOSE ON -- a larger than life blonde 
           in a bikini, her hair in beaded corn-rows. She lays in the 
           bubbles. One leg tossed up on the ledge a la Marilyn. 

           The blonde is twenty-six-year-old ANNA NICOLE SMITH, the 
           Texan Playboy Bunny, known to her family as Vickie-Lynn.

           She looks directly at us. 

                                 ANNA
                        We’re here on our honeymoon in Bali 
                        Indonesia. It’s almost Nineteen-
                        Ninety-Four. And we’re having the 
                        most amazing time. Isn’t that 
                        right, Paw-Paw?

           The cam-corder zooms out to reveal J HOWARD MARSHALL II (89), 
           a mischievous octogenarian with an irrepressible smile, 
           seated next to her in the jacuzzi. 

           He wears large, post-eye exam style sunglasses, a Hawaiian 
           shirt opened over a tank top, and a straw hat.

                                 HOWARD
                        Best honeymoon ever. I should know, 
                        I’ve had four of ‘em.

           He smiles with giddiness and takes off his glasses. Are those 
           tears in his eyes? At his age, emotions hit hard.
                                 ANNA
                        Howard, sing or something.

                                 HOWARD
                        He was the cockeyed mayor of 
                        Kaunakakai. The horse he rode was 
                        skin-knee. A broken down old 
                        female. So he placed a big panini. 
                        Right under that horse's tail, Oh!

           Anna uses a loose palm frond to aid in a goofy Polynesian 
           dance. She’s a natural ham, someone who enjoys life’s simple 
           joys with as much vigor as the grand ones.

                                 HOWARD
                        He wore a malo and a coconut hat... 

           Howard gestures to his head...

                                 HOWARD
                        One was for this...

           And then his crotch.

                                 HOWARD
                        ...and the other for that.

           Anna loves his raunchy delivery.

                                 ANNA
                        Tell the camera what you told me... 
                        about after you’re gone.   

                                 HOWARD
                        Where am I going?

                                 ANNA
                        Howard! You know what I’m sayin.

           The camera jostles. Anna strips off her bikini and tosses it.

                                 ANNA
                        I know my husband is gonna live 
                        ‘til a hundred and ten, but when he 
                        does leave me all alone in this 
                        cold world, he promised me I’d 
                        always be taken care of——

           She nudges Howard.

                                 HOWARD
                        My bride will never have to worry 
                        her entire life.  
                                 ANNA
                        Be more specific.

           She grabs the guard rail, slow grinding it. 

           JUST THEN -- Anna slips backward nearly bringing Elaine and 
           the camera down with her in a giant SPLASH. 

           As she falls, she reaches out to Howard who reaches for her. 

           FREEZE on their outstretched hands.

           TITLES: “A True American Love Story”

                                        MARCH 2001

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY FAMILY COURT - HOUSTON - DAY

           Reporters and media fill the crowded wood paneled room.

           RUSTY HARDIN, (50s) a ginger-haired lawyer whose boyish looks 
           belie his talent as a ruthless litigator, checks his notes.

           Rusty speaks with a thick Texas drawl.

                                 RUSTY
                        Now, when you met J. Howard 
                        Marshall did you know how wealthy 
                        he was?

           Sitting on the witness stand, Anna couldn’t look more out of 
           place. Bright-pink lipstick, big hoop earrings, acrylic 
           nails, and hair done all the way up.

                                 ANNA
                        No sir. I had no idea. 

                                 RUSTY
                        None at all?

                                 ANNA
                        If you’re implying that I’m a gold 
                        digger... you know it really hurts 
                        when people assume that because I 
                        coulda married my husband the first 
                        week we met. But I wanted to get my 
                        career started first. People might 
                        not think that getting into Playboy 
                        is makin’ something out of your 
                        life, but coming from where I came 
                        from it was a big deal.
                                   HOUSTON, TEXAS 1991

           QUICK SHOTS OF: 

           People exiting limos with big hair, big boots, and big boobs. 

           Bags of silicone being filled in a lab.

           George H. W. Bush brings the cowboy look to the White House.

           A mother-daughter pair exit a plastic surgeon’s office with 
           matching red lipstick, matching golden tans, and matching 
           silicone breasts.

           A man reads the Texas Monthly with the headline: “Oil Bust 
           replaced with Silicone Boom!”

           A plastic surgeon dives into a breast shaped pool.   

           FINALLY WE LAND ON: a flat-chested brunette in a waitress 
           uniform and name tag that reads, “VICKIE LYNN,” serving 
           drinks to a booth at The Red Lobster. 

           INT. RED LOBSTER - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Anna steps away from a table and pulls a few bills out of her 
           apron, counting them. Her MANAGER spots her and approaches. 

                                 MANAGER 
                        We don’t count tips in front of 
                        clients. 

                                 ANNA
                        No one’s looking.  

                                 MANAGER
                        Don’t forget to finish your side 
                        work.

            A mop and bucket lean next to the bathroom door.

                                 ANNA
                        Yes, sir. 

           Rolling her eyes as she grabs the mop. 

           INT. HOUSTON MODELING AGENCY - OFFICE SUITE - DAY

           Anna sits nervously in a designer office as GARY (50s) with a 
           big mustache and JOAN, sixty trying to look forty, scroll 
           through a stack of polaroids taken in Anna’s bedroom. 
           Supermodels in framed ads——the era of Claudia Schiffer and 
           Elle McPherson——slim, chic, blue bloods, line the walls. 

                                 JOAN
                        Any other languages, musical 
                        instruments, sports, hobbies--
                        anything like that? 

                                 ANNA
                        Roller blading and couch 
                        potato’ing. I love my soaps too.  

                                 GARY
                        Vickie-Lynn Smith, is that your 
                        real name?

                                 ANNA
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 GARY
                        Stand up for us sweetie. 

           Anna stands. She’s in white short-shorts and a tank top. She 
           twirls in a wholly ungraceful but endearing way. 

                                 GARY
                        Listen honey, you’ve got height, 
                        that’s something, but you can’t 
                        walk, you can’t talk, and you’re --

                                 JOAN
                        -- Too fat. Even for Texas. 

           She’s not, but models are anorexic thin. 

                                 GARY
                        It’s a new era. Brands want lithe. 

                                 JOAN
                        And sophisticated. Which, well -- 

           Joan trails off. It hits Anna like a kick in the tits. Gary 
           and Joan make eyes. Time to wrap this up. They stand. 

           Anna stuffs her photos back in an envelope, one polaroid 
           drops to the floor. She considers grabbing it, decides 
           against it. And with that, she’s out the door.

           Gary and Joan eye the photo: Anna, leaning into the flash, 
           with her tongue between her fingers lewdly. 
           INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           Flushed with embarrassment, Anna pushes the elevator button. 

           On a sofa, a thin model eyes her. Anna impatiently stabs the 
           button until it lights up. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           As the elevator descends, Anna makes awkward glances at a 
           super fit and confidant JANICE (30s) who’s low v-neck reveals  
           her perfectly tanned cleavage.

           Anna affects an awkward loud whisper.

                                 ANNA
                        Excuse me, I’m sorry if this is 
                        impolite but, where’d you get your 
                        ta-tas done? 

                                 JANICE
                        Dr. Rose.

           Janice fishes in her purse and pulls out a business card. She 
           hands it to Anna with pride.  

                                 JANICE
                        He’s an artist.

           The card reads, “Dr. Franklin Rose, Sculptural Surgeon.” The 
           elevator doors slide open, as people file in. 

           Anna stuffs the card in her purse like a naughty secret.

           INT. VIRGIE AND CARL’S TRACT HOUSE - DAY

           A small row house filled with an unsettling amount of wooden 
           crucifixes and shrines to saints. 

           A heavily hair-sprayed VIRGIE HOGAN (late 40s), makes her way 
           down the hallway with her mamma bear swagger. She holds 
           DANIEL (3), Anna’s son, in her arms. 

           Beneath the stress and some extra pounds, the tracings of a 
           former beauty queen and a playful warmth shine through. 

           BATHROOM

           The door flings open and Virgie barges in on a stark naked 
           Anna, legs spread open, dry-shaving her crotch. A towel 
           wrapped on her head. Virgie GASPS. 
                                 VIRGIE
                        Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Don’t you 
                        lock the door?

           Virgie averts her eyes. Anna finishes with the razor.

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t you knock?

                                 VIRGIE
                        What if I was Carl?

           Anna kisses Daniel all over his face. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        I guess you never know who you 
                        might meet at The Red Lobster. 

                                 ANNA
                        Gotta be ready for anything. 

           Anna removes the towel from her head revealing a rat’s nest 
           of freshly bleached hair. Virgie immediately goes at the 
           tangles with a brush.

           Daniel sits on the counter, painting lipstick on his face. 
           Anna sets him down and he crawls away. 

                                 ANNA
                             (shouting)
                        One of ya’ll out there watch 
                        Daniel?

                                 VIRGIE
                        You really need to figure out a 
                        different living situation.  

                                 ANNA
                        Or what? You’re gonna ditch me 
                        again, like you did when I was 
                        fifteen? 

                                 VIRGIE
                        That was for your own good.

           Anna scoffs. 

                                 ANNA
                        Dropping me with Aunt Kaye so you 
                        could troll for men.

                                 VIRGIE
                        This house isn’t big enough for 
                        six. 
                                 ANNA
                        Maybe you shouldn’t of had more 
                        kids then. 

           The brush sticks on a knot. Virgie vigorously attacks it.

                                 ANNA
                        Owwww. 

           Finished brushing, Virgie admires Anna’s new platinum look.  

                                 VIRGIE
                        You need to learn to be a hard 
                        worker and earn your way.

                                 ANNA
                             (under her breath)
                        Yeah and end up in a tract house 
                        working two jobs?

           Virgie smacks the shit out of her. Revenge flashes across 
           Anna’s face. She raises her arm about to strike back but 
           lowers it. Bigger things on her mind. 

                                 ANNA
                        Move, I’m late.

           Anna barges past, knocking Virgie aside.

                                 VIRGIE
                             (shouting after her)
                        No more free babysitting! My first 
                        shift with the county starts 
                        tomorrow.

           Virgie looks at the dye box, then at her own hair, silently 
           mourning the life she sacrificed for her daughter.

           EXT. HOUSTON STREETS - DAY

           Anna steps off the bus and into the parking lot of a strip 
           mall where a neon sign looms large——a pair of women’s legs 
           kicking off a pair of cowboy boots: “Rick’s Gentleman’s Club” 

           INT. RICK’S GENTLEMAN’S CLUB - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

           In a dirty mirror, Anna applies last minute makeup touches. 
           She realizes something and panics. 
           HALLWAY

           The walls are lined with framed Playboy covers——many of which 
           are personally signed. Anna rushes out of the bathroom. 

           She follows a few girls through a curtained entrance into...

           A DRESSING ROOM

           Where dancers sit around casually chatting. Anna’s entrance 
           barely causes a stir.

                                 ANNA
                        Um. This is kinda embarrassing but 
                        do any of y’all have an extra 
                        thong?

           Frozen stares. Until one of the dancers, LORI, stands up and 
           removes her underwear, a bright green G-String. 

           Anna notices one of the framed Playboy pictorials. 

                                 ANNA
                        I heard this place was a pipeline 
                        to Playboy?

           The dancer, LORI, sneers. 

                                 LORI
                        More like a pipeline to the owner’s 
                        flabby ass pant line. 

                                 ANNA
                        Which one’s the owner? 

                                 LORI
                        Terry runs the place. Rick only 
                        comes for special occasions. 

           Anna bites her nails. 

                                 LORI
                        Jesus. Take a pill or something. 
                        Just looking at you gives me 
                        anxiety.

           RICK’S MAIN ROOM

           Dimly lit. Semi-plush. Trying to cater to the business class. 
           Anna steps up to a nearby booth where Terry, a sleepy-eyed 
           nightlife lizard, sits next to a zonked out dancer with that 
           hard flinty look. Anna hands him a CD. 

                                 ANNA
                        Do you want my professional name or 
                        my legal name?

                                 TERRY
                        It’s your rodeo honey.

                                 ANNA
                        Nikki. That’s my professional name. 

           Prince’s “Darling Nikki,” starts as Anna steps on stage and 
           works an awkward strip tease. She hesitates before removing 
           her padded bra. 

           At six feet tall with stretch marks and a mostly flat chest, 
           she delivers a certain country je ne sais quoi. She’s a 
           little rough around the edges, but open. And real. 

           She smacks her own ass, drawing focus there. The music stops. 

                                 TERRY 
                        Day shift. 

           Anna beams.

                                     SIX MONTHS LATER

           INT. RICK’S GENTLEMAN'S CLUB - DAY

           In the shadows of the club, resting on a stool, Anna pushes 
           her small cleavage up and nervously bites her nails.  

           She gobbles a pill nonchalantly. Across the room, Terry walks 
           in with a PHOTOGRAPHER (30s) lugging some gear.

                                 TERRY
                        Lori? Get over here. 

           Lori checks out the camera gear.

                                 LORI
                        Uh-uh. I got one year left at A&M. 
                        Can’t have my photo blasted 
                        everywhere while I’m at job fairs. 
                                 TERRY
                        Fun Fact: it’s part of your 
                        contract to do promotional.

           She scoffs, mockingly.

                                 LORI
                        What contract? 

           Anna shyly stands, feeling the pill. The photographer eyes 
           all six feet of her——impressed.

                                 TERRY
                        No, not her.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - MOVING - DAY

           Behind the wheel, Virgie, in a snug cop’s uniform, patrols. 

           Her partner, LLEWYN, (40s) a plug of dip in his cheek, scans 
           the stations out of boredom.

                                 VIRGIE
                        Stop messing with the radio. 

           Llewyn looks out the window and does a double take. 

                                 LLEWYN
                        Holy shit. You’re not gonna want to 
                        see this. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        See what?

           Virgie pulls over, gazes out the window. 

           GIANT BILLBOARD

           Anna, glistening and tan, lays naked except for a tuxedo 
           choker. 

           INT. RICK’S GENTLEMAN’S CLUB - DAY

           Jon Bon Jovi’s “Blaze of Glory” PLAYS loudly as Virgie and 
           Llewyn enter the dim club. Virgie squints, eyes still 
           adjusting to the dark. Terry approaches the two. 

                                 TERRY
                        What do I owe Houston’s finest?

           Anna, spilling out of a red thong, grinds on a customer.
                                 VIRGIE
                        Vickie-Lynn?! 

                                 ANNA
                        Mother?! 

           INT. VIRGIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           The small space bustles with extended family: 

           AUNT ELAINE, (30s) country, UNCLE RAY, (40) beer gut and 
           mustache, COUSIN SHELLY, (20s) wiry and nervous, JESUS-FREAK 
           CARL, lazy and unburdened, along with periphery family. They 
           blow-up birthday balloons, drink beer, and watch loud T.V. 

           Virgie and Anna fly through the front door——no one looks up.

                                 ANNA
                        Where’s my birthday boy!?

           She can’t buy their attention. 

           Anna bee-lines for her bedroom. Elaine, mid-cigarette, reads 
           Virgie’s face and——out of boredom——chases after Anna. 

           Virgie flops on the sofa. Carl glances at her——irritated. She 
           shakes her head: ”Don’t ask.”  

           VICKIE'S BEDROOM 

           Anna opens her closet and pulls out a pillowcase stuffed a 
           quarter full with cash. 

                                 ELAINE
                        What’d you expect? Your ass is 
                        plastered above I-45. 

                                 ANNA
                        And you know it looks good.

           She removes a small wad of bills from her wallet, contributes 
           it to the stash.

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t know whether to admire you 
                        or pray for you. 

           Anna dumps out the contents of her purse——a baggy of 
           pills——Valium, Xanax, and Benzos. She chews a Xanax raw.

           Loose dollar bills, a hair brush, a bra, and a mascara-
           smudged business card also fall to the ground.
           She counts her wad of singles. Not much. 

                                 ANNA
                        How do people save their money? I 
                        run through it like it’s toilet 
                        paper. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Ever heard of a bank?

           Not listening, Anna picks up Dr. Rose’s business card. 

           LIVING ROOM

           Anna weaves past relatives. Elaine follows closely behind. 

                                 COUSIN SHELLEY
                        I knew I smelled pussy on you all 
                        those times --

           Everyone talks over each other.

                                 VIRGIE
                        Stop paying attention to her. 
                        That’s exactly what she wants.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m sorry you got whipped with the 
                        ugly stick, Shelley. 

           Anna finds Daniel and scoops him up in a warm squeeze. He 
           squirms away.

                                 UNCLE RAY
                        Now what’s this club?

                                 ELAINE
                        You ain’t allowed to watch your 
                        niece-in-law take off her clothes! 

                                 ANNA
                        At least it’ll get me out of this 
                        dump!

                                 VIRGIE
                        The only way you’re getting out of 
                        here is if someone pays your plane 
                        ticket. You got no skills, sweetie. 

           SFX: DING-DONG! Virgie jumps. Anna beats her to the door. 
           AT THE DOOR

           A beefy blond BOYFRIEND hands Anna a small cardboard carrying 
           case with air holes. 

                                 ANNA
                        Call you later.

           She pushes him out. 

           BACK TO LIVING ROOM

           Anna holds the box up with a wide grin on her face.  

                                 SHELLEY
                        I don’t even want to know.

           Anna sets the carrying-case down and opens it. A pot-bellied 
           pig jets out with a SQUEAL. 

                                 ANNA
                        Happy Birthday sugar-pie. Do you 
                        love it?

           The Daniel SCREAMS and claps with delight. Anna beams. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        That’s it! I’m done.

           The pig finally finds Daniel who snuggles it in his arms, 
           before it escapes, SQUEALING at the top of its lungs. 

           Anna stares at Daniel and his cousins. An idea forms. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        Do you hear me Vickie-Lynn?! You 
                        need to move out, immediately. 

                                 ANNA
                        You’re right. He should stay with 
                        his Grandma until I get my body. 

           Virgie nods——like she’s won the argument. Anna heads to her 
           room to pack before Virgie realizes she’s been played.

                                 VIRGIE
                        You’re doing what now? 

           The pig races under Virgie’s legs, jumps on the sofa, and 
           flops down into Daniel’s arms.
                                 MARCH 2001

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY COURT HOUSE - ROTUNDA - DAY

           The middle of a long day in session. A female jury member 
           steps out. She beelines for the women’s restroom.

           BATHROOM STALL

           The jury member flushes, zips up her beige suit skirt. She 
           notices something stuffed behind the toilet paper holder. 

           Loathe to know what it is——but equally fascinated——she peers 
           closer——an oversized black satin bra. She yanks it out. 

           BATHROOM

           She steps out of the stall with the FF sized bra dangling 
           from her finger tips. She stares at it curiously. 

                                       HOUSTON 1992

           INT. DR. ROSE’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY

           A bustling office. Anna strides up to the check-in window. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m here for a consultation.

           INT. DR. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Anna, in a bra, sits on the exam table. 

           DR. ROSE, an “I-got-into-this-for-the-money-and-the-ladies” 
           kind of surgeon, flips through a book of his own works of 
           art——a gallery of topless women.  

           On a metal tray, Anna picks up the two hockey puck sized 
           implants filled with clear silicone.

                                 DR. ROSE
                        Finest product on the market, 
                        manufactured right here in Houston.

                                 ANNA
                        Do they come in any bigger sizes?
                                 DR. ROSE
                        The way we’d do that is stack two 
                        of these puppies on top of each 
                        other, creates a more natural look. 

           A nurse takes measurements of Anna.  

                                 DR. ROSE
                        If you decide to go that route it’s 
                        double the price. And I should warn 
                        you, double the weight.

           Dr. Rose glances over her tall figure. 

                                 DR. ROSE
                        You do have the build for it. 

                                 ANNA
                        I want mine to be the biggest and 
                        best ones you’ve ever done. 

           INT. RICK’S GENTLEMEN’S CLUB - DAY

           Anna plops her pillowcase full of cash in front of Terry.

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t let me touch it.

           Terry eyes it.

                                 ANNA
                        Even if I beg. I’m saving for my 
                        new body.

                                 TERRY
                        Who wants to place bets this won’t 
                        last more than a week? 

                                 ANNA
                        I know ya’ll think I’m the cliche, 
                        and married to the club. But I’ve 
                        got more to think about than just 
                        me, ya know. 

                                 TERRY
                        I’m just here to help. 

           Terry pinches a little girth around her waist. 

                                 TERRY
                        You stop eatin’ all that fried 
                        chicken and maybe we can talk night 
                        shift.   
           Terry takes the pillow case and locks it up in a safe. 

           SUPER CUT: Anna evolves into a super stripper. 

           Anna works her magic on some TEXAS OIL EXECS:

                                 ANNA
                             (thicker drawl than 
                              normal)
                        My daddy always said: We’re here 
                        for a good time, not a long time!

           The EXECS go in big for the VIP treatment. CHA-CHING!

           We see CASH rolling in as:

           -- Anna leaves the club as two night-shift girls step out of 
           a gleaming Mercedes with perfect implants. 

           -- Anna downs a tequila shot after work at Lori’s apartment. 

           -- Anna flirts with a TRAINER at the gym.

           -- Later, Anna and the same trainer fuck.

           -- Anna, too tipsy, falls off the stage into a customer.  

           -- Anna parties with low-life ballers after-hours. When 
           things get rough, she narrowly escapes into Lori’s car.  

           -- Anna wakes up beneath a fallen Christmas tree with vomit 
           next to her and two men sprawled nearby.

           -- Anna takes the pillowcase full of cash home from the club. 

           -- Anna moves into her own apartment with Daniel. 

           -- Finally, WE END ON: Anna entering the Texas Institute of 
           Plastic Surgery.

           INT. TEXAS INSTITUTE OF PLASTIC SURGERY - SURGERY ROOM - DAY

           A nurse administers the sedative through an IV. Anna, in blue 
           scrubs, hums a dreamy Marilyn Monroe song. 

           As she fades into the soft haze of the anesthesia, her eyes 
           catch a framed photo of Texas Monthly cover with Dr. Rose 
           grinning on the cover. The caption reads: “The Breast Man.”
           INT. VICKIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           It’s a messy apartment with little more than a floral sofa 
           and too many animals——the pig, the cat and a cockatoo.

           Anna’s eyes dip in and out of sleep with her legs propped up. 
           Her chest wrapped tightly in gauze with blood stains oozing 
           from her wounds. “Beavis and Butthead” on the T.V.

           A nearly six-year-old Daniel, in a cowboy costume with a 
           badge, hat, and little boots, races around.

                                 ANNA
                        Pass me my pills sugar pie?

           Daniel retrieves her prescription bottle. The bird COOS. The 
           cat HISSES at the cockatoo. 

                                 ANNA
                             (slurs)
                        Boooooger be nice.

                                 DANIEL
                        Booger farted. That’s what Cricket 
                        was saying.

           Daniel hops onto her lap.

                                 ANNA
                        Careful of Momma’s new rosebuds.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re bleeding.

           Daniel gently touches her oozing bandages. Anna takes a few 
           pills with water. 

           EXT. FARM LAND - DAY

           Anna, sporting her new set of extra-large enhancements, 
           wearing pig-tails and a low cut crop top, poses on a fence. 

           The photographer from Rick’s snaps a few shots. 

           Anna scoops up her pot-bellied pig. Her breasts fall out of 
           her top. She revels in the splendor of her new post-op body.

           EXT. MEMORIAL GARDENS CEMETERY - DAY

           J. HOWARD MARSHALL II, from the teaser, walks with a cane 
           towards a driver waiting by a black Rolls Royce. 
           Fresh flowers lay on a grave behind him, along with a framed 
           photograph of an amply endowed woman in a southern ballgown. 

           CLOSE ON THE HEADSTONE -- “Lady Jewell” Diane Walker. 

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE - MOVING - DAY 

           Howard lays splayed out in the back seat holding a small 
           chrome revolver. A man who’s nearly given up on life. 

           His driver, ORSON (30s), checks the rear view several times.

           THROUGH THE REAR VIEW:

                                 HOWARD
                        Orson? You ever heard of a man 
                        laying a wreath on his mistress’ 
                        grave while filing suit against her 
                        the same day?

                                 ORSON
                        You’re a complex man, Sir. I 
                        wouldn’t attempt to explain but 
                        just note that you have your 
                        reasons.  

                                 HOWARD
                        I’m not ready to go home. 

           Without a thought Orson executes a U-turn.  

           Howard, all 90 pounds of him, topples over the leather seat 
           like a rag doll. The pistol falls from his lap. He grabs it 
           and places it in it’s holster above his cowboy boot.

           INT. RICK’S GENTLEMEN’S CLUB - DAY

           Same club, different day shift. Brimming out of a bright red 
           mini-dress, Anna fills out a Playboy “contest” form. 

           She pops one of her pills, washes it down with a cocktail, 
           eats the cherry. Her routine. She squints at the form.

           Terry glances at the troublesome word she’s stuck on.

                                 TERRY
                        “How much do you weigh?”

           This is the first time we realize Anna’s partly illiterate.

           She writes: “165,” scratches it out. Replaces it with: “130.”
           Anna stuffs the nude farm photos and the “entry form” in a 
           large envelope. She lays it on the bar in front of Terry. 

                                 TERRY 
                        Not my department. 

           He scoffs, goes back to work behind the bar.

                                 ANNA
                        How much is in my pillowcase?

                                 TERRY
                        About half full. Not bad, Sweet 
                        Cheeks.  

           Anna slides the envelope closer to Terry. 

                                 ANNA
                        Take it. Just sneak this into 
                        Rick’s package with the others. 

           Surprised, Terry picks it up.

                                 TERRY
                        Better not come crying two weeks 
                        from now when you can’t pay rent. 

           Off Terry’s smirk, Anna notices an elderly man in a wheel 
           chair struggle to use the jukebox.

           At the same moment, a couple of YOUNG BUCKS step in the club. 
           Two day shift dancers approach and escort the young bucks to 
           their section.

           The elderly man is HOWARD. His dollar keeps popping out of 
           the jukebox. Other dancers giggle at this senior moment. 

           Howard, the drama queen that he is, SHOUTS at the machine. 

           A hand takes his dollar and straightens it out on the edge of 
           a table. The machine takes it this time. 

                                 ANNA
                        There you go, sweetheart. 

           A cocktail waitress delivers Howard a white wine with ice.

                                 HOWARD
                        Can I buy you a wine for your help?

                                 ANNA
                        You ever had Boone’s Farm? 

           Howard laughs.
                                 ANNA
                        I’d like to get into wine but it 
                        all tastes the same to me.

                                 HOWARD
                        You ought to come to my vineyard 
                        sometime. I can teach you. 

                                 ANNA
                        I learn a lot from customers.  

                                 HOWARD
                        Yeah, like what?

                                 ANNA
                        Well, I know that one man plus two 
                        beers equals twenty bucks. 

           He grins. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Deadly combination——beautiful and 
                        with horse sense.

           Howard hands her two twenties.

                                 HOWARD
                        Would thou oblige if I took thee to 
                        lunch instead?

                                 ANNA
                        Sorry darling, I can’t. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Doth the lady protest too much?

           Anna picks up the thread.

                                 ANNA
                        Thee isn’t allowed to date-eth 
                        customers. Did I say that right? 
                        What is that anyway? 

                                 HOWARD
                        Thou’st can not?

                                 ANNA
                        But thee knows where to find me if 
                        he needs me. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Doth thee have a man in thine’s 
                        life?
                                 ANNA
                        A very very important man.

                                 HOWARD
                        Then where is thy ring?

                                 ANNA
                        Hold on a sec.

           Anna runs behind the bar and pulls out a photo from her 
           purse. She returns but is too embarrassed to show. 

                                 HOWARD
                        No need to be shy. 

           She hands it over. To Howard’s delight——it’s of Daniel. 

           Anna notices the current song is about to end. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oooo, our song’s next. 
                        Hang tight honey.

           She let’s Howard hold onto the photo as she dashes off.

                                 TERRY (OVER THE SOUND SYSTEM)
                        Ladies and Gentleman please welcome 
                        our very own little country girl, 
                        Miiiiissssss Nikki.

           We hear the first notes of “LADY IN RED,” begin. 

           The spotlight falls on Anna at the edge of the stage.  

                                 OVER THE SPEAKERS
                        “Never seen you lookin’ so lovely 
                        as you did tonight. I’ve never seen 
                        you shine so bright.”

           By now, we know that, at best, she’s a mediocre dancer. 
           Nevertheless, she’s compelling, even vulnerable.   

           She dances just for Howard. 

                                 OVER THE SPEAKERS 
                        “There’s nobody here; it’s just you 
                        and me; it’s where I wanna be.”

           She’s fully naked, save for a red G-string. Howard’s eyes, as 
           big as saucers, tear up a little. 
           EXT. MARSHALL ESTATE - NIGHT

           The limo pulls up to the gate of an enormous Tudor estate.  

           INT. LIMO - NIGHT

           Orson pulls down the circular drive towards the main house. 
           Howard gazes out the window, in a demonstrably better mood. 

                                 ORSON
                        There better not be any falling in 
                        love stuff going on J. Howard.

                                 HOWARD
                        Too late. 

           Orson parks. He opens the passenger door and helps Howard 
           into his wheelchair.

           CLOSE ON -- stripper heels as they pound the sidewalk. A 
           skateboard whizzes past. Toto, we’re not in Houston anymore. 

           EXT. SANTA MONICA BLUFFS - OCEAN AVENUE - DAY

           CLOSE ON -- a pair of sneakers as they jog along a sandy 
           footpath above the ocean. 

           CLOSE ON -- the stripper heels as they stride into grass. 

           A marine layer cloaks the coast line where the wearer of the 
           sneakers, a jaded LOCAL, stretches, bent over, on the grass. 

           The stripper heels enter the jogger’s upside down view. 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, how far is Rodeo Drive 
                        from here?
                             (pronouncing Rodeo wrong)

                                 JOGGER
                        You mean Row-Day-Oh?  

           The jogger raises his head from his bent over stretch. 

           We follow his gaze as he takes her in——the ultimate blonde, 
           straps falling off her shoulders, eyes that tempt but at the 
           same time say “don’t mess with me, mister.”

                                 ANNA
                        It’s my first time in LA. First 
                        time out of Texas actually.
           Anna takes in the foggy view from the bluffs——enchanted.

                                 ANNA 
                        It’s even dreamier than I imagined. 

           Anna winks before she goes, leaving the jogger in awe.

                                 JOGGER
                        Good luck with... everything.

                                 ANNA
                        Thanks! 

            Anna steps into her waiting taxi, idling at the curb.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA PHOTO STUDIO - DAY

           In a second story studio loft above a heavily trafficked 
           street, Anna holds a pose against a pink backdrop.

           She has a small black mole painted on her upper lip. 

                                 ANNA
                        Sorry. I’m pantin’ like a lizard on 
                        a hot rock.

           Anna dabs the sweat from her upper lip.

           The photographer, ARNY, (40s) mustache, early 90s mullet, and 
           a casual swagger, snaps away with bored dispatch. 

           In posing for the camera, Anna is too sexually overt, too 
           cheap, and too tarted up. In short, she’s trying too hard.

           Arny snaps the last shot and sets his camera down.

                                 ARNY
                        We’re all set honey.

                                 ANNA
                        Already?

                                 ARNY
                        We got enough.

           Anna changes back into her street clothes with no modesty and 
           pulls her hair into a bun. She wipes her make-up off. 

           Arny shuts off the hot lights and opens the blinds, letting 
           more natural light spill in. 

           Catching a glimpse of Anna make-up free as she lights a 
           cigarette, he points the lens at her.
                                 ARNY 
                        Don’t mind me. 

           When she glances over, her eyes flicker, the cigarette 
           dangling from her lips. The camera SNAPS. 

                                        MARCH 2001

           EXT. HARRIS COUNTY COURT - FRONT STEPS - DAY

           News vans and media swarm the premise. Virgie, aged by the 
           years, emerges from the court house and descends the steps.

           A REPORTER flashes her pearly whites as she approaches. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Mimi Jones from Channel Eleven 
                        News. Mind if I ask you a question? 

                                 VIRGIE
                        I have nothing to do with my 
                        daughter’s case. I never asked her 
                        for nothin’.

                                 REPORTER
                        Did you ever think your daughter 
                        would be in the spotlight like 
                        this?

                                 VIRGIE
                        Why she needs so much attention? 
                        Don’t ask me!

                                    MEXIA, TEXAS 1985

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Virgie drives as a sixteen-year-old Anna pouts next to her. 

           They pass a sign that reads: WELCOME TO MEXIA, TEXAS. 
           (pronounced: MUH-hee-AH)

           EXT. KAYE BEALL’S HOUSE - DAY

           On the lawn KAYE BEALL HART, (38) a sweet woman in a Walmart 
           uniform, stands outside the humble one story home.  

           Virgie walks up from the car and hands her Anna’s bag. 
           Anna, coltish, glancing-eyed, and already nearly six feet 
           barefoot, reluctantly waits by the curb. 

           Virgie walks back to her.

                                 VIRGIE
                        It’ll just be for a little while.

                                 ANNA
                        Why can’t I go and live with my 
                        daddy! 

           That delivers the sting she knew it would. Virgie remains 
           stoic and walks to the car. Kaye joins Anna on the sidewalk.

                                 KAYE
                        Sugar, mention that man to her and 
                        you’re in for a world of trouble. 

           Virgie gets in the car. Anna fumes as her mom pulls away. 

                                 KAYE
                        Clean the dishes and there’s five 
                        food stamps in it for ya. Can buy 
                        yourself some candy or whatever.

           Kaye’s creepy BOYFRIEND-OF-THE-MONTH eyes Anna from the 
           window. Anna glares with teary eyes full of hurt and rage.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - VOLLEYBALL COURT - DAY

           It’s a cat fight. A flat-chested Anna (16) and a POPULAR GIRL 
           in gym clothes go at it. Spectators SCREAM in delight. 

           Anna, red and puffy beneath big bangs, yanks the girl’s hair 
           until she breaks free, shoving Anna’s face into the gravel. 

           Anna pulls the girl down with her and pins her to the ground. 
           Now on top, Anna beats the girl wildly with her fists.

           The gym COACH, a firecracker in short-shorts, races up  
           WHISTLE blaring. 

                                 COACH
                        Ladies!

           Finally, they break it up. Anna stands. The crowd whispers.  

                                 SPECTATOR
                        I heard she licks pussy. 

                                 POPULAR GIRL
                        Dyke!
           INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Motivational posters fill the wall -- “Pain is inevitable, 
           suffering is optional” and “Believe in yourself.” 

           Jesus is EVERYWHERE.

           An over-worked counselor, DIANE, (40s) wearing all khaki, 
           with tall teased-up hair, sits behind a desk with a Big Gulp. 
           She sips from a straw and speaks in a deep smoker’s voice.

                                 ANNA
                        Aren’t you going to call my mom? 

                                  DIANE
                        Awfully eager to let her know 
                        you’ve been suspended.

           Nothing from Anna.

                                 DIANE
                        Gimme the number.

                                 ANNA
                        218-746 --

                                 DIANE
                             (interrupting)
                        Houston?

           Anna looks away.

                                 DIANE
                        How ‘bout your Daddy’s?

           Nothing. That’s when Diane puts it together. 

                                 DIANE
                        Listen, sugar, I know things at 
                        home aren’t always peachy-keen, but 
                        you can’t go running around 
                        punching people in the face to get 
                        their attention.
                             (looking at her file)
                        Now, with these grades and your 
                        suspension, you’ll likely have to 
                        repeat tenth. 

                                 ANNA
                        Yes Ma’am. But, you see, my English 
                        teacher, Mrs. Kantor, she doesn’t 
                        explain how to do the homework. 
                                 DIANE
                        Some people are just better suited 
                        for trade school. Or marriage.  

           Anna wants to disappear. The sound of SIZZLING. 

           CLOSE ON -- fried chicken as it bubbles in oil. A hand lifts 
           the basket out. 

           INT. JIM’S FRIED CHICKEN - DAY

           A sweaty but happy Anna, (now 17) in her uniform, gazes 
           through an opening into the kitchen at BILLY WAYNE SMITH 
           (16), a scrawny kid with a bowl cut.

           He grins back at her, showing off his row of braces. Anna 
           loves the braces. Her BOSS approaches, handing her a tray. 

                                 BOSS
                        You have weird taste in men. 

           INT. ANNA AND BILLY’S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Dim, small, and full of wicker furniture. A floral bedspread 
           drapes over a shaking brass bed. 

           Greasy wrappers from Jim’s Fried Chicken lay on the carpet.

           In a gauzy nightgown with sweat on her brow, Anna, looking 
           like a teenage housewife, rides Billy-Wayne. Their size 
           difference makes for quite a sight. 

           On the bedside table sits a framed wedding photo of the two.

           The phone RINGS. Anna picks it up mid-thrust.

                                 ANNA
                             (huffing and puffing)
                        Hello? 

                                 VIRGIE (V.O.)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ANNA
                        Mother can I call you back? Me and 
                        Billy are trying to have us a baby. 

           Anna hangs up and keeps riding. 
                             AND WITH THAT, WE’RE BACK TO 1992

           EXT. RICK'S GENTLEMAN'S CLUB - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Anna walks up to the club for another day shift. Orson 
           intercepts her.  

                                 ORSON
                        Mr. Marshall sent me to pick you up 
                        for your lunch date. 

                                 ANNA
                        That’s really sweet but can you 
                        please inform Mr. Marshall that he 
                        knows where to find me. I can’t 
                        keep leaving the club.

           Orson hands her an envelope. She opens it: J. Howard 
           Marshall’s holdings, proof of his wealth. A shocking amount. 

                                 ORSON
                        One hour. That’s all. 

           A few of the other day shift girls walk into the club. Anna 
           decides to go. 

           INT. RIVER OAKS COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Anna, in a spaghetti strap dress and heels, chops gum. A 
           hostess hangs up a call. She scans Anna from head to toe. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        Who’d you say you were here to see?

                                 ANNA
                        My friend, Howard. He told me to 
                        meet him here for lunch. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        This is the River Oaks Country 
                        Club. 

                                 ANNA
                        Howard’s driver brought me straight 
                        from work. I didn’t have time to 
                        change. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        Howard as in J. Howard Marshall II?

           Anna nods--getting impatient. Finally, the hostess locates a 
           “lost and found” coat and hands it to Anna. 
           INT. RIVER OAKS COUNTRY CLUB - DINING ROOM - DAY

           A chandeliered dining room overlooks the golf course. 

           Seated in a prime booth across from Howard, Anna picks an 
           olive out of a tray of crudités. She’s about to suck the 
           pimento, but thinks otherwise. She can feel the eyes on her. 

           She attempts to delicately slice it with a knife, which goes 
           about as well as you might expect. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Did you get my “letter?”

                                 ANNA
                        Honey, I’ve been waiting for that 
                        kind of love letter my whole life.

                                 HOWARD
                        Wanted you to know that I’m 
                        serious.

           Howard places a check on the table. 

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t just hand it across the 
                        table?!  

           Howard grabs it and passes it to her beneath the table.

           Anna holds it off to the side, inspecting the memo: “Monthly 
           Consulting Fee.” Howard beams——proud of his power to help.

                                 ANNA
                        Monthly? As in --

                                 HOWARD
                        You don’t have to ever go back. 

           Anna stares at Howard. Aware of the arrangement’s demands.  

           She drops it in her purse, kicks off her heels, and grabs the 
           champagne from the bucket. Evidently a faux pas as a waiter 
           rushes over to pour it for her. People whisper.  

                                 ANNA
                             (spikey)
                        What are ya’ll lookin’ at? 

           Howard smirks.
                                 HOWARD
                        They’re thinking: how could that 
                        beautiful creature be with him? 
                        He’s got one foot in the grave. 

           Anna leans over and gives him a kiss on the lips.  

                                 ANNA
                        Should we take a trip to the little 
                        boys room together, really give 
                        them something to think about? 

                                 HOWARD
                        We don’t even have to do anything 
                        in there. 

                                 ANNA
                        Except let their dirty minds 
                        wonder.  

                                 HOWARD
                        M’lady, your chariot is waiting. 

           Howard pats his lap. She hops on. They ride to the men’s 
           room, mischief in their eyes. 

           INT. DALLAS - PIERCE MARSHALL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           In a stuffy living room, PIERCE MARSHALL, (59) Howard’s 
           youngest son whose pale face lacks the natural warmth of his 
           father, holds the phone to his ear. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Well, that won’t do. We can’t let 
                        that happen. Not Again.

           Takes a deep breath, preparing for battle. 

           INSIDE ROLLS ROYCE PARKED OUTSIDE HOWARD’S ESTATE

           Orson hangs up the car phone. He watches as a NURSE wheels 
           Howard through the front doors of his estate. 

                                        MARCH 2001

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY COURT HOUSE - DAY

           On the witness stand, Anna holds onto a small framed photo of 
           her and Howard. She stares at it with sadness. 

           Rusty reaches for the photo. She hands it over defiantly. 
                                 RUSTY 
                        You graduated from which school 
                        now?

                                 ANNA
                             (you got me)
                        Yeah I’m a drop out Rusty.

                                 RUSTY
                        No one is talking about your --

                                 ANNA
                        -- I’m not a book worm -- I’m not a 
                        smart person--but I know what 
                        happened with my husband and Pierce 
                        wasn’t -- 

                                 RUSTY
                        -- Ma’am? You’re just going up 
                        there and making stuff up now?

                                 ANNA
                        -- I am not making anything up 
                        Rusty! 

           The burst of anger startles her and everyone else——juries 
           don’t like to see female anger. 

           Anna sits back in her chair, the weight of the trial and her 
           untreated grief spilling over.

                                    MEXIA, TEXAS 1988

           EXT. BILLY AND VICKIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Anna plops down on the sofa, exhausted after an early morning 
           shift at Jim’s. The Houston Oilers game plays on the RADIO. 

           Billy-Wayne pounds a beer. He’s belligerent. Tiny baby Daniel 
           lays on the sofa next to him, wailing. 

           Anna stares at the scene, then looks at Billy. 

                                 ANNA
                        Have you told your parents about us 
                        moving yet? 

           His eyes strangely fixed on the radio.

                                 BILLY-WAYNE
                        I’ve been thinking. I like it in 
                        Mexia.

                                 BILLY-WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        You know, with your looks and my 
                        experience at Jim’s I could open my 
                        own chicken place someday. 

           It dawns on Anna. He’s never going to leave. 

                                 BILLY-WAYNE
                        What’s really in Houston for you 
                        anyway? Cause it ain’t modeling.  

           Anna stares, quietly fuming. Billy-Wayne takes a swig. 

                                 ANNA
                        What’s here? Work from five in the 
                        morning. The rest of the time, I’m 
                        cooped up cuz you flip if I even go 
                        to the market alone. 

                                 BILLY-WAYNE
                        You just want to get to the big 
                        city so you can go fuck around with 
                        some other dicks. Or is it chicks?

           The Oilers score, Billy-Wayne HOOTS. Daniel CRIES. 

                                 ANNA
                             (screaming over him)
                        We don’t even have a T.V.

           INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 

           Sporting a black-eye and wearing white cowboy boots, Anna 
           drives like a bat out of hell. 

           Laying on top of a pile of hastily packed clothes is a framed 
           wedding photo of Billy-Wayne and Anna.   

           Six-month-old DANIEL cries bloody murder in a baby-seat next 
           to her. And it’s getting worse. 

           SIDE OF THE ROAD

           Anna pulls the truck off the dusty highway and stops. 

           INSIDE TRUCK 

           Anna holds a squirming Daniel. 

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t worry sugar-pie, I didn’t 
                        have a daddy either. 
           Daniel calms down. She feeds him from her breast.

                                 ANNA
                        Momma’s gonna get us a ranch bigger 
                        than Texas.

           As exhausted and determined as she’s ever been. 

                                     LOS ANGELES 1992

           INT. PLAYBOY HEADQUARTERS - PHOTO EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Photo editors and lay-out artists hustle for deadlines. 

           The room tenses when MARY (40s), a taut German woman whose 
           coiled energy commands the attention of all, enters. 

           Mary holds a magnifier up. She flips to another sheet. 

           Arny approaches. Mary lands on Anna’s contact sheet.

           She zeroes in on one shot in particular——a candid. The shot 
           of Anna’s eyes smoldering as a cigarette dangles.

                                 ARNY
                        Shot out the rest of my roll while 
                        she was leaving, doing some lights 
                        tests. 

           Mary scans the sheet. She speaks with a slight accent.

                                 MARY
                        You sent this girl home?

           INT. HOUSTON - MARSHALL INDUSTRIES - DAY 

           Howard sits perched at a large marble desk, forty stories 
           above a sprawling downtown outside his window.

           His chief financial officer, EDWIN (60s) sits across from 
           him, giving him a report, which Howard interrupts.

                                 HOWARD 
                        Why didn’t the lawyers include me 
                        in the memo?

                                 EDWIN
                        Just didn’t think you’d want to be 
                        bothered --
                                 HOWARD
                             (sharp)
                        -- You know exactly what it 
                        signals. That I’m on my way out.

                                 EDWIN
                        You’re misunderstanding.  

                                 HOWARD
                        You and Pierce would be dead in the 
                        water without me!

                                 EDWIN
                        Yes, sir. 

           The tension passes. Howard presses a button on his phone.

                                 HOWARD
                        Call Vickie. See what Vickie’s up 
                        to.

           We can see Howard’s SECRETARY through the glass wall. Howard 
           brightens just thinking about her. 

                                 SECRETARY (INTERCOM)
                        She’s still out of town, sir. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Find out if she needs anything. 

                                 SECRETARY (INTERCOM)
                        Yes, sir. Pierce is here for your 
                        luncheon now.

           Pierce steps in with Orson who helps Howard into his 
           wheelchair. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Ready to take down a Porter House?

                                 HOWARD
                        Does a fat baby fart?

                                 PIERCE
                        I thought it might be nice if 
                        Evelyn Marks joined us today. 

           Howard knows exactly what Pierce is up to.

           The secretary steps in holding a newly framed photo of Anna 
           and Howard fishing by the lakeside wearing trucker hats.
                                 SECRETARY
                        This just came in from the framers. 
                        Should I put it on your desk?

           Pierce eyes it. Anna and Howard look thick as thieves. 

                                 PIERCE
                        I get it, dealing with the 
                        Alzheimer's was tough, but mom’s 
                        barely been in the grave a year. 
                        Not to mention the mess were still 
                        in from your last mistress.

                                 HOWARD
                        She’s the one Pierce. 

                                 PIERCE
                        The one?

                                 HOWARD
                        The golden girl of my dreams.

           Pierce follows behind Orson and Howard, making eyes with 
           Edwin before he exits the room.

           INT. PLAYBOY STUDIO SET - DAY

           Anna, sitting in a director’s chair, nervously bites the skin 
           around her acrylic nails. 

           Hair curled, make-up shellacked, and wearing a column dress 
           with an endless slit. A small crew tinker with the lights. 

           She stands, unsure who to talk to, sits back down. Out of her 
           element and anxious, she tries to seem aloof and 
           sophisticated.     

           Finally, a production assistant ushers her to a throne-like 
           chair in front of a velvet back-drop. 

           The PHOTOGRAPHER approaches. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                             (thick accent)
                        Just try to pretend you’re a 
                        princess in the court. A very horny 
                        one. 

           Anna pretends to be scandalized. But the moment the camera 
           points at her, she turns on a switch. Her raw energy now 
           focused, she thrills to the lens, thrives with the attention.
           Mary steps in the room, stiff and distracted. The second she 
           lays eyes on Anna her mood softens. 

           Anna’s locked in. Not one bad frame. 

                                 MARY
                        Hef’s gotta see this. 

           EXT. MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS HOUSTON - NIGHT

           An exclusive charity event with all the Southern movers and 
           shakers in attendance.

           Pierce Marshall stands with his wife ELEANOR MARSHALL (60) a 
           refined southern woman with taut curls. 

           They watch Howard, seated at the main table. He shakes hands 
           with the elder of the Koch Brothers and other passersby.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Now’s your chance. 

           Pierce tentatively approaches and sits. Howard looks annoyed 
           by his son’s cloying presence.

                                 PIERCE
                        Sorry you have to be in the chair 
                        all the time now.

                                 HOWARD
                        Who cares. Everything else works 
                        great.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Wanted to talk to you about us 
                        moving to Houston. 

                                 HOWARD
                        I need you to run point in Dallas.

                                 PIERCE
                        I can do it from here. I know 
                        you’ve been through a lot and now 
                        that the suit is over --

                                 HOWARD
                        I’m doing better than ever!  

           Howard spots who he’s been waiting for and waves. Anna, in a 
           skin tight mini, arrives tipsy. 
                                 ANNA
                        Sorry I’m late. It took forever to 
                        get my zipper up. 

           Anna sucks in, squeezing her hands around her waistline. 

           Pierce tries not to stare but can’t help it. Same goes for 
           everyone in the room.  

                                 HOWARD
                        Vickie-Lynn Smith. This is my 
                        youngest, Pierce.

                                 PIERCE
                        So, you do exist.

           They shakes hands and she sits.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m as real as they make’m honey.

           Pierce gives her a phony-as-fuck smile.  

                                 HOWARD
                        Pierce’s hoping I croak soon so he 
                        can take over my empire.

           Howard laughs a sturdy laugh.

                                 PIERCE
                        How’d you two meet?

                                 HOWARD
                        At her place of work. Vickie was a 
                        dancer.  

                                 ANNA
                        Howard and I were instant friends. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Isn’t that something. 

           Howard’s pride oozes. He winks at Anna. Eleanor arrives, 
           introduces herself, and sits. Pierce turns to Howard.

                                 PIERCE
                        Dad, Eleanor and I have some very 
                        exciting news. Preston received his 
                        acceptance letter from Yale. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        We’re over the moon. 

           Howard eats his food, non-plussed.
                                 ANNA
                        I want my Daniel to go to Yale too. 
                        He just started at a new college 
                        prep school. 

           Eleanor stifles a laugh. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Vickie’s just returned from 
                        modeling in Hollywood. She’s got a 
                        natural mind for show business.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        How interesting. I don’t know how 
                        you do it. I get nervous giving a 
                        speech to the foundation board. 

                                 ANNA
                        If you want a career in front of 
                        the camera, it takes dedication. 
                        Marilyn Monroe for example. I could 
                        put you in touch with a doctor. He 
                        does everything, including noses.  

           Unaware of shocking Eleanor, Anna dives her knife into an icy 
           piece of swan-shaped butter with amazement.   

                                 ANNA
                        This is the same brand they serve 
                        at the Playboy Mansion. Whoever 
                        catered this has good taste.

           Pierce talks to Howard out of earshot.

                                 PIERCE
                        She’s something else --

                                 HOWARD
                        Careful what you’re about to say.
                             (turning away)
                        Edwin? Let’s get this over with.

           Edwin wheels Howard to the stage. Pierce turns to Anna.

                                 PIERCE
                        You’re not the first young lady 
                        that’s come digging at this well.  

           Anna absorbs the blow, caught off guard by his directness. 

           Pierce steps away to find Eleanor. The Governor of Texas 
           takes the stage with Howard as the small crowd gathers. 
                                 PIERCE
                        Can’t take the Quaker out of him. 
                        “Kindness to strangers above all.” 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Not the time to rock the boat, we 
                        need to stay in the circle of 
                        trust. He’s frail and vulnerable. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Exactly why I need to protect him. 

           ON THE STAGE

           The Governor finishes his introduction. A worker unveils a 
           giant plaque with Howard’s name on it. Howard takes the mic 
           behind a lectern. 

                                 HOWARD
                        It’s rare when two become one, as I 
                        did, a Yankee with Texas. I’ve 
                        recently been graced with another 
                        of those occasions for wonder. 
                        She’s here with me tonight and 
                        she’s a marvel.

           CHEERS as the crowd eyes Anna, genuinely touched by Howard’s 
           affection. Pierce turns to Edwin.

                                 PIERCE
                        I need to be kept in the loop on 
                        this madness.

           They watch Howard, a big fat smile on his face.   

                                        MARCH 2001

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY COURT HOUSE - DAY

           Another day in court. Anna’s back on the stand. She’s tired 
           but focused. A good day. Rusty stalks her. 

                                 RUSTY 
                        Now, Ms. Marshall. I think the 
                        court would be very interested to 
                        know who you slept with while you 
                        were with your husband? 

           Anna looks to her counsel to see if this is appropriate, they 
           nod in encouragement. 
                                 RUSTY
                        You didn’t always lead a life that 
                        your husband would have hoped, did 
                        you?

                                 ANNA
                        He loved me warts and all.

           Anna glares at Rusty in defiance. Rusty, not ready to give 
           up, considers. 

           INT. CHANNEL 11 NEWS STATION - EDIT BAY - DAY

           Dark. Multiple monitors. An EDITOR watches playback footage 
           from the above exchange. He smokes. 

           ON THE MONITOR: we pick up where they left off. 

                                 ANNA
                        He loved me warts and all.

                                 RUSTY
                        Is that right?

           Rusty really digs in. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Let me ask you, Ma’am, how many 
                        tattoos do you have? 

           Anna seems confused. Where is this going?

                                 ANNA
                        A lot. 

                                 RUSTY
                        I bet there’s a story behind every 
                        one of them too, is that right? 

           The editor freezes the frame on Rusty’s smirk——pretty proud 
           of himself for drawing an analogy between warts and tattoos. 

                                      DECEMBER 1992

           EXT. NORTH HOUSTON - VIRGIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Anna drives up in a lipstick red Mercedes convertible. She 
           HONKS the horn. Virgie steps out and approaches.

                                 ANNA
                        You seen my spread yet?
           Anna holds open the Playboy magazine to her scantily clad two-
           page spread. Virgie swats it away——embarrassed.

                                 VIRGIE
                        Whose car? 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s a present from Howard. 

           Virgie shakes her head.

                                 ANNA
                        What? Jealous?

                                 VIRGIE
                        It’s just not right——he could be 
                        your grandfather. 

                                 ANNA
                        He’s a very supportive friend. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        If you’re taking him for all his 
                        money, what’re you giving back in 
                        return?

           Off Virgie’s look. Anna beeps the horn several times.  

                                 VIRGIE
                        You better know what you’re doing, 
                        there’s nothing in life for free. 

           Elaine, dressed to the nines, races out the front door. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Sorry honey. Ray was nagging me.  
                        He wants a signed copy. You mind?

           Anna relishes in signing her spread. Elaine hops in.

                                 VIRGIE
                        Don’t let this go to your head, you 
                        can lose it in a day but you can’t 
                        get yourself back.

                                 ANNA
                        God, stop raining on my parade. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        I’m your mother, I look out for 
                        you. Who else is gonna do that?

           Anna hands the magazine to Virgie and pulls away. 
           INT. HILL’S GAY BAR - NIGHT

           Anna, showing abundant cleavage, dances with Elaine. She’s in 
           bacchanal mode and we can feel the eyes on her. 

                                 ELAINE
                        You know this is a gay bar, right? 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m tired of men pawing at me. 

           Anna and Elaine pile into a booth. Anna pulls out a wad of 
           cash and hands it to Elaine. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Just so we’re clear, I’m just here 
                        for the line dancin’.

                                 ANNA
                        Drinks on me. 

                                 ELAINE
                        We’re about to get wasted, huh?

           Anna downs a Jaegermeister shot. Elaine does the same.

           JUST THEN -- Anna makes eyes with a butch red-head alone at 
           the bar in paint splattered jeans. This is SANDI. Anna is 
           immediately transported. 

           ON SANDI

           The bartender delivers a Jaeger shot to Sandi, pointing to 
           Anna, who had it sent. Caught off guard, Sandi blushes. 

           ON ANNA

           The waitress delivers a tequila shot, points back at Sandi. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        From your “friend” over there. 

                                 ELAINE
                        The one who looks like someone 
                        stole her mullet? 

                                 ANNA
                        What should I do? 

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh shit, you’re serious? 
           The music changes to a slow song. Anna stares at Sandi who’s 
           leaving the bar with a group of friends. 

           Anna hurries to the door. Sandi gestures for her group to go 
           on without her.  

                                 SANDI
                        Are you messing with me?

                                 ANNA
                        Why? 

           For the first time we see Anna timid and insecure.

                                 SANDI
                        I mean, who actually sends a 
                        stranger a drink? 

                                 ANNA
                        They do it in the movies all the 
                        time. 

                                 SANDI
                        That’s adorable. It’s just, why me? 

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t know. You’re the only one 
                        not looking at me. 

           Catching her off guard with her realness. 

                                 SANDI
                        I’m just shy. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh my god. Me too! I’m probably, 
                        like, the shyest person in the 
                        world. 

           Sandi gives her a doubtful look. Awkward silence. Anna 
           struggles——not good with words. 

                                 ANNA
                        Dance with me.

           Anna drags her to the dance floor where they join a sweaty 
           group of line dancers. 

           Elaine, puffing on a cig, watches from the bar mystified at 
           the throng of onlookers.

                                 ELAINE
                        That girl is crazier than a betsy 
                        bug.
           A keyed-up COWGIRL approaches.  

                                 COWGIRL
                        Who is she, a porn star? 

                                 ELAINE
                        Not that I know of. She’s my niece. 

                                 COWGIRL
                        Can I get you a drink? 

                                 ELAINE
                        I’ll take a tequila. FYI -- I’m 
                        only here for the line dancing.

                                 COWGIRL
                        Sounds kinky.

           OUTSIDE BAR

           Anna leans against the wall, Sandi next to her. 

                                 SANDI
                        Never seen you here before. 

                                 ANNA
                        I was living in Mexia up until a 
                        few years ago.

                                 SANDI
                        I did a construction job there.

                                 ANNA
                        Ever go to Jim’s Fried Chicken? We 
                        might have met. 

                                 SANDI
                        Oh no, I would have remembered you. 
                        You don’t really seem like you’d 
                        fit in a place like that.

                                 ANNA
                        Where do you think I fit in? 
                        Honestly. 

                                 SANDI
                        I dunno... somewhere prettier. 

           It’s been so long, Anna can’t believe she actually has 
           butterflies in her stomach. She tries to keep a cool-head. 
           EXT. ANNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It’s nearly dawn. Sandi’s sedan is parked out front.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Anna and Sandi stare awkwardly, hiding pre-kiss jitters. Anna 
           makes the first move and they feverishly make-out. 

           After a bit, Sandi separates.

                                 SANDI
                        Gotta be at the job site in a few 
                        hours. I’ll wait ‘til you get 
                        inside. 

           Sandi’s care makes Anna even more horny. She keeps her 
           composure and walks to the front door.

           FRONT DOOR

           Anna turns, flashes a goofy smile and a peace sign, 
           immediately regrets it, and quickly lets herself in.

           INT. MARSHALL ESTATE - DAY

           The lights twinkle from a large Christmas tree. Daniel sits 
           on a mini-four wheeler with a huge red bow.

                                 ANNA
                        Thank your Paw-Paw for your 
                        present. 

           A SIX-YEAR-OLD Daniel runs over, wraps his arms around 
           Howard, and sits on his knee. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you Paw-Paw.

                                 ANNA
                        Now give mommy a little privacy. 

           Daniel rides his four-wheeler out. 

                                 ANNA 
                        Wait here. 

           Anna steps out and returns carrying two life-sized framed 
           prints of herself naked with red ribbons around each. 

           Howard pulls the ribbons off. 
                                 ANNA
                        I know it’s not sex, but now you 
                        can look at my rosebuds whenever 
                        you want. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Do you feel pressured about that?

                                 ANNA
                        Isn’t that what you want?

           Howard shakes his head. 

                                 HOWARD
                        I want you to be my lady.   

           He opens a box from Harry Winston’s and presents her with a 2-
           karat yellow diamond ring. 

           Anna holds it, admiring it. Nervous to turn him down. 

                                 ANNA
                        You know I can’t. 

           Howard deflates.

                                 ANNA
                        I promised I’d make something of 
                        myself first——before I get married. 

           Bites her lip, worried about his reaction. 

                                 ANNA
                        We can still be friends, right?

           He rebounds.

                                 HOWARD
                        I want you to keep it anyway. I 
                        admire you, for knowing what you 
                        want. You’ll show ‘em all, my 
                        princess with street smarts.  

           Relieved, she feeds Howard a piece of left over cherry pie.

                                 HOWARD
                        Just don’t wait too long.

           INT. GUESS HEADQUARTERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           A stack of magazines sits on a glass table. On the wall is a 
           large framed GUESS ad starring Claudia Schiffer. 
           PAUL MARCIANO, (50s) the Italian designer in a black 
           turtleneck and gold chain, sits behind a enormous desk. 

           An ASSISTANT stands across from him. 

           Paul hands the assistant a Playboy magazine——the cover is a 
           black and white photo of Anna in nothing but a bath towel, 
           her smoldering eyes burning bright with a new confidence.

           The cover title reads: VICKIE LYNN SMITH.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        The Playboy model?

           Paul speaks with a thick Italian accent.

                                 PAUL
                        She’s like Anita Ekberg. An amazon! 

           INT. ANNA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Anna, in her bra and panties, fries eggs while she’s on a 
           call, the receiver jammed between her ear and shoulder.  

           Sandi drinks coffee, reading the want ads. 

                                 ANNA
                        I wear your jeans all the time!
                             (listening)
                        I’ve got ‘em on right now.

           Anna hangs up. A female gym trainer in boxers plops on the 
           sofa. Remnants of a wild night.  

                                 ANNA
                             (mis-pronouncing)
                        Paul Marciano wants to see me in 
                        San Antonio this weekend. 

                                 TRAINER
                        How’d some dude get your number? 

           Anna bounces around, pulling a confused Sandi into a hug. She 
           pulls away with a paranoid thought. 

                                 ANNA
                        What if he sees me and laughs? 

                                 SANDI
                        Who is he?
                                 ANNA
                        Shit, I hope he doesn’t try to 
                        sleep with me.  

                                 SANDI
                        Why put yourself in that position? 

                                 ANNA
                        He could make me famous in a 
                        second.

           Anna falls into a daze imagining the possibilities. 

           INT. SAN ANTONIO STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT

           A tropical fish tank type of joint. Dim with low ceilings. 

           Paul and Anna sit at a cocktail table. Anna sips on a frozen 
           margarita. Paul studies her. 

                                 PAUL
                        I believe there is one woman who 
                        defines every generation——the 
                        collective spirit of an era. I 
                        think you might be that woman. Are 
                        you ready to do what it takes to 
                        make it a reality? 

           A shameless grin. They both know what he means. 

                                 ANNA
                        Sorry, what time is it?

                                 PAUL
                        You have somewhere else to be?

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t miss my call home.  

                                 PAUL
                        Married?

                                 ANNA
                        Just my son. 

           Anna pulls her wallet and shows the same photo of her and 
           Daniel. Paul looks at his watch. Impatient. Rude.

                                 PAUL
                        You better go. 
           FRONT RECEPTION 

           Anna holds the hostess’s phone to her ear. The hostess tries 
           to take the phone back from her.  

                                 HOSTESS
                        You can’t just call long distance. 

                                 ANNA
                        This is an emergency.
                             (into the phone)
                        It’s your sweet cheeks.

           The hostess relents. 

                                 ANNA
                             (baby-talk)
                        Yeeeeew know I’d never miss our 
                        call. Talking to you is the 
                        highlight of my day. More than you 
                        even know. 

           The hostess looks away, trying not to listen. 

                                 ANNA
                        I miss you too lover boy.
                             (kissing the receiver)
                        That makes my rosebuds hard.

           She actually touches her hard nipples, getting aroused. 

                                 ANNA
                             (eyeing the bar)
                        I have to go now. Okay? We’ll be 
                        thinking of you.

           Anna hands the phone to the hostess who hangs up, aghast. 

           Anna looks into the dining room at Paul. She collects herself 
           then heads back to their table. 

           BACK AT THE COCKTAIL TABLE

           Anna sits with a new calm and focus. She sucks the entire 
           rest of her frozen margarita through the straw. 

           Paul takes this as a good sign. 
           EXT. TEXAS BEACH - DAY

           Expensive lighting is hooked to a generator. A small crew 
           gathers near a glam trailer, while a photographer shoots a 
           playful Anna, dressed head to toe in Guess. 

           Next to a crew van, Paul Marciano leans on his parked Jaguar.

           The photographer re-fills the camera as the crew re-sets the 
           lighting and props. A STYLIST hands Anna a diet soda. 

           A pod of dolphins surface and sink back below the waves. Anna 
           points and squeals. 

                                 ANNA
                        I love dolphins. But I hate ocean 
                        water -- it’s like swimming in 
                        their toilet. Once you think about 
                        it that way... it’s gross.  

           Anna’s escorted by crew to a new marker. An assistant leans 
           into to the stylist to whisper. 

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        Why are they always so brain dead?

           Off the stylist’s cringe as Paul gives Anna a handsy hug 
           nearby. Anna and Paul walk up to the glam trailer and enter.

           INT. MAKE-UP TRAILER - DAY

           Behind a partition, Anna changes into her street clothes. 

           She glances through the cracks, gauging what Paul wants, and, 
           not wanting to lose his interest, she plays along.  

                                 PAUL
                        I think you should come up with a 
                        stage name that makes you stand 
                        out. Like a brand. Like the 
                        Hollywood studio actresses in the 
                        era of glamour.   

                                 ANNA
                        Nikki was my dancer name. 

                                 PAUL
                        Nicole is good. I like. I like this 
                        a lot. But an iconic name should 
                        bounce off the tongue, like Marilyn 
                        Monroe. Like Mary Nicole, Lauren 
                        Nicole, or Anna Nicole?
                                 ANNA
                             (Italian accent)
                        Anna Nicole. 

           And from this point forward Anna is known as: ANNA NICOLE. 

           Paul touches her face. She makes a silly kissy face to 
           placate him, but pushes him away. 

                                 PAUL
                        You know, it’s true that no one 
                        wanted me to cast you. 

           Paul grabs onto her waist. He tries a kiss on her, grabbing 
           her ass. She pulls away.

                                 PAUL
                        What are you afraid of--the big bad 
                        wolf?

           A KNOCK on the trailer door. The wardrobe STYLIST enters. The 
           women share a knowing look. Saved by the bell. 

                                 STYLIST
                        Can I grab her a minute for a 
                        fitting?

           INT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Sandi, in white coveralls, paints the interior wall as part 
           of a construction crew. A few other painters work nearby.  

                                 WORKER
                        Hey Sandi. Delivery for you. 

           A delivery man stands in the doorway holding a bouquet of red 
           roses and a department store bag. 

           FROM YOUR SECRET ADMIRER. 

                                 WORKER
                        Open it!

           Sandi pulls out a magenta pink silk top and matching skirt 
           that screams Dynasty. 

           Her co-workers laugh. 

                                 WORKER
                        Never seen you in a dress. 

           Sandi blushes.
           INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

           Anna, dressed conservatively, for her, in a two piece blazer 
           and mini skirt, sits nervously excited. 

           Anna enjoys being in the traditional man’s role of provider. 

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           The limo pulls up and Anna pops her head out the moon roof. 

           Sandi, reluctantly dressed in the silk two-piece, walks out. 

                                 ANNA
                        Happy Anniversary baby.  

           Anna can’t be bothered to see that Sandi’s overwhelmed.

           INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

           Anna checks out the dress on Sandi. 

                                 SANDI
                        You knew my exact size and 
                        everything. I mean, I’m flattered. 
                        But... you really didn’t have to go 
                        all out. 

                                 ANNA
                        I never got spoiled growing up. I’m 
                        just making up for lost time! 

           It makes Sandi uncomfortable.

                                 ANNA
                        You want to see something?

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Anna brings Sandi to the dirty-magazine section. 

           She grabs a Playboy with her on the cover: ANNA NICOLE SMITH 
           PLAYMATE OF THE MONTH MAY 1992.   

                                 SANDI
                        Holy shit... my girlfriend is a 
                        centerfold.
           INT. TATTOO PALOR - NIGHT

           A tattoo artist works on Anna’s ankle while another artist 
           works on Sandi’s arm. There’s a torn out page from Anna’s 
           Playboy shoot taped up as reference.  

           Anna’s tattoo is done——Sandi’s initials inside a heart with 
           vines wrapped around it. 

                                 ANNA
                        Let me see yours! 

           Sandi’s artist moves his hand to reveal a replica of Anna’s 
           face on Sandi’s shoulder. It gives Anna a tingle.

           INT. ANTONIO’S STEAK HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT

           Post-tattoo Anna and Sandi step up to the hostess, who gawks 
           at the handsy couple. Anna grabs Sandi’s ass. 

           The hostess escorts them into the dining room just as Pierce 
           Marshall passes by with a crowd of business men.

                                 PIERCE
                        Miss Smith, what brings you here?
                             (re: Sandi)
                        Who’s this?

                                 ANNA
                        This is... Betty... my cousin... 
                        from Mexia.   

                                 PIERCE
                        Pierce Marshall. 

           Sandi and Pierce shake hands. 

                                 PIERCE
                        What’s the occasion?

           Anna hesitates. 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s her birthday. 

           Pierce waves a waiter over. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Please put these ladies on my tab.  

                                 ANNA
                        Thank you, but I can pay for  
                        myself.
           Anna pulls out a wad of cash and hands it to the waiter. 

                                 ANNA
                        We’ll take the best table with a 
                        view. 

                                 PIERCE
                        I’ll be sure to tell dad I ran into 
                        you.

                                 ANNA
                        Actually, the truth is I just got 
                        back early from my modeling trip 
                        and was planning to surprise him.   

                                 PIERCE
                        Oh he’s not one for surprises. 
                        Enjoy your steaks, ladies. 

           Anna feels his spite. Pierce leaves as Sandi looks on. 

                                 SANDI
                        I don’t know why we had to come 
                        here. Hardee’s is just as good.

           INT. SANDI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clothes strewn all over the bed, Sandi and Anna make-out. 
           Sandi pulls away, a thought nagging at her.

                                 SANDI
                        If that old timer wants to use his 
                        money to help you, then God bless 
                        him. But I guess what I want to 
                        know is——do you love him? 

                                 ANNA
                        Quit fussin’ about Howard. We ain’t 
                        fuckin’ if that’s what you need to 
                        know. We’re friends. 

                                 SANDI
                        Okay. But does he ever get mad that 
                        you go out all the time? 

                                 ANNA
                        I talk to him every day. And we see 
                        each other once a week for lunch.

           The conversation stresses her out. Anna grabs her bottle of 
           prescription pills and takes one. 
                                 ANNA
                        He knows I have my night life 
                        needs. He pays for it. 

           Anna gives Sandi a pill. 

                                 SANDI
                        Why are you always reaching for 
                        these?

                                 ANNA
                        They’re my superpower. 

           Sandi doesn’t really want one, but she takes it anyway——it’s 
           hard to deny Anna. 

                                 ANNA
                        You better not ever cheat on me. 

                                 SANDI
                        Are you insane? My life sucked 
                        before I met you.  

                                 ANNA
                        Cause now if you do, you know I’ll 
                        be watching you. 

           She licks Sandi’s new tattoo of her own likeness. 

                                 ANNA
                        You can’t ever get rid of me now!

           Already naked Anna pulls Sandi’s clothes off. 

           INT. SANDI’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sandi delivers coffee to Anna who snuggles on the sofa. Sandi 
           grabs her car keys up to leave. 

                                 ANNA
                        Where you going?

                                 SANDI
                             (obviously)
                        Uh, work?    

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t leave me. 

           Anna gives her puppy dog eyes. 

                                 ANNA
                        Purdy pleaaaase?
           Anna grabs Sandi’s hands, pulling her back into bed. She 
           pours them Champagne in bed for breakfast. Sandi stays.

           Anna lays back on the pillows. 

           The room SPINS:

           Another woman in bed with Sandi and Anna. 

           The room SPINS again:

           INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - BEDROOM SET - DAY

           The spinning stops briefly on: an overhead shot of Anna——nude 
           on top of satin sheets——hair curled and tousled——skin tanned 
           except for a pale bunny logo on her hip. 

           The rooms SPINS again and with every spin: A NEW SET-UP. 

           Black lace. Yellow gauze. Wet hair. A horse whip. 

           Until finally we LAND on: Anna in thigh highs, heels, 
           crawling on hands and knees. She flips her hair up and GROWLS 
           like a cat. SNAP!

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Alright everybody, that’s a wrap on 
                        Anna-Nicole. 

           The crew CLAPS. We see Sandi, looking exhausted but devoted, 
           sitting in a corner nearby. She stands and approaches Anna.

           JUST THEN -- HUGH HEFNER, smoking jacket and all, enters the 
           room. Anna shoos Sandi away, but not before Hef clocks their 
           intimate exchange.

                                 HEF
                        Hope you’re enjoying our little 
                        Shangri-la?

                                 ANNA
                        It’s a dream come true.   

                                 HEF
                        I’ve got meetings the rest of the 
                        day, but why don’t you come down to 
                        the Grotto later and meet some of 
                        the other Playmates.   

           Hef winks and walks off. Sandi tries to approach again but 
           this time Mary, the photo editor, heads her off. 
           Sandi looks around, not sure where she fits in, she mingles 
           with a lighting grip. 

                                 MARY
                        Ready for your interview?

                                 ANNA
                        Sandeeee... can you order me some 
                        lunch? I’m starving.

                                 MARY
                        Before Playboy, what were you 
                        doing... in Texas?

                                 ANNA
                        I was an exotic dancer. 

           Mary doesn’t write that down.

                                 MARY
                        You may be surprised but our 
                        consumers like more wholesome 
                        fairytales.

           The assertion she’s not wounds Anna briefly. 

                                 MARY
                        Fantasy is what sells. I bet you 
                        had to struggle quite bit as a 
                        country girl. All on your own? 

           Catching on, Anna adapts.

                                 ANNA
                        I worked at Red Lobster and Jim’s 
                        Fried Chicken before that.  

                                 MARY
                        That’s good. How ‘bout a little tid-
                        bit, on how rough it was? 

                                 ANNA
                        It got so bad I had to beg for food 
                        stamps just to get a chocolate bar.  

           Sandi watches as they continue the interview. 

           EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION - GARDEN POOL - DAY

           Anna and Sandi walk up to a surprisingly empty pool. Anna 
           strips naked and dives in, breaking their silent tension. 
                                 ANNA
                        Don’t be a party pooper, come in. 

                                 SANDI
                        I don’t have a swim suit.

           Sandi gets in with her shirt and underwear on. Anna 
           summersaults underwater. When she surfaces, Sandi swims over.

                                 ANNA
                        I just have to act like that in 
                        front of everyone.

                                 SANDI
                        Why am I even here?

                                 ANNA
                        We’re at the Playboy mansion 
                        meeting famous people——I’m doing 
                        you a favor. 

                                 SANDI
                        I quit my job. 

           Anna swims to the deep end. Sandi follows her, like a lost 
           puppy looking for an owner. They tread water, face to face. 

                                 SANDI
                        You know how it feels when I have 
                        to pretend to be the help?

                                 ANNA
                        Well you could make it a little 
                        less obvious and wear a dress or 
                        something. What’s wrong with you 
                        anyway?

           Suddenly, Anna grabs her leg, flailing. 

                                 ANNA
                        Owww. Leg cramp! 

           She grabs Sandi, who treads water faster, holding Anna’s 
           weight up. Anna wraps herself around Sandi. Anna gasps. 

                                 ANNA
                        Help!

           Sandi sinks under as she boosts Anna up, allowing her to grab 
           the side of the pool. Anna collects herself. 

           A black haired bunny, KENDALL, (20s) saucy and mischievous, 
           walks over to the pool with a couple of bunnies in tow. 
           Kendall notices the skirmish and breaks off from the others 
           to approach Anna, dangling on the pool’s edge.

                                 KENDALL
                        Everything okay over here?

                                 ANNA
                        Thought I’d take a little pre-game 
                        skinny dip.

                                 KENDALL
                        I’m glad you decided to stay and 
                        play. We’re headed to the grotto. 
                        Come join. 

           Sandi gasps for air as she finally finds the ledge.

                                 KENDALL
                             (re: Sandi)
                        Who’s this?

           Anna pulls herself out and joins Kendall. 

                                 ANNA
                        My assistant. She was just on her 
                        way out. 

           Kendall takes note. Anna follows Kendall and they join the 
           other bunnies heading to the grotto. 

           Sandi watches them flirt in the distance. 

                                        MARCH 2001

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY FAMILY COURT - HOUSTON - DAY

           Hair curled with mini butterfly clips all over, Anna, back on 
           the witness stand, really strains to understand the angle 
           behind Rusty’s current line of questioning. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Are you contending that in December 
                        1994, that this man, this business 
                        man you said was totally with it 
                        and was in control of his mind and 
                        his business senses was being kept 
                        from giving you money from his son? 

           Anna seems sedated but also trying intensely to focus on 
           keeping up with the proceedings.
                                 ANNA
                        Well, he told me that Pierce would 
                        only give him a hundred thousand 
                        for my Christmas and I know that 
                        and he asked me what I wanted and I 
                        said half cash and half -- 

                                 RUSTY
                             (interrupting)
                        Ms. Marshall? What kind of world is 
                        it when people start talking about 
                        only a hundred thousand for 
                        Christmas?

           Finally, a question she feels she knows the answer to.

                                 ANNA
                             (obviously)
                        My husband spent hundreds of 
                        thousands on me, a hundred thousand 
                        dollars is not a lot of money. 

           Playing up his shock in a gotcha way. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Pardon me? A hundred thousand 
                        dollars is not a lot of money to 
                        you?

           Rusty knows she’s blowing it in front of the jury.

                                 ANNA
                        No, sir. My husband, you don’t 
                        understand, he threw money at me, 
                        he--it--my-- 

           She tries to find the words that could describe the sheer 
           magnitude of the experience. She can’t. Of course she can’t.

           Instead, she falls into a dreamy smile, a memory of Howard.

                                 RUSTY
                        Ms. Marshall how do you spend a 
                        hundred thousand dollars a week? 

                                 ANNA
                        Well. 
                             (counting with her hands)
                        You gotta buy shoes. You gotta buy 
                        gowns. You gotta have hair and make-
                        up. I mean it’s very expensive to 
                        be me. It’s terrible the things I 
                        have to do to be me. 
           Rusty laughs. The jury laughs. 

                                 RUSTY
                        I would agree.

           She laughs, unsure if she’s in on it or the butt of the joke.

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY

           A large dressing room suite with seating. Elaine and Virgie 
           watch as Anna tries on a dress. Her girth has grown. 

           INT. NEIMAN MARCUS DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           A store clerk holds a slew of dresses that nearly weigh her 
           down. Virgie and Elaine stand nearby. 

           Anna steps out of the changing room in a floral dress with 
           way too much cleavage. 

                                 ANNA
                        None of these fit. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Kind of hard when you’ve got Mount 
                        Rushmore as a chest. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        Hard Copy just did a special on how 
                        those things explode. The Good Lord 
                        made us how we are for a reason.   

                                 ELAINE
                        The Good Lord forgot to give me a 
                        body.

                                 ANNA
                        Y’all like ‘em when they’re buying 
                        you things!

           Anna sorts through the dresses in the woman’s arms, tossing 
           the rejects at Elaine.

                                 ANNA
                        Pick out whichever ones you want. 

           Elaine grabs a dress. 
                                 ELAINE
                        Never owned a BCBG before. 

                                 ANNA
                        Y’all better be nice to me now that 
                        I’m rich. 

           CASH REGISTER

           The sales clerk rings up the pile of clothes. Anna hands over 
           her card. The woman slides it. Declined. 

                                 SALES CLERK
                        Do you have another card Miss?

                                 ANNA
                        That card’s fine. Try it again.

           She slides it again. Virgie eyes Anna. 

                                 SALE CLERK
                        I’m sorry, it’s not going through. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        My daughter is very wealthy.

                                 ELAINE
                        If that ain’t a fact, God’s a 
                        possum.

                                 SALES CLERK
                        That may be true Ma’am but her card 
                        has still been declined. 

           Virgie steals a concerned glance at Anna.

           INT. ANTONIO’S STEAK HOUSE - RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Anna walks up to the reception desk. She’s nervous. 

           Anna spots Howard already seated in his usual booth but 
           before he spots her she ducks into the ladies room. 

           INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Anna shakes her arms, breaths heavily, and generally attempts 
           to get a grip. 

           Hesitantly, she takes out her pill bottle, fighting the urge, 
           and knowing it’s a problem. Still, she downs one.
           A WAITRESS pokes her head in.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Your grandpa is waiting for you. 

           INT. ANTONIO’S STREAK HOUSE - MAIN DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Anna, having somehow gotten her shit together, makes her way 
           through the overpriced restaurant. 

           She joins Howard, who can’t but beam, at a prime booth with a 
           view of the San Jacinto River below. 

           Howard’s about to speak. Anna interrupts.

                                 ANNA
                        Wait, can I just say something 
                        first? 

           Howard nods, amused by her nervousness. 

                                 ANNA
                        First of all, you are the sweetest 
                        kindest person I’ve ever met. You 
                        take care of me and Daniel. You 
                        respect my way of life, never look 
                        down on me. You teach me stuff all 
                        the time, like about World War II 
                        and tax write offs. You tell me 
                        what I should do, and how I can 
                        make myself better. And I just want 
                        to say that I can try harder for 
                        you. If you give me one more 
                        chance, I can be a better person. 

           Howard is at a loss. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Why would you say this?

                                 ANNA
                        I know you cut me off because I 
                        haven’t been around as much. It’s 
                        just that, I’ve been real busy with 
                        photoshoots and my career taking 
                        off. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Haven’t I been supportive of your 
                        career?! 
                                 ANNA
                        That doesn’t mean I haven’t been 
                        thinking about you.

                                 HOWARD
                        Did you think I asked you here 
                        because I was cutting you off? 

                                 ANNA
                        You’re not?

                                 HOWARD
                        Actually I was thinking, you 
                        haven’t had a “big kill” in a 
                        while. 

           Anna can’t hide her relief. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Orson drives the Rolls Royce up to a two story house on a 
           sprawling ranch. 

           INT. / EXT. ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

                                 HOWARD
                        I figure you and Daniel need a 
                        little more room. 

           Anna sticks her head out the sun roof wide-eyed at the size 
           of the property. All that land is for her.

                                 HOWARD
                        Now you can get yourself those few 
                        horses you want.

           Anna lowers and cries. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Why are you crying?

                                 ANNA
                        I really don’t deserve you. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Just think of this as a refund for 
                        all the happiness you give me. 

           She wipes her guilt-tears and plants a red kiss on his lips.
           INT. RUSTY HARDIN’S LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Rusty, on the phone, hands an associate some paperwork. 

                                 RUSTY
                        New will is on the way to you now. 
                        You’ll want to be discreet about 
                        the irrefutable language. It’ll 
                        raise a red flag.

           INT. HOWARD MARSHALL'S - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Pierce Marshall stands with LETITIA, (30s) a sturdy woman in 
           a formal nurse’s uniform. 

           In the background, a series of GUNSHOTS can be heard. 

           It’s jarring to Letitia who tries to remain collected.

           Another GUNSHOT. Pierce looks out the French doors. Outside, 
           Howard shoots a rifle from his wheelchair. 

           EXT. HOWARD MARSHALL'S ESTATE - PATIO - DAY

           Pierce, holding a manila envelope, joins Howard on the patio. 
           Howard aims the gun at a bottle set up on his lawn. 

                                 HOWARD
                        It’s too long. I like things to be 
                        simple and clear——a one-pager.

                                 PIERCE
                        If something happened to you, god 
                        forbid, there’s room for Howard 
                        Junior to make a claim. 

                                 HOWARD
                        This isn’t about Junior.

                                 PIERCE
                        I’m trying to protect you from what 
                        you don’t see coming.  

                                 HOWARD
                        So now I’m not capable of making my 
                        own choices? 

           Pierce pulls photos out of the envelope. They’re intimate 
           shots of Anna and Sandi. 
                                 HOWARD
                        Before you come back here again, 
                        you need to get your pathetic 
                        jealousy of my success with this 
                        beautiful woman in check. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Just looking out for you. 

           Howard tosses them on the ground. Pierce leaves in defeat. 

           Once Pierce is gone, Howard looks at the discarded photos 
           with a pained uncertainty.

           INT. LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO SET - DAY 

           On the fully lit sound stage, Anna sits across from Larry 
           King. The cameras roll. Anna’s lawyers wait in the wings. 

                                 LARRY
                        You’ve claimed that you wanted to 
                        have a career first, sort of 
                        proving you weren’t just out for 
                        the money, right? 

                                 ANNA
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 LARRY
                        You waited something like four 
                        years. Would you have made him wait 
                        longer had your career not started 
                        to nose dive? I heard you were 
                        broke, is that true? 

                                 ANNA
                             (laughing it off)
                        Nose dive, who said that? I’m doing 
                        fine, thank you very much. 

           MAGICALLY, the studio DISSOLVES into --

           THE HARRIS COUNTY COURTHOUSE 

           Anna now on the stand and Larry replacing Rusty. On trial for 
           the world.  

                                 LARRY
                        I’m not blaming you. This town is 
                        fickle, happens to the best.

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        But the boozing and pills didn’t 
                        help, would you agree?

                                 ANNA
                        People make that into a bigger 
                        thing than it is--I mean--it’s not 
                        like doing hard stuff. I took 
                        prescription medication. Xanax for 
                        my insomnia. Vicodin for my 
                        migraines. The press just likes the 
                        “druggie” story.

                                 LARRY
                        Would you say you loved him? 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh yes, very much. For what he did 
                        for me and my son. I mean I never 
                        had love like that before. He 
                        didn’t care what people thought of 
                        me either. And I trusted Howard, 
                        which is saying a lot--I didn’t 
                        really have anyone I could trust. 

           Larry turns to the jury, as if they were the studio camera.

                                 LARRY
                        We’ll take a break and come back to 
                        talk more with the lovely Anna 
                        Nicole Smith who is battling in 
                        court for a stake in her late 
                        husband’s estate.

           INT. ANNA'S RANCH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           All new furniture. Cricket (the cockatoo) hangs by the doors. 

           Anna, in a bikini, lays on a chaise with Booger (the cat) 
           curled in her lap. She clutches her diamond necklace with 
           long fake nails. 

           Elaine reads from the TEXAS MONTHLY.

                                 ELAINE
                        Anna Nicole Smith is the busty girl 
                        on the arm of Houston oil baron J. 
                        Howard Marshall II. And God bless 
                        Vickie Lynn, the fatherless country 
                        girl who finally found her gusher.  

           Anna hits the magazine out of Elaine’s hands. 
                                 ELAINE
                        You need another drink honey?  

           Daniel races in with a gang of COUSINS and Uncle Ray. 

                                 COUSINS
                        Daddy can we go swimming in 
                        Daniel’s pool?

                                 RAY 
                        Last one in is a rotten egg. 

           They race out and dive into the pool. Anna is focused on the 
           father and son duo play. 

           Elaine desperately tries to stay in Anna’s favor.

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m not Virgie, ya’know. Who’s the 
                        one that told you about Rick’s in 
                        the first place? 

           Anna tunes her out. She’s fixated on Ray with the kids.

           INT. HOUSTON - BIRTH PARENTS OFFICE - DAY

           A kind looking woman, RENEE (60s) sits across from Anna. A 
           poster reads: “Reuniting families since seventy-two.”

                                 RENEE
                        Tracked him down living a few 
                        blocks from Grimes Park. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh my god. That’s right near the 
                        house I grew up in. 

                                 RENEE
                        It’s the damndest thing. They 
                        usually are just under our noses. 

           INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

           A HOUSE KEEPER helps Anna put curlers in her hair.  

                                 ANNA
                        Would you dial Sandi again. 

           She does. 

                                 HOUSEKEEPER
                        No answer. 
           INT. SANDI'S APARTMENT - DAY

           The phone RINGS and RINGS in the empty room. 

           INT. HILL’S GAY BAR - NIGHT

           Anna enters the bar dolled up and slightly crazed. The usual 
           crowd dances and drinks. 

           Anna scans faces, looking for Sandi, who she spots with a 
           group of friends. Anna approaches with intensity. 

                                 ANNA
                        Where’ve you been?

                                 SANDI
                        Was I supposed to be somewhere?

                                 ANNA
                        I need someone to come with me. 
                        Right now. It’s important.  

                                 SANDI
                        I can’t.

                                 ANNA
                        You know how I get when I’m alone. 

                                 SANDI
                        Ask Howard. Or take a pill --

           Hitting Anna where it hurts. A friend of Sandi’s steps up. 

                                 LADY FRIEND
                        Sandi, come on, let’s go.  

                                 ANNA
                        Who’s face is on her arm?

                                 ANOTHER LADY FRIEND
                        Heard you liked ‘em older anyway.

                                 FIRST LADY FRIEND
                        And more leathery.

           Sandi waves off her friends. They step aside.

                                 ANNA
                        You said you’d always have my back.

           Sandi lowers her eyes. 
                                 SANDI
                        I miss Vickie.

                                 ANNA
                        Vickie was nobody. 

                                 SANDI
                        She was fun.

                                 ANNA
                        Come ooooon. Purdy please.

                                 SANDI
                        I can’t get caught up in your 
                        whirlwind again. There’s no room 
                        for me.  

                                 ANNA
                        Then you can have those freaks.

           Anna leaves in haughty indifference. In reality, she’s 
           crushed and deeply alone.  

           INT. RANCH HOUSE - SAME NIGHT

           Anna paces in the foyer in her heels. She peaks out the 
           window several times. 

           Her red Mercedes parked out front. Nearby, Elaine waits with 
           her. Anna takes her heels off. 

                                 ANNA
                        My back is killing me. 

                                 ELAINE
                        If Virgie knew I was helping you do 
                        this, I swear to God, she’d raise 
                        hell and stick a chunk under it.

           Finally, headlights. 

                                 ANNA
                             (holy shit)
                        He’s here.  

           DONALD HOGAN, (40s) Anna’s BIOLOGICAL FATHER with a blonde 
           receding hair-line slicked back and a used car salesman 
           charisma, walks up to the front door. 

           Anna opens it. Donald takes Anna in like a tall drink of 
           water. Creepy as fuck. The odd part, no one seems to care.  
                                 DONALD
                        Well hell, I don’t know wether to 
                        shit or go blind!

                                 ANNA
                        I guess it’s been a while since 
                        you’ve seen me.

           Anna leads him into the house. 

                                 DONALD
                        Hoo-Wee. Look at this place!

           She awkwardly shows him around. He stops in front of Anna’s 
           framed Playboy cover.  

                                 DONALD
                        When I saw you in the magazines——I 
                        couldn’t believe that it was my 
                        little girl. I actually saw them, 
                        the pictures, before I knew...

                                 ANNA
                        Yep. That’s me.

           Elaine makes drinks at the wet bar. Donald looks out the 
           window at her convertible.

                                 DONALD
                        The whip yours too?

                                 ANNA
                        Want to take it for a spin? I’m 
                        sick of being at this house anyway.  

                                 DONALD
                        How many houses you got?

                                 ANNA
                        Two here, one in L.A.

           INT. MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT 

           Anna and Donald drink milkshakes parked at a McDonald’s lot. 

                                 DONALD
                        Me and your mom were teenagers when 
                        we had you.

                                 ANNA
                        Runs in the family.  
                                 DONALD
                        Virgie don’t approve of me. I guess 
                        you knew that. 

                                 ANNA
                        I take advice from people I admire. 

           Anna finishes up her milkshake. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’d love to see how fast this thing 
                        can go. 

           Anna hands him the keys. 

                                 DONALD
                        Who’d a thunk? My daughter, a 
                        millionaire...

           Anna hangs onto this sliver of happiness.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Donald pulls the car out and speeds off. 

           EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - DAY 

           A group of preppy third graders play hand ball. Daniel stays 
           on the side lines, a little smaller than the others. 

           A teacher approaches and points to the parking area. Daniel 
           turns and spots Anna, dressed to the nines in her Jaguar. 

           She sticks her head up out of the moon roof and waves 
           flamboyantly. He hides from her view. 

           EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL - DAY

           Mothers and housekeepers line up in the carpool lane in 
           soccer mom vans and dressed for country club tennis.

           Daniel, with his oversized backpack, walks to the Jaguar. 
           Anna steps out of the car and generally makes a big fuss. 

           Embarrassed, Daniel evades her and quickly hops in the front 
           seat. She clocks this with amusement. 
           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Daniel ducks, mortified that students from the playground 
           will notice them.

                                 ANNA
                        You want to do the moon roof?

                                 DANIEL
                        Mom, can we just go please.

                                 ANNA
                        You used to love sticking your head 
                        out the top with me. 

           Daniel pulls away.

                                 ANNA
                        I brought your cowboy clothes to 
                        meet your grandpa. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I already have a Paw-Paw. 

           As they pull up to a residence, Daniel peeks out the window. 

           THROUGH THE WINDOW:

           Donald emerges from a double-wide in a western shirt and a 
           bolero tie.   

           His son, DONNIE JR. (17), his dad’s handsome doppelgänger, 
           stands with a knowing grin as he sees Anna.  

           Anna sticks her head out of the Limo. 

                                 ANNA
                        There’s my daaadaaay!

                                 DONALD
                        That’s my babygirl. 

           Anna steps out and hugs Donald a little too tightly. Daniel 
           timidly joins them.

                                 ANNA
                        This is my pride and joy, Daniel. 

                                 DONALD 
                        Howdy, cowboy.  

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m an oil man. Not a cowboy. 
           Donald holds up his hand for a high-five. Daniel shyly shakes 
           his hand instead. 

                                 DONALD 
                        A proper gentleman, I can respect 
                        that.

                                 ANNA
                        He’s just started the third grade. 
                        Honor student, straight As. 

                                 DONNIE JR.
                        Nice dress. 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s an Italian designer. Made with 
                        a blend of spandex and something 
                        called lycra.   

           When Dolly Parton said, “It costs a lot to look this cheap,” 
           she could’ve been talking about this moment.

           EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

           Anna welcomes in a small TV DOCUMENTARY CREW through the 
           front door. Inside Daniel, Donald, and Donnie are gathered in 
           their prime-time best. 

                                 ANNA
                        When do we start? 

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        We’re rolling right now.

                                 ANNA
                        Welcome to my ranch. I’m Anna 
                        Nicole Smith.  

           Donald looks thrilled to be there. Anna turns to him and 
           turns back to camera.  

                                 ANNA
                        This here is Donald, my daaaadeey.

           CAMERA’S POV:

           Inside the ranch house is a life sized blow-up of Anna on the 
           cover of Playboy next to an extravagant Christmas tree.

           Anna leads Donald and Donnie Jr. on a tour of the house.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        What’s it feel like to have your 
                        daughter be the playmate of the 
                        year?

                                 DONALD
                        Can’t believe she comes from my 
                        genes. I can tell you that much. 

           Donald follows her around like a puppy dog, which she loves.

           Anna points at random features of the house as she passes. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Some say you’re the most famous 
                        centerfold now. Tabloids can’t seem 
                        to get enough of you.

                                 ANNA
                        Did you see the one about me going 
                        out for a steak dinner alone with a 
                        pig? Lies. Rascal’s a vegetarian!

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Not all of it’s that soft. 

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t mind as long as they’re 
                        talking about me. 

           We follow her out.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Anna touches the counter, gesturing like a game show host.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s real marble. Or granite. One 
                        of those.

           BACK TO CAMERA’S POV

           Donald snatches a Playboy from Donnie whose been peaking at 
           Anna’s nude spread. 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s illegal to look at yer sister 
                        that way. But she is something 
                        isn’t she?! 
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Was it really your first time 
                        meeting just a few weeks ago?

                                 ANNA
                        We met for the first time in Twenty-
                        four years. That’s how old I am 
                        now.

           OUTSIDE PATIO

           Anna leads the crew to an outdoor pen where a tiny pot-
           bellied pig rummages around. Daniel picks the pig up. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Yours is a real rags to riches 
                        story. What was it like growing up 
                        in Texas?

                                 ANNA
                        Y’all want to know about my child 
                        life? About how I was left to 
                        defend myself... what my mother let 
                        my step-father do to me?

           INT. VIRGIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Virgie strides into the house carrying two bags of groceries. 
           Anna follows after her. Daniel immediately plops on the couch 
           and plays Zelda on Nintendo.  

           Virgie whips past Ray, nearly spilling his beer. 

                                 RAY
                        What’s got her motor revving? 

           Anna runs after Virgie who ducks into the bathroom. Anna 
           leans on the closed door. 

                                 ANNA
                        Mother?

           INSIDE BATHROOM 

           Virgie turns on the shower but leans on the counter, 
           marinating in her pain. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        You can keep talking but I’m not 
                        listening.  
           OUTSIDE BATHROOM DOOR

                                 ANNA
                        Momma, please try and understand. I 
                        want to make money and I want to be 
                        noticed. So these stories that I 
                        tell, momma, it's not about you, 
                        it's about me.

                                 VIRGIE (O.S.)
                        “I was a country girl who had to 
                        beg for food stamps. My Momma 
                        didn’t care if I finished school.” 

                                 ANNA
                        You’re gonna regret this Virgie.

                                 VIRGIE (O.S.)
                        “You want to know what my momma let 
                        my step-father do to me?”

                                 ANNA
                        I wish it was a lie. You won’t even 
                        admit some of it’s true.

           The whole thing is painful enough to make everyone want to 
           crawl in a hole and die.

           INT. THE RED LOBSTER - NIGHT

           At the end of a rowdy dinner, Anna, Donald, Donnie Jr., 
           Daniel and Howard are seated the table. Everyone’s boozed up.

                                 ANNA 
                        My favorite place with my favorite 
                        people. I just want y’all to know 
                        that -- y’all are the only people 
                        that know the real me.   

           Anna sleepily feeds Howard a lobster claw dripping in butter. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m ready to go sleep-sleep.

           Anna hooks arms with Donald. 

           FRONT ENTRANCE

           Donald helps Anna through the front door. Orson wheels Howard 
           behind. Daniel and Donnie follow.  
           EXT. RED LOBSTER - NIGHT

           It’s a downpour with a pile-up of cars. No way for the Rolls 
           to get to the entrance drive.  

                                 ORSON
                        I’ll be back with the car. 

           Orson races to the lot. In the cold, Anna and Donald race 
           after him, followed by Daniel and Donnie Jr. 

           Howard is left alone, exposed. 

           INT. ROLLS - NIGHT

           Boozy and pilled out, Anna’s head lols as she nods off on 
           Donald’s shoulder.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Mom, we forgot Paw-Paw.

           Anna looks up. Orson flips a fast U-Turn.

                                 ANNA
                        Howard!? Oh my god!

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           Orson races back up to a shivering Howard.  

           INT. ANNA’S BRENTWOOD BUNGALOW - DAY

           A small ranch style house——a girly and flamboyant shrine to 
           Anna. A make-up artist and hair stylist work on Anna. 

           Donald and Donnie Jr. step in wearing suits. 

                                 ANNA
                        Y’all are gonna meet so many 
                        celebrities. 

                                 DONNIE JR.
                        You think Hulk Hogan will be there?

                                 ANNA
                        Probably. 

           Anna looks at her hair. 

                                 ANNA
                        Bigger. 
           EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION - DAY

           In the back garden lawn of the mansion, a lavish ceremony for 
           the “Playmate of The Year” is mid-stream. 

           Camera crews and a crowd of playmates, b-list celebrities, 
           and tanned plastic surgeons, are gathered at the edge of the 
           patio leading to the infamous mansion. 

           Hugh Hefner stands next to Anna, in a Marilyn style white 
           halter dress and hair as big as we’ve seen it. 

           A banner reads: PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR 1993. 

           Hefner steps up to the podium holding a laminated plaque with 
           the Anna Nicole cover on it. 

                                 HEFNER
                             (into microphone)
                        I’d like to present Miss Anna 
                        Nicole Smith with the honor of 
                        Playmate of the Year for nineteen 
                        ninety three. 

           Anna kisses Hef as she holds a human-sized check for 100K.

           The crowd CHEERS. Cameras FLASH. Workers unveil enormous 
           posters of all her covers. 

           Hefner hands Anna a bouquet of white lilies. She beams as she 
           steps up to the microphone.  

                                 ANNA
                        For a country girl from Texas, you 
                        sure did make my dreams come true. 
                        I gotta thank the two things that 
                        got me everything I am. 
                             (shakes her breasts)
                        Also, this is extra special because 
                        my daddy is here with me to 
                        celebrate. Hi Daddy!
                             (waves)
                        And thanks to all the love from 
                        Playboy and Mr. Hefner, I’m about 
                        to shoot my first movie. 

           Donald and Donnie Jr., in baggy suits, stand in the crowd. 
           Donald is boozing heavily not paying attention. 

                                 ANNA
                        Let’s get this party started! 

           The crowd CHEERS awkwardly. The photographers snap photos of 
           Anna and Hefner. Anna eats a giant piece of cake. 
                                 HEFNER
                             (whispers)
                        You better be careful you don’t 
                        blow-up. 

           PLAYBOY MANSION DRIVEWAY 

           Parked at the end of a long drive is a brand new Jaguar 
           convertible with a red ribbon wrapped around it. 

           Anna opens the car door and poses. The press corps fire away. 

           FLASH. FLASH. FLASH.

           INT. PIERCE MARSHALL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pierce sleeps in the dark next to his wife. The phone RINGS. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Hooked up to machines, Howard sleeps. Orson sits in the 
           corner. LETITIA, the house nurse, stands near Howard’s 
           bedside. Pierce races in. 

                                 ORSON
                        He just caught a bad cold. 

                                 LETITIA
                        Pneumonia isn’t a bad cold. He was 
                        left out in the rain.

                                 PIERCE
                        Who was watching him?

                                 ORSON
                        There was a mix-up, Sir. It’s hard 
                        to know sometimes who’s in charge 
                        of the chair at every moment when 
                        he’s with Vickie-Lynn.

                                 PIERCE
                        That selfish bitch. Letitia you 
                        need to keep Miss Vickie away from 
                        my dad at all cost. Every call 
                        needs to go through me. You got 
                        that? 

                                 LETITIA
                        Yes, sir.
           EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION - NIGHT

           The Playboy party is in full throttle. Anna takes shots with 
           Hef and his girlfriends. She’s falling out of her dress.  

           Nearby, a PLAYBOY BUNNY on the arm of a Hollywood AGENT type.  

                                 PLAYBOY BUNNY
                        She’s a lot fatter in real life. 

                                 AGENT 
                        I’d fuck her. All that matters in 
                        this town anyway. 

           The Playboy Bunny gives him dead eyes. Nearby, Donald flirts 
           with a publicity WOMAN. They notice Anna slurring and barely 
           able to walk. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Is she okay?

                                 DONALD
                        Who?

           The woman realizes Donald doesn’t give a shit about his 
           daughter. She seizes the opening. 

                                 WOMAN
                        She is your daughter, right? I 
                        mean, you do look way too young. 

           With that one compliment, she’s got his attention. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Are all the rumors about her true?  

                                 DONALD
                        Don’t know what the fuck you’re 
                        talking about. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Because if even just one or two of 
                        them, say, are true, I’m certain my 
                        viewers would want to know. And 
                        we’d be happy to do whatever it 
                        takes to get them that info.  

           Slowly, Donald’s face breaks into a grin. 

                                 DONALD
                        God I love Hollywood. 
           LATER

           Anna rides a mechanical bull which was brought in just for 
           the occasion. Donnie Jr. cheers her on awkwardly. 

           The bull slows down. Anna steps off, nearly falls. A stranger 
           helps her down. She approaches Donnie Jr. with a young model.  

                                 ANNA
                        Where’s Donald?

           Donnie barely looks up.

                                 DONNIE JR.
                        Left a while ago with his “new 
                        friends.”

           Anna hides her hurt with a laugh and more booze. She grabs 
           another drink and downs it. 

           She turns to find she’s surrounded by strangers. 

           A young STUD eyes Anna. This momentarily alleviates her 
           loneliness. 

                                 STUD
                        What’re you doing all alone? 

           Anna immediately turns back into her sexpot role-play.

                                 ANNA
                        Who said I’m alone?

           She throws her arms around him, kissing him wildly.

                                 STUD
                        It must be my lucky day.

           INT. ANNA’S BRENTWOOD BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Anna and the young stud stumble in. Anna’s a hot mess. She 
           turns the lights out before she gets on the bed, lays back, 
           and opens her legs——giving him what she thinks he expects. 

           Anna and the stud have sad sloppy sex. The guy stops for a 
           moment considering her lack of enthusiasm. 

                                 STUD
                        Do you even like sex?

           Anna, wanting to uphold the sex goddess mystique, closes her 
           eyes and emits the saddest most committed FAKE-GROAN you’ve 
           ever heard. 
           Feeling more alone than ever and hating that she’s 
           pretending, she throws him off and gets on top. 

           She grinds him, desperate for a good fuck. Encouraged, the 
           stud continues rapidly until he GRUNTS loudly. And, it’s 
           over. Her big night ends splayed out in a naked stupor.

           MORNING

           Nearly dawn, the guy SNORES. Anna, with tear-stained eye 
           liner, sits on the floor with a phone and dials. 

           INT. MARSHALL ESTATE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Letitia picks up a ringing phone. She has a tray of food on 
           the counter. 

                                 LETITIA 
                        Marshall residence.

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED:

                                 ANNA
                        I need to talk to him. It’s 
                        important. 

                                 LETITIA 
                        Ms. Anna? It’s not a good time.

                                 ANNA
                        Howard would want to hear from me 
                        no matter what time it is.

                                 LETITIA 
                        I can give him your message. 

                                 ANNA
                        Tell him I love him.  

           The receiver goes dead. 

           Letitia hangs up, then dials a number. It RINGS. We HEAR 
           Pierce answer on the other end. 

           INT. HOWARD MARSHALL'S ESTATE - DAY

           Howard is served lunch. He looks over the new will. Letitia 
           stands nearby. 
                                 HOWARD
                        Anyone call?

           Desperately hoping for good news. Letitia wants to tell the 
           truth, but remains loyal to Pierce. 

                                 LETITIA
                        Just Pierce, sir. 

           Howard considers the will. He sets it aside, not ready to 
           sign it yet. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS BUNGALOW - DAY

           Anna, in a robe, eats breakfast as a PUBLICIST briefs her on 
           her week of press and meetings.

                        An exclusive source, someone in the 
                        immediate family, has confirmed the 
                        Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole is 
                        bisexual and addicted to pills. 

           They show a spread of private photos of Anna Nicole looking 
           wasted and out of control. 

                                 ET NEWS ANCHOR
                        Could this Cinderella story be a 
                        train wreck waiting to happen? 
                        We’ve got the story after the 
                        break.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Anna shuts off the t.v.

                                 PUBLICIST
                        My job would be a lot easier if 
                        you’d ask your family not to speak 
                        to the press. 

                                 ANNA
                        At least they’re talking about me.  
                                 PUBLICIST
                        This is not good. It sends the 
                        wrong signal to the industry right 
                        at the time we’re trying to get you 
                        real meetings.  

           Anna’s eyes sting with shame. She pats her tears preventing 
           them from ruining her make-up. 

                                 ANNA
                        I even got him and Donnie Jr. back 
                        stage tickets to Regis...  

                                 PUBLICIST
                        I’m sorry sweetie. 

                                 ANNA
                        You can’t trust no one. Least of 
                        all your family.

           INT. REGIS AND KATHY LEE - BACK STAGE - DAY

           Anna, hungover in a casual t-shirt and jeans, looks gorgeous. 
           She stares at Donald and Donnie Jr. 

           Anna signs a tabloid magazine and drops it at Donald’s feet.  

                                 ANNA
                        Should be able to sell this for 
                        something. 

           Donald realizes he’s been caught. On stage, the show starts.  
           The live studio audience APPLAUDS as the cameras go live.

                                 REGIS (O.S.)
                        They refer to her as the girl next 
                        door. So how come none of my 
                        neighbors ever looked like her? 
                        Here she comes, please welcome Anna 
                        Nicole Smith. 

           An assistant director signals to Anna and she walks onto the 
           stage. Donald picks up the tabloid, probably to sell.

           EXT. STUDIO SET - REGIS AND KATHY LEE - DAY

           Anna blows a kiss to her screaming fans and sits next to 
           REGIS(60s) and KATHY LEE (40s) classy and petite in tweed.

           Regis reads from a note card, doing his nasally best.
                                 REGIS 
                        Something nice has happened with 
                        all this publicity. Your biological 
                        father and you have been reunited. 
                        Isn’t that right?

                                 ANNA
                        After twenty four years. I found 
                        him. I went through a place called 
                        Birth Parents. It was really 
                        emotional. He totally flipped out. 
                        He said he had seen me in Playboy.

                                 REGIS
                        “Oh daddy, I’m home!”

           Audience LAUGHS. Anna plays along, the irony not lost on her.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Anna lays down on the sofa, alone at home. She watches the 
           interview on T.V. 

           ANNA’S POV:

           The screen blurs in and out from all the pills. Regis tries 
           to get a word in. 

                                 REGIS
                        That certainly is a nice top you 
                        have on.  

           Regis gapes his mouth wide, then playfully slaps his own 
           face. Audience LAUGHTER.

                                 ANNA
                        I heard you were an octopus. 

           Anna throws a cheeky wink at the crowd. With all the noise 
           and distraction Regis missed her response.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Anna looks over at her poster of Marilyn, suddenly aware of a 
           different layer of her idol. Fame isn’t love. It’s a trap.

                                 MARCH 2001

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY COURT HOUSE - DAY

           A blown-up photo of Howard and Anna sits on a big easel. The 
           age difference is jarring. 
           Rusty, mid-interrogation, turns to Anna on the witness stand. 
           She’s worn down by the process. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Now, he could have been your 
                        granddad. Are you saying you were 
                        sexually attracted? 

                                 ANNA
                        It wasn’t sexual like an “oh-baby-
                        baby give it to me, I love your 
                        body” type of thing. It was more of 
                        a deep respect for what he did for 
                        me. He was my savior. 

                                 RUSTY
                        So what you’re saying is you didn’t 
                        provide wifely duties? 

                                 ANNA
                        That’s between me and my husband. 
                        Our bedroom life is our business 
                        and nobody else’s. 

           INT. ANNA'S BED ROOM - LATER

           Outside it storms. Thunder BOOMS. Lighting FLASHES.

           Anna lays in bed next to Daniel who’s asleep. She can’t 
           sleep. She sneaks out of bed and approaches Gizmo’s covered 
           cage. The power goes out. 

           It’s pitch black. There’s a loud CRACK of thunder. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING 

           Anna drives through the pouring rain. Daniel snoozes in the 
           front seat.

           INT. HOWARD MARSHALL'S - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dark save for a few lanterns. Gizmo’s cage sits on a table. 

           Howard and Anna, with her hair in a towel, sit by the fire 
           place. Mid-conversation.

                                 HOWARD
                        Sounds like jealousy to me. 
                                 ANNA
                        They don’t even know me. 

                                 HOWARD
                        In my day, if a man accomplished 
                        the same as you have, they’d have 
                        called him a swashbuckling 
                        raconteur.  

                                 ANNA
                        A what?

                                 HOWARD
                        Honey, what you are is a threat. 

           Anna sits back. The intense pleasure and pain of being seen 
           fully by someone is new to her. 

                                 HOWARD
                        And you’ve given this man here 
                        something to live for.

           Howard pulls a box out from his sweater pocket. 

                                 HOWARD
                        I’d like to know your answer once 
                        and for all. Will you be my wife?

           Anna opens the box to find an enormous diamond ring. 

                                 HOWARD
                        You saved me. And all I want in 
                        life is to take care of you and 
                        Daniel. Forever. 

           And it’s in that moment she knows he saved her too. He places 
           the ring on her wedding finger. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A lantern and some candles illuminate the large open kitchen. 

           Anna scarfs a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m so hungry I could eat a horse. 
                             (in between bites)
                        Ever since I got back, I’ve been on 
                        this starvation diet.

           Anna notices framed photos illuminated by the candlelight. 
                                 ANNA
                             (pointing to a photo)
                        He looks like you.

                                 HOWARD
                        Howard Jr., my oldest. Haven’t 
                        spoken in years. Has a company in 
                        California he built all on his own. 
                        But went behind my back. 

                                 ANNA
                        You still mad?

                                 HOWARD
                        I still love him, from a distance.

                                 ANNA
                        I know how you feel. 

                                 HOWARD
                        At least he’s his own man. 
                        Independent, like you. My other one 
                        may be loyal, but it’s because he 
                        has to be. You understand?  

                                 ANNA
                        More than you know.

           Anna nods as she finishes both sandwiches. 

                                 ANNA
                        Rainy nights are great for drinking 
                        games.

           Anna pours wine with ice cubes for him, how he likes it. 

                                 ANNA
                        Never have I ever?

                                 HOWARD
                        How’s it work?

           Anna drinks. 

                                 ANNA
                        Like, never have I ever been with a 
                        man in a wheelchair. 

           Anna lays across his chair, holding herself up with the 
           table. She takes his hands and places them on her breasts.

           At last, she doesn’t feel like she has to work any 
           angle——she’s just in the moment.  
                                 HOWARD 
                        It’s been a while. 

                                 ANNA
                        Let me do the thinking in this 
                        department.

                                 HOWARD
                        Better grab my pills. 

           Anna wheels Howard out of the kitchen. The door to the 
           bedroom slams shut. 

           INT. HOWARD MARSHALL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Howard lays on a mechanical bed. Anna takes two towels and 
           ties his wrists up to the bannister. 

           Anna stands naked across from Howard who’s tied up——ready to 
           ravish him. Sensing his vulnerability, she knows what to do. 

                                 ANNA
                        You’re so sexy. 

           Howard reads her sincerity with relief and excitement. Anna 
           crawls up to his waist and mounts him. 

           Slow and steady. She enjoys what it does to him. Howard let’s 
           a tear roll down his face.

           OUTSIDE BEDROOM

           Orson listens to the methodical bed CREAKING slowly.

           INT. BURBANK - STUDIO STAGE - HUDSUCKER PROXY SET - DAY

           It’s a barber shop set from the 1940s. Amidst the bustle of 
           the big studio production, Anna stands just outside the stage 
           doors in a corridor on the phone.   

                                 ANNA
                        What do you mean it’s not there? 
                             (listening)
                        He always sends me my monthly “pin 
                        money.” 

           Anna, distraught, looks at the set full of extras and crew. 
           INT. HOWARD MARSHALL - LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN - DAY 

           Anna storms into the house and enters the kitchen. Pierce 
           cuts her path off. 

                                 PIERCE
                        He’s resting. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’ll wait. 

                                 PIERCE
                        See you’ve got yourself a new ring?

                                 ANNA
                        What do you want from me Pierce?

                                 PIERCE
                        I wanna know how you sleep at 
                        night?

                                 ANNA
                        Like a baby. 

                                 PIERCE 
                        Maybe it’s all those pills you’ve 
                        been gobbling. I don’t blame you 
                        though. If I were living a godless 
                        life I might want to fill that void 
                        too.

                                 ANNA
                        You don’t know anything about me.  

                                 PIERCE
                        You have your hooks in him, I’ll 
                        give you that. And you may even 
                        hoodwink him into marrying you. 
                        Hell, we both know, he’d marry a 
                        blow up doll long as it was big and 
                        soft.

                                 PIERCE
                        No matter what he tells you, you 
                        won’t see a dime. Our wealth stays 
                        in our family.

                                 ANNA
                        I am family. 

                                 PIERCE
                        You’re a slut.
                                 ANNA
                        He respects me more than you, and 
                        you can’t stand it.

           Check mate. Pierce tucks away his rage with a searing LAUGH. 

           EXT. HOUSTON - WHITE DOVE CHAPEL - DAY

           A Nissan pick-up truck squeals up and parks outside the small 
           white roadside chapel——a Texas institution.

           Elaine and Ray, in exhausted t-shirts and tired jeans, jog up 
           to the front door with breathless energy.

           The proprietor, PAT WALKER, (50s) a good ol’gal with a 
           beehive, opens the door.  

           The place is pre-decorated in that kitschy way.

                                 ELAINE
                        We wanna book a weddin’ for 
                        tomorrow. 

           Pat eyes the two of them.  

                                 PAT
                        What’s the hurry?

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s gotta be today, bride’s 
                        orders. 

                                 PAT
                        Well, wait a minute. I’m busier 
                        than a one-eyed dog in a smokehouse 
                        right now, booked up through 
                        summer.

                                 ELAINE
                        Money’s no object.

                                 RAY
                        This is the place where y’all 
                        release the live doves, right?

           Off Pat Walker’s questioning glance, trying to keep up. 

                                 TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LATER
           INT. WHITE DOVE CHAPEL  - DAY

           The big day. Inside the staff prepares the chapel with all 
           the finest——tiered cake, flowers, you name it. Pat oversees 
           the activities.

                                 PAT
                        Not petals. Buds.  

           Referring to the use of full rosebuds to line the aisles. The 
           staff makes the adjustment. Pat makes her way to the...

           BRIDE’S GREEN ROOM

           Pat arrives amidst the hub-bub as Elaine helps Anna into a 
           puffy-sleeved extremely low cut gown. 

           Anna notices Pat’s presence and goes on the defensive.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m not marrying him for his money. 
                        I have my own.

           Elaine struggles to apply make-up on Anna who continues in a 
           girlish frantic way. 

                                 ANNA
                        He’d been begging me to marry him 
                        for four years.  

           Anna flashes a desperate look at Pat. 

                                 ANNA
                        Just please don’t call the 
                        reporters.

                                 PAT
                        Well, who are you? 

           Holding a thick false eye-lash, Anna pauses in disbelief. 

                                 ANNA
                        Well...
                             (fluttering her eyelashes)
                        I’m Anna Nicole Smith. 

           WHITE DOVE CHAPEL

           Killing time, Daniel, in a miniature tux, tosses a satin 
           pillow holding the wedding ring into the air over and over. 
           His cousin does the same with the groom’s ring pillow.
           Under the white arch in his wheelchair and an all white tux, 
           J. Howard Marshall II, waits, deliriously happy. 

           Letitia and his personal secretary stand by his side. Along 
           with Elaine, Ray, and PIERRE, Anna’s new giant bodyguard.  

           The WEDDING MARCH plays.

           Anna, wearing her gown and veil, walks down the aisle with a 
           bouquet of white roses. Like a goddess from Vegas.  

           When she arrives, Howard and Anna look at each other like 
           joyful teenagers. 

           The minister turns to Howard whose eyes glimmer. 

                                 HOWARD
                        I've done a lot of things. I've 
                        made a lot of money. If I can make 
                        her happy, and I’ve made her happy 
                        today, I’ll die a happy man. 

           He blinks, holding back tears. Anna kisses him. 

           Immediately after, “ANGEL OF THE MORNING,” plays from the 
           loud speakers. Everyone CLAPS and CHEERS. 

           The SONG continues as... 

           Anna and Howard release two white doves outside the chapel.

           Anna, sitting on Howard’s lap, feeds him cut cake. 

           Daniel dances with Anna and Howard. More like a sway, all 
           holding each other close. 

           The SONG ends. 

           OUTSIDE WHITE DOVE CHAPEL

           Anna steps out in a brunette pageboy wig and a yellow suit. 
           Her wedding party follows behind. She’s got an international 
           flight to catch.

           She approaches Howard and kneels down to his level. 

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t CRWWWWWY! 

           Anna kisses his head.
                                 ANNA
                        Yew knew about my shoot. I’m 
                        contracted to be in Sweden 
                        tomorrow. 

           Howard squeezes her hand, pained to see her go. 

                                 ANNA
                        Yew know it’s yew that I love. 

           Anna kisses him all over his face before she gets in a limo.

           EXT. MARSHALL ESTATE - PRIVATE LAKE - DAY

           On the edge of the lake bed, Letitia stands next to Howard in 
           his chair. Howard flings his fishing rod, casting his line 
           impressively far. 

           He reels it in, stuttering for best effect. 

           In the background, Pierce tromps through the thick grass 
           trying not to scuff up his fancy shoes.   

           He arrives next to Howard, who casts his line again.

                                 PIERCE
                        Oughta get your land under control. 

                                 HOWARD
                        I like it rough. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Where’s your bride?

                                 HOWARD
                        Out of town. 

                                 PIERCE
                        She’s been out of town a lot. 

           Howard’s used to this game, almost enjoys the sparing. 

                                 HOWARD
                        What are you saying now?

           Pierce motions for Letitia to leave. She does.

                                 PIERCE
                        The question of loyalty comes to 
                        mind.   

                                 HOWARD
                        You’ve always been a jealous type. 
                                 PIERCE
                        She’s not faithful.

                                 HOWARD
                        Others may come and go, but she 
                        needs me and I need her. She’s my 
                        golden girl.

                                 PIERCE
                        That’s beautiful. But hear me out. 
                        You’ve been humiliated once. Lady 
                        Jewel’s affair hit us blindly after 
                        her will was read. 

                                 HOWARD
                        And that dadgum leach she let into 
                        her home didn’t get a dime. I got 
                        all the assets back.  

                                 PIERCE
                        In court. That’s why we should take 
                        precautions now, ahead of time. Why 
                        take any chances? 

                                 HOWARD
                        You wouldn’t have a pot to piss in 
                        without the chances I took in life. 

                                 PIERCE
                             (testy)
                        You can’t even listen to my 
                        proposal?     

           Howard lobs his line back in once more. 

                                 PIERCE
                        We put everything into the living 
                        trust. Name me as executor. Your 
                        wife would be taken care of, just 
                        not in writing. Consider what 
                        protections that allows in the 
                        worst case scenario, while still 
                        providing everything you desire. 
                        You keep your leverage too. 

           Howard’s line yanks, he’s caught something. He reels it in. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Think you snagged one of the 
                        trouts. 

           Howard pulls the fish out of the water and slaps it on the 
           grass where it flaps and gasps for air.

           EXT. MOVIE PREMIERE RED CARPET - DAY

           The exciting BUZZ of the carpet. Anna ambles down the press 
           line, waving and posing for the cameras and a screaming crowd 
           in the rafters. A long haired bodyguard on her arm. 

           Finally, she saunters over to an entertainment news crew. The 
           REPORTER holds a microphone up to Anna.

                                 REPORTER
                        Anna, come talk to us! I’ve just 
                        got to ask you a couple questions. 

           Anna comes in hot with boozy adrenaline. Mic in her face.

                             (slurring)

                        love yew. I just wanted to say

           Anna looks for the right answer.

                        He’ll probably stay up and watch

                        not great, what do you say? 

           Anna slurs her words——her eyes are barely open.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s been a wild ride and -- what

                        hate me. 

           Anna pulls away, winks dopily at the camera, nearly trips 
           over her own dress and waddles away. 

           Anna turns back, blows a kiss to the cameras, gives the 
           finger, mimics shoving it up their ass, and is swiftly 
           whisked away by a publicist.

                                 AGENT (O.S.)
                        Just get back to your diet and keep 
                        your head down. 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s like why even try when people 
                        are just gonna talk shit and make 
                        lies anyway.   

                                 AGENT (O.S.)
                        People need to see the real you. 
                        You can’t hide in Texas if you want 
                        Hollywood to keep calling.  

                                 ANNA
                        I gotta go pick up my 
                        prescriptions.

           She hangs up the phone and pulls up to a pharmacy drive-
           through. The Pharmacist appears at the window. 

                                 ANNA
                        For Vickie-Lynn Marshall. Can you 
                        order ice cream from the window?  

           INT. ANNA’S SECOND HOUSTON HOUSE - DAY

           Anna passes out with a tub of ice cream in her bed. Alone. 

           Daniel, in pajamas, peaks in. He shuts off the television and 
           gets in bed, cuddling up next to her.
           INT. LAW OFFICES OF DIANA MILLER - DAY

           A New York Magazine drops with a THUD on a desk. The title 
           reads: WHITE TRASH NATION. A cover photo of Anna-Nicole in 
           jean shorts, cowboy boots, and a bag of cheese puffs. 

           Anna sits across from, DIANA MILLER, (50s) with a sympathetic 
           nature. No more playing softball. Anna means business. 

                                 ANNA
                        I woulda never have agreed to do a 
                        shoot called “White Trash Nation.” 

                                 DIANA
                        Then we sue for breach of contract. 
                        Possibly defamation. 

                                 ANNA
                        Also, I’m dealing with another 
                        thing. I know that Pierce has been 
                        manipulating my husband. I know it 
                        because Howard told Pierce to start 
                        a trust for me but he hasn’t. He’s 
                        lying to my husband. And you want 
                        to know something else? He’s having 
                        me followed. Even on the way here.

                                 DIANA
                        If it’s like you say then Pierce is 
                        acting in bad faith. And, we’d have 
                        a case.

                                 ANNA
                        He wants to cut me out. 

                                 DIANA
                        Is there a way to find out if 
                        Howard’s put you in his will? 

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t bother Howard with that 
                        right now. He needs to feel loved. 

                                 DIANA
                        There’s other ways. It would help 
                        if you had something on tape.
                                        MARCH 2001

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY FAMILY COURT ROOM - DAY

           On the witness stand, Anna, in another colorful ensemble, 
           behaves loopy. She touches her cheek with an acrylic nail, 
           trying to focus. 

           Rusty Hardin stands by a diagram on an easel with a timeline. 

           The room listens to a tape being played. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Paw-Paw now tell everybody back 
                        home what you’re leaving for your 
                        wife? 

           Through the machine, the loud SPLASH is heard. Pierce stops 
           the tape. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Is that you telling him what to 
                        say? 

                                 ANNA
                        Yes, sir.

                                 PIERCE
                        You’re talking and telling him to 
                        say something into the recorder in 
                        regards to leaving you half of his 
                        estate and isn’t it true that 
                        sometimes you would record him with 
                        your top off? Is that true?

           Always game, Anna smirks innocently. Her effect is endearing.  

                                 ANNA
                        Oh Rusty, you’re a pervert. 

           Hard to tell whose the better actor.  

                                 RUSTY
                        Pardon me?

                                 ANNA
                        That’s not true. I think you’re 
                        sick.

           Anna sits back with a smirk. 
                                 ANNA
                        I wish there was a tape. ‘Cause I 
                        wouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t even 
                        be here in the first place. 

           Rusty continues in a more bull dog manner.

                                 RUSTY
                        Ms. Marshall, for the record, isn’t 
                        it the truth that not one single 
                        living person can confirm that your 
                        husband J. Howard Marshall promised 
                        you half of his estate? 

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t know. 

                                 RUSTY
                        It’s yes or no. 

                                 ANNA
                        Well, I’m sorry, I really can’t 
                        answer that one Rusty, I told you --

                                 RUSTY
                             (talking over her)
                        Your honor can I ask the jury to be 
                        removed while I ask for a motion 
                        for contempt. 

                           JUDGE
                                                          ANNA
                                              How am I con-tempting myself?
           Answer the question yes or 
           no.

                                 RUSTY
                        There isn’t one single person who 
                        can confirm that your husband ever 
                        promised you half of his estate, 
                        correct? I need you to answer for 
                        the record. 

                                 ANNA
                        Maybe someone in a restaurant 
                        overheard us and there’s paperwork 
                        in California that could --

                                 RUSTY
                             (screaming over her)
                        Ms. Marshall!! As of right now, you 
                        cannot name one single human 
                        person, can you?
                                 ANNA
                        Well... no. 

                                 RUSTY
                        And isn’t it true you cannot 
                        provide any documents as evidence 
                        that your husband wished you to 
                        have half of his estate?

                                 ANNA
                        No. But that’s because Pierce has 
                        records shredded and manipulated--

                                 RUSTY
                             (interrupting/agitated)
                        Ms. Marshall what evidence can we 
                        look at that Pierce Marshall had 
                        anything to do with these supposed 
                        incidents? None. Because isn’t it 
                        the truth that all of this, 
                        everything you said, relies solely 
                        on the question of whether or not 
                        you’re a truth teller? Is that 
                        correct? 

                                 ANNA
                        Well, I guess to the best of it, 
                        yeah.

           Anna sits back in her seat, defeated and exasperated. Rusty 
           makes eyes with the Jury——they’re not on her side.

           INT. RANCH HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Elaine frantically packs luggage, coming in and out of the 
           bathroom. Anna pulls unrealistic outfit options out of the 
           closet and tosses them on the bed. We catch them mid-convo.

                                 ANNA
                        -- And he’s been putting things in 
                        Howard’s head that aren’t true.

                                 ELAINE
                        You better get what you deserve. 

                                 ANNA
                        I really don’t want to do it but--
                        Pierce is a snake.
                                 ELAINE
                        Fuck Pierce. He’s fucking with the 
                        wrong bitch. 

           Ray walks in carrying a Circuit City shopping bag. 

                                 RAY
                        Bali here we come. 

           EXT. BALI FOUR SEASONS RESORT - PRIVATE POOL - DAY 

           Anna lowers a magazine. She’s laying by a pool in a pink swim 
           suit, her hair being braided. She’s sips a tropical drink.

                                 ANNA
                        Howaaarrd?

           Anna conspiratorially loud-whispers at Elaine. 

                                 ANNA
                        Get the camera out!

           Beyond a large tropical hedge, a HIRED MAN snoops on Anna, 
           craning to get a view.

           In his electric wheelchair, Howard arrives to the jacuzzi. 

           WE ARE NOW CAUGHT UP TO THE OPENING TEASER.

           When Anna looks up at Howard, he smiles with giddiness. 

           Anna and Ray delicately help Howard slip into the water.  

           Already in the Jacuzzi, Elaine points the camera at Anna.

                                 ANNA
                        I got Howard to swim. No one’s ever 
                        let him swim back at home.

                                 HOWARD
                        She’s my lady love.

           Anna strips her bikini top and tosses it aside. It hits the 
           camera lens, blocking the view. 

           BLACK OUT.

           A RINGING phone.
           INT. RANCH HOUSE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Middle of the night. Dark and quiet except for the RINGS. 
           Virgie picks it up. Barely awake.

                                 VIRGIE
                        Vickie-Lynn? I can hardly hear you.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        I want to talk to my son. 

           INTER CUT AS NEEDED:

           Anna lays in the sun, holding a portable phone. Beads from 
           her braids dangle.

                                 VIRGIE
                        He’s sleeping. 

                                 ANNA
                        Wake him up. 

           Virgie brings the phone and cord with her. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        The pig went missing. 

           DANIEL’S BEDROOM 

           It’s dark except for the night light. Virgie taps a sleeping 
           Daniel. Daniel wipes his eyes and holds the phone delicately. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I hope Rascal comes back home. 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        We’ll find him. I promise.

                                 DANIEL
                        Okay. When are you coming home? 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Soon. Your Paw-Paw isn’t feeling 
                        well. Send him prayers, okay? 

           Daniel kisses the receiver.

           INT. OFFICES OF RUSTY HARDIN ESQ. - DAY 

           Pierce paces as Rusty Hardin and his team of junior lawyers 
           look through papers. Pierce is nervous.
                                 PIERCE
                        I’ve got someone out in Bali 
                        reporting to me that she’s been 
                        trying to get footage. This has 
                        turned into a Goddamn soap opera! I 
                        thought we were safe, you said it 
                        was irrefutable?!!
                             (calming)
                        Let’s say there is a tape——then 
                        what? 

                                 RUSTY
                        Well, she could make a case to a 
                        jury. And there’s two ways that 
                        could go. The better of the two is 
                        she’d only be able to make a claim 
                        on half of what was earned during 
                        their marriage. The worse is half 
                        of the whole shebang.  

           Pierce looks out the window——thinking. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Tell me something, not to sound 
                        grim, but he’s nearing the end, 
                        correct?

                                 PIERCE
                        It’s not looking good. Weeks or 
                        months. Maybe a year——God willing. 

                                 RUSTY
                        There’s a way you can keep her away 
                        from him until he passes. It 
                        wouldn’t be absolutely full proof, 
                        but it would be fool-proof. 

                                 PIERCE
                        I’m listening. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Acquiring legal guardianship for 
                        someone in his condition would not 
                        be terribly hard at this stage. Can 
                        you think of any evidence we could 
                        present to a judge?  

                                 PIERCE
                        Their whole goddamn relationship is 
                        evidence. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Something that could have put his 
                        health at risk perhaps?
           Rusty SIGHS. Pierce remembers something. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Pneumonia.  

                                 RUSTY
                        What?

                                 PIERCE
                        She left him unattended in the 
                        rain. He had to be hospitalized for 
                        Pneumonia. Damn near killed him.

           Off Rusty’s nod. That’ll do it.

           EXT. MARSHALL ESTATE - DAY

           Two armed guards stand by the front door. Anna walks up.

                                 GUARD
                        I’m sorry ma’am. Visiting hours are 
                        over. 

                                 ANNA
                        But they’re only giving me thirty 
                        minutes every day. 

           Anna tries to knock on the door, they restrain her.

                                 ANNA
                        Howard they’re lying to you! I’ve 
                        been trying to see you.

           EXT. SIDE PASSAGEWAY - MARSHALL ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Anna tip-toes up to the house and taps on the french doors by 
           Howard’s new make-shift hospice room. 

           A large T.V. plays the stock market news in the background. 

           Letitia approaches the window. They speak in a loud whisper.

                                 LETITIA
                        You can’t be here. 

                                 ANNA
                        He needs me. I’m his wife.  

                                 LETITIA
                        Pierce is his legal guardian. I 
                        can’t go against his orders. 
                                 ANNA
                        I just want to hold him and touch 
                        him and let him know how much I 
                        care.

           Letitia looks at a dozing Howard. She turns back to Anna.

                                 LETITIA
                        I’ve seen how he lights up with 
                        you. Just be quiet.

           Letitia opens the window and helps her in.

           INSIDE HOWARD’S ROOM

           Anna approaches Howard. Waking, he warms at the sight of her. 

           Letitia sits vigil nearby. Anna stares at Letitia. 

                                 ANNA
                        Can we have some privacy please?

                                 LETITIA
                        I’m not supposed to leave him 
                        alone.

           Anna unbuttons her top and removes her bra. 

                                 ANNA
                        Stay if you want. 

           Anna HUMS a tune as she shakes her cleavage for Howard. 

                                 LETITIA
                        I’ll be right outside if you need 
                        me, Mr. Marshall.  

           Letitia steps outside. 

                                 ANNA
                        They have you all caged up like a 
                        prisoner. 

                                 HOWARD
                        You weren’t around. 

           Howard’s breathing is forced.

                                 ANNA
                        I hate that Pierce is just waiting 
                        for you to die. I’m getting you out 
                        of here. 
                                 HOWARD
                        The bathroom has doors to the 
                        garden.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Howard, in his wheelchair, holds a bottle of wine. Anna opens 
           the doors. She pushes Howard out.

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           Anna wheels Howard across the garden to a shed. 

           AFTER A FEW MOMENTS -- the two emerge on a four wheeler with 
           Anna at the helm and Howard’s arms wrapped around her body.

           She holds the handle bar with one hand, her cocktail in the 
           other. Mischievous grins on both their faces.

           Letitia runs out the bathroom doors. She stops and watches 
           Anna and Howard speed away. Letitia runs into the house. 

           ON THE FOUR-WHEELER

           They’re going so fast Howard’s eyes water. Anna turns back to 
           check on him. 

                                 HOWARD
                        Keep going!

           INT. PIERCE MARSHALL - BEDROOM - DAY

           Pierce has a phone to his ear. He listens calmly. 

           ON THE FOUR-WHEELER

           Flat Texas Plains spread out endlessly. Anna pulls over and 
           turns off the engine.  

           IN A FIELD OF WILD FLOWERS

           Anna runs in circles around Howard on the four-wheeler. 

           JUST THEN -- Anna sees a movement in the grass. It’s a pot-
           bellied pig. Anna steps off and sneaks up to the pig.
                                 ANNA
                        Maybe Daniel won’t know the 
                        difference.

           The pig munches on mud. Anna tries to grab it. The pig emits 
           a blood curdling SQUEAL, escaping in a sprint. 

           The pig runs for what feels like miles. Anna plops in the 
           grass and watches it go.

           INT. MARSHALL ESTATE - DAY

           Anna carries Howard on piggyback through the french doors 
           into the bathroom. Letitia rolls the wheel chair in with a 
           stern look. Howard flashes a wicked smile. 

           LATER - NIGHT

           The lights are out. Howard, Anna, and Daniel lay asleep 
           snuggled up together in his bed. 

           Daniel’s head resting on her shoulder. Letitia snoozes in her 
           chair nearby. 

                                     SIX MONTHS LATER

           INT. MARSHALL’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Howard Marshall is attached to machines. He starts to gag. 

           The monitors BEEP. He’s choking. 

           Letitia rushes in with another nurse. They perform CPR. It’s 
           unsuccessful. Pierce steps in and watches. 

                                 PIERCE
                        That’s enough. 

           The work stops. The monitors flat line. 

           INT. NEW YORK CITY - SOUND STAGE - NIGHT

           Anna, backstage at a late night show, receives the news from 
           her body guard and instantly turns into a sobbing mess. She’s 
           physically in pain. Someone hands her pills. 

           EXT. FUNERAL HOUSE - HOUSTON - DAY

           Anna steps out holding an urn. 
           INT. CAR - DAY

           Anna hands Daniel the urn. 

                                 ANNA
                        That’s your Paw-Paw. Half of him at 
                        least. Pierce has his other half. 

           INT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Holding the urn, Daniel and Anna step into the pitch black 
           house. Anna flicks a light on. Nothing. She tries another 
           one. Same thing.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why is it so dark?

           Anna grabs the phone, no dial tone. 

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           Anna holds the phone to her ear. Daniel waits in the car.

                                 ANNA
                        He won’t even give me widow’s 
                        allowance. How am I supposed to--
                             (listens)
                        Fine then. You can tell Pierce I’ll 
                        be seeing him in court. 

           Anna slams the phone down. Ironically, across the street, 
           Rick’s neon kicking cowboy boot flashes through the dark. 

           In the car, Daniel has his face pressed against the window.

           INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A long rectangular table. Lawyers and staff on each side. 

           Pierce sits on one side with the complete confidence of a man 
           who knows he has the best team money can buy. 

           Anna sits across from him next to Diana. They wait. It’s 
           about as tense as it gets.

                                 DIANA
                        My client believes Pierce 
                        manipulated his father. 

                                 ANNA
                        Howard promised me an inheritance.  
                                 DIANA
                        My client is alleging that Pierce, 
                        resentful that his very aged father 
                        would give that kind of money to a 
                        woman barely more than a quarter 
                        his age, took steps to prevent the 
                        promise from being fulfilled. And 
                        the steps he took, my client 
                        alleges, were fraudulent and 
                        perhaps criminal. 

                                 ANNA
                        He forced Howard to convert the 
                        trust to an irrevocable one without 
                        his knowledge. 

                                 DIANA
                        Which deprived the recently 
                        deceased of the ability to amend it 
                        to add her as a beneficiary, 
                        terminate it to free up the assets 
                        and make her a lifetime gift, or 
                        make a bequest to her of the amount 
                        promised. 

                                 PIERCE 
                        She could’ve settled for generous 
                        gifts and a house.
                             (directly at Anna)
                        But you got greedy. Didn’t you. The 
                        will is clear on who it doesn’t 
                        include. You should let this go now 
                        before it gets ugly.  

                                 DIANA
                        I’m sorry but whose calling who 
                        greedy? 

                                 ANNA
                        If I let this go then I’d be 
                        admitting that the promise was a 
                        lie, when I know that’s not the 
                        truth. 

           Howard’s estranged eldest, J. HOWARD MARSHALL III, strides in 
           with a casual confidence, the spitting image of his father. 

                                 PIERCE
                        I should have known you’d want to 
                        get your grubby hands in on this.
                                 HOWARD III
                        You really have forgotten the 
                        meaning of family haven’t you 
                        little brother. 

           Howard III sits at the far end of the table——Anna’s team. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Drop the case. 

                                 HOWARD III 
                        So then everything, all of it, goes 
                        to you? Is that justice?

                                 PIERCE
                        This is a waste of time and you 
                        know it. Sad how bitter you still 
                        are because dad disowned you.

                                 HOWARD III
                        What’s sad is how much you don’t 
                        understand. Mrs. Marshall and I 
                        aren‘t playing the same game as 
                        you. 

           Pierce motions for his lawyers to pack it up. Then he struts 
           off. Anna feels vindicated to have Howard III on her side.  

           EXT. LAW OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Pierce walks out holding hands with Eleanor. A few PAPS snap 
           his photo. Not a big crowd but growing. 

                                 PAPS
                        Was Anna named in the will?

                                 PEIRCE
                        I have nothing to say. 

           They reach their car. Pierce gets in the front seat.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        Hold on a minute, I left my coat 
                        inside. 

           She jogs off, leaving Pierce alone. The paparazzi retreat 
           back to the front door out of sight.
           INT. PIERCE’S CAR - DAY 

           Pierce’s eyes tear up. He removes his glasses. Wipes the 
           tears with annoyance. Clears his throat. And generally tries 
           to prevent himself from letting the waterworks flow.  

           Eleanor opens the door. Pierce starts the car. She notices 
           his emotional state and turns to him. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Pierce?

           Pierce, unable to hide his sobs, let’s his body shake. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        You’re doing the right thing. You 
                        were his protector in life and 
                        you’re his protector now. 

                                 PIERCE
                             (breaking up)
                        I--I guess I just miss him.  

           She looks at him. Now just a son who lost his dad.  

           Pierce let’s out a GRUNT. Clears his throat, putting an 
           abrupt end to it. They drive off.

                                        MARCH 2001

           INT. ANNA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Anna, bloated and groggy, wallows in bed. Diana steps in and 
           opens the curtains. 

                                 DIANA
                        I’ve been trying to get in touch 
                        all morning.

                                 ANNA
                        What time is it?

                                  DIANA
                        We have to be in court in an hour. 

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t want to go. Everyone hates 
                        me anyway. 

                                 DIANA
                        If there’s one thing you’ve showed 
                        me it’s that you refused to settle.

                                 DIANA (CONT'D)
                        So don’t sit there and tell me 
                        you’ve come this far to give up. 
                        Get up! 

           Anna emits a LAUGH of gratitude. She sits up, a little more 
           fight in her eye than before.

                                 DIANA
                        Are you going to let Pierce 
                        Marshall take away your legitimate 
                        rights as Howard’s wife and hoard 
                        the money for himself? You’re just 
                        as deserving of a piece of the pie 
                        as him. You earned that right under 
                        the law.    

           This revs Anna up. Just thinking about Pierce pisses her off. 

                                 DIANA
                        Pierce just can’t stand the thought 
                        of having to share some of daddy’s 
                        wealth with a -- 

                                 ANNA
                        -- a hussy?!

           She flashes a naughty wink. The pep talk seems to have 
           worked. 

                                 DIANA
                        I’d like to bring in a few more 
                        character witnesses. We could 
                        really use Virgie. I know you said 
                        it’s tricky with her, but I think 
                        it would help.  

           Anna goes quiet. 

                                 DIANA
                        Offer her some form of the 
                        settlement if it comes to that. 

                                 ANNA
                        She’s prideful. But I’ll try.

           From outside, a housekeeper SHRIEKS.

                                 HOUSEKEEPER (O.S.)
                        Ay, Dios Mío!

           A thirteen-year-old Daniel, steps in with a mischievous grin. 

                                 DANIEL
                        The hamster got loose again. 
           Daniel notices Anna. 

                                 DANIEL
                        You okay mom?

           Anna throws the covers off. Naked except for her panties.  

                                 ANNA
                        I’m ready to go kick some butt!

           EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY

           A black car pulls up. Anna, in a wig, steps out. Virgie steps 
           out after her. 

                                 VIRGIE
                             (re: the wig)
                        Was this really necessary?

                                 ANNA
                        They’re everywhere.

                                 VIRGIE
                        I don’t know why I agreed to this.

           They step in the salon.

           INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

           Anna and Virgie sit in spa chairs having their nails and hair 
           done by stylists. 

                                 ANNA
                        Give my mother the full treatment. 
                        I want her to come out like a 
                        beauty queen.  

                                 VIRGIE
                        I was a beauty queen once. 

                                 ANNA
                        That was high school.

           They sit and stylists go to work on their hair. Virgie turns 
           to her daughter.

                                 VIRGIE
                        What is it you want from me? 

                                 ANNA
                        Can’t I treat you to a beauty day? 
                                 VIRGIE
                        Don’t bullshit a bullshitter.

                                 ANNA
                        Okay. All you have to do is go up 
                        and confirm a few things and make 
                        me look good. Say a couple nice 
                        things about me. 

           Virgie takes this in. 

                                 ANNA
                        Is it really that hard to say 
                        something nice about me?

                                 VIRGIE
                        Why don’t you ask Donald?

                                 ANNA
                        ‘Cause he’d probably hump the 
                        witness stand. 

           Anna mimics humping. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        I warned you about that. But you 
                        never did listen to anybody but 
                        yourself. 

                                 ANNA
                        And you never believed in me. At 
                        least Howard did...

           Anna slumps down, looking away with longing. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        Guess that’s why he didn’t leave 
                        you a cent? 

                                 ANNA
                        I bet you’re happy. 

           Anna stands in a rage, ripping the curlers out but creating a 
           giant tangle with her impatience. On the brink of tears. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        Slow down. You gotta be gentle.

           Virgie stands and helps untangle her rat’s nest. Anna let’s 
           her help, removing one curler at a time. 

                                 VIRGIE
                        It’s like cotton candy from all 
                        that bleach. 
                                  FINAL DAY OF TESTIMONY

           INT. HARRIS COUNTY FAMILY COURT - DAY

           On the witness stand, Anna fidgets with a crumpled piece of 
           tissue. Pierce Marshall and Eleanor sit stoically. 

           Rusty Hardin, mid-interrogation, stalks in front of the jury. 

                                 RUSTY
                        What is it you’re saying Pierce 
                        Marshall did now? Did he order 
                        people to let his father choke? 

                                 ANNA
                        No. He ordered for him to not be 
                        suctioned. I know because I talked 
                        to the nurses. That is the same 
                        thing as ordering him to choke to 
                        death on his own vile. 

                                 RUSTY
                        You just go up here and start 
                        making things up now? Where were 
                        you last week? Last month? Did you 
                        fly to California? How can we 
                        believe anything you say?

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t know. 

                                 RUSTY
                        When did you go to California? 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m not good with dates. 

           Visibly shaken, Anna grips her little tissue and dabs her 
           eyes. Rusty moves in. Incredulous. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Ms. Marshall, have you been taking 
                        acting lessons?

           Backed into a corner, she breaks.

                                 ANNA
                             (tearfully)
                        Screw you Rusty! 
                                 RUSTY
                        Answer the question. 

                                 ANNA
                        No. I haven’t. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Mrs. Marshall what is that written 
                        across your dress?

           Anna looks down at her pink velour two piece——the word 
           “spoiled” embroidered in cursive across her chest. 

                                 ANNA
                        Spoiled. 

           Rusty looks at the jury with a knowing smirk.

                                 RUSTY
                        I pass the witness.

           EXT. HARRIS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY 

           A sea of people empty out as Pierce Marshall and his wife 
           descend the steps. Reporters and cameras hound him. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Mr. Marshall, do you really think 
                        your step-mother deserves nothing?

           He waves them off as they pass. 

                                 PIERCE
                        I have nothing to say. 

           Pierce and his entourage disappear into a waiting car. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Rusty Hardin emerges. Reporters stick microphones towards 
           him. Rusty stops. The press gather. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Now. What we saw on the witness 
                        stand over the last six days is a 
                        very self absorbed selfish person 
                        who only cared about herself and 
                        taking his money. A long con, if 
                        you will. What this is really about 
                        is just a son trying to fulfill his 
                        father’s wishes.

                        And I think the jury understands 
                        that. We’ll see what they have to 
                        say. 

           Lastly, Anna, led by a large bodyguard, steps out of the 
           courthouse with her team, who wave the reporters away. 

                                 ANNA
                        Wait, I want to say something to 
                        the world. 

           Anna stops. The microphones point at her. She’s mobbed.

                                 ANNA
                        No matter what happens, I’m going 
                        to fight to the end. My husband is 
                        worth it. He wanted me to have it. 
                        People don’t understand--my husband-
                        -he saved my life and I saved his. 
                        He knew me when I was a nobody. And 
                        I went out and made a name for 
                        myself. He just always promised me 
                        that he’d take care of me no matter 
                        what, that’s what he always 
                        promised...

           She sniffles, putting her sunglasses on. As she approaches 
           her town car, Pierce’s car pulls up. 

           Anna looks at Pierce in the window. He turns away. 

           Reporters SHOUT questions as Anna slips into the back seat of 
           a waiting town car.

           INT. TOWN CAR - DAY 

           Anna sits in the back, staring out the window. A little proud 
           of herself. 

                                 ANNA
                        Would you mind making a stop?

           EXT. PRIVATE MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY 

           The town car pulls up to the front entrance as middle school 
           kids flood out at the end of the day. 

           Anna rolls down the tinted window to wave to Daniel, standing 
           with a few of his peers. They all spot her. He stalls. 

                                 PEER KID
                        Hey Daniel, is that --
           He tenses momentarily, but shrugs off his insecurity.

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s my mom. She’s a superstar.

           Daniel races to the car with pride.     

           INT. TOWN CAR - PARKED - DAY

           A thirteen-year-old Daniel hops in next to Anna. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Didn’t know you were picking me up?

                                 ANNA
                        I wanted to see my baby.

           She kisses him all over, he pulls away in a pre-teen kind of 
           way. She tosses his hair around making him blush.

                                 DANIEL
                        What happened in court today?

                                 ANNA
                        I fought for the truth. So even if 
                        we lose, we won.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Moon roof?

           INT. / EXT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           Daniel and Anna stand with their heads sticking out of the 
           moonroof. Wind in their faces. Smiles plastered ear to ear.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           TITLES OVER BLACK

           Anna Nicole Smith spent years fighting Pierce Marshall for a 
           share of her late husband's estate. 

           In 2006, the case reached the Supreme Court. 

           In 2007, Anna died of an accidental drug overdose, six months 
           after the death of her son, Daniel. 

           She was the same age as Marilyn Monroe. 

           The case is still not settled.
