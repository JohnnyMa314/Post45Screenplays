           We hear the JINGLE of a SHOPKEEPER BELL.

           INT. STORIES (BOOKSTORE) - MORNING

           TOM (26), smart, approachable, sits at a REGISTER reading a 
           book of poetry by Keats. He looks up to spot--

           SANDRA (23) enter through the front door. She’s dressed 
           conservatively, wearing glasses and a quick smile. 

           She surveys the BOOKSTORE -- small and cozy.   

                                 TOM
                        Morning.

                                 SANDRA
                        Morning.

           She browses the shelves as Tom watches her discreetly from 
           behind his book. Then: 

                                 TOM
                        Looking for something?

                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah, a hardcover of Finnegans 
                        Wake?

                                 TOM
                        I think I might have one. 

           Tom heads to the back of the narrow store, he runs his 
           fingers along a shelf of books until...

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Here we go.

           He removes a heavy copy of Finnegans Wake and hands it to 
           her. They head back to the register. 

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Some light reading you got there. 

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s actually a gift for my 
                        professor.

                                 TOM
                        You’re a student?
                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah, I’m getting my PHD.

                                 TOM
                        Columbia? NYU? 

                                 SANDRA
                        Columbia.

                                 TOM
                        Nice. What’s your thesis topic?

                                 SANDRA
                        Social resistance in Irish 
                        Literature.

                                 TOM
                        And how’s that going?

                                 SANDRA
                        Slowly. Very slowly. 

                                 TOM
                        Well, I’m impressed. Let me wrap 
                        this up for you. Free of charge. 

           Tom begins to gift wrap the book. Sandra continues to browse.

                                 SANDRA
                        God, I could move in here. It sucks 
                        how all these bookstores are 
                        closing. I blame the internet. 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, that and the fact that nobody 
                        reads anymore.  

                                 SANDRA
                        I know. It’s sad.

                                 TOM
                        That’ll be fifteen even.

           Sandra hands Tom a CREDIT CARD. Tom spots her name: SANDRA 
           MITCHELL. He runs it through the machine. They wait. Then:

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Hey, there’s this great little 
                        Vietnamese restaurant on Mott 
                        street. If you’re not doing 
                        anything later, dinner’s on me. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh, well, um...
                                 TOM
                        Sorry, was that weird? That was a 
                        little weird, wasn’t it?

                                 SANDRA
                        No, it’s just that--

                                 TOM
                        You probably have a boyfriend.

                                 SANDRA
                        I don’t. I’m single. I’m single and 
                        I kinda like being single. 

                                 TOM
                        Oh, sure. I get it.  

           Tom looks down at the credit card machine.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Uh, your card’s not going through.

                                 SANDRA
                        I must have maxed it out again. Let 
                        me see if I have enough cash.

           Sandra rummages through her pocket book.

                                 TOM
                        Tell you what, take the book, you 
                        can come back and pay for it later. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I couldn’t. What if someone else 
                        came in looking for it?

                                 TOM
                        They can always order it online. 
                             (smiles)
                        Go on, take it. I trust you.

                                 SANDRA
                        Thank you. I promise I’ll be back 
                        with the money. 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, whenever.

           Sandra exits the store. Tom moves to the window and watches 
           her walk off. He then turns to a LAPTOP and types in her 
           name: SANDRA MITCHELL.

           He scrolls through FACEBOOK and finds her page: Different 
           pictures of Sandra with friends, updates, forwarded articles. 
           Tom lets himself linger on it for a beat, she is adorable.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                             (mocking himself)
                        Sorry, was that weird? Idiot. 

           Tom shuts the laptop and goes back to his book. 

           EXT. STORIES - NIGHT 

           Tom exits the store, on this quite downtown Manhattan street.

                                 SANDRA (O.S.)
                        Wait! Wait! 

           Tom turns to spot Sandra hurrying towards him.

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        Hi, remember me? I got your money.

                                 TOM
                        Oh, hey, you didn’t have to bring 
                        it back tonight.

                                 SANDRA
                        I didn’t want to leave you hanging. 
                        Here, keep the change. 

           Sandra hands Tom a twenty dollar bill.

                                 TOM
                        Thanks. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Okay. Well, see ya.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. Have a good night. 

           But Sandra doesn’t leave. She just stands there. Tom’s not 
           sure what to do. Sandra laughs, embarrassed. 

                                 SANDRA
                        So, remember this morning when you 
                        asked me to dinner?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to--
                                 SANDRA
                        No, it’s-- I wanted to say yes. I 
                        was actually standing there 
                        thinking how nice would it be if 
                        this guy asked me out, and right as 
                        I thought it, you did and, I don’t 
                        know, I panicked.

                                 TOM
                        You panicked?

                                 SANDRA
                        I panicked. I’m Sandra.

                                 TOM
                        I’m Tom.

           INT. VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Sandra is laughing as Tom recounts a story.

                                 TOM
                        ...What am I getting myself into? A 
                        short story was one thing, but a 
                        novel? I mean, that’s, like, at 
                        least three hundred pages.

                                 SANDRA
                        I know. Sometimes more. 

                                 TOM
                        Exactly, and here they were 
                        offering me, like, real money. I 
                        had to deliver something. 

                                 SANDRA
                        So, what’d you do?

                                 TOM
                        I took the money, had a year long 
                        panic attack and wrote a book that 
                        was... terrible.

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m sure it wasn’t that bad. 

                                 TOM
                        Oh, no, it was awful. It was so bad 
                        they wouldn’t publish it. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m sorry.
                                 TOM
                        It’s okay. At least I got to keep 
                        the advance. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Do you still write?

                                 TOM
                        No. Not really. All that happened 
                        around the time my mom died and I 
                        just kinda gave up.  

                                 SANDRA
                        I lost both my parents when I was a 
                        kid. 

           Tom nods, they share a moment.

                                 TOM
                        Anyway, I started managing the 
                        bookstore and that takes up most of 
                        my time now.

                                 SANDRA
                        It must be nice being surrounded by 
                        books all day.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, it’s great.

                                 SANDRA
                        After my parents passed my brother 
                        and I hopped from one foster family 
                        to the next. At some point we were 
                        living with this couple who had a 
                        great collection of novels. One 
                        night I started reading Jane Eyre 
                        and here was this character who was 
                        sorta going through everything I 
                        was going through...
                             (thoughtful beat)
                        I didn’t want it to end. I finished 
                        it and went straight back to page 
                        one and started reading it all over 
                        again. I’ve loved books ever since. 

           Sandra trails off, wistful. Tom watches her closely.

                                 TOM
                        Jane Eyre, huh?

                                 SANDRA
                        Jane Eyre.
                                 TOM
                        Can I show you something?

           INT. STORIES - NIGHT 

           Tom and Sandra enter, Tom flicks on a light, motions for her 
           to follow him to a LOCKED GLASS DISPLAY CASE. 

           Tom takes out a small KEY, opens it and delicately removes A 
           COPY OF JANE EYRE. He carefully hands it to Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh my God, is this a first edition?

                                 TOM
                        Yup. And here’s the best part.

           Tom opens the book, delicately. Sandra looks down. Reveal 
           that the book has been SIGNED BY CHARLOTTE BRONTE.

                                 SANDRA
                        Is this real?

                                 TOM
                        This is real.

           Sandra puts the book down on the counter and gazes up at him. 

                                 SANDRA
                        How can I be sure?

           Tom leans in close and kisses her and she kisses him back.

           EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

           Tom waits outside a building as a GROUP OF STUDENTS spill 
           out. Sandra among them, she meets up with Tom.  

                                 SANDRA
                        Sorry, my class ran late. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Tom and Sandra walk along a trail. It’s autumn and 
           picturesque as the leaves are changing colors.

                                 SANDRA
                        ...these professors are so 
                        obnoxious.

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        This guy today actually used the 
                        phrase “the vaginization of German 
                        literature.” I’m pretty sure 
                        vaginization isn’t even a real 
                        word.

                                 TOM
                        What do you want to eat tonight?

                                 SANDRA
                        That’s hilarious, I say 
                        vaginization and you start thinking 
                        about food. What Freud would say? 

                                 TOM
                        Freud would say we should go 
                        someplace nice for dinner.

                                 SANDRA
                        Like, how nice?

                                 TOM
                        Nice, like, we’ve been seeing each 
                        other for a week and a half and so 
                        far so good, nice.  

                                 SANDRA
                        I know the perfect place. 

           INT. SANDRA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sandra delivers a large feast, as Tom sits at a table.

                                 SANDRA
                        We’ve got ravioli with homemade 
                        pesto, fried zucchini, salad. And 
                        dessert is in the oven.

                                 TOM
                        Where did you learn to cook?

                                 SANDRA
                        I spent my junior year in Florence.

           The following dialogue in italics will be spoken in Italian.

                                 TOM
                        Do you speak Italian?

                                 SANDRA
                        I used to speak it well, now it’s a 
                        bit rusty, unfortunately.
                                 TOM
                        Did you like Italy?

                                 SANDRA
                        I have great memories. But, I had 
                        this boyfriend who was a real jerk.

                                 TOM
                        Where is he? I’ll kill him!

           Sandra smiles and returns to English:

                                 SANDRA
                        How about you? Where did you learn 
                        to speak Italian?

                                 TOM
                        My mom was from Italy and I also 
                        watch a lot of Fellini movies. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I love Fellini.

                                 TOM
                        Most people think that 8 & 1/2 is 
                        his best film, but I’ll stand by La 
                        Strada as being his most perfect.

                                 SANDRA
                        The end is so moving. 

                                 TOM
                        Oh, man, it’s heart breaking. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Have you ever had your heart 
                        broken, Tom?

                                 TOM
                        Once or twice. How about you?

                                 SANDRA
                        No, I mean, there was the jerk in 
                        Italy, and after him, I was sort 
                        of... Turned off to guys for while.

                                 TOM
                        You still turned off?

                                 SANDRA
                        Depends on the guy.

           She smiles at him. 
           INT. SANDRA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tom and Sandra are furiously making out in her bed. Sandra 
           stops for a moment, takes a breath, then:

                                 SANDRA
                        I need you to know that, there’s no 
                        one else, okay? 

           Tom realizes that Sandra has suddenly turned serious. 

                                 TOM
                        Okay. Yeah, me neither... 

                                 SANDRA
                             (relieved)
                        Okay. Good. Great. Great. 

           Sandra kisses him and they fall onto the bed and make love. 

           INT. SANDRA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Tom sleeps in Sandra’s bed. He stirs awake when HE HEARS THE 
           SOUND OF VOICES. He notices Sandra isn’t in bed with him.

           Tom gets up and moves to the doorway, peeks into the living 
           room. Sandra talks to SOMEONE OBSCURED at her front door. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Go away. I can’t help you. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Come on, don’t say that, you 
                        haven’t even heard what I need--

                                 SANDRA
                        I don’t care, I want you to leave.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sandra, please!

           Tom quietly steps further into the living room, watching.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Don’t turn your back on me! You’re 
                        all I have in this world!

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m sorry, Jason... I’m sorry.

           Sandra shuts the door, and he begins pounding on it.  
                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sandra! Sandra! Open the door! 
                        Please don’t do this me, I need 
                        your help! Please! Please!

           More pounding. Sandra now in tears. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Go away! Just go!

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        You fucking bitch! I hate you! 

           One last loud POUND on the door. Then the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS 
           retreating. Sandra spots Tom standing there.

                                 SANDRA
                             (embarrassed)
                        I’m sorry about that. 

                                 TOM
                        Are you okay? 

                                 SANDRA
                        That was my brother. I haven’t seen 
                        him in, like, six months, but when 
                        he comes by it only means one 
                        thing. He needs money... All happy 
                        families are alike and all that...

                                 TOM
                        Right. How about a drink? 

           EXT. SANDRA’S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

           Sandra and Tom drink whiskey on the fire escape, the sounds 
           of the city below them. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I had it pretty easy. I was good in 
                        school, I had teachers who helped 
                        me get into college. My brother 
                        wasn’t so lucky. Some of the homes 
                        he was put in were a nightmare.

                                 TOM
                        That’s not your fault.

                                 SANDRA
                        I know, but he’s the only family 
                        I’ve got. And no matter how many 
                        times he takes advantage of me, I 
                        find it impossible not to help him.
                                 TOM
                        You’re a good person, Sandra. 

                                 SANDRA
                        About a year ago I got a call from 
                        the police. I thought they were 
                        calling to tell me he had died. He 
                        hadn’t, he had just gotten 
                        arrested. And I... I remember being 
                        disappointed. I remember thinking 
                        it wouldn’t be so bad if... I am 
                        not a good person, Tom. 

                                 TOM
                        Yes, you are... 

           Tom cocoons her with his arms as she weeps into his chest.

                                 GUESTS (PRELAP)
                        Happy Birthday to you/ Happy 
                        birthday to you...

           INT. STORIES - NIGHT

           A small gathering of GUESTS. The lights are low as JACK 
           (20s), clearly a fun guy, delivers a CAKE to the birthday 
           boy: Tom, who stands with Sandra.

                                 GUESTS (O.S.)
                        Happy birthday dear Tom/ Happy 
                        birthday to you!

                                 JACK
                        Make a wish, Tommy boy!

           Tom blows out the candles. Everyone applauds.

           INT. STORIES - NIGHT

           Sandra sips wine, talks to a artsy girl, BRENDA (20s).

                                 BRENDA 
                        So, how long have you known, Tom?

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh, uh, a few weeks now.

                                 BRENDA
                        That’s it? It seems so much longer.
                                 SANDRA
                        I know, it’s been a real whirlwind 
                        romance.

                                 BRENDA
                        Where did you go to undergrad?

                                 SANDRA
                        Vassar.

                                 BRENDA
                        Oh my God, so did I!

                                 SANDRA
                        You know, I thought you looked 
                        familiar. When did you graduate?

                                 BRENDA
                        Class of fourteen.

                                 SANDRA
                        Class of sixteen.

                                 BRENDA
                        Did you hang out at the Mug a lot?

                                 SANDRA
                        I spent almost all of my time at 
                        the library. But don’t tell Tom, I 
                        want to maintain the illusion that 
                        I’m not a total nerd.

           ON JACK AND TOM 

           Watching Sandra and Brenda from across the store.

                                 JACK
                        She’s like a sexy librarian, she’s 
                        literally your dream girl. 

                                 TOM
                        I know. She’s incredible.

                                 JACK
                        It’s good to see that you’re...
                        I don’t know. Doing okay? I mean, 
                        you were in a bad place there. 

                                 TOM
                        I was just a little depressed. 
                                 JACK
                        Dude, you were more than a little 
                        depressed. We were all worried 
                        about you. But, you’re good now? 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. Believe it or not. 

                                 JACK
                        Cool. Cool.  
                             (then)
                        So, how is she in bed?

                                 TOM
                        Awful. Terrible. It’s torture.  

           INT. STORIES - LATER

           Sandra peruses a book shelf by herself. Tom approaches her.

                                 TOM
                        Hey, you okay?

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m great. I met someone who I went 
                        to college with. 

                                 TOM
                        Really? Small world.

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh, and I got you something. 

           She hands him a PACKAGE. He opens it.

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        I noticed you don’t wear a watch.

           He removes an EXPENSIVE WATCH.

                                 TOM
                        This is amazing. Sandra, it must 
                        have cost a fortune. 

                                 SANDRA
                        No, it’s a long story, but it was 
                        given to me by an old friend. 
                        Anyway, I want you to have it.

                                 TOM
                        Thank you.
                                 SANDRA
                        Happy birthday.

           They kiss. 

           EXT. ROLLER COASTER - CONEY ISLAND - AFTERNOON

           Sandra and Tom ride in the front car of the ROLLER COASTER. 
           They squeal and shriek, enjoying the ride. 

           EXT. STREET - CONEY ISLAND - AFTERNOON

           Sandra and Tom walk down the street, arm in arm.

                                 SANDRA
                        Soooo, why do we always go back to 
                        my place? 

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 SANDRA
                        I want to see where you live.

                                 TOM
                        It’s kind of uncomfortable there.

                                 SANDRA
                        Tom, my apartment’s not exactly the 
                        Four Seasons.

                                 TOM
                        No, it’s not that. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Let me guess. You still live with 
                        your parents? 

                                 TOM
                        I live with my dad and his new 
                        wife, yeah. 

                                 SANDRA
                        So?

                                 TOM
                        It’s complicated. My dad and I 
                        don’t get along. He doesn’t like 
                        me. He loves me but he doesn’t like 
                        me. He sees me as a disappointment. 
                                 SANDRA
                        How’s that possible? 

                                 TOM
                             (shrugs it off)
                        All happy families are alike... and 
                        all that, right? Anyway, he’s 
                        really sick, so we’re both trying 
                        to get some closure, I guess. 

                                 SANDRA
                        That sounds rough.

                                 TOM
                        It is what it is. 

           Sandra’s phone RINGS. She checks the caller ID and grimaces.

                                 SANDRA
                        Hold on...
                             (into phone)
                        Hello? Yeah... I don’t know-- 
                        What?! Okay... I said okay!
                             (hangs up phone)
                        I have to go. I’m sorry.

                                 TOM
                        Sure, I’ll call us an Uber--

                                 SANDRA
                        No, I have to go by myself. I’m 
                        sorry. Please. I have to go.

           She hurries away leaving Tom alone, confused.

           EXT. STORIES - NIGHT

           Tom pulls down the gate and locks it.  

           INT. SANDRA’S APARTMENT BULDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Tom climbs the stairs carrying a bag of groceries. He gets to 
           Sandra’s door, then notices the door isn’t fully shut. 

                                 TOM
                        Sandra?

           Tom carefully pushes the door open and enters...
           INT. SANDRA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Tom spots Sandra sitting by the window, drinking a glass of 
           wine and smoking a cigarette. 

                                 TOM
                        Since when do you smoke?

                                 SANDRA
                        I quit two years ago. 

                                 TOM
                        You’re not returning my texts. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know what’s going on with 
                        you and you don’t have to tell me. 
                        But you should eat. 

           Tom heads to the kitchen with the groceries. 

           INT. SANDRA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Tom cooks. Sandra appears at the entrance of the kitchen.

                                 SANDRA
                        My brother’s in trouble.

                                 TOM
                        What kind of trouble? 

                                 SANDRA
                        He owes people a lot of money. 

                                 TOM
                        What happens if he can’t pay?

                                 SANDRA
                        He says they’ll kill him.

                                 TOM
                        And you believe that?

           Sandra looks at him for a beat. Then:

                                 SANDRA
                        They cut out one of his eyes.
           INT. SANDRA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sandra barely touched her food. Tom listens to her.

                                 SANDRA
                        I went to see him in the hospital. 
                        He looked awful. They told him if 
                        he didn’t pay up they would come 
                        back and take his other eye.

                                 TOM
                        How much does he owe them? 

                                 SANDRA
                        Paying them back is not an option.

                                 TOM
                        So, what is an option?

                                 SANDRA
                        I was thinking of giving him money 
                        and getting him out of the country.

                                 TOM
                        How do you know they won’t come 
                        looking for him? And there’s 
                        something else to consider.

                                 SANDRA
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Suppose your brother does 
                        disappear, and they can’t find him. 
                        Who do you think they’re going to 
                        come looking for to collect?

                                 SANDRA
                        Me? They wouldn’t come for me, they 
                        don’t even know I exist. 

                                 TOM
                        How can you be sure that your 
                        brother didn’t mention you?  

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m not sure of anything, Tom. 

                                 TOM
                        You have to pay them off. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I told you that’s not possible.
                                 TOM
                        How much do they want?

                                 SANDRA
                        Three hundred and fifty thousand 
                        dollars and they want it in four 
                        days, so short of robbing a bank it 
                        is just not gonna happen.

           Tom takes this in, nods. Then: 

                                 TOM
                        I can give you the money.

                                 SANDRA
                             (confused)
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        I have it. It’s in the bank. You 
                        wouldn’t have to rob it. I could 
                        just go make a withdrawal.

                                 SANDRA
                        I don’t understand. You live at 
                        home. You work in a bookstore. 

                                 TOM
                        I own a bookstore. And how do you 
                        think I can afford to keep it open? 
                        All that place does is lose money. 

           Sandra stares at him, as if seeing him for the first time. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You have that much money just 
                        sitting in the bank?

                                 TOM
                        More. Yeah. My family has money. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Why... Why is this the first time 
                        I’m hearing about this?

                                 TOM
                        It never seemed to come up. Maybe I 
                        didn’t want you to know. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Well, honestly, it’s fucked up that 
                        you never said anything. 
                                 TOM
                        Sandra, I can help you. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I can’t take your money, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Why not?

                                 SANDRA
                        Because it’s three hundred and 
                        fifty thousand dollars, that’s why!
                             (takes a breath, then)
                        I appreciate the offer, I really 
                        do. But let’s face it, Tom, we’re 
                        practically strangers. 

                                 TOM
                        Before I met you I was sinking into 
                        a hole I didn’t think I was ever 
                        gonna climb out of. Then one day 
                        you walked into my store and the 
                        world’s never looked the same. I 
                        love you, and I’ll do anything for 
                        you. Let me say that again. I love 
                        you, and I’ll do anything for you.

           Sandra takes in the sincerity of his words.

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK CUTS: A DUFFLE BAG ZIPPER PULLED OPEN... HANDS PLACING 
           STACKS OF CASH INTO A DUFFLE BAG... THE DUFFLE BAG ZIPPER 
           PULLED SHUT.  

           INT. BANK - DAY

           A BANK EMPLOYEE hands over the DUFFLE BAG to Tom. Tom turns 
           around and strides out of the bank.

           EXT. BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Tom exits and meets Sandra. He hands her the bag of money. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s all there. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m going to pay you back, if it 
                        takes the rest of my life...
                                 TOM
                        It’s okay. I wish you’d let me come 
                        with you, though. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I told you, I don’t want you 
                        anywhere near these people. I’ll be 
                        fine. What are you doing tonight?

                                 TOM
                        I was hoping to hang out with this 
                        pretty girl I know.

                                 SANDRA
                        Well, there’s this great little 
                        Vietnamese restaurant on Mott 
                        street. If you’re not doing 
                        anything later, dinner’s on me. 

           Sandra hugs Tom tight. She hangs onto him for a long beat. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                             (whispers in his ear)
                        I will never forget this.

           Then she heads off down the street toting the bag. 

           INT. VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Tom sits at a table, checks his watch-- the gift from Sandra. 
           The door opens and he looks to the entrance. It’s not Sandra. 

           EXT. VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The restaurant is closing up. Tom steps out. He checks his 
           watch again. Then removes his phone and checks that as well. 

           INT. SANDRA'S APARTMENT BULDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Tom skips up the stairs. He reaches Sandra’s door and KNOCKS. 
           The door swings open and a YOUNG GUY (30) stands before him.

                                 YOUNG GUY
                        Can I help you?

                                 TOM
                        Where’s Sandra?

                                 YOUNG GUY
                        Who?
                                 TOM
                        Cut the bullshit. I’m Tom. The hell 
                        happened today?

                                 YOUNG GUY
                        You got the wrong--?

                                 TOM
                        I thought they cut out your eye.

                                 YOUNG GUY
                        What?

           A DARK HAIRED WOMAN (30) comes to the door in a robe.

                                 TOM
                        What happened? Where’s Sandra?! 

                                 DARK HAIRED WOMAN
                        Who’s Sandra?
                             (to Young Man)
                        Who’s Sandra, Todd?

                                 TODD
                        I have no idea.

                                 DARK HAIRED WOMAN
                        Todd, what have you been up to?

                                 TODD
                        Nothing, I just spent the last 
                        month in Mexico with you.
                             (to Tom)
                        Seriously, you got the wrong 
                        apartment, dude. Alright?

                                 TOM
                        I don’t... I want to see Sandra. 
                        You hear me? I want see Sandra! 

                                 TODD
                        Get the fuck out of here, man, 
                        before I call the police. 

           SLAM! The door SHUTS IN TOM’S FACE. 

                                 TOM
                        Sandra! Sandra! Sandra!

           Tom POUNDS on the door as we abruptly-- CUT TO BLACK.

           TITLE CARD: SANDRA
           EXT. PHILADELPHIA - STREET -  NIGHT

           A shitty neighborhood-- vacant, desolate, cold. A YOUNG WOMAN 
           in a short skirt and a flimsy jacket hurries down the street. 
           One of her heels BREAKS and she FALLS to the ground. 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN 
                        Oh, fuck me! Shit!

           She hoists herself up and heads into...

           INT. ROUND ABOUT BAR - CONTINUOUS

           The Young Woman enters this decrepit bar. We notice for the 
           first time IT’S SANDRA. Her hair is longer and in disarray. 
           Cheap make-up decorates her face. Her nose is runny. She’s a 
           disaster. A far cry from the Sandra we just got to know.

           She looks around and spots LESTER (35), dressed in a TRACK 
           SUIT and covered in cheap gold. He sits in the corner, 
           drinking scotch. Sandra forces a smile and approaches him.

                                 SANDRA
                        How you doing, Lester?

           Lester ignores her. She sits down across from him.

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        Fucking ‘a it’s cold. I ain’t 
                        feeling so good--

                                 LESTER
                        How much you make tonight, Sandy?

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s empty out there, it’s fucking 
                        Christmas, what do you expect?

           She removes some CASH from her bra. Lester counts it.

                                 LESTER
                        I expect more than this. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Lester. It’s Christmas.

                                 LESTER
                        I don’t give a fuck what day it is!

           A MAN (30s) at the other end of the bar notices them. He’s 
           dressed in an elegant suit, too elegant for this place. 
                                 SANDRA
                        I know, Lester, I’m sorry. You take 
                        such good care of me and tomorrow 
                        I’m going to get you that money, I 
                        swear. As soon as I get some rest. 

                                 LESTER
                        Who you trying to hustle?

                                 SANDRA
                        I ain’t trying to hustle nobody.

                                 LESTER
                        As soon as you get some rest? You 
                        rest when I get paid. See that guy? 
                             (points to the Man at Bar)
                        Go ask if he needs company. 

           Sandra looks at the Man at the bar. She squints.

                                 SANDRA
                        Lester, he looks like a cop.

                                 LESTER
                        Cops get lonely like everybody 
                        else. Go work your magic, girl. 

           Sandra starts heading for the Man, but Lester stops her.

                                 LESTER (CONT'D)
                        Wait up. You look like shit. Go fix 
                        yourself up.

           Sandra heads to the back. She passes the Man and they lock 
           eyes. She does her best to smile, then ducks into the...

           INT. ROUND ABOUT BAR - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sandra enters, fishing in her pocket book. She removes a 
           small BAGGIE OF HEROIN. She snorts a bump. Then looks at 
           herself in the mirror and puts on lipstick.

           INT. ROUND ABOUT BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Sandra exits the bathroom and approaches the Man at the bar. 
           She sits next to him. He notices. She smiles at him.

                                 SANDRA
                        Buy me a drink?

           The Man motions to the BARTENDER.
                                 THE MAN 
                        Dewars for the lady.

           The Bartender pours Sandra a drink. She takes a deep gulp.

                                 SANDRA
                        That’s good. It warms you right up. 
                        It’s cold out there tonight, I’m 
                        freezing my fucking pussy off.

                                 THE MAN 
                        Not advisable for a woman in your 
                        profession. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Haha... You’re funny. I like funny 
                        guys. You alone? You wanna hang? 

                                 THE MAN 
                        And do what?

                                 SANDRA
                        Use your imagination. 

           She takes the Man’s hand and rests it on her leg. 

                                 THE MAN 
                        What are you worth?

                                 SANDRA
                        Sixty, but we can talk about it...

                                 THE MAN
                        No. I mean, what are you worth to 
                        yourself?

                                 SANDRA
                        Don’t know what you’re asking me. 
                        You wanna take me home? We’ll 
                        cuddle.

                                 THE MAN
                             (RE Lester)
                        Is that your pimp?

                                 SANDRA
                        Shit. You a cop? ‘Cause, I’ve had a 
                        real fucked day, man, the last 
                        thing I need is to get arrested. 
                        Please, it’s Christmas, tell me to 
                        walk away and I’ll walk away.
                                 THE MAN
                        Is that what you want? To walk 
                        away? I can help you do that. 
                             (Sandra sizes him up)
                        I can help you walk away.

                                 SANDRA
                        You think you’re the first guy to 
                        tell me that?

                                 THE MAN
                        I’m the first guy to mean it.

                                 SANDRA
                        There’s always a catch. 

                                 THE MAN
                        There sure is. 

                                 SANDRA
                        So, what is it?

                                 THE MAN
                        I need your trust. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I don’t trust anybody.

                                 THE MAN
                        That’s too bad.

           The Man returns to his drink. Sandra watches him carefully. 
           There’s just something about him... 

                                 SANDRA
                        Okay. Okay... I trust you. 

           The Man smiles, stands and heads towards Lester, motions 
           Sandra to follow him. She does.

                                 THE MAN
                             (to Lester, RE Sandra)
                        This belong to you?

                                 LESTER
                        I don’t know her.

                                 THE MAN
                        Great. So you don’t mind if I take 
                        her out of here.

                                 LESTER
                        You ain’t taking shit. 
                                 THE MAN
                        Oh, so you do know her. 

                                 LESTER
                        The fuck you want, man?

                                 THE MAN
                        How much is she worth to you? 

                                 LESTER
                        Sandy? Sandy’s one of my top 
                        earners. What you want with her?

                                 THE MAN
                        I want with her, what I want with 
                        her. What do you care?

           The Man takes out a WALLET. He lays a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on 
           the table, then another, and another. He gets to five 
           hundred. Sandra continues to eye The Man, curiously. 

                                 LESTER
                        Keep going.

                                 THE MAN
                        That’s all I’ve got on me. Why 
                        don’t you just tell me how much 
                        she’s going to cost?

                                 LESTER
                        It’s going to take more than that, 
                        that’s for damn sure.

           The Man gathers his money.

                                 THE MAN
                        Forget green. Let’s talk silver. 

           The Man lifts up his sleeve and removes a SILVER WATCH -- WE 
           REALIZE IT’S THE SAME WATCH THAT SANDRA GAVE TOM. The Man 
           places it gently on the table. Lester inspects it.

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                        That’s a Rolex Submariner. 

                                 LESTER
                        Yeah, I know what a Rolex is. So?

                                 THE MAN
                        It’s worth eighty five hundred. 
                        New.
                                 LESTER
                        You gonna pay eighty five hundred 
                        for this bitch? You high? 

           The Man contemplates Sandra, then shrugs.

                                 THE MAN
                        Yeah, I guess you’re right. Forget 
                        it. Must be the booze.

           The Man reaches across the table, takes his watch back. 

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry to have wasted your time.

           Sandra watches helplessly as the Man walks straight out of 
           the bar and out of her life. Sandra deflates. Then: 

                                 LESTER
                        Where the fuck does he think he’s 
                        going?

           Lester shoots up and follows after The Man.

           EXT. ROUND ABOUT BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The Man walks to his BMW. He opens the door when Lester comes 
           running out of the bar. 

                                 LESTER
                        Wait up, wait up, yo, yo, wait up. 

           He can’t help but notice the Man’s brand new BMW.

                                 LESTER (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t you come back inside? 
                        I’ll buy you a drink. We’ll talk.

           INT. ROUND ABOUT BAR - MOMENTS LATER 

           The Man sits at the bar with Lester. Sandra is a seat away, 
           listening in.

                                 THE MAN 
                        I run a brothel outside of Vegas. 
                        Now, I can use her, but I’m not 
                        about to pay over five grand.

                                 SANDRA
                        A brothel?! What? I ain’t going to 
                        no brothel. Fuck that--
                                 LESTER
                        Sandy, I’m warning you. Shut the 
                        fuck up.  

           Sandra looks to The Man, but his face betrays nothing. 

                                 LESTER (CONT'D)
                             (to the man)
                        Fine, I’m good with five grand.

                                 THE MAN
                        Great, I’ll be back next month, and 
                        I’ll take her off your hands. 

                                 LESTER
                        Next month? She may be dead or in 
                        jail next month. Let’s do this now. 

                                 THE MAN
                        I only have five hundred on me.

                                 LESTER
                        So gimme the watch.

                                 THE MAN
                        Watch is eighty-five hundred. Nice 
                        try. I’ll see you next month.

                                 LESTER
                        Wait, wait, you said the watch is 
                        eighty-five hundred new? Correct? 
                        How much is it used? Like, seven?

                                 THE MAN
                        Maybe. Why?

                                 LESTER
                        Alright, then gimme the watch and 
                        I’ll give you change. 

           Lester takes off his shoe. Inside is a small stack of bills. 
           He counts out two thousand dollars, places the money on the 
           bar. The Man contemplates it. 

                                 THE MAN
                        You mind putting that in an 
                        envelope? 

                                 LESTER
                             (to Bartender)
                        Frankie! Get me a fucking envelope!

           The Bartender roots around for an envelope as the Man removes 
           his watch and hands it to Lester. Lester is very pleased.
                                 LESTER (CONT'D)
                        Happy holidays. 

           EXT. ROUND ABOUT BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The Man and Sandra exit the bar together.

                                 SANDRA
                        Fucking Vegas. I knew it, shit, I 
                        fucking knew it--

                                 THE MAN
                        Just get in the car.

           He unlocks the door and opens it for her.

                                 SANDRA
                        I heard what goes down in those 
                        shit bag places, and there are 
                        things I will not do, motherfucker--

           The man stops, looks her in the eye.

                                 THE MAN
                        I told you to trust me.

           Sandra hesitates, then gets in. The Man shuts her door.

           INT. BMW - CONTINUOUS 

           The Man walks around and gets in the driver’s seat. He fishes 
           around in his coat pocket, removes the envelope of money.

                                 THE MAN
                        Jesus, what kind of a man hides 
                        money in his shoe? Disgusting.

           He takes out half the money and hands it to Sandra. 

                                 SANDRA
                             (confused)
                        What’s this for?

                                 THE MAN
                        That’s your cut.

                                 SANDRA
                             (skeptical)
                        My cut? 

           He leans over, opens the dashboard. IT’S FILLED WITH WATCHES 
           IDENTICAL TO THE ONE HE JUST GAVE LESTER.
                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        Oh fuck. You mean it ain’t real?

                                 THE MAN
                        Nope. It ain’t real. I get them 
                        from a guy named Tipsy in New York. 
                        The best junk money can buy.

                                 SANDRA
                        Well, you fucking fooled me.

                                 THE MAN
                        That’s because you associate with 
                        stupid people. And stupidity is 
                        contagious. 

           The Man starts the car and takes off.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A small one-bedroom, the kind of apartment you can rent by 
           the week. The Man and Sandra enter. Sandra lights a 
           cigarette. The Man fixes himself a drink.

                                 SANDRA
                        Can you make me one?

                                 THE MAN
                        No. From now on you don’t drink, 
                        you don’t smoke.

           He approaches her, grabs her cigarette and puts it in his 
           mouth, takes a drag.

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                        Do me a favor. Take off your 
                        clothes. 

           He sits in a chair across from her, crosses his legs and 
           watches her as she begins to strip. Sandra dances a little.

                                 SANDRA
                        You wanna put on some music?

                                 THE MAN
                        Just take off your clothes.

           She strips down to her bra and underwear. She’s about to 
           remove her bra when--

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                        That’s enough. Go sit on the couch.
           Sandra sits. The Man walks up close, then kneels in front of 
           her. He takes her arms into his own and inspects her 
           forearms. Then spreads her legs and runs his hands along her 
           inner thighs. He takes a hold of her feet and looks in 
           between her toes. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You trying to see if I shoot up?

                                 THE MAN
                        Last thing I need is some junkie. 
                        Get dressed. 

           He stands up and hands her some blankets from nearby.

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                        You’ll sleep out here tonight. Now, 
                        you got a thousand dollars on you, 
                        and that door over there is going 
                        to remain unlocked. You can leave 
                        whenever you want. Or you can stay. 
                        It’s up to you.

                                 SANDRA
                        I’ve never been to Vegas.

                                 THE MAN
                        We’re not going to Vegas. We’re 
                        staying right here.

           Sandra looks at the Man as he heads to a bedroom door, Is he 
           for real? What the hell is going on? He shuts off the light 
           in the living room.

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                        Get some sleep.

                                 SANDRA
                        You haven’t told me your name.

                                 THE MAN
                             (beat)
                        Max

                                 SANDRA
                        Merry Christmas, Max.

                                 MAX
                        Merry Christmas, Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                        You can call me Sandy. Everybody 
                        calls me Sandy. 
                                 MAX
                        Not anymore they don’t.

           Max steps inside his bedroom and shuts the door.

           INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

           Sandra wakes up. Waiting for her is a tray with coffee, and a 
           full breakfast. She sits up, sips the coffee and grabs a 
           piece of toast. 

           Max enters the room, adjusting his tie. He sits down on the 
           couch next to Sandra. 

                                 MAX
                        How did you sleep?

                                 SANDRA
                        Good.

                                 MAX
                        Let me ask you a question. What’s 
                        your favorite movie?

                                 SANDRA
                             (confused)
                        What’s my favorite movie?

                                 MAX
                        What’s your favorite movie?

                                 SANDRA
                        Um... You’ll probably think it’s 
                        stupid. Titanic. 

                                 MAX
                        It’s not stupid. I love that movie. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You do? It’s so good, right?

                                 MAX
                        Of course.

                                 SANDRA
                        God, DiCaprio was so young in it. 

                                 MAX
                        Honestly, he’s never been better.

                                 SANDRA
                        He was pretty great in The 
                        Departed, too. 
                                 MAX
                        He was okay. But nothing compares 
                        to Titanic. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Kate Winslet was beautiful.

                                 MAX
                        And the end is so moving.

                                 SANDRA
                        I can’t believe you like Titanic.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t. I’ve never even seen it. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You’ve never seen Titanic?

                                 MAX
                        I don’t watch movies, they’re a 
                        waste of time. But I was able to 
                        give you the impression that I had 
                        seen it, and was able to discuss 
                        actors I barely know. And that is 
                        what we are going to do with you. 
                        We’re going to create the 
                        impression that you are somebody 
                        you’re not. And when I am done with 
                        you, it’s going to be one hundred 
                        percent convincing. 

                                 SANDRA
                        How you gonna do that?

                                 MAX
                        We’re going to teach you a little 
                        about everything, so you can lie 
                        about anything.

           Max hands her an iPad.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        I downloaded today’s newspapers. 
                        Read them all cover to cover.

                                 SANDRA
                        Newspapers? You fucking kidding me?

                                 MAX
                        Where’d you put the thousand 
                        dollars I gave you?
                                 SANDRA
                        Why?

                                 MAX
                        Where did you put it?

                                 SANDRA
                        In that drawer there. Why?

           Max opens the drawer of the coffee table. Counts money. 

                                 MAX
                        From now on, every time you curse 
                        I’m taking a hundred dollars. 

           Sandra reaches for her money, Max moves away.

                                 SANDRA
                        Fuck that. That’s my money!

           Max takes another bill and throws the rest down on the table.

                                 MAX
                        Now you got eight hundred left. 
                        Choose your words wisely.

           With that he turns around and exits the apartment. Sandra 
           sinks back into the couch. Stares at the money.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           All the lights are off. The front door opens. Max enters.

                                 MAX
                        Sandra?

           He turns on the lights. The living room is empty. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Sandra?

           He walks over to the...

           BATHROOM

           And opens the door.

           Sandra is sitting on the toilet in a t-shirt. Her eyes have a 
           glazed quality to them. Her nose runny again. Max looks over 
           at the sink to spot a small, empty BAGGIE. 
           He rushes Sandra...

                                 SANDRA
                        No...

           Grabs her by the shirt...

                                 MAX
                        Get out.

                                 SANDRA
                        No, come on, I was only snorting 
                        what I had left, I don’t shoot or 
                        nothing.

           Max isn’t listening. He drags her back into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           Pulls her to the front door.

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        Come on, let me go!

                                 MAX
                        Get out. I’ve wasted enough time 
                        with you.

           He opens the front door and pushes her out into the...

           HALLWAY

           And SLAMS the door behind him.

                                 SANDRA
                        Max! Let me back in! Please!

           Sandra POUNDS on the door as she breaks down.

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        I don’t have any clothes! Please, 
                        let me back in! I swear, I’ll do 
                        anything you ask! Please! It’s 
                        cold! It’s so cold out there! 
                        Please! Oh, Jesus, please!

           She keeps hitting the door until she’s spent and goes limp. 
           Tears falling hard and fast down her face. 

           After a few moments, the door creaks open. Sandra looks up 
           from her knees. She pulls herself together. 

                                 MAX
                        That was your only warning.
           Sandra nods and steps back inside. The door quietly shuts.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sandra sits across from Max. She looks a little healthier.

                                 MAX
                        The Great Gatsby.

                                 SANDRA
                        “In my younger and more vulnerable 
                        years my father gave me some advice 
                        that I’ve been turning over in my 
                        mind ever since.”

                                 MAX
                        The Stranger.

                        each unhappy family is unhappy in

                                 MAX

           Sandra and Max eat burgers across from each other.

                        Vassar College.

                                 MAX
                        From when to when?

                                 SANDRA
                        Twenty twelve to twenty sixteen. I 
                        lived in a dorm -- Jewett -- for 
                        two years, then moved off campus. 
                        Didn’t have much of a social life, 
                        spent all my time in the library. 

                                 MAX
                        Good.
                             (then)
                        You’re not without talent. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Am I the first?

                                 MAX
                        First what?

                                 SANDRA
                        First girl you’ve done this with?

                                 MAX
                        Yes.

                                 SANDRA
                        Why’d you pick me?

                                 MAX
                        Because you came along.

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m from Seattle, originally. I’ve 
                        got a mom there. She’s a total hard 
                        ass but she’s alright--

                        What did you major in?

                                 MAX
                        At Vassar. What did you major in?

                        English... I’m just trying to make 
                        some conversation.

                                 MAX
                        I have no interest in making 
                        conversation. I don’t care about 
                        the person you were, I’m only 
                        interested in who you are about to 
                        become. 
                             (then)
                        Now, let’s rewind. When did you go 
                        to Vassar?

                                 SANDRA

                                 MAX
                        You were there the whole time?

                                 SANDRA
                        No, I spent a year abroad.

                                 MAX
                        Where?

                                 SANDRA
                        Florence. Italy. 

                                 MAX
                        How’s your Italian?

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Max and Sandra are jogging and a brisk pace. She’s put on 
           weight and is clearly stronger. All dialogue in italics will 
           be spoken in Italian, with English subtitles. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I used to speak it well, now it’s a 
                        bit rusty, unfortunately.

                                 MAX
                        And what did you think of Italy?

                                 SANDRA
                        I’ve got great memories. But, I had 
                        this boyfriend who was a real jerk.
                                 MAX
                        Have you ever danced an Irish jig?

                                 SANDRA
                        I have no idea what you just said.

                                 MAX
                        So, what do you do?

                                 SANDRA
                        I change the subject.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Max sits at a DINING ROOM TABLE. He can hear a commotion in 
           the Kitchen. After some time, Sandra steps out holding a pot. 
           She places the pot in front of Max, removes the cover. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Chicken cacciatore. Enjoy.

           IT LOOKS DISGUSTING. Max frowns. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        I followed the recipe. I don’t know 
                        what happened. Maybe it tastes 
                        better than it looks?

                                 MAX
                        We’re going to have to simplify 
                        this. Can you boil water?

           INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY

           Sandra is getting her hair and nails done. She looks like a 
           completely different person. Max sits behind her. A 
           HAIRDRESSER works on her. 

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Big plans for the weekend?

                                 SANDRA
                        My brother’s coming to town.

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        That’s nice. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Not exactly. If he’s coming it 
                        means he needs money. And I’ll 
                        probably end up giving to him. He’s 
                        the only family I’ve got.
                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Well, family’s important, honey. 

           Max watches as Sandra continues to make small talk. Sandra 
           spots him looking at her. She smiles at him. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah, our parents died when we were 
                        young. All we had was each other... 

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sandra sits on the couch in front of an OPEN LAPTOP. We see a 
           briefly that she’s on TOM’S FACEBOOK PAGE. Max enters 
           carrying a large garment bag.

                                 SANDRA
                        What’s this?

                                 MAX
                        This is for you. Try it on.

           He opens the bag revealing an ELEGANT DRESS.

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 MAX
                        I’m taking you someplace tonight.

           INT. THE RITTENHOUSE HOTEL - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The nicest hotel in Philly. Max and Sandra sit across from 
           each other, eating steaks. A WAITER drops off two MARTINIS.

                                 MAX
                        Do you like martinis?

                                 SANDRA
                        I like martinis.

                                 MAX
                        Then you’re in luck. They make a 
                        great one here. 

           They both take a sip of their Martini. 

                                 SANDRA
                        What exactly are we doing?

                                 MAX
                        We’re celebrating.
                                 SANDRA
                        What are we celebrating?

                                 MAX
                        My birthday.

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s your birthday?

                                 MAX
                        Yes. Watch your elbows.

           Sandra moves her elbows off the table.

                                 SANDRA
                        How old are you?

                                 MAX
                        I’m thirty-three. You’ve been doing 
                        very well. Better than I expected. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Thank you.

                                 MAX
                        You’re ready for a test run.

                                 SANDRA
                        A test run?

                                 MAX
                        See the man behind me, at the bar?

           Sandra looks over at the bar and spots a middle aged man, 
           WILLIAM TYLER, sitting at the bar by himself.

                                 SANDRA
                        What about him?

                                 MAX
                        Get him to take you back to his 
                        hotel room.

                                 SANDRA
                        How?

                                 MAX
                        Figure it out. You got forty 
                        minutes.

                                 SANDRA
                        You want me to do it now?
                                 MAX
                        The clock’s ticking.

           Sandra smiles, and we realize she’s up for the challenge.

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           William nurses a drink, when Sandra sits down next to him. He 
           can’t help but notice her. The BARTENDER approaches.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I get for you, Miss?

                                 SANDRA
                        Vodka martini, please. 

           The Bartender goes to fix her drink. Sandra catches William 
           checking her out and she smiles at him. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        How do you do?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hi. Good.

           The Bartender returns with Sandra’s drink. She opens her 
           purse and takes out cash.

                                 SANDRA
                        Can you break a hundred?

                                 BARTENDER
                        No problem.

           He goes to get her change. Sandra looks over to William. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Buy you a drink? I hate drinking 
                        alone.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Uh... Sure.

                                 SANDRA
                        My name is Sandra. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        William. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Nice to meet you, William. 

           Sandra offers a hand to shake.
           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           William and Sandra are walking to his room. They’re both 
           laughing. They reach a door and enter...

           INT. WILLIAM’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           William heads to the mini-bar, as Sandra lies out on the bed.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Get you a drink?

                                 SANDRA
                        Yes, please.  
                             (then)
                        I have a confession to make.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What is it?

                                 SANDRA
                        I noticed you at the bar. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        You noticed me?

                                 SANDRA
                        I have a thing for older men.

                                 WILLIAM
                        A thing?

                                 SANDRA
                        A bad thing.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s the matter, daddy didn’t 
                        love you?

                                 SANDRA
                        Daddy wasn’t around much.

           He hands her a drink, she sips it.

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        You’re married, aren’t you?

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s what the ring on my finger 
                        says. 
                                 SANDRA
                        I hope you have liberal ideas about 
                        marriage. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Very liberal.

           He kisses her, when there’s a KNOCK at the door.

                                 SANDRA
                        Ignore it. It’s just turn down 
                        service.

           They continue to kiss. The knocking becomes louder.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What the hell?

           He gets up, walks to the door, opens it, revealing Max.

                                 MAX
                        Where is she?!

           Max plows past William into the room.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        There you are, you miserable bitch!

                                 SANDRA
                        What are you doing here?! 

                                 MAX
                        How could you do this to me?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m calling the front desk--

                                 MAX
                        You shut up! You shut up! You’re 
                        fucking my girl, you motherfucker!

           Max looks like he’s going to kill him. William freezes. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hey, okay, nothing happened here-- 

                                 MAX
                        Just shut up! 

                                 SANDRA
                        Jason. It’s over. It’s been over!

                                 MAX
                        But, why?!
                                 SANDRA
                        Baby, I’m sorry. 

           Max sits down and starts crying. Deflated.

                                 MAX
                        You’re killing me, you know that?

           Max continues to sob. William turns to Sandra.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Should I call security?

                                 SANDRA
                        No, please don’t, William. He’s not 
                        dangerous. He’s just hurt. He’s an 
                        old boyfriend...
                             (then)
                        Can you give us a few minutes?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Uh, sure... Sure...

                                 SANDRA
                        Go down to the bar and I’ll meet 
                        you there in a half hour. Okay?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You going to be alright?

                                 MAX
                        Jesus Christ, look what you’ve 
                        turned me into! I’m so fucking 
                        pathetic. I’m so pathetic...

                                 SANDRA
                        I’ll be fine. I’ll get him out of 
                        here and I’ll come meet you.

           Sandra kisses William and escorts him out of the room. She 
           shuts the door behind her. Max drops the act.

                                 MAX
                        Well done. Seriously, I didn’t even 
                        have to tell you what the game was.

                                 SANDRA
                        I figured it out. 

                                 MAX
                        You’re a natural. You were able to 
                        think quick and improvise and keep 
                        cool. That’s the most important 
                        part of doing what we do.
                                 SANDRA
                        Thank you.

           Max gets up and rifles through William’s bags and luggage. He 
           finds an ENVELOPE with some CASH and smiles.

                                 MAX
                        I’m always surprised that people 
                        still walk around with cash. 

           He pockets it. He keeps looking and finds a BOX FROM 
           TIFFANY’S. He opens it, revealing beautiful EARRINGS.  

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Ah, for the dutiful wife who sits 
                        at home while her husband preys on 
                        young women. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I wouldn’t say he was preying on 
                        me. We sorta set him up.

                                 MAX
                        Don’t do that. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Do what?

                                 MAX
                        Feel sorry for him. 

           Max starts putting the earrings on Sandra. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        There’s an old saying in this 
                        business. You can’t cheat an honest 
                        man. This is why you never feel 
                        sorry for a mark. 

           He finishes putting on the earrings. She looks at herself in 
           the mirror. She’s a new person.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        You wear them well.

           Sandra turns to Max. She gazes up at him. She smiles. The 
           energy in the room has shifted. Max notices. Sandra wraps her 
           arms around him and brings him close to her. Kisses his 
           cheek, his neck...

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing? 
                                 SANDRA
                        Happy birthday, Max...

           She kisses him, and he kisses her back. They fall onto the 
           bed together and begin to make love. 

           FADE TO BLACK.

           TITLE CARD: MAX

           INT. LUXURY SUBURBAN - NIGHT

           Max sits in the back, wearing large headphones, bobbing his 
           head mindlessly, as he watches the Upper East Side pass by.

           He looks YOUNGER than we last saw him, less rough around the 
           edges. He has the air of an entitled rich kid. 

           The Suburban pulls up to a curb and stops. The Driver, 
           CHARLIE, turns back towards Max.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re here, sir. 

           Max looks up at a massively ornate Fifth Avenue building, 
           dating back to the Gilded Age. He takes it all in. 

           INT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING - NIGHT

           A DOORMAN lets Max in. Max carries a suitcase and backpack 
           towards the FRONT DESK. A CONCIERGE greets him.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Good evening, sir.

                                 MAX
                        I’m Max. I’m here to see Madeline 
                        Phillips. She’s in the Penthouse.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Yes, they’re expecting you. Take 
                        the elevator to the top floor. May 
                        we help you with your luggage? 

                                 MAX
                        I got it. Thanks. 
           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open and Max steps inside. The apartment 
           is massive. 10,000 square feet, a luxurious maze of wealth 
           and refinement, overlooking Central Park.  

           A HOLIDAY PARTY takes place. Within seconds of Max stepping 
           out of the elevator, a MAN appears at his side. 

                                 MAN
                        Good evening, sir, may I take your 
                        jacket and bags?

           Max takes off his jacket and hands it to the Man who also 
           takes his bags and vanishes as quickly as he appeared. 

           A CATERER carrying a TRAY OF DRINKS passes Max, and Max helps 
           himself to two. He downs one, and nurses the other as he 
           makes his way deeper into the party.

           And then Max stops as he sees MADELINE, holding court with a 
           GROUP OF GUESTS. She has an effortless beauty. Her age is 
           hard to pin down. She could be on either side of fifty. 

           As Max sees her he softens, but only for a moment. Next to 
           Madeline is RICHARD HOBBES (60s), who radiates power. 
           Madeline spots Max heading towards them, and smiles. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Max! You made it!

                                 MAX
                        Hey, mom. 

           Madeline beams, turns to Richard. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Richard, I’d like you to meet my 
                        son, Max. 

           Richard holds out his hand, they shake. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ve heard so much about you. 

                                 MAX
                        I wish I could say the same. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Well, maybe if you returned a text. 
                        Or picked up the phone and actually 
                        called your mother. 
                                 MAX
                        I’ve been busy. Sorry. 

                                 RICHARD
                        How was the flight? 

                                 MAX
                        Great. Thanks for having your car 
                        pick me up. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Of course. Your mother tells me you 
                        were in Saint Tropez. 

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. I was. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I had some fun times there myself 
                        in the seventies. 

                                 MAX
                        Well, look at us. We already have 
                        so much in common. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Max... 

                                 MAX
                        What? I’m just saying, we’re 
                        starting off on the right foot. We 
                        both partied in Saint Tropez, we 
                        both love mom. 
                             (to Richard)
                        You do love mom, right? This isn’t 
                        just some fling, is it? 

           Richard, annoyed, smiles through it. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I care for your mother very much. 
                        Any advice you can give me, Max?

                                 MAX
                        Nope. You’re on your own.
                             (to Madeline)
                        Can I talk to you privately?

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           The party takes place elsewhere, but mother and son are in 
           the quiet of the library. 
                                 MADELINE
                        You didn’t have to be so rude. 

                                 MAX
                        What do you know about this guy?

                                 MADELINE
                        Come on, Max, anything you want to 
                        know, you can just Google him. He’s 
                        a public figure. 

                                 MAX
                        Why can’t you be alone for two 
                        minutes? You gotta always throw 
                        yourself into these relationships. 

                                 MADELINE
                        This is different, Max. 

                                 MAX
                        Sure it is. 

           Max walks over to a BAR, pours himself a drink. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Go easy on the alcohol, please. 

                                 MAX
                        Stop being my mom, mom. 

           Max takes a deep gulp. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Why are you so hostile? And where’s 
                        Candice? I thought she was coming.

                                 MAX
                        Candice is in the Maldives with 
                        Stefano. They are now an item. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I’m sorry. Still, I never liked 
                        her. She was not a good influence. 

                                 MAX
                        Can I stay here for a while?

           Madeline hesitates, then:

                                 MADELINE
                        I need to know you’re not using.
                                 MAX
                        I’m not. I’m clean. I haven’t done 
                        drugs in a year. 

           Madeline doesn’t believe him. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Jesus, mom, I swear to God. I’m 
                        clean, okay? 

                                 MADELINE
                        It’s just... I won’t go through 
                        that again, Max, I--

                                 MAX
                        For chrissake, you want a piss 
                        test? Huh? Is that what you want? 

           Max finishes his drink. Then starts unzipping his pants.

                                 MADELINE
                        What are you doing?

                                 MAX
                        Proving it to you.

           Max turns away from her and pisses in the empty glass. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Stop it. Stop it right now. 

           Max finishes pissing, turns back around and slams the tumbler 
           full of piss on the coffee table. 

                                 MAX
                        There. Go on. Test it. Go on--

                                 MADELINE
                        Enough! 

           Madeline starts to cry. Max is quiet. Then:

                                 MAX
                        I’m sorry... I’m sorry. 

           Madeline continues to cry. Max softens. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        I just need a place to stay for a 
                        bit. If I can’t stay here, I’ll 
                        make other arrangements. 

           Madeline wipes away her tears. She hugs Max.
                                 MADELINE
                        Of course you can stay. 

                                 MAX
                        Thanks, mom. 

           Max turns and leaves... On his way out of the Library he 
           almost runs into Richard who has been standing outside the 
           library eavesdropping. Max looks him in the eye.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        You enjoy the show?

           Before Richard can answer Max keeps walking. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - MORNING

           Max wakes up in bed. He’s hungover. He sits up, looks out the 
           window and takes a moment to admire the view. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Max, showered and dressed but still groggy, makes his way 
           down the hallway. As he approaches the DINING ROOM, he hears 
           his mother and Richard discussing him. He listens in... 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - SAME TIME

           The apartment STAFF bring in food and take away plates as 
           Madeline and Richard eat breakfast and talk quietly.  Richard 
           is taking a NUMBER OF VARIOUS MEDICATIONS, as he speaks. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m just trying to get a sense of 
                        how he lives. How does he get by? 

                                 MADELINE
                        Well, he spent most of last year 
                        putting together a company to 
                        charter boats in the Bahamas, but 
                        that hurricane wiped the whole 
                        thing out. It’s too bad because--  

                                 RICHARD
                        Madeline, how does he live?  

                                 MADELINE
                        His father left him some money. And 
                        I help him out from time to time. 
                                 RICHARD
                        There’s no shame in that. I know 
                        what it’s like to be a parent. You 
                        don’t have to make excuses to me. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I know. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I just want to be able to discuss 
                        all topics openly, that’s all. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I had Max when I was very young. 
                        His father died soon after. I was 
                        suddenly a widow and I had this 
                        child and I didn’t always know how 
                        to be a mother. I made mistakes. 

                                 RICHARD
                        We all have. But, he’s an adult 
                        now, Madeline.

                                 MADELINE
                        No. He certainly is not. And that’s 
                        my fault. I never let him grow up. 
                        He’s always been my little Max. And 
                        now he can’t swim without me. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Maybe you just have to throw him in 
                        the deep end and watch him sink. 

           Madeline takes this in. A THROAT is cleared as Max steps in. 

                                 MAX
                        Morning.

                                 MADELINE
                        Morning, hon. How did you sleep?

                                 MAX
                        Great. Thank you. The room’s got an 
                        incredible view. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Good. Now, I have an appointment 
                        downtown. But, maybe we can have 
                        lunch later?

                                 MAX
                        I’d like that, mom.
                                 MADELINE
                        Perfect. 

           Madeline stands up, kisses Richard, smiles at Max and exits. 
           Max and Richard are left alone. Slightly, awkward. Finally:

                                 MAX
                        I’m sorry about last night. I took 
                        a Klonopin on the plane and I had a 
                        few drinks too many. 

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s fine. Your mother and I are 
                        attending an event tonight to 
                        commemorate The Hobbes Foundation. 
                        My late wife founded it. We do 
                        medical research, work on climate 
                        change, help third world economies. 

                                 MAX
                             (joking)
                        Are you looking for a donation?
                        Because, to be honest, I’m a little 
                        light at the moment. 

                                 RICHARD
                        No, I thought you might want to 
                        join us. There will be Hollywood 
                        people in attendance and a few 
                        musical acts that I’m told are 
                        quite... relevant. 

                                 MAX
                        Relevant musical acts? Wow. Sounds 
                        like a good time. 

                                 RICHARD
                        There will also be a bevy of young 
                        women your age. You may enjoy 
                        yourself, despite yourself.  

                                 MAX
                        Thanks. But after last night, I 
                        think I should just stay in. Rest. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Okay. Max, I meant what I said. I 
                        care for your mother very deeply. 

                                 MAX
                        I’m starting to see that. 
                                 RICHARD
                        You and I are going to be in each 
                        other’s lives for the foreseeable 
                        future. It would be nice if we 
                        could find some way to navigate 
                        these rocky shores. 

           Max, smiles, nods. Satisfied, Richard goes back to eating. 

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING - NIGHT

           A SUBURBAN pulls up. A DOORMAN hustles to the back and opens 
           the door, as Richard and Madeline step out. 

                                 RICHARD
                        See you tomorrow, Charlie. 

           The Doorman leads them into the building. 

           INT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Richard and Madeline ride up, slightly buzzed, in good moods.

                                 MADELINE
                        ...honestly, Richard, you treated 
                        him like a waiter. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I still have no idea who he was.

                                 MADELINE
                        He’s on that television show. The 
                        one where he plays a spy. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Well, I don’t watch television. 
                        It’s a waste of time.
                             (smiles, then)
                        A few months ago I would never have 
                        made it past ten. My body would’ve 
                        given out... 

           He brings her close.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        But, you’ve done what all those 
                        doctors were unable to do. You made 
                        me well. You’re my cure, Madeline.  

                                 MADELINE
                        I love you, Richard. 
           She kisses him lovingly. The Doors open...

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           As the two step out, they’re met by a HOUSEKEEPER. 

                                 HOUSEKEEPER
                        Sir, the police are here.

                                 RICHARD
                        The police?

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard and Madeline enter and are met by DETECTIVE COLLINS, 
           black, middle age. Max sits sheepishly on the couch. 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        Mr. Hobbes? I’m Detective Collins.

                                 RICHARD
                        What’s this all about?

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        Does this young man live here?

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t say I lived here, I said--

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                             (to Max)
                        Sir. Please.

                                 RICHARD
                        He’s staying here, yes.

                                 MADELINE
                        What’s going on? 
                             (to Max)
                        Max, what did you do?

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t do anything. 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        He solicited sex from an undercover 
                        officer. 

                                 MAX
                        I hit on a girl in the park. How is 
                        that illegal? 
                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        It became illegal when you offered 
                        her money. 
                             (to Richard and Madeline)
                        As we were arresting him he told us 
                        he lived here and he told us who 
                        you were. I thought I’d give you 
                        the courtesy of a heads up. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Is he in trouble? 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        We ran his name through the system. 
                        He has priors. He’s looking at 
                        doing some time. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Jesus, Max. 

           Max stays silent. Madeline begins to cry. 

                                 RICHARD
                        What happens now, Detective?

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        We take him downtown and book him. 
                        It’s late, so he’ll spend the night 
                        in jail and he’ll be arraigned in 
                        the morning. You’re going to want 
                        to meet him there with a lawyer. 

           Detective Collins motions Max to stand up. Max gets up. 
           Detective Collins takes out HANDCUFFS.

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS (CONT'D)
                        Turn around. 

                                 MAX
                        Come on, man. 

           Detective Collins puts handcuffs on him. Madeline is now 
           really crying. Richard’s mind is working. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Detective, I’ve given large 
                        donations to the NYPD every year. 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        I’m aware of that, sir, that’s the 
                        reason for the courtesy call. 
                                 RICHARD
                        I know the Commissioner. Martin is 
                        a dear friend. I could call him, 
                        put in a good word, Detective.

           Detective Collins hesitates. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        My word carries some weight in this 
                        city. And it can go both ways. 

           Richard delivers this congenially, but there is the trace of 
           a threat. Detective Collins suddenly looks out of his depths. 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        Uh... I, uh... I don’t know... 

                                 RICHARD
                        I appreciate what you’ve done by 
                        coming here. How long were you 
                        waiting for us? 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        Not long... an hour maybe? 

                                 RICHARD
                        I will pay you for your time. 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        No, that’s, um...

           Richard takes out his wallet, and begins to count out TEN 
           CRISP HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. He holds the money out.

                                 RICHARD
                        Do the right thing. 

           Detective Collins, defeated, nods. He uncuffs Max. Madeline 
           watches all this, her mind working. Detective Collins reaches 
           out for the money when--

                                 MADELINE
                        Stop. He’s not a cop. 

           Everyone turns to Madeline who has a look of disgust.

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        Ma’am--?

                                 MADELINE
                        Shut up. 
                             (to Richard)
                        This is what Max does. He plays 
                        these little confidence games.

                                 (MORE)
                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                             (to Max)
                        That’s what this is, isn’t it? One 
                        of your stupid little games? 

                                 DETECTIVE COLLINS
                        I assure you, I am a police--

                                 MADELINE
                        Get out of my apartment or I really 
                        will call the police.

           She steadies her gaze on Detective Collins WHO WE NOW REALIZE 
           IS NOT A DETECTIVE AT ALL. He looks at Max. 

                                 MAX
                        Tipsy, you better go. 

           Tipsy quickly leaves. Madeline turns her fury onto Max.

                                 MADELINE
                        I gave you everything. I gave you 
                        the best education money can buy. 
                        You never wanted for anything and 
                        this is how you repay me? By 
                        getting cheap thrills hustling the 
                        man I love for a few hundred 
                        dollars? How dare you! 

                                 MAX
                        Mom, I--

           SLAP! The slap is hard and vicious and echoes in the spacious 
           room. Max turns away. Madeline gets close to him. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Get out. 

           Madeline exits the room. Richard and Max are left alone. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ll get you a hotel room. 

           Richard leaves the room, as Max is left alone. 

           INT. CARLYLE HOTEL - ROOM - MORNING

           It’s early but Max is already up. He’s packing his bags and 
           drinking coffee. There’s a KNOCK on the door. He opens it and 
           Madeline is standing there, Max FROWNS. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I’m sorry I hit you. 
                                 MAX
                        Forget it. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I took it too far.

                                 MAX
                        It’s fine.

           She reaches for his face, he pulls back. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Let me see... 

           She takes hold of his face, inspects it, then looks him in 
           the eye and leans in and KISSES HIM DEEPLY ON THE MOUTH. 

           They kiss for a long beat, before she lets him go. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        You got anything to drink? 

           Madeline goes looking for the mini-bar, notices Max’s bags.

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        What’s going on here?

                                 MAX
                        You screwed up. There’s love in his 
                        eyes. 

                                 MADELINE
                        So?

                                 MAX
                        So the man is worth half a billion 
                        dollars. What do you think he’s 
                        going to do when we up and vanish? 
                        He will use his resources to find 
                        us. I’m not living like that.

                                 MADELINE
                        We’re one month and forty grand 
                        deep on this thing. 

                                 MAX
                        He loves you. You understand? He 
                        won’t stop looking for you. We 
                        leave now, we cut our losses, we 
                        set up shop somewhere else. 

                                 MADELINE
                        We’re close. 
                                 MAX
                        I don’t care. 

                                 MADELINE
                        It’s in arm’s reach. He wants to 
                        meet with you at his office at one 
                        o’clock. 

                                 MAX
                        That is a meeting I will not be 
                        attending. 

                                 MADELINE
                        That is a meeting you will be 
                        attending. 

                                 MAX
                        I’m not spending the rest of my 
                        life looking over my shoulder. It’s 
                        why I never liked him for a mark. I 
                        told you. 

                                 MADELINE
                        We’re taking him for a pittance 
                        compared to what he’s worth. 

                                 MAX
                        You’re not listening. It’s not the 
                        money. He’s not gonna let you go. 

           Madeline regards Max, then a slow smiles crosses her lips.  

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 MADELINE
                        Are you jealous?

                                 MAX
                        Madeline, we’re leaving.

           Madeline steps close to him, still smiling. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You’re jealous... 

           Now, Madeline is close to him, breathy, there’s is an erotic 
           charge coming from her that we see Max is helpless against.

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        Is that what you’ve been doing? 
                        Sitting here stewing? Thinking 
                        about me and him together...
                                 MAX
                        Stop...

                                 MADELINE
                        Thinking about the things I was 
                        letting him do to me? Was it 
                        driving you crazy?

           She pushes him down on the bed, and straddles him. She’s 
           wearing a long skirt that flowers around him. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        Or maybe you liked it? Hm? Maybe it 
                        turned you on a little?

           Madeline unzips his pants, takes him and slips him inside 
           her. She lets out a soft moan. Madeline begins to move back 
           and forth slowly... 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        Did it turn you on a little? You 
                        can tell me... 

           Max doesn’t answer, just closes his eyes. Madeline continues 
           to move on top of him, taking her time, enjoying it. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        Who’s in charge, Max?

                                 MAX
                        You’re in charge.

                                 MADELINE
                        Who taught you everything?

                                 MAX
                        You taught me everything. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Are you going to do what I say?

                                 MAX
                        I’m going to do what you say. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Are you going to get me my money?

                                 MAX
                        I’m going to get you your money. 

           Madeline kisses him as they continue to make love. 
           INT. THE HOBBES FUND - RICHARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Richard sits behind a desk. His entire office has large 
           windows overlooking the financial district. It’s like a glass 
           box floating in the sky. 

           There’s also glass looking into the rest of the office, as we 
           see a vast and moneyed financial empire in full swing. 

           A PHYSICIAN takes Richard’s blood pressure.

           Richard’s ASSISTANT KNOCKS on the glass door and points to 
           Max standing behind her. Richard motions them to enter. The 
           Assistant opens the door and lets Max in.

           The Physician finishes what he’s doing and begins packing up. 

                                 PHYSICIAN
                        I want to see you again later this 
                        week, Richard. 

           The Physician gives Richard a worried glance. Richard nods. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Sure thing, Sam.

           Physician leaves, Richard turns his attention to Max.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Max, thank you for coming.

                                 MAX
                        Are you okay?

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes, just maintenance. Have a seat. 

           Richard points to a large couch. Max sits down and Richard 
           comes around the desk and takes a seat opposite him. 

                                 MAX
                        I’d like to apologize. What I did 
                        last night was inappropriate. 

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s a hell of an understatement. 
                        You almost took me for a ride.

                                 MAX
                        It was just a prank, you know? I
                        I thought it would be funny. It 
                        wasn’t even for that much money. 
                                 RICHARD
                        I get the sense that the money 
                        wasn’t the point. 

                                 MAX
                        No, I guess not. 

                                 RICHARD
                        When your mother first told me 
                        about you, she said you were well 
                        educated. Smart. Clever. I thought, 
                        I’m always on the look out for such 
                        a young man. 

                                 MAX
                        Are you offering me a job here? 

                                 RICHARD
                        I doubt that you’d want one. 

                                 MAX
                        Why’s that?

                                 RICHARD
                        Because, you came in here wearing 
                        sweats. 

                                 MAX
                        In fairness, these sweats probably 
                        cost more than your suit. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Then it was you who was taken for a 
                        ride.  

           Richard smiles. He points to a PICTURE on a SHELF. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        That’s my son up there. 

           Max looks at the picture and we recognize Richard’s son 
           immediately: HIS SON IS TOM.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        He’s traveling through Italy at the 
                        moment. 

                                 MAX
                        Lucky him. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I always thought my son would 
                        inherit all this. Then his mother 
                        died and he did not take it well.

                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        It became clear that he did not 
                        posses the internal fortitude one 
                        needs to be in this business. You 
                        need to be strong and my son is 
                        fragile. 

           Richard stands up, takes the picture off the shelf and takes 
           a moment to study it. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        When he turned twenty one I offered 
                        him anything he wanted. Most boys 
                        his age would request a sports car. 
                        Those slightly more grounded may 
                        have asked for a piece of property. 
                        You know what my son wanted? 

                                 MAX
                        I haven’t a clue. 

                                 RICHARD
                        A signed copy of Bronte’s Jane 
                        Eyre. After his mother died he 
                        spent his days reading and watching 
                        foreign films. For a moment it 
                        looked as if he might have some 
                        success as a writer, but that too 
                        proved to be a dead end. Now he 
                        wants to open up a used book store.   

                                 MAX
                        Not exactly a sound investment. 

                                 RICHARD
                        No. But, I’m going to give it to 
                        him anyway. Another man in my 
                        position might not. Perhaps they 
                        would insist that he come work for 
                        the family business. But, not me. 
                        You know why, Max? 

           Max shrugs. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Because we only get one life. And I 
                        will not be my son’s jailer for his 
                        brief time here on earth.

           Richard lets that sit. Just then the glass door opens and 
           Richard’s ASSISTANT steps in carrying a LARGE TRAY with FOOD. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        I thought we could have lunch. 
           The tray is placed between them and they help themselves. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        I want you to be honest with 
                        yourself, Max, if I hired you here 
                        how do you think it will end? 

                                 MAX
                        I think it’s quite certain that I 
                        would shit the bed. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I concur. Still, I would like to 
                        offer you a job, just not here. I’m 
                        thinking thirty thousand dollars a 
                        month should be commensurate to 
                        your skill and experience. 

                                 MAX
                        You’re gonna pay me thirty grand a 
                        month? For what? 

                                 RICHARD
                        To do what you do. To go out and 
                        find opportunity. 

                                 MAX
                        Wow. I don’t know what to say.

                                 RICHARD
                        I refuse to be your jailer, Max. We 
                        only get one life. So? 

                                 MAX
                        Yes. I’m in. And this is the right 
                        city. I got a lot of connections 
                        here and I think I can make moves--

                                 RICHARD
                        No, Max. Go off into the world. See 
                        what you find. I hear you tried to 
                        start something in the Bahamas. It 
                        sounded promising. Perhaps, you 
                        could revisit it?  

           Max takes this in and pushes his plate away. Then:

                                 MAX
                        You want me gone. 

                                 RICHARD
                        No, I--
                                 MAX
                        You want to talk about honesty?
                        You want to me to stay away. 

           Richard looks at him for a long beat, then:

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s not me. 

                                 MAX
                        Oh. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You cause your mother a great deal 
                        of anguish, Max. A separation might 
                        not be the worst thing. 

                                 MAX
                        That’s what my mother thinks I’m 
                        worth? Thirty grand a month? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Think of it as an opportunity. 

           Max takes all this in, then: 

                                 MAX
                        Fine. But, I want a years salary up 
                        front. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes, well, that can be arranged. 
                        We’ll transfer the money into your 
                        account--

                                 MAX
                        Transfer the money? No. What? Then 
                        I gotta pay taxes? Huh? Hire an 
                        accountant? No. She wants me gone, 
                        she pays me the whole thing, up 
                        front, cash. 

           Richard hesitates. Max, hurt, looks ready to break, but then 
           a look of resolves crosses his face. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Give me the cash and you can tell 
                        my mother she won’t hear from me 
                        again. Not so much as a fucking 
                        postcard. 

           Richard meets Max’s gaze. Then:
                                 RICHARD
                        Wait here. 

           EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT STREET - DAY

           Max walks on a crowded street carrying an OVERSIZED BAG, his 
           face a mixture of giddiness, paranoia, relief and joy.

           INT. MCCALL’S BAR - DAY

           An EMPTY DIVE BAR, with a small dance floor. Max is getting 
           super drunk. MUSIC IS BLARING, as Max smokes a cigarette and 
           dances by himself, celebrating. 

           SAMMY, the bartender, pours him a shot. Max wordlessly downs 
           it, then spots something and smiles wide.

           Walking in the bar is Madeline. She also can’t stop smiling. 
           She starts to dance towards him. When she reaches Max she 
           kisses him passionately and deeply. 

           They continue to kiss, still dancing, this feeling is better 
           than sex for them. 

           As she kisses him, she moves seductively, giving him a 
           improptu lap dance as Max leans against the bar stool...

           And then she looks him in the eye, with love. Max grins. 

                                 MAX
                        We did it. 

                                 MADELINE
                        We sure did, baby. 

           She grins back and kisses him again. 

                                 TIPSY (O.S.)
                        WHERE’S MY MONEY?!!!!

           They look over and spot Tipsy grinning as he enters. Max 
           turns to Sammy and motions to him. 

                                 MAX
                        Give me the bag. 

           Sammy removes the bag from behind the bar. Max opens it, the 
           bag is overflowing with money. Max produces a large WAD OF 
           CASH, he walks towards Tipsy. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        You want your money?
           Max starts throwing HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS in his direction.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Here’s your money...

           He throws more money at him. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Here’s your money...

           He throws even more...

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Here’s your money!!!!

           And Max throws the rest in the air, hundred dollar bills 
           falling from above as Max makes it rain in celebration. 

           INT. MCCALL’S BAR - LATER

           Max, Madeline and Tipsy have been drinking for hours, they’re 
           all sluggish, but still in good spirits. 

                                 TIPSY
                        This guy Goldie just got to town 
                        from LA. He’s a real pro, started 
                        out working as a stuntman before 
                        grifting. Comes highly recommended. 
                        He’s looking for a score. 

                                 MAX
                        Well, look elsewhere. We’re out.

                                 TIPSY
                        Oh, you guys are retiring? That it? 

                                 MAX
                        No, just taking a well deserved 
                        vacation. 

                                 TIPSY
                        Yeah, well, you hit me up when you 
                        get back. I’m telling you this guy 
                        is good. You will want to meet him.  

           Tipsy stands up, Max slides a LARGE ENVELOPE towards him. 
           Tipsy looks inside, frowns.

                                 TIPSY (CONT'D)
                        Where’s the rest of it? 
                                 MAX
                        We had expenses we didn’t account 
                        for. That’s your cut. 

                                 TIPSY
                        It’s not what we agreed on. 

                                 MAX
                        Things change. 

                                 TIPSY
                        This is becoming a habit with you 
                        two. I’m starting to feel like I’m 
                        the mark.

                                 MAX
                        Tipsy, move on. 

                                 TIPSY
                        I guess, there’s no honor among 
                        thieves, right?

                                 MADELINE
                        Wrong, Tipsy. There’s no honor in 
                        thieving. 

           Tipsy sizes both of them up, cuts his losses. Sighs. 

                                 TIPSY
                        It was a beautiful con. 

                                 MAX
                        You can thank Madeline. 

                                 TIPSY
                        Thank you, Madeline. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You’re very welcome, Tipsy.

           Tipsy takes his money and walks out.

                                 MAX
                        Alright, so we’re forty grand in, 
                        plus Tipsy’s twenty. Another ten 
                        for incidentals. Leaving us with 
                        two ninety. That’s one forty five 
                        each. Not bad for one month’s work. 

           Max kisses Madeline, she smiles and then gets serious. 
                                 MADELINE
                        I got some good news and some bad 
                        news. Good news is you get to keep 
                        it all. 

                                 MAX
                        What’s the bad news? 

                                 MADELINE
                        Bad news is gonna sting a bit.

                                 MAX
                        What is it, Madeline? 

                                 MADELINE
                        This is where we part ways.

                                 MAX
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MADELINE
                        I’m staying, Max. I got a good 
                        thing going here. You were right. 
                        The old man loves me. 

                                 MAX
                        You’re not thinking straight. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You know what happens to people 
                        like us? They end up sitting in a 
                        bar all day every day, pulling 
                        short cons for a couple a hundred 
                        bucks a pop. That won’t be me. 

                                 MAX
                        That’s not gonna be us. Madeline, 
                        we’re just getting started here. 
                        This was a good con, we can keep 
                        doing this.  

                                 MADELINE
                        No. There’s nothing worse than 
                        having to play a mother. I’m out. 

                                 MAX
                             (beat, take a breath)
                        Sooner or later the old man is 
                        gonna start asking questions. 

                                 MADELINE
                        No, he won’t. He’s got a lot on his 
                        mind. He’s got his business. His 
                        son’s an emotional mess.

                                 (MORE)
                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        And he’s got health problems. I’m 
                        the only thing he’s got going. 

                                 MAX
                        You stay and you will slip. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I won’t slip. You know how I know 
                        that? Because, I am that good. 

           Max stands up. 

                                 MAX
                        I love you and I will not let you 
                        go. This conversation is over. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Max... 

                                 MAX
                        Listen to me, I will blow this 
                        whole thing up if I have to. 

           Madeline takes in his words. Max softens:

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Look, let’s take this money, go 
                        someplace warm. What do you say? 
                        Look at this money.

           Max shows her the bag of money. She can’t help but smile.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        You really wanna wake up next to 
                        that old man every day? Use your 
                        head. This was a good score. Okay?

                                 MADELINE
                        Okay. I’ll go home and get my 
                        stuff. I’ll wipe everything down. 
                        I’ll tell him I got a sick aunt in 
                        Long Island. We’ll spend the night 
                        at the hotel, we’re out first thing 
                        in the morning.
                             (then)
                        You really love me? 

                                 MAX
                        Unfortunately. 

           She brings him close and kisses him. 
           INT. CARLYLE HOTEL - ROOM - SUNSET

           Max impatiently sips a drink while watching the sun dip. On 
           his bed, his bags are packed, he’s ready to go. His PHONE 
           RINGS, he answers:

                                 MAX (INTO PHONE)
                        Where are you?

           Madeline is on the other end, we hear her disembodied voice. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        I’m sorry, Max. 

                                 MAX (INTO PHONE)
                        We discussed this. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        I made up my mind. 

                                 MAX (INTO PHONE)
                        I told you what I would do. I will 
                        blow everything up. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        No, you won’t. 

                                 MAX (INTO PHONE)
                        And why’s that?

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        Because, if you do I’ll never 
                        forgive you. And you’ll lose me 
                        anyway. 
                             (softer)
                        Just let me go. 

           There’s a BANGING ON THE DOOR. Max is alarmed, then:

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Good luck to you, Max.

                        Nice try, Madeline. Who’s at the 
                        door? Tipsy? One of his new guys? 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        You need to go. Now.

                        Then call my bluff. Open the door.

                        We are coming in! 

           More BANGING. Max’s suddenly has a moment of realization:

                        The old man was the real con this 
                        entire time, wasn’t he? I was just 
                        a side act. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        It’s your final lesson, baby. Trust 
                        no one. 

           Madeline hangs up the phone. Max grabs his bags, walks over 
           to a SIDE DOOR and gets on his knees. He quickly removes a 
           LOCK PICKING KIT and very smoothly opens the door. 

           Max slips into the side door taking him into an adjoining 
           hotel room, just as the front door opens and POLICE STEP IN. 

           Max deftly DISAPPEARS, shutting the side door behind him.

           TITLE CARD: MADELINE

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Madeline sits on a bench reading a paper. Her hair is 
           shorter, and she looks a little younger. As she reads, 
           something catches her eye.

           A few feet away there’s a YOUNG MAN, baseball hat, flannel 
           shirt, jeans, walking up to strangers. 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Excuse me, uh, I was mugged and I’m 
                        trying to get home. I just need 
                        money to buy a--

           People ignore him and keep walking. Upon closer inspection we 
           realize this YOUNG MAN IS MAX. Madeline, interested, puts 
           down the paper and continues to watch.
           ON MAX

           Max walks up to a MIDDLE AGE COUPLE. 

                                 MAX
                        Hey, I was just mugged and--

                                 MIDDLE AGE MAN
                        Sorry...

           They pass him. Max looks around, searching for someone else, 
           when he spots TWO POLICEMEN heading his way. He starts to 
           turn, but they call out to him.  

                                 POLICEMAN # 1
                        Can we see some ID?

                                 MAX
                        Well, see the thing is--

                                 POLICEMAN # 1
                        ID. Now. 

           Max hesitates.

                                 POLICEMAN # 2
                        Let’s see some identification or 
                        we’re bringing you in.

           Max, helpless, searches for a way out, when:

                                 MADELINE (O.S.)
                        There you are!

           Madeline, frantic, runs up to him. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        Are you alright?

           Max, confused, doesn’t answer. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        We got here as quickly as we could. 
                        Mom and Dad are at a hotel. 

                                 POLICEMAN # 1
                        Ma’am, please step away. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Excuse me? 

                                 POLICEMAN # 1
                        We need him to show us some ID. 
                                 MADELINE
                        This is my brother. He was mugged. 

                                 POLICEMAN # 2
                        Yes, that’s what he’s been telling 
                        people. We need to see some ID. 

                                 MADELINE
                        If his wallet was just stolen, 
                        Officer, please explain how you 
                        expect him to show you 
                        identification?

           This stumps the two cops, and Madeline continues.  

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        And I’d like you to tell me why 
                        you’re harassing my brother after 
                        he’s been the victim of a crime? 

                                 POLICEMAN # 1
                        Okay, we’re sorry, some people come 
                        here and try to scam--

                                 MADELINE
                        Try to what? Scam? 

                                 POLICEMAN # 2
                        Uh... It was a misunderstanding. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You can make it up to us by giving 
                        us a ride. 

                                 POLICEMAN # 1 
                        What? 

                                 MADELINE
                        I’d like to get my brother back to 
                        the hotel. My parents are beside 
                        themselves and there’s not a single 
                        taxi outside. Please give us a 
                        ride. It’s the least you can do. 

           The two police officers just look at each other. 

           INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

           Madeline and Max sit in the back seat as the Police Officer’s 
           drive them. Max is now super confused. He looks over at 
           Madeline who turns to him and delivers a devilish grin. 

           Max is beside himself. Who is this woman? He leans in. 
                                 MAX
                        Where... Where are we going?

                                 MADELINE
                        The Rittenhouse Hotel. You like 
                        martinis?

                                 MAX
                        I... I like martinis.

                                 MADELINE
                        Then you’re in luck. They make a 
                        good one. 

           Madeline goes back to reading her paper, we quickly notice 
           she’s reading an article about RICHARD HOBBES. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - PRESENT DAY

           Madeline GRIPS the side of a sink. Her hair is longer, she 
           looks a little older. She’s staring at herself in the mirror. 
           Slowly tears begin to flow down her face.

           She BLINKS. Dabs her eyes. Takes a deep breath. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

           A WAKE takes place. Friends of Richard are all mourning his 
           death. Everyone wears black. Madeline exits the bathroom and 
           nervously mingles with other mourners. She approaches a group 
           of WOMEN, JILL, KAREN and VALERIA. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Can I get you anything? A drink?

           They look at Madeline with sympathy. 

                                 JILL
                        Oh, Madeline, please sit down...

                                 KAREN
                        You don’t need to be fetching 
                        drinks for us.  

                                 MADELINE
                        I just need to do something... I 
                        can’t sit still... 

           And as Madeline speaks, she breaks down in tears. The Women 
           take out handkerchiefs and comfort her. 
                                 VALERIA
                        Madeline, you gave so much meaning 
                        to his life. Especially at the end. 

                                 KAREN
                        He adored you. As he should. I 
                        mean, look at you. 

                                 JILL
                        You’d be so easy to hate if you 
                        weren’t so lovely. 

           Madeline manages to smile through tears. 

                                 VALERIA
                        You have your whole life ahead of 
                        you. You have to begin thinking 
                        about what you will do now.

           Madeline takes in these words, when DAVID (60s), steps up, 
           with all the pragmatic efficiency of a well paid lawyer. 

                                 DAVID
                        I need a minute of your time. 

           Madeline nods and allows herself to be led away by David. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        We have to go over Richard’s will. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Now? Can’t it wait?

                                 DAVID
                        There are papers to sign that are 
                        time sensitive. Also, I think it’s 
                        best we do it now, for Tom’s sake. 

           David looks over and we spot Tom sitting off with his friends 
           Jack and Brenda. He’s practically catatonic. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LIBRARY - DAY

           Madeline and Tom sit across from David as he shuffles papers. 

                                 DAVID
                        Richard dictated this last draft of 
                        the will to me personally, then he 
                        signed it. And because he was at 
                        the height of his sickness I feel 
                        it’s my obligation to assure you 
                        that he was cogent and of sound 
                        mind when he did so.
           David lets those words sink in and then moves on:

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Richard left the bulk of his 
                        inheritance to Madeline. 

                                 MADELINE
                        What? 

           Tom nods, a part of him finds it funny. 

                                 TOM
                        Perfect. 

                                 MADELINE
                        This is ridiculous. Tom is his son. 
                        He should be inheriting it all. 

                                 DAVID
                        Richard was very clear. After the 
                        past incident with Tom, he had 
                        major misgivings leaving Tom both 
                        the business and the estate. 

                                 TOM
                        You mean the incident where I had 
                        three hundred and fifty thousand 
                        dollars stolen from me and I then 
                        proceeded to have a nervous 
                        breakdown? That incident? 

                                 DAVID
                        Tom, you will be taken care of 
                        through a trust. It’s generous and 
                        will allow you to hold on to your 
                        bookstore. You will also retain 
                        control over the Hobbes Foundation. 
                        But, as for everything else, it 
                        will all go to Madeline. 

                                 MADELINE
                        David, I need to speak with Tom.

                                 DAVID
                        Of course. 

           David leaves the Library. Madeline turns to Tom. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I am so sorry. 

                                 TOM
                        Don’t be. It’s not your fault. 
                                 MADELINE
                        He left you the foundation. That’s 
                        what he prized more than anything. 
                        And he left it all to you.

                                 TOM
                        He left me his tax write off. 
                        That’s what he called it. You can’t 
                        fix my relationship with my dad, 
                        Madeline, especially now. 

           Madeline leans over and takes Tom’s hand, warmly. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I’m here for you, Tom. 

                                 TOM
                        I know. Thank you. 

           Tom stands up and starts to leave. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You don’t have to move out any time 
                        soon. Stay as long as you like. 

           Tom is confused by this. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        I’m planning on selling the 
                        apartment. I’m moving into 
                        something more manageable. But, 
                        that’s not something we need to 
                        discuss now. 

                                 TOM
                        I see. Okay.  

                                 MADELINE
                        I don’t know why I even brought it 
                        up. I have so many things going 
                        through my head right now, Tom. 
                        Forget I said anything. I’m sorry. 

           She starts to cry. Tom walks up to her and embraces her. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s okay... It’s okay. 

           They share a moment, then Tom leaves. Madeline watches him 
           go, and the moment he exits THE TEARS STOP. 

           She sits down in a plush chair and takes a deep breath. She 
           clenches her fists in silent victory and you can tell that 
           every fiber of her being wants to scream with joy! 
           But, they’re mourning her husband in the next room. So, 
           instead she quietly takes in the enormity of the moment. 

           She just pulled off a half a billion dollar con. 

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING - MORNING

           A DOORMAN opens the door, Madeline steps out. A Suburban 
           waits for her. The doorman opens the back door. As Madeline 
           gets in:

                                 MADELINE
                        Good morning, Charlie.

           The door is shut, the Suburban takes off. 

           INT. BARNEYS - DAY

           Madeline sips champagne, while a NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES buzz 
           around her, fitting her with clothes and accessories.

           Madeline slips into an EXPENSIVE DRESS, she admires herself. 

                                 BARNEY EMPLOYEE
                        That is stunning.

           Madeline continues to look at herself, happily. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

           Madeline enters, carrying a number of BAGS. A HOUSEKEEPER 
           comes and quickly takes them from her. 

                                 HOUSEKEEPER
                        I’ll bring these to your room. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Thank you. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           Madeline walks down the hallway and pauses at Tom’s room. She 
           peeks inside, and spots Tom just sitting at his desk looking 
           mindlessly at his computer. 

           Madeline regards him with a cold gaze. Then keeps going. 
           INT. RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

           A LARGE GROUP have gathered for a dinner party. They are all 
           of the highest social circle, some are obviously celebrities 
           or artists, while others are just plain rich. 

           Madeline is there, completely at ease, looking gorgeous in 
           her new dress and fitting right in.

           A HANDSOME OLDER MAN whispers something in her ear. Madeline 
           laughs and laughs... This is her life now.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Madeline wakes up to faint VOICES coming from somewhere in 
           the apartment. Curious, she gets up and slips on a robe.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Madeline steps into the living room and spots THREE MEN 
           standing there. They are all large men, clearly ex-military, 
           wearing dark suits. The oldest, BRADDOCK (50s), sees her. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Mrs. Hobbes, good morning. I’m Pat 
                        Braddock, we met briefly at your 
                        husband’s wake. 

           Madeline, startled, sticks out her hand. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Yes, of course, how do you do?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I am well, thank you. These are my 
                        associates, Mr. Mosely and Mr. 
                        McCabe. 

           Braddock points to the other two men, who greet her politely. 

                                 MADELINE
                        How can I help you?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Oh, no, ma’am, we were called in by 
                        Tom. We’re doing a bit of business 
                        for him. 

                                 MADELINE
                        A bit of business?

           Tom steps into the living room, excited. 
                                 TOM
                        It’s okay, Madeline, Braddock is an 
                        old family friend. These men are 
                        part of Blackwell Security. They 
                        did work for my father whenever he 
                        had anything sensitive that needed 
                        to be taken care of. Come on, I 
                        want you to see this. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (hesitates)
                        Maybe I should walk you through 
                        things first, Tom, and then you can 
                        decide what you’d like to share. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s fine. Madeline is family. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Okay, then. 

           Madeline, surprised, takes all this in. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LIBRARY - MORNING

           Tom and Madeline sit down, Mosely and McCabe pull the SHADES 
           SHUT, dimming the room. Braddock, facing Tom and Madeline, 
           holds an iPad in front of him. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Tom enlisted our help in finding 
                        the young woman who committed the 
                        theft. We had very little to go on 
                        other than the few pictures Tom had 
                        of her and whatever we could glean 
                        from her fabricated social media. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Tom, are you looking for this 
                        person?

                                 TOM
                        Yes. I want to find her. 

                                 MADELINE
                        This is not a good idea. Dredging 
                        it all up again, how can this be 
                        healthy? Why are you doing this? 

                                 TOM
                        Because, I need to know why she 
                        picked me. Why was I chosen? 
                                 MADELINE
                        Your father was a wealthy man. It’s 
                        rather obvious. You were targeted. 

                                 TOM
                        This city is full of rich kids. Why 
                        was I targeted?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Would you like to know what we 
                        uncovered?

                                 TOM
                        Please. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        After running these photographs 
                        through facial recognition software 
                        we landed on this woman. 

           Braddock punches at his iPad and on a TV SCREEN hanging on 
           the wall A PICTURE OF SANDRA APPEARS, an OLD MUG SHOT.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        We believe this to be her.

           Tom is stunned. He stands up and approaches the TV Screen as 
           if in a trance. 

                                 TOM
                        That... That’s her... Who is she?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Her name is Sandra Carmichael. Born 
                        in Seattle in Nineteen Ninety 
                        Seven. Her mother Liza is the only 
                        living family she has. We 
                        questioned the mother who has not 
                        heard from her in several years. 

                                 TOM
                        What else did you find out?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        A bit. She drops out of high school 
                        at sixteen and from there begins to 
                        rack up a number of petty offenses. 
                        Shoplifting, possession, assault. 
                        Then she develops a habit and 
                        begins escorting. She crisscrosses 
                        the country for the next few years.  

           As Braddock speaks he SWIPES thought a number of MUG SHOTS OF 
           SANDRA and other pictures he’s accumulated. 
                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        She strips when she can find the 
                        work, her longest stint is a year 
                        and a half in Atlantic City. 
                        Eventually, she makes her way to 
                        Philadelphia, where she’s arrested 
                        a number of times for possession 
                        and solicitation and that’s where 
                        her trail runs cold. No trace of 
                        her in over two years. 

           A look of relief crosses Madeline’s face. 

                                 MADELINE
                        So, that’s it? 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        For now. Frankly, it raises more 
                        questions. 

                                 TOM
                        How so?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Pulling off what she did required a 
                        great deal of sophistication and I 
                        don’t see how this woman was 
                        capable of it. To be blunt, she’s a 
                        hooker with a drug habit. She’s a 
                        mess. 

                                 TOM
                        You don’t think she did it? 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I don’t think she did it alone. I 
                        think she had help. I think we’re 
                        looking for more than one person. 

           Tom and Madeline take this in, silently. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - FOYER - MORNING

           Madeline and Tom are seeing Braddock and his men out. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        We’ll keep you posted with any new 
                        developments. All we need is a 
                        small break. 

                                 TOM
                        Thank you, Pat. For everything. 
           Braddock gives Tom a familial hug. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        We’re going to find these people, 
                        Tom. I promise you that. 

           Braddock looks to Madeline and smiles. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Have a good day. We’ll be in touch. 

           Braddock and his men leave. Tom is positively giddy. 

                                 TOM
                        I better go, too. The shop was 
                        supposed to be open an hour ago. My 
                        three customers are going to be 
                        very upset.

           Tom walks over to a SIDE CLOSET, grabs a JACKET. He looks at 
           Madeline and smiles. 

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        You heard him, right? He said we’re 
                        going to find these people. 

           Madeline smiles back. Tom turns and exits. As soon as he’s 
           gone her face fills with rage. 

           But, we also see that she’s thinking... thinking... 
           thinking... and then her eye’s land on something. 

           On a small SIDE TABLE is a PHOTOGRAPH OF -- YOUNG RICHARD, 
           YOUNG TOM, who’s in the arms of his MOTHER.

           Madeline focuses on the picture. Her mind working. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Madeline steps into the kitchen with a number of bags. She 
           quickly unpacks the bags, TAKE-OUT BOXES filled with food. 

           She removes pots and pans and places them on a stove, then 
           empties the food into the pots and pans and sets everything 
           to simmer. She tosses the take out boxes in the trash.

           She uncorks a bottle of wine, pours herself a glass, takes a 
           sip, checks her watch and waits... 

           Then she hears footsteps coming towards the kitchen. She puts 
           the glass of wine down, turns towards the stove, just as Tom 
           steps into the kitchen.
                                 TOM
                        I didn’t know you could cook. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Yes, well, I wasn’t always a trophy 
                        wife. 

           Tom is taken back by this, but Madeline smiles. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        Your father told me what you 
                        thought of me when we first got 
                        together. 

                                 TOM
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t know you then. 
                        It had more to do with him.

                                 MADELINE
                        It’s okay. Are you hungry?

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - KITCHEN - LATER

           Madeline and Tom sit at the kitchen island eating. Though the 
           kitchen is grand, there’s something cozy and intimate about 
           them sitting there and just sharing a simple meal. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Any luck with the elusive girl?

                                 TOM
                        Not yet. Braddock had a lead down 
                        in Miami but it was a bust.

                                 MADELINE
                        Tom, I know you’re hurting. What 
                        these people did to you was awful 
                        and confusing and unfair. But, I 
                        promise you, finding them is only 
                        going to make everything worse. 

                                 TOM
                        I disagree...

                                 MADELINE
                        You need to move on with your life. 
                        Let me show you something.

           Madeline produces a number of REAL ESTATE LISTING. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve begun looking for apartments 
                        for you.

                        I think these three are quite nice. 
                        They’re all downtown right near the 
                        bookstore, so it wouldn’t be much 
                        of a commute--

                                 TOM
                        What is this?

                                 MADELINE
                        I told you. I’m selling the 
                        penthouse, you’re going to need a 
                        place to move into. Now, take a 
                        look at this one in Tribeca--

                                 TOM
                        I don’t need you to do this for me.

                                 MADELINE
                        I want to. I want to help you. And 
                        these are all great apartments--

                                 TOM
                        I’m just saying, I can find my own 
                        apartment, okay?

                                 MADELINE
                        Why are you getting so upset?

                                 TOM
                        Because, you can’t just come in 
                        here and do this for me and--

                                 MADELINE
                        Tom, you need to move on with your 
                        life. You need to find a place to 
                        live and--

                                 TOM
                        Stop it, just stop it.

                                 MADELINE
                        I’m sorry if this hurts, but you 
                        have to hear this. You can’t just 
                        keep living like this--

                                 TOM
                        You’re not my mother! 

           This stuns Madeline into silence, then:

                                 MADELINE
                        You’re damn right I’m not. If I was 
                        I’d tell you to grow the fuck up.  
           Now it’s Tom’s turn to be stunned into silence. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        You had your heart broken, Tom. 
                        Guess what? It happens to guys your 
                        age every day but not everyone is 
                        entitled enough to hire men to 
                        track down the girl that did it. 

                                 TOM
                        She stole money from me, she--

                                 MADELINE
                        That’s not why you’re doing it. You 
                        want to see her again. That’s all. 
                        You can lie to yourself but you 
                        can’t lie to me. 

           Madeline stands up, about to leave, but then stops. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry if I was harsh. 

                                 TOM
                        You think I’m pathetic. 

           She smiles at him, and the energy shifts.

                                 MADELINE
                        Oh, honey, no. I think you’re 
                        human. I think we’re all just 
                        human. Doing the best we can. 

           They share a moment. Tom then looks at her. 

                                 TOM
                        You’re right. I’ll call Braddock 
                        and call it all off. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Good for you.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           An empty spacious apartment in the West Village. Tom and 
           Madeline are being led around by a REALTOR. 

                                 REALTOR
                        It’s just shy of two thousand 
                        square feet. 

                                 MADELINE
                        But, it’s only a one bedroom?
                                 REALTOR
                        Yes, there’s another apartment 
                        upstairs that has two bedrooms. We 
                        can take a look if you like. 

                                 TOM
                        One bedroom is fine. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You may want more space, Tom. 

                                 TOM
                        No, it’s cool. I mean, this place 
                        seems okay. I guess I should just 
                        take it?

           Madeline turns to the Realtor. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You’ll have to forgive my step-son 
                        he’s very discerning. 

           Then Tom’s PHONE RINGS. He answers it. 

                                 TOM
                        Hello?... Yes?... Yes. Okay. Bring 
                        her to the apartment. Thank you. 

           Tom hangs up the phone, flustered. 

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I gotta go. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Is everything, alright?

                                 TOM
                        They found her. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You said you were going to call 
                        Braddock and put a stop to this.

                                 TOM
                        I did, but they had one last lead 
                        to follow and they found her. 

                                 MADELINE
                        What are you hoping to get out of 
                        this?
                                 TOM
                        I just want to talk to her, that’s 
                        all... I haven’t been able to stop 
                        thinking about her. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Tom... It’s not a good idea-- 

                                 TOM
                             (resolved)
                        I need to do this.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           Madeline and Tom follow Braddock down the long hallway, as he 
           catches them up to speed. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        We’ve set her up in the guest room 
                        on the south east corner. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Where did you find her?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        She was living at the Lincoln Motel 
                        off the Cross Bronx Expressway. She 
                        was prostituting herself. She’s got 
                        a serious heroin addiction.

           They reach a door, where Mosely and McCabe are stationed.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        We gave her a sedative to calm her 
                        down, but she’s going to be 
                        experiencing some pretty heavy 
                        withdrawal soon.  

                                 TOM
                        Can I go in and talk to her?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Of course. You want one of us in 
                        there with you? 

                                 TOM
                        No. I’m okay. 

           Tom hesitates, then takes a deep breath and enters. Madeline, 
           Braddock and the two other men are left alone in the hall. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Well done, Mr. Braddock. 
                                 BRADDOCK
                        Thank you.

                                 MADELINE
                        Did she tell you anything? Did you 
                        get anymore insight?

           Braddock shakes his head. Then: 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I first met Tom when he was just a 
                        boy. Mr. Hobbes was receiving 
                        kidnapping threats. This was after 
                        9/11, everyone was on edge. I was 
                        Tom’s bodyguard for over three 
                        years. I watched him grow up. You’d 
                        think a kid who grew up with this 
                        kind of wealth would turn into a 
                        real asshole, but not Tom. You 
                        wanna know the truth? This money 
                        was the worst thing that could 
                        happen to a kid like that. 

           Braddock sighs, smiles at Madeline. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        About a week before he passed, Mr. 
                        Hobbes called me here. You were 
                        out. He was not well. He could 
                        barely speak above a whisper. As I 
                        was leaving, I went to shake his 
                        hand and he slipped me a piece of 
                        paper where he’d written three 
                        simple words. Protect. My. Son. 

           Braddock shakes head ruefully, rests his hands on his hips, 
           causing his JACKET TO OPEN, revealing a SIDEARM. Madeline 
           stiffens at the sight of the weapon. Then smiles.

                                 MADELINE
                        Well, you’ve done an incredible 
                        job.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Madeline sits in silence, nursing a drink, while Braddock 
           stands by the window and gazes out at Central Park. 

           Tom steps into the room, he’s clearly in a daze. Madeline and 
           Braddock notice him. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Are you alright, Tom?
                                 TOM
                        Yeah. I’m okay... It’s weird, it’s 
                        like, it’s her, but it’s not her. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Did she tell you anything?

                                 TOM
                        Oh, yeah, you were right. She 
                        wasn’t working alone. There’s this 
                        guy who was her accomplice. He 
                        taught her everything and trained 
                        her. He planned the whole thing. He 
                        has some kind of connection to us.

                                 MADELINE
                        A connection?

                                 TOM
                        That’s what she told me. She said 
                        he knew all about me. She said it 
                        seemed personal. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Did she tell you anything about 
                        him? 

           Madeline holds her breath. Waits. Then:

                                 TOM
                        Just that he ended up cheating her, 
                        too. Left her with almost nothing. 
                             (then)
                        I told her she could stay here. 

                                 MADELINE
                        What? Tom, no--

                                 TOM
                        She’s sick. She needs a place to 
                        kick her habit and, you know, she’s 
                        real sorry for what she did. 

                                 MADELINE
                        This woman is a liar and a thief 
                        and she is not to be trusted. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I agree with Madeline, Tom. 
                                 MADELINE
                        She’s a junkie who will say 
                        anything to get a fix or some 
                        money. You do not want any part of 
                        this. Trust me. 

                                 TOM
                        I know it sounds crazy, but, I want 
                        to help her.

                        If you want to help her we can set 
                        her up in a rehab. We’ll start 
                        making calls--

                                 TOM
                        No, she’s staying here. I’m gonna 
                        take care of her. I’ll call in 
                        doctors and nurses. I want to do 
                        this. 

                                 MADELINE
                        It’s just not safe. Right, Mr. 
                        Braddock?

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (reluctantly)
                        I can post men outside her room. 
                        She’ll be essentially under lock 
                        and key. The issue is, Tom, are you 
                        prepared for when she does sober up 
                        and you get to see the real her?

                                 TOM
                        I’m dying to see the real her.

                                 MADELINE
                        I want to talk to her. If this 
                        woman is going to be staying under 
                        my roof, I want a word. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - DAY

           Madeline steps into the room and shuts the door behind her. 
           Sandra is lying in bed, sweating, track marks covering her 
           arms, a black eye, she looks like death. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Sandra? My name is Madeline. I was 
                        married to Tom’s father before--

                                 SANDRA
                        Shut the fuck up, you lying cunt. 
           Madeline freezes, Sandra levels her gaze at her. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        Max told me the whole score. How 
                        there was an old man who was dying 
                        and was gonna leave behind a 
                        fortune and Max and I just needed 
                        to nudge the only heir aside so 
                        that his very full of shit widow 
                        could inherit it all. Yeah, I know 
                        who you are, Madeline. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I see. What is it you want? 

                                 SANDRA
                        I want to get this off my chest. I 
                        want to confess. I want to confess 
                        to it all. Do me a favor and get 
                        Tom so that I can unburden myself. 

                                 MADELINE
                        So, this is a shakedown? Okay. How 
                        much? How much do you want? 

                                 SANDRA
                        I don’t want your money, bitch. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Then what do you want?

                                 SANDRA
                        Max and I were supposed to meet at 
                        the waiting room in Penn Station. I 
                        waited there for three days. 
                        Because I was so fucking stupid, I 
                        actually thought something had 
                        happened to him. I was worried. Can 
                        you believe that? He had run off 
                        with almost all the money and I was 
                        sitting there worrying about him. 
                        My heart breaking. 

                                 MADELINE
                        How much does he still owe? I’ll 
                        pay it. Plus interest. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I said I don’t want your money. I 
                        don’t want to have anything to do 
                        with you. 
                                 MADELINE
                        Sandra, I know all about you too, 
                        and I can say with some certainty 
                        you do not have the moral high 
                        ground here. 

                                 SANDRA
                        At least when I fuck someone, they 
                        know what they’re getting. 

                                 MADELINE
                        If it’s not money you want then 
                        what is it?

                                 SANDRA
                        I want Max. I want to see Max. I 
                        want to look him in the face. I 
                        want him to see what he did to me. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I don’t know where he is. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Well, you better find out. Or I 
                        will tell everyone in the next room 
                        who you really fucking are. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tom and Braddock wait, as Madeline breezes through on her way 
           out of the apartment. As she walks past them, she calls out:

                                 MADELINE
                        She can stay! 

           INT. MIDTOWN ELECTRONIC STORE - DAY

           An EMPLOYEE removes a BURNER PHONE from the shelf and hands 
           it to Madeline. She counts out two hundred dollars in cash. 

           INT. BEACH FRONT BAR - DAY

           We’re in Florida, as evidenced by the blue ocean and white 
           sand beaches we see from a window. Max enjoys an afternoon 
           cocktail at the bar. His PHONE BUZZES. He answers it. 

                                 MAX (INTO PHONE)
                        Where’s my money?
           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY - INTERCUT

           Madeline, on the phone, walks briskly down the street. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        There’s a problem.

                                 MAX (ON PHONE)
                        The problem is I don’t have my 
                        money. Did I not do my part? I 
                        cracked him, Madeline, just like 
                        you asked and don’t think I didn’t 
                        have to put a lot of my personal 
                        shit aside to come back and help 
                        you. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        From what I remember it didn’t take 
                        a hell of a lot of convincing.

                                 MAX (ON PHONE)
                        I swallowed shit, Madeline, and 
                        here am I am a year later and I 
                        don’t have my share. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        They found the girl. 

           Max pauses, then:

                                 MAX (ON PHONE)
                        Where?

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        Turning tricks off the Cross Bronx 
                        Expressway. You really did a number 
                        on her. Left her high and dry.

                                 MAX (ON PHONE)
                        She got a cut. Enough to start 
                        over, if she backslid into bad 
                        habits that is not my concern. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        It is very much your concern. 
                        Because she is in my apartment 
                        pining after you. 

                                 MAX (ON PHONE)
                        She knows nothing about me. I’m a 
                        ghost. I’m not exposed. 
                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        She is in my apartment. She is 
                        threatening to talk. I am very much 
                        exposed. You want your money?

                                 MAX (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah, I want my money. 

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        Then get back here and fix this.

           Hold on Max. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Madeline sleeps, when the sound of SCREAMS awaken her. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Madeline makes her way through the apartment, following the 
           sound of screams. As she gets to the GUEST ROOM, the screams 
           get louder and louder...

           There’s quite a bit of commotion outside the guest room, with 
           NURSES coming in and out of the room.

           Madeline walks to the door and looks inside. Tom is sitting 
           on the bed holding a bucket as Sandra, in the height of 
           withdrawal, vomits into it. 

           Sandra looks up and spots Madeline standing at the doorway. 
           She locks eyes with her. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Did you find him?! 

           Tom spots Madeline and walks to her. 

                                 TOM
                        She’s delirious. She’s just been 
                        screaming things all night.

                                 SANDRA
                        Did you find him?! 

                                 TOM
                        They say she’ll be better in the 
                        morning. I apologize. 

           Tom goes back to help Sandra, who’s glaring at Madeline.
                                 SANDRA
                        DID YOU FIND HIM?! 

           Madeline retreats and hurries away.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Madeline stands at the window, smoking a cigarette. She’s 
           looking out at the city down below. A BUZZING can be heard.

           She walks to her purse. REMOVES THE BURNER PHONE. There’s a 
           TEXT: I’M HERE. 

           Madeline puts out her cigarette. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - DAY

           Sandra is sitting up in bed, while Tom sits next to her. 
           They’re talking, and laughing, as if they’re getting to know 
           each other all over again. Madeline steps in. 

                                 MADELINE
                        And how is our young patient doing?

           Madeline smiles at them, and they smile back. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Feeling a lot better. Thank you.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, last night was rough, but, I 
                        think she’s over the hump. 

                                 MADELINE
                        That’s a relief. I’m going to get a 
                        pedicure. Would you like to join 
                        me, Sandra?

                                 TOM
                        That’s not a good idea. She’s still 
                        not a hundred percent. 

                                 MADELINE
                        The fresh air will do her good. 

                                 TOM
                        Um, I don’t know--

                                 SANDRA
                        No, it’s okay. A pedicure sounds 
                        perfect. 
                                 MADELINE
                        Get dressed then. 

                                 TOM
                        But--

                                 MADELINE
                        We’ll only be a short while, Tom. 

           INT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

           Madeline and Sandra ride in silence. 

                                 SANDRA
                        That was fast. Where was he?

                                 MADELINE
                        You can ask him yourself. We had a 
                        deal, right? After you see Max you 
                        get out of my apartment and you get 
                        out of my life. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I told you, I don’t want anything 
                        from you. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Good. You are not my problem. 

           Sandra regards her for a beat, a mixture of revulsion but 
           also an odd admiration. 

                                 SANDRA
                        How can you do what you do?

                                 MADELINE
                        Practice. 

           INT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Elevator Doors open and Sandra and Madeline step out. The 
           Doorman spots her. 

                                 DOORMAN
                        Hello, Mrs. Hobbes, shall I call 
                        your driver?

                                 MADELINE
                        No, thank you. We’re going to walk.
           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Madeline and Sandra step out of the building. Madeline walks 
           at a brisk pace, as Sandra tries to keep up. 

           They turn the corner, and Madeline raises her hand. A TAXI 
           comes to a stop. She opens the back door. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Get in. 

           Sandra gets in, and Madeline follows her.

           EXT. QUEENS STREET - WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The taxi pulls up to a warehouse in this industrial 
           neighborhood. Madeline and Sandra exit the taxi. 

           Madeline starts to head for a warehouse, but Sandra pauses, 
           looking around, noticing just how isolated she is. 

           There is literally not a soul around. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Are you coming? 

           Sandra, hesitates, but then follows her. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Sandra steps in after Madeline in this empty warehouse, and 
           standing there, waiting for them, is Max. 

           Sandra freezes at the sight of him. And then she’s filled 
           with a mixture of rage and sadness. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You piece of shit!

           Sandra attacks him, hitting him and punching him, crying all 
           the while. 

                                 MAX
                        Hey, hey, hey...

                                 SANDRA
                        How could you?! How could you?!

           Max tries protect himself from Sandra but she’s keeps 
           pummeling him in anger, her small fists attacking fiercely, 
           as Max attempts to calm her.  
           Madeline watches, annoyed, and lights a cigarette. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        I waited for you! I waited for 
                        days! You left me! You threw me 
                        aside like trash! 

           Sandra continues hitting Max, Madeline has had enough. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Alright, are you done? 

           Sandra spins, turns her fury on to Madeline. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You stay out of this!

                                 MADELINE
                        Too late. You dragged me into it. 
                        You got taken. That’s what we do. 
                        Now, the question is, how do we 
                        make this right by you? 

                                 SANDRA
                        I want him to apologize. 

                                 MADELINE
                        He can’t. Because he’s not sorry. 
                        So, what else do you want?

                                 SANDRA
                             (to Max)
                        I want to know... Did you feel 
                        anything for me? Ever? 

           Max hesitates, but Madeline steps forward. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Give it to her straight, Max. 

                                 MAX
                        If I had allowed myself to feel 
                        anything it would’ve jeopardized 
                        what we were doing. So, no. I did 
                        not allow that to happen. That is 
                        the discipline. 

           Sandra deflates, it’s as if all the anger has gone out of 
           her. She looks back at Max and Madeline, genuinely confused:

                                 SANDRA
                        Why did you save me if you were 
                        just going to destroy me?  
                                 MAX
                        Because, that was the con. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Who are you people?

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.)
                        Great question. 

           They look over and bum rushing the warehouse is Braddock and 
           his men. Following behind is Tom. 

           Madeline and Max grow alarmed, as they spot themselves being 
           descended on. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        But, here’s the good news. We’re 
                        going to find out. We’re going to 
                        find out exactly who you are. You 
                        guys are through. 

           The men start to surround Madeline and Max. But, Madeline 
           steadies herself, her mind working.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        You have been lying about who you 
                        are, about your intentions. This 
                        whole thing was a set-up from the 
                        beginning. You targeted Mr. Hobbes 
                        because of his wealth. Then 
                        targeted Tom here so that you can 
                        pull the inheritance out from 
                        underneath him. Lady, believe me 
                        when I tell you. You are fucked. 

           Madeline sits in silence as Braddock approaches her. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Well? You got nothing to say? 

                                 MADELINE
                             (icy)
                        I do. I have advice. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You have advice? Let’s hear it. 

                                 MADELINE
                        My advice to you is, lawyer up. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You don’t get it. You’re not in the 
                        position to be making threats. 
                                 MADELINE
                        I’m making promises. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        The inheritance belongs to Tom. And 
                        you’re going to give it all back. 
                        It’s Tom’s money. 

                                 MADELINE
                        If it was Tom’s money, he would 
                        have his money. But, he doesn’t. 
                        Because it is not Tom’s money. It 
                        is my money. And you know what I 
                        will do with my money, Mr. 
                        Braddock? I will take a half a 
                        billion dollars and aim it in your 
                        direction.  

           Braddock notices he’s losing ground. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        Your three bedroom in Scarsdale, or 
                        Lloyd Harbor or wherever the fuck. 
                        It’s gone. Your Benz. Gone. The 
                        clothes you’re wearing, your 
                        children’s college fund. By the 
                        time we’re done with you, it’s all 
                        gone.  

           Tom, as if in a trance, steps forward. 

                                 TOM
                        That’s what it’s all about for you. 

           Madeline turns to Tom, who’s just staring at her. He’s 
           shaking, clearly in the midst of a break down. 

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        It’s all about the money for you. 
                        It’s why you seduced my dad, right? 
                             (nods to Tom and Sandra)
                        Why you got these two to steal from 
                        me? It was all for money. You’ll do 
                        anything for money. Well, I’ll tell 
                        you what. You can have it. You can 
                        have it all.

           With sudden speed, Tom turns to Braddock and removes his SIDE 
           ARM from Braddock’s belt. Tom SHOVES THE GUN in this mouth. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Tom, no--!
           And he pulls the trigger. A loud GUNSHOT is heard, and the 
           back of Tom’s head explodes -- sending blood and skull and 
           brains splattering behind him, spraying Braddock. 

           Sandra lets out a SCREAM. Everyone else just stands there in 
           shock. Braddock falls to his knees. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        No, no, no, no, no...

           He cradles Tom’s body in his arms, this big military man is 
           on the verge of tears... 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        No! No! No! NO!

           Braddock is suddenly back on his feet. And he’s got the gun 
           in his hand. He points it at Madeline and Max and Sandra. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        You did this! You did this!

           Madeline, Max and Sandra all back up. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Get on your knees! All of you! 

           Madeline, Max and Sandra do as their told. Braddock steps 
           closer to them, pointing his gun squarely at Madeline.  She 
           squeezes her eyes shut, and turns away. 

                                 MAX
                        Wait, wait, wait, we can fix this 
                        for you! She will fix this! 

           Max gets in front of Madeline to shield her. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You can’t fix this!

           Braddock HITS MAX with the GUN. Max falls over. Braddock 
           firmly plants the gun against Madeline’s forehead. His finger 
           on the trigger, beginning to squeeze... 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        You killed him... 

                                 MADELINE
                        Please. 

                                 MAX
                        Don’t do this. Don’t do this.
                                 BRADDOCK
                             (to Madeline)
                        Look at me. Open your eyes. 

                                 MAX
                        You don’t need to do this. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (to Madeline)
                        Open your eyes!

           Madeline opens her eyes, looks up at Braddock. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Say it. You killed him. Say it. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I... I killed him... I’m sorry. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You’re damn right you are.

           BANG! BANG! BANG! 

                                 MAX
                        NO, MADELINE!

           Yet, as the echo of the gunshots die down, we notice that 
           Braddock had moved the gun to the left before firing. He 
           couldn’t bring himself to do it. 

           He stands there, exhausted, holding the gun limply by his 
           side. Madeline, shaking, on her knees, weeping from fear.  

           Braddock looks at her with disgust, then turns and walks over 
           to McCabe and Mosely. The three men begin to confer. 

           Madeline turns to Max, motions towards a side-door just 
           fifteen feet away. The two shift their weight, starting to 
           get up, attempting to make a run for it--

           Braddock notices. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Don’t fucking move!

           Max and Madeline stop. Braddock finishes conferring with his 
           men, then comes back to Madeline, Max and Sandra.

           He goes into his inside pocket and removes a handkerchief. He 
           quickly wipes down his gun. He turns back to Madeline. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Give me your right hand. 
           Madeline, confused, as Braddock grabs her right hand. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Give me your hand!

           Madeline struggles to free herself, but the much bigger man 
           over powers her. He puts the gun in her hand, makes sure her 
           prints are all over it. 

           Braddock gets the gun back from her. McCabe steps up with a 
           plastic zip lock bag, and Braddock drops the gun inside. 

           He turns back to Madeline, Max and Sandra. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        I want you out of the city. You 
                        come back and that gun goes 
                        straight to the NYPD. I will use 
                        every connection we have to make 
                        sure you get a murder rap. You 
                        leave today. 

           Madeline, Max and Sandra all stand up, warily. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        But, before you leave you give all 
                        the money back. 

                                 MADELINE
                        To who? Look, Tom is dead. That is 
                        a terrible tragedy. But, you and 
                        your men are very much alive. I can 
                        make it up to you. All of you. I 
                        can make amends--

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Stop talking! That is the problem 
                        with you people! You can never just 
                        shut the fuck up! 

           Braddock turns to her, filling up again with rage. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        You’re giving the money back to the 
                        Hobbes Foundation. You’re turning 
                        it all over. That money is going to 
                        do good. That’s what’s going to 
                        happen. It gets done today or so 
                        help me God, I will see to it that 
                        you rot away in prison for the rest 
                        of your miserable life. 
           EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - BUILDING - DAY

           A NUMBER OF SUBURBANS pull up outside of a BUILDING. Braddock 
           steps out of the passenger side and opens a back door, 
           revealing Madeline, Max and Sandra in the back seat. 

           He motions to Madeline to step out of the car and she does. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Get it done. 

           She nods, still shaking, and heads for the building. 

           INT. LAW FIRM - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A large and active law firm. David steps into the waiting 
           room, spotting Madeline. 

                                 DAVID
                        Madeline, hello, is everything 
                        alright?

                                 MADELINE
                        Yes. I want to talk to you about 
                        transferring my inheritance. 

                                 DAVID
                        Transferring?

                                 MADELINE
                        Yes. To The Hobbes Foundation. 

                                 DAVID
                        It was your husband’s wish that you 
                        receive it, Madeline. It’s yours.  

                                 MADELINE
                        And it’s my wish that it goes to 
                        the foundation. I need it done 
                        today.

                                 DAVID
                        I... I don’t understand. What 
                        you’re asking is not a simple task, 
                        there are tax implications and--

                                 MADELINE
                        Just do it. Now. 

           David is taken back, looking at Madeline who stands there 
           with a forced smile. 
                                 DAVID
                        Sometimes, when we experience a 
                        loss, we feel guilt. And that guilt 
                        can manifest itself in a number of 
                        ways. Perhaps, you should take a 
                        moment and speak to someone. A 
                        trusted confidant or a therapist. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I need you to do this, David. I 
                        need it done as soon as possible. 

           David regards her again, skeptical. 

                                 DAVID
                        Madeline, are you under duress?

                                 MADELINE
                        Duress?

                                 DAVID
                        You can tell me if something has 
                        happened. If there are extenuating 
                        circumstances. I can help you. 
                        Whatever it is. 

           David sees Madeline wavering, he keeps going.  

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        We are your lawyers. We are here no 
                        matter what. Look around you. You 
                        have all this at your disposal. 

           Madeline takes this in, she opens her mouth, when:

                                 BRADDOCK  (O.S.)
                        David?

           David and Madeline look behind them and spot Braddock. 

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, Pat, are we meeting today?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I’m just in the neighborhood and 
                        wanted to ask you about something. 

                                 DAVID
                        Have a seat. I’ll be with you 
                        momentarily. 

           David turns back to Madeline, but the spell is broken.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        So, Madeline, is there something 
                        you need to tell me?

                                 MADELINE
                        You’re my lawyer?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes. 

                                 MADELINE
                        And you want to continue being my 
                        lawyer? 

                                 DAVID
                        Of course. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Then do what I say. Transfer the 
                        money. Every last dime. 

           INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           Madeline sits at a long conference table, surrounded by PILES 
           OF PAPERS. She begins to sign.

           She looks up. Through the glass partition she can see 
           Braddock, smiling and joking around with David. 

           As if sensing her looking at him, Braddock looks back at her. 
           He’s no longer smiling. He looks ready to kill her. 

           Madeline goes back to signing the papers. 

           EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - BUILDING - NIGHT

           Braddock and Madeline exit the building and step up to the 
           awaiting Suburban. Braddock opens the back door, as Madeline, 
           defeated, wordlessly gets in the back. 

           INT. SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS

           Braddock gets into the passenger seat. Madeline, Max and 
           Sandra are all squeezed into the back. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Now what?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Now you get the fuck out of my 
                        city. 
           EXT. JFK AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The Suburban parks in front of the airport. Madeline, Max and 
           Sandra step out of the Suburban. Braddock also exits, removes 
           PLANE TICKETS and distributes them. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Next flight out is to Oklahoma 
                        City. It’s the Nine O’clock.

           Braddock LOOKS AT HIS WATCH. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Forty minutes to take off. Make 
                        sure you’re on when it departs. 
                        We’ll be watching. 

           The three of them take the tickets and head inside. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Madeline, Max and Sandra walk down the aisle, and find their 
           seats. Madeline and Sandra are both in a daze. But, Max is 
           starting to regain his composure. Madeline just sits there.  

                                 MAX
                        It’s all gonna be okay, I promise. 
                        It’s the two of us again. We’re 
                        gonna be fine. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I just gave up hundreds of millions 
                        of dollars. It doesn’t feel fine. 

                                 MAX
                        We’ll line up new scores. We’ll 
                        start over. 

                                 MADELINE
                        I don’t want to start over. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Did you see all that blood? 

           They look at Sandra, as if remembering she’s there. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        There was all that blood and you’re 
                        still talking about money. How can 
                        you people just do what you do over 
                        and over again, not caring?  
                                 MAX
                        What did I tell you? You can’t 
                        cheat an honest man. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Tom was honest. He was honest and 
                        we killed him. We killed him.

                                 MADELINE
                        Keep it together. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m going to be sick. 

           Sandra stands and heads for BATHROOMS. They watch her go. 

                                 MADELINE
                        We gotta get rid of her. 

                                 MAX
                        We’ll ditch her when we land.

           Max checks his watch. Madeline watches him do this, her mind 
           working, then a look of horror crosses her face. 

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        We’ll get there around midnight. We 
                        spend the night at OKC and regroup. 
                        I got some money set aside. We’ll 
                        be okay for a while. 
                             (then)
                        Everything’s going to be okay. It’s 
                        you and me, baby, it’s you and me.  

           Madeline just keeps staring at him, he notices.

                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 MADELINE
                        Don’t trust anyone. 

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 MADELINE
                        You’re behind this. 

                                 MAX
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MADELINE
                        But... I don’t understand. Why?
                                 MAX
                        Madeline...?

                                 MADELINE
                        You fucked me. You fucked me! 

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. 

                                 MADELINE
                        Your watch. Your bullshit watch! 

                                 MAX
                        Yeah?

                                 MADELINE
                        Braddock had the same one.

           INSERT QUICK FLASH: Braddock, curb side, checking the time. 
           Sure enough, it’s the same one Max has. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        You fucked me. I’ll kill you. I’ll 
                        fucking end you! 

           Madeline starts to attack Max, punching him. 

                                 MAX
                        Listen to me. Listen to me. 

                                 MADELINE
                        You told me you would blow it all 
                        up and you did. You destroyed me. 

                                 MAX
                        Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! I had 
                        nothing to do with this! 

           They both stop for a beat, minds working and then they crane 
           their head towards... SANDRA’S EMPTY SEAT. 

           Madeline is on her feet, sprinting down the aisle. A 
           STEWARDESS tries to stop her. 

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Ma’am, please sit down, we’re about 
                        to take off--

           But Madeline shoves her aside and keeps running to the back 
           until she gets to the bathrooms. There are two. She swings 
           one open and it’s empty. 

           She turns to the next, it’s locked. Madeline BANGS on it.
                                 MADELINE
                        Sandra! Sandra! Sandra! 

           She keeps banging, and then the door opens: A MIDDLE AGE 
           ASIAN WOMAN, who just stares at her confused. 

                                 MADELINE (CONT'D)
                        No! No! Sandra! SANDRA! 

           INT. STORIES - NIGHT

           We’re back inside the bookstore. Sandra sits with Braddock 
           and the rest of his crew. Gone are the dark suits, replaced 
           by HAWAIIAN SHIRTS and KHAKIS.

           They’re all celebrating, drinking CHAMPAGNE. Music plays. 

                                 TIPSY (O.S.)
                        WHERE’S MY MONEY?!

           The look over. Tipsy’s just entered. They all laugh as he 
           walks in. Everyone is in good spirits. Sandra removes a bag. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Here’s your money. 

           She begins to take out large ENVELOPS and doles them out. 
           Tipsy looks at his cut. 

                                 TIPSY
                        Not bad, little lady, Max taught 
                        you well. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I’m off to Rhode Island on a land 
                        deal. I could use someone like you. 
                        You got a real future. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Sorry, Goldie. I’m done. 

                                 TIPSY
                        I’ve heard that before. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Well, here’s to you hearing it 
                        again. I’m done.

           She lifts her glass, they all cheers and drink.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Okay. Time to get out of Dodge. 
           One by one everyone files out of the bookstore. Sandra 
           watches them all leave. Then a door in the back opens and Tom 
           exits a bathroom. He’s clearly very much alive.

           He’s washed his hair, cleaned himself off and drying off with 
           a towel. Suddenly he and Sandra are very much alone. 

                                 TOM
                        It took forever to wash that all 
                        out. Did everyone go?

                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah. They all thought it would be 
                        better to leave town. I guess, 
                        that’s what you do. 

                                 TOM
                        I see. Did you get your cut?

           Sandra takes out one last envelope from the bag. Pockets it. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I should go. 

                                 TOM
                        Thank you. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You’re thanking me? I got 
                        everything taken from you. 

                                 TOM
                        You also got it all back. 

           Sandra takes this in. She starts to turn, when Tom says:

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        So, there’s this great little 
                        Vietnamese restaurant on Mott 
                        street. If you’re not doing 
                        anything later, dinner’s on me. 

           Sandra takes this in. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I thought you’d never ask. 

           And with that, we... 

           CUT TO BLACK
