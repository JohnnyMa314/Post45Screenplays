          Note To Reader:

          There will be certain moments of this script where we 
          experience a heightened sense of reality due to the 
          influence of Marijuana. These moments will be italicized 
          and written in dark green ink.

          In moments where we are experiencing this influenced 
          reality, envision these scenes with a faster pace, amplified 
          level of anxiety, and more visibly flushed aesthetic... 
          Kinda like as if it's gone through the Gingham filter on 
          Instagram.

          It will appear as an entirely different world for our 
          characters to explore and embark upon.
           MUSIC CUE: “FIRE BURNING” BY SEAN KINGSTON

                                                                 OPEN ON:

           EXT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - DAY

           CHYRON: 2009

           We look out at the beautiful exterior of the Washington 
           Catholic Academy-- the landmark of educated excellence in 
           the suburban D.C. area. I hear the Obama girls go there!

           We push in toward the school, transitioning through the 
           school’s second floor window, and into--

           INT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - HALLWAY - DAY

           Quiet, pristine and adorned in the school’s Blue and Gold 
           color scheme. Everything down to the imperial texture 
           flooring looks like it was hosed with a pressure washer.

           The BELL RINGS, and the classroom doors swing open in a 
           frenzy. Flooding the halls are the preppy co-ed STUDENTS 
           of the Washington Catholic Academy-- blonde, white, perky 
           and all dressed in their mandated Blue and Gold uniforms.

           We forage through the hallway, watching students play 
           pick-up basketball, flirt by lockers and take selfies.

           At the end of the hallway rests a stained glass window of 
           St. Francis. We pass through the window, and onto--

           EXT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - DAY

           Various playing fields, trimmed to perfection. Looking 
           outward, we lock onto a shed in the distance, not far 
           behind the school’s MLB regulated baseball diamond. 

           We slowly push in on the shed.

                                 NATE (O.S.)
                        How can you feel bad for Sasuke? 
                        He tried to kill his own brother!

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        Only because Itachi was murdering 
                        every member of the Uchiha clan!

                                 WYATT (O.S.)
                        Can you two boners shut the fuck 
                        up already and pay attention?
           INT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - TOOL SHED - DAY

           The school’s baseball utility shed. It’s been repurposed 
           into a make-shift man cave, full of posters of super 
           models, refurbished furniture, and empty pizza boxes.

           Resting on couches are NATE YAACOBI (15) and KYLE YAACOBI 
           (12). They sit in filth, eating pizza and playing cards.

           The boys put down their cards and turn to WYATT YAACOBI 
           (16), sitting in a chair as he packs a matte gold bong. A 
           Barack Obama “Hope” sticker is plastered onto the bong.

                                 WYATT
                        Now, feast your eyes on me. As I, 
                        Wyatt Yaacobi, boldly travel where 
                        no Mashugina has gone before!

           Nate smirks, grabbing a lighter as he walks toward Wyatt.

                                 NATE
                        I’d like to see you come back to 
                        Earth after this hit.

           Nate hangs the lighter over the packed bong. Wyatt 
           prepares to inhale, cupping his lips to the bong.

                                 NATE
                        Here we go, Wy. In Five! Four! 
                        Three... Two... One! Blastoff!

           Time slows down, along with our Sean Kingston ballad, as 
           Nate strikes down on the spark wheel, igniting a flame.

           The flame burns the weed-packed bong. Wyatt inhales. 
           Smoke rushes up the bong’s shaft, through the empowering 
           blue and red Obama sticker, as it enters Wyatt’s mouth.

           Time comes back to normal as Wyatt takes a beat to 
           process the hit. He then begins to cough up a fit.

                                 WYATT
                        Wat-- Wat-- get me some--

           Nate drops the lighter, looking for water, and spotting 
           an ARIZONA ICED TEA next to Kyle. He motions for it.

           Kyle grabs the iced tea can and tosses it. Nate catches 
           it and turns to Wyatt. He prepares to toss the can, as--

           The toolshed doors open, revealing a SCHOOL NUN (mid-60s) 
           just as surprised to see the boys as they are to see her. 

           All caught by surprise, the room stands still in silence.
                                 NATE
                             (then)
                        Run!

           Nate drops the can and books it to the toolshed door. 
           Kyle quickly jumps up and runs along with Nate.

           Wyatt, struggling to catch his breath, slowly follows 
           suit. The Nun tries to grab him, but Wyatt stealthily 
           dodges her as he escapes out of the toolshed door.

           EXT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - TOOLSHED - DAY

           Nate grabs a skateboard resting on the side of the shed 
           and runs toward the road. Kyle and Wyatt, not far behind 
           Nate, grab their boards and join him.

           Off Wyatt’s cross, the Nun exits the shed, scurrying over 
           to a golf cart nearby. She starts the cart and floors the 
           gas, charging full speed toward the boys.

           EXT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - DAY

           The boys drop their boards on the asphalt and skate away. 
           Gaining ground in her golf cart, the Nun jumps the 
           medium, picking up air as she bulldozes toward the boys.

           Kyle, worried, turns and watches as the Nun nears.

                                 NATE (O.S.)
                        Come on, Man!

           Losing ground, Kyle closes his eyes, kicking hard against 
           the asphalt to propel himself toward Nate and Wyatt.

           As Kyle focuses ahead, Wyatt leans forward on his board, 
           reaching for a silver dollar on the ground ahead of him. 

           Leaning too far, Wyatt capsizes, eating asphalt as he 
           falls off his board. The Nun stops her cart, approaching.

           Kyle turns as he passes, watching as the Nun steps out of 
           her cart and over to Wyatt. A grimace on his face, Kyle 
           turns back toward Nate. The two cross, skating away.

           EXT. BALTIMORE BWI TRAIN STATION - SUNSET

           Trains move in and out of the quiet station. Nate and 
           Kyle sit atop an overhead medium, watching trains below 
           their feet. Nate lights a joint. He turns to Kyle.
                                 KYLE
                             (re: hit)
                        I’m okay. Thanks.

           Kyle turns away, looking out in the distance. Nate takes 
           a hit, joining Kyle as they watch the sunset.

                                 WYATT (O.S.)
                             (then, yelling out)
                        Hey dick faces!

           Nate and Kyle turn to the sound of the voice, spotting 
           Wyatt, aggressively rattling the station’s wire fence.

                                 NATE
                        Wow. Mother Fitzgerald let you go 
                        early this time.

                                 WYATT
                        Yeah. On good behavior. After I 
                        banged her in the sacristy!

           A beat, then Nate and Kyle break into laughter. They 
           laugh hysterically as they sit. Wyatt looks back angrily.

           A train approaches the station. The sound of its horn 
           gets louder and louder as it nears.

                                 NATE
                        Wyatt fucked a Nun. Wyatt fucked a-

           The noise of the train’s HORN encapsulates the screen.

                                                             CUT TO BLACK:
           CUE TITLE: YOM KIPPUR

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - KYLE’S ROOM - DAY

           An ALARM goes off, waking Kyle up. Visibly older and more 
           distraught, Kyle gets up, forcing himself out of bed.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

           CHYRON: 2012

           A packed BUS. Kyle sits by himself with his earphones on. 

           STUDENTS chat around him-- but we don’t hear them. 
           Instead, we hear an action packed scene of NARUTO as it 
           plays on Kyle’s phone.

           Kyle, glued to his screen, watches the battle scene play.
           INT. SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER CLASSROOM - DAY

           Kyle writes organized bullet points onto his notebook.

           JACOB BOGAGE (18, chubby) stands at an overhead 
           projector. The projection reads, “Marketing 101.”

                                 BOGAGE
                        With September’s issue two weeks 
                        away, I wanted to discuss 
                        strategies we could implement for 
                        marketing our new issue.
                             (then, with disdain)
                        Yes, Tony Kang?

           TONY KANG (18), a stoner-type Hypebeast, sits at the back 
           of the class with his hand raised.

                                 TONY
                        Okay so hear me out. I’m hosting a 
                        rager at my place tomorrow night.
                             (sotto, to class)
                        Come through.
                             (then, to Jacob)
                        I’m thinking it would be dope to 
                        have newspaper ambassadors there 
                        to give out copies of the paper.

           The STUDENTS turn away from Bogage as they look to Tony.

                                 BOGAGE
                        We’re a school-run newspaper, 
                        Tony. I don’t know how that would 
                        be acceptable in any capacity.

                                 TONY
                        Look. All I’m saying is, if we had 
                        someone to hype up The Warrior, 
                        maybe more kids would actually 
                        read the shit we work on.

           Jacob, speechless, stares for a beat as the bell rings. 
           Students gather their belongings and rush for the door.

                                 TONY
                             (as he packs his bags)
                        Oh, by the way. For anyone coming 
                        through tomorrow, there’s a five-
                        dollar cover for food and alc.
                             (then, as he leaves)
                        Skooooo--

           Kyle, slowly packing up his belongings at his seat, looks 
           to Jacob, noting the visible frustration on his face.
           INT. SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER CLASSROOM - LATER

           The room now empty, Bogage and Kyle chat one-on-one.

                                 BOGAGE
                        Only one Sophomore has ever held 
                        the title of beat writer on the 
                        Warrior Newspaper before you came 
                        around. You know that, right?

                                 KYLE
                        Yes I do. And I’m thankful for the 
                        opportunity.

                                 BOGAGE
                        Kyle, we publish in two weeks and 
                        you still don’t have a story. Is 
                        this job not important to you, or--

                                 KYLE
                        No, no. I love this job. It’s--
                             (then, composing himself)
                        Look, I promise I’ll get you an A+ 
                        story before we publish. I’m just 
                        a little behind. I’m sorry.

           Bogage stands and scowls softly at Kyle.

                                 BOGAGE
                        Okay. Well, we got the holiday 
                        starting tomorrow evening. Can I 
                        expect a draft from you Thursday?

                                 KYLE
                        Consider it done. Again, sorry ab--

                                 BOGAGE
                        Don’t. It’s a learning curve.
                             (then, turning serious)
                        Just make sure you have the thing 
                        by Thursday. Or I will have to 
                        fire you. Just so you know.

           Bogage laughs, easing the tension as he pats Kyle on the 
           back-- knocking the wind out of Kyle in the process.

           EXT. JAMAL’S HOUSE - DAY

           We open on a basketball SWISHING into a driveway hoop.

           Crossing into frame, and after his ball, is JAMAL JACKSON 
           (17). Jamal passes the ball to Nate. Now 18 years old, 
           Nate has grown a lot since we saw him last.
                                 JAMAL
                        Okay, how about Allie Hughes?

                                 NATE
                        Ah, that’s a no from me dog.

           Kyle sits against the garage door with a TI-83 calculator 
           on his lap, doing his homework as Nate and Jamal play.

                                 JAMAL
                        Okay, okay. Amy Ginsberg.

           Nate laughs, messing up his shot in the process.

                                 NATE
                        Yes. Yes I have.
                             (then)
                        That was fucked up, Jamal. You 
                        messed up my shot.

                                 JAMAL
                        Ha! That’s what you get. Staring 
                        at some big ole Amy bitties.

           Kyle puts his work down, chiming into the conversation.

                                 KYLE
                        What are ya’ll talking about?

           Nate and Jamal turn to Kyle, directing their game at him.

                                 JAMAL
                        We’re talking about the girls we 
                        jerk it to.

                                 NATE
                        But you wouldn’t know anything 
                        bout that cuz you got a baby dick.

                                 JAMAL
                             (laughing at Kyle)
                        This man just said you can’t jerk 
                        because your dick too small, Fam.

           Kyle puts his books down and quickly stands up.

                                 KYLE
                        Fuck you both. Let me play.

           A solid beat as Nate and Jamal encourage it.

                                 JAMAL
                        Nate, your brother a freak!
                                 NATE
                        He’s not a freak. He just wants to 
                        fit in.

                                 KYLE
                        What if I want to be a freak?

           A beat as Jamal and Nate contain their laughter, then--

                                 NATE
                        Okay, fine. Then tell us Kyle. How 
                        many girls have you jerked to?

           Kyle thinks, taking his time to contemplate his answer.

                                 KYLE
                        Twenty!

           A short beat as Nate and Jamal absorb the comment, then--

                                 JAMAL
                        Giggity Giggity! Nate your brother 
                        the jerking king. The Iron Fist!

           Nate falls to the ground laughing as Jamal begins to 
           parade around the driveway. Kyle looks back in confusion.

                                 JAMAL (O.S.)
                        Ky a freak! Ky a freak! Ky a--

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - KYLE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kyle sits at a desk, typing a story onto his laptop. As 
           he types, Kyle’s mind begins to visibly drift.

           Mentally distracted, Kyle scrolls over to Google Chrome. 
           He hits Shift Command D, opening an incognito tab.

           Kyle scrolls to the search bar, typing, “How to Jerk”. A 
           menu of suggested searches pop up: “How to Jerk Turkey”. 
           “How to be a Jerk”. “How to Jerk (Dance)”. Kyle clicks.

           A YouTube video appears on Kyle’s screen. A DANCER, 
           standing in front of a white backdrop, speaks to camera. 
           Kyle drags the ticker along to the middle of the video.

                                 DANCER
                        One popular dance to showcase your 
                        stuff is the West Coast dance 
                        craze, the Jerk! Follow these ten 
                        steps to become a Jerk king today.
           Kyle watches carefully. He begins to jot down notes.

           INT. SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Students organize themselves into rows, sitting and 
           talking amongst themselves as MR. FOSTER calls roll.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Santiago? Webber? Weeks?... Weeks?

           Kyle, in the far back corner of the row, sits by himself, 
           minding his own business as Mr. Foster continues.

                                 MR. FOSTER (O.S.)
                        Xiong?

           Kyle turns, catching a glance at MEGGIE XIONG. He smiles, 
           infatuated with her beauty as she raises her hand. Stuck 
           in a trance, Kyle ignores Mr. Foster as he call his name.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Great. Okay, let’s get into pairs 
                        and do some warm-ups. Boys with 
                        boys, girls with girls. And, go.

           STUDENTS stand and form pairs. A student crosses Kyle’s 
           eye line to Meggie, snapping him into reality. He stands.

           Meggie gets up. Panning around, she notices the majority 
           of class already in pairs.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Okay, anyone not have a partner?

           Kyle and Meggie stop their search. Standing on opposite 
           sides of the gymnasium, they both raise their hands.

                                 MR. FOSTER 
                        Ah, damnit, you two! Didn’t I say 
                        boys with boys, girls with girls?
                             (then, with a heavy sigh)
                        Well, fine. Just no funny business 
                        now, ya hear?

           Kyle and Meggie turn to each other.

           INT. SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - Kyle and Meggie do arm stretches, warming up together.
           - Meggie does Squats. Kyle holds her hands for support.

           - Kyle and Meggie do reach-and-touch planks together.

           - Kyle does Squats. Meggie holds his hands for support.

           - Kyle does sit-ups. Meggie’s shoes hold his feet down.

           - Meggie does sit-ups. Kyle’s shoes hold her feet down.

           Meggie crunches up from the ground, her head landing 
           within Kyle’s crotch area with each successful sit-up.

           Kyle stares at Meggie, his gaze glued to her as she does 
           each sit-up. Her face landing right beside his crotch. 
           Kyle, fixated on Meggie, puts on a big, elated smile, as--

                                 GYM STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Holy shit! Look at that kid’s 
                        boner!

           Kyle quickly snaps out of his gaze. He turns his head 
           toward the voice, spotting THE ENTIRE CLASS opposite him, 
           staring down at his giant gym shorts boner.

                                 STUDENTS
                        Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!

           Mr. Foster shakes his head.

                                 MR. FOSTER 
                        Damnit, kid! Know how much trouble 
                        your boner’s gonna get us in!

           Mr. Foster crosses, frustratedly leaving the scene as 
           students continue to laugh and take videos.

           Kyle, face red, covers his boner. He nervously looks over 
           to Meggie. Meggie grabs her stuff and quickly stands up.

                                 MEGGIE
                             (making nothing of it)
                        It’s fine. Really. You don’t have 
                        to worry about it.

           Meggie quickly walks away toward the girl’s locker room. 
           Kyle, head down, stands to himself for a beat. Students 
           continue to snap pics and laugh in the background.

           INT. NATE’S CAR - DAY

           Nate sits in the driver’s seat, cruising around in the 
           family’s comfortable Toyota Prius. Kyle sits shotgun.
                                 NATE
                        Why didn’t you tuck your boner in 
                        your waistband?

                                 KYLE
                        My shirt wasn’t long enough. I 
                        would’ve had pre-exposed dick.

                                 NATE
                        Hmm. I see. Yeah, that’s no good.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, anxiously)
                        Fuck me. I’m gonna be known as 
                        “Boner in Gym Class Kid” for the 
                        rest of my life.
                             (nervously ranting)
                        I have three fucking days to write 
                        an article for the paper. Now I 
                        got this boner shit in my face.

                                 NATE
                        Look. This isn’t gonna become your 
                        legacy, Kyle. This is high school. 
                        So much happens in a given day.
                             (then)
                        Remember Heather? That girl’s 16 
                        and has a baby! It’s all we talked 
                        about an entire summer.

                                 KYLE
                        A whole trimester.

                                 NATE
                        But then something else happened 
                        and people forgot about it.
                             (then)
                        People forgot about Heather’s 
                        baby. And they’ll forget about 
                        your boner in gym class.

                                 KYLE
                        You better be right.

                                 NATE
                        You’re way too uptight, Man.
                             (then)
                        Open the glove compartment.

           Kyle turns and pulls the glove compartment handle down.

           The glove compartment light shines down on a beautifully 
           packed pre-rolled joint. It’s so dank and pristine, you 
           can smell it through the screen.
                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        You could use this more than me.

           Kyle pauses, staring at the joint for a beat.

           EXT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Kyle and Nate walk to the door, then turn to one another.

                                 KYLE
                             (paranoid, nervous)
                        Okay, how do I look?

                                 NATE
                        Like a little bitch.

           Nate chuckles to himself. Kyle angrily shakes his head.

                                 NATE
                             (off Kyle’s frustration)
                        But, in all actuality I’m really 
                        not sure. I’m too high to tell.

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - DAY

           Nate and Kyle leisurely enter the house, leaving their 
           shoes at the front door as they walk up the staircase.

                                 KATH (O.S.)
                             (from afar)
                        Look at that. The boys are home!

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The boys turn, spotting KATH YAACOBI, the boys’ mother. 
           She sits on a nice chair, drinking wine with DON YAACOBI.

                                 DON
                        Happy Yom Kippur, Boys. Come join 
                        us. We have guests!

           Peaking out from the kitchen and walking into the living 
           room with a wine glass of her own is RINA YAACOBI. 

                             NATE
                                                          KYLE
           Fuck, why...
                                              Please no...

                                 RINA
                        Oh my gosh look at you two! Get 
                        over here and give me a hug!
           Nate and Kyle reluctantly walk down from the staircase 
           and into the living room. Rina brings them in for a hug.

                                 RINA
                        Look at you handsome young men.

                             NATE
                                                          KYLE
                    (squished)
                                                 (squished)
           Thanks, Aunt Rina.
                                              Thank you, Aunt Rina.

           Rina swings the boys back and forth within her hug.

                                 WYATT (O.S.)
                        Holy Shit!

           Nate and Kyle turn toward the sound of the voice, 
           spotting WYATT YAACOBI (19), walking in from the kitchen. 
           Wyatt excitedly joins the boys in the living room.

                                 WYATT
                        What the frick is up, Cuzzos?

           The boys stare at Wyatt, feeling almost sorry for him.

                                 NATE
                        ...Sup Wyatt.

                                 WYATT
                        Oh you know, just sleeping in the 
                        AM, partying in the PM. You feel?
                             (then, impressed)
                        I saw that video of you getting a 
                        boner, Kyle! That’s what’s up.

                                 KYLE
                             (nervously, re: video)
                        There’s a video?

           Wyatt reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone. He 
           fidgets with his phone, typing into a browser search bar.

                                 WYATT
                        Dude, it’s blowing up. Had forty-k 
                        views when I saw last. Watch!
                             (then)
                        Y’all have Wifi, or--?

                                 KYLE
                        It only happened two hours ago.

                                 WYATT
                        Wow. In today’s day and age of 
                        virality, I’d consider that a 
                        critical success. Congrats, Ky.
           The video plays on Wyatt’s phone. He shows the boys.

           INSERT PHONE: We watch a low-quality, shaky phone video 
           of the scene in the gymnasium. The video is titled: 
           “Twink Gets Big Boner in Gym Class.” The video, in all of 
           it’s 480p goodness, catches a profile shot of Kyle’s 
           large pants boner.

                                 WYATT (O.S.)
                        I mean, look. It’s got it all. 
                        Great title. Sex appeal.

           We watch the continuation of the scene. Meggie runs away. 
           Kyle sits on the ground by himself. He covers his head.

                                 WYATT (O.S.)
                        And lots of self deprecation.
                             (as Kyle cries in video)
                        This is actually where I turned it 
                        off last time. Got kind of sad...

                                 NATE
                        I think he knows what happened Wy.

           Nate pushes Wyatt. Wyatt recoils, putting his phone away.

                                 WYATT
                        You’re both seeing this all wrong. 
                        You’re about to be the talk of the 
                        town, Ky! You should be excited.

           Kyle nods along nervously-- his head drops dramatically.

                                 WYATT (CONT'D)
                        Plus, you got yourself a good 
                        sized dick. This here would be a 
                        very different conversation if you 
                        had a small dick... So, good thing 
                        all of us have big dicks, right?
                             (then, nervously)
                        Because, like, if one of us had a 
                        small dick, that would like, 
                        totally be fucked!

                                 RINA (O.S.)
                        Language, Wyatt!

           Wyatt stops in place, angrily looking up to the ceiling.

                                 WYATT
                        Sorry, Mom.
                             (then, yelling out)
                        Fuck!
           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - DINNER TABLE - SUNSET

           Kyle, Nate, Wyatt, Kath, Don, Rina and JED YAACOBI, 
           Wyatt’s politically incorrect father, all sit together.

           Amongst the table, Kath and Rita gossip, Wyatt builds a 
           Meat Monster out of Gefilte Fish, Nate peacefully chews 
           on Noodle Kugel, and Jed and Don fight over Nova Lox.

           DIANNA YAACOBI (80s), the boys’ Grandmother, sits at the 
           end of the table. Overwhelmed by the nonsense around her, 
           Dianna turns to Kyle, who pokes his food with his fork.

                                 DIANNA
                        Little one. What’s new with you? 
                        Any fun going on in your life?

                                 KYLE
                             (in a paranoid high)
                        Uh. I don’t know. Nothing really.

           Kath, speaking up, turns to Dianna.

                                 KATH
                        Kyle just got a job on the school 
                        paper! He’s too shy to admit it.

                                 DIANNA
                        The youngest Yaacobi got a job?

           Kyle turns to Nate for support. Nate nods to himself, 
           mindlessly digging into his food. Kyle turns back.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, there’s no actual money in 
                        it, Nanni. It’s more just a title--

                                 DIANNA
                        Well, that’s a lot of fun, indeed! 
                        You went out, with no help from 
                        anyone, and got yourself a job.

           Dianna turns, staring down Jed at the end of the table.          

                                 DIANNA
                        I think some people at this table 
                        should take note of that!

           Jed breaks from his fight for Nova Lox, turning to Kyle. 
           He grows larger and larger as spit spews from his mouth.

                                 JED
                        Well, I think you’re brainwashed.
                        You and your socialist propaganda.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JED (CONT'D)
                        You’re spreading lies and hate to 
                        all of your lizard-scaled friends.

           Jed angrily glares at Kyle. Kath gets up from her seat, 
           breaking the silence as she walks toward the fridge.

                                 KATH
                        Uh-- who wants dessert? We grabbed 
                        treats from PJs on the way home...

           As Kath pardons herself from the table, Jed gives Kyle an 
           “I’m watching you” gesture. Kyle slides back in his seat.

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - KYLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kyle sits at his desk, typing his story into a now 
           paragraph-long Microsoft Word document.

           A loud knock at the door interrupts Kyle’s rhythm.

                                 KYLE
                        Go away. I’m working.

           The door opens, revealing Nate at the other end.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        What do you want?

                                 NATE
                        Don’t let him bug you. He’s just 
                        jealous you’re Nanni’s favorite.

                                 KYLE
                        Honestly, he can have it. I really 
                        don’t care. This family is stupid.

                                 NATE
                        I’m not going to argue with that.
                             (then, with a sigh)
                        I’m gonna hit up Tony’s house 
                        party for a bit. Why don’t you 
                        come along? It could be fun.

                                 KYLE
                        No. I have to work on my paper.

           Kyle turns, ignoring Nate as he goes back to typing.

                                 NATE
                        Come on. I just can’t stand seeing 
                        you sit here all sad-like.
                                 KYLE
                        I’m not sad. I’m writing. This is 
                        what I like! Do you not get it?

                                 NATE
                        Okay, what if I told you Meggie’s 
                        gonna be there?

                                 KYLE
                        Don’t you think I’ve embarrassed 
                        myself enough for one day?

                                 NATE
                        I don’t know. Tony’s parties are 
                        super chill. Maybe this could be a 
                        chance to fix things up?

           Kyle thinks a beat, then turns back, closing his laptop.

                                 KYLE
                        You really think so?

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jed lays a series of letters down onto a Scrabble board.

                                 JED
                        I-E-R. Sommelier. Plus a triple 
                        letter on L. Fifteen. Beat that!

                                 DON
                        I call bull. That’s not a word.

           While Jed and Don argue in the living room, Nate and Kyle 
           surreptitiously walk down the staircase. Kath looks away 
           from the game, spotting Nate and Kyle at the front door.

                                 KATH
                        Where are you two headed?

           Nate and Kyle quickly turn away from the doorknob and 
           toward the living room. Anxiety seeps from their pores.

                                 NATE
                        Oh, um. Well, you know. We were...
                             (a beat, then)
                        About to go to the girl’s 
                        volleyball game! Kyle’s thinking 
                        about writing an article about the 
                        team, so I’m giving him a ride.

           Nate, garbling out his fib, smiles back to the family. 
           Kath stares back, taking a beat to inspect his sincerity.
                                 KATH
                        Okay. Have fun. Just remember, 
                        there’s synagogue tomorrow. Nanni 
                        wants to sit with you--

                                 WYATT
                             (interrupting)
                        Oh shit! A girl’s volleyball game? 
                        I love girl’s volleyball! Know 
                        what I mean? With the bounce 
                        bounce, and the ba-donk-a-donk?
                             (then, excitedly)
                        Can I come with you?

           Nate and Kyle sigh.

                                 NATE
                        I’m pretty sure anyone with a 
                        police record isn’t allowed--

                                 KATH
                        Come on you two. Take your cousin 
                        with you to the volleyball game.

                                 NATE
                        Mom. He’s nineteen and makes 
                        creepy remarks about high 
                        schooler’s butts. No!

           Kath gets up from her seat.

                                 KATH
                        Take your cousin along to the 
                        game, or all three of you are 
                        staying in and playing Scrabble.

           Nate and Kyle frustratedly sigh as we--

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. NATE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Nate drives. Kyle sits shotgun. They both look visibly 
           frustrated as Wyatt, sitting in the back, rambles on.

                                 WYATT
                        All I’m saying is, if this Kony 
                        guy is truly bad news, why don’t 
                        we shoot a bomb into Africa 
                        tomorrow and kill him?

           Nate grinds his teeth in frustration.
                                 NATE
                        Please stop talking, Man.

                                 WYATT
                        But, like, know what I mean? Just 
                        send over some NAVY seals. Some 
                        Marines. Couple Task Force 141 
                        motherfuckers. And take out Kony 
                        and his African Kid militia like--

           Wyatt snaps his fingers. Nate turns to the backseat.

                                 NATE
                        You are so fucking stupid, Wyatt! 
                        Just shut the fuck up.

           The car goes silent. Wyatt sits quietly in his seat. Nate 
           turns back around, focusing on the road.

                                 WYATT
                             (then, quietly)
                        You’re the stupid one.

                                 NATE
                        What did you just say?

                                 WYATT
                        Shutting the fuck up and stopping 
                        talking are the same things. So 
                        how can I do both?... Stupid.

           Nate angrily scowls. He ignores Wyatt, shaking his head 
           as he continues to drive. Wyatt looks out the window, 
           spotting that Nate’s car is now driving past the school.

                                 WYATT
                        Oh, and lookie that. Strike number 
                        two. You just passed the school. 
                        Now we’ll be late to the game 
                        because of you and your stupid.

           A quiet beat between the boys, Nate turns to Kyle. They 
           both shrug to one another.

           Nate pulls the car over to the side of the road. He turns 
           on his hazard lights, then turns to Wyatt.

                                 NATE
                        Listen, Wy. We aren’t going to 
                        school. We’re going to Tony Kang’s 
                        house party down the street.

           Wyatt jumps up awkwardly from his seat. He gets tangled 
           in his seatbelt in the process.
                                 WYATT
                        Fuck yeah! A high school party!? I 
                        can’t wait to pick up some chicks--

                                 NATE
                             (interrupting)
                        But, we need to go through some 
                        ground rules first. You agree to 
                        the rules, or no party. Kapeesh?

           Wyatt, inspecting Kyle’s outfit, interrupts Nate.

                                 WYATT
                        You’re planning to go to a party 
                        like that? You look like you’ve 
                        been dressed by Quasimodo.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey. I’ll have you know that this 
                        is my lucky jacket. It gives me 
                        good luck.

                                 WYATT
                             (smirking, then)
                        Mhm. Says the virgin.

                                 NATE
                        Wyatt! Rules!

                                 WYATT
                        Uh, fine. Okay. Lay ‘em on me.

                                 NATE
                        Rule number one, you must not talk 
                        for the remainder of this ride!

                                 WYATT
                        Deal! I mean...
                             (softly)
                        Deal. Now rule number two. Hit me.

                                 NATE
                        Rule number two. No accents, 
                        stereotypes or impressions for the 
                        entirety of the night. They’re all 
                        racist, and you can’t do them.

                                 WYATT
                        Does that include my Alberto The 
                        Taco Truck Owner impression?

                                 NATE
                        I don’t even know what that is, 
                        but judging by the name, yes.
                                 WYATT
                             (offensive Mexican accent)
                        But guys, I’m just harmless 
                        Alberto the Taco Truck Owner. I 
                        just want to lay on my couch and 
                        eat Tacos all day because I’m laz--

                                 NATE
                             (interrupting)
                        I will happily turn this car 
                        around and drop you off at a bus 
                        stop if you keep that going.

                                 WYATT
                        Okay, fine. Alberto will take a 
                        siesta. What’s rule number three?

                                 NATE
                        Rule number three. You must swear 
                        on your life that you will not be 
                        a fuckboy at this house party.

           Wyatt takes a long beat to mull over this rule. Nate and 
           Kyle sit, waiting impatiently for Wyatt’s answer.

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Wy?

                                 WYATT
                        That’s a lot to ask, Guys. I can’t 
                        stop being a fuckboy on a dime. 
                        That’s like telling Blake Griffin 
                        to stop being tall.

                                 KYLE
                        It’s a yes or no, Wy. You either 
                        swear to not be a fuckboy, or you 
                        don’t swear to not be a fuckboy.

                                 NATE
                        Red pill, blue pill. Red pill, 
                        blue pill. Which one you taking?

                                 WYATT
                        Uh, uh, uh, uh.
                             (then, with conviction)
                        Fuck it, I’m taking the red pill 
                        tonight, Baby. I solemnly swear to 
                        not be a fuckboy tonight!

           Nate and Kyle smile.

                                 NATE
                        Great. Then we’re set.
           Nate shifts gears and drives off. The car is now finally 
           quiet and composed-- the boys all excited.

                                 WYATT
                        High school butts, here I come!

                             NATE
                                                          KYLE
           No!
                                              Stop!

           EXT. KANG HOUSE - NIGHT

           MUSIC blasts loudly from inside. The place is packed. 
           KIDS smoke and drink on the front lawn.

           Nate, Wyatt and Kyle head to the front door, passing by a 
           group of PARTYGOERS who smoke a bowl on the front porch.

                                 NATE
                             (to Wyatt)
                        And remember. No fuckboy-ing 
                        around tonight.

                                 WYATT
                        You have my word, Nate. I promise 
                        I will not act a fuck--

           Wyatt turns, spotting the group hitting the bowl beside 
           him. He crosses, walking toward the group.

                                 WYATT
                             (interrupting himself)
                        Sick bowl, Brah. Can I get a hit?

           Nate and Kyle look to each other, shaking their heads as 
           they cross away and walk into the house.

           NOW, WITHIN THE GROUP

           The partygoers hand Wyatt the bowl, lighting it up for 
           him. Wyatt inhales, smoking too much, and exhaling into 
           the bowl. All the weed shoots out like a volcano.

           INT. KANG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nate and Kyle walk into the house. MUSIC plays loudly 
           around them. The boys look about, spotting kids drinking, 
           dancing, doing keg stands-- it’s a lot to consume.

           Tony Kang, near the door, turns and greets Nate.

                                 TONY
                        Yo! Fuck yeah. Nate’s here!
           Tony and Nate dap up. As they finish their dap, Tony 
           looks to Nate’s side, spotting Kyle.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        And shit! Little Yaacobi made it 
                        out, too. It’s been a minute, Man.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, like fourth period ago.

           Tony offers Kyle a dap. Kyle improvises a dap back.

                                 TONY
                        Dude, isn’t this fucking crazy? I 
                        told the boys to extend an invite 
                        to the whole county. It’s a rager!
                             (then)
                        You guys want a beer? We got a keg 
                        up if you wanna give it a pump.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey Tony, is Dustin around?

                                 TONY
                             (turning to Kyle)
                        You know what? Lil bro bro was in 
                        the kitchen when I saw him last.
                             (then, to Nate)
                        Here, let me show you this keg.

           Kyle turns, looking toward the kitchen area of the house.

                                 KYLE
                        Nate, can you come with me--

           Kyle turns back to Nate, watching as Tony leads him into 
           another area of the house. They vanish into an abyss of 
           partygoers. Kyle nervously stands by himself.

           INT. KANG HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Wyatt walks around the busy venue, laying eyes on a table 
           that’s set with a near-demolished spread of finger foods.

           Wyatt picks at the remains, crafting up a ham sandwich on 
           Trisket crackers. Wyatt leans in, taking a bite.

           As Wyatt eats, Jamal crosses in, chasing after Nicole 
           Cruz (18), a school cheerleader. Wyatt turns, watching.

                                 JAMAL
                        Come on girl. I’m sorry. I meant 
                        it in a flirtatious way...
           Jamal exits, crossing by a window at the end of the room. 
           Wyatt catches his eye on the window, looking down and 
           spotting two GUYS by a fire pit outside. He stares.

           INT. KANG HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Kyle steps into the kitchen. The counter is decorated 
           with various liquor bottles and red Solo cups.

           In the center of the kitchen sits a ping-pong table, 
           repurposed for beer pong. The table is drenched in beer.

           At the end of the table stands DUSTIN KANG (15). Dustin 
           goes head-to-head in a game against two SKATER BOYS.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Okay, okay. I’m calling Island.

                                 SKATER 1
                        Ha. You can have it.
                             (to his friend)
                        No way this kid makes that.

           Dustin straightens his elbows, lining up his shot.

                                 DUSTIN
                             (then, distracting)
                        Holy shit what’s that!?

           Dustin points up to the ceiling. The skater boys look up. 
           Off the boys’ glance, Dustin releases his ball, bouncing 
           it on the table, and sinking it in an isolated Solo cup.

           The boys look down, recognizing that they’ve been duped.

                                 DUSTIN
                        That’s island, and a bounce shot. 
                        Four cups. And balls back, please.

           The boys roll the balls back to Dustin. Mid roll, Dustin 
           grabs a ball and shoots at the last cup-- he sinks it.

                           SKATER 1
                                                        SKATER 2
           Ah!
                                              What the actual fuck!

           Kyle walks over to Dustin. Dustin, giving post-game 
           handshakes, turns, spotting Kyle.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh crap! Kyle’s here? What are you 
                        doing here, Man?

           Kyle smirks. The two hug, huddling at the pong table.
                                 KYLE
                        I came with Nate!
                             (then, re: beer pong)
                        That was real impressive what you 
                        did back there. How’d you do that?

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh. It’s just practice. Every time 
                        Tony has a house party I just stay 
                        in the kitchen and play beer pong.
                             (then)
                        I put in more reps than a Chinese 
                        Olympic Ping-Pong team. Watch.

           Dustin takes a ball from the table, shooting from between 
           his legs. It lands directly in the cup opposite them.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, pointing)
                        And who is that?

           Dustin turns, spotting JOSH WEINSTEIN (18).

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh. That’s Josh. He drinks for me 
                        when the other team makes a cup.

           Josh waves, then lets out a loud burp.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh. So you already have a partner?

                                 DUSTIN
                        Yeah... But I’m sure Josh would be 
                        okay sitting one out. Right, Josh?

                                 JOSH
                             (burping, then)
                        Sure.

           EXT. KANG HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           RYAN GUERRERO (19) stands outside over a fire pit. 
           Opposite him sits ADAM HOLLAND (18). A large metal tin 
           rests beside Adam at the fire pit.

                                 ADAM
                        Look, Man. The grub is hot.

                                 RYAN
                        You’ve got nothing to worry about. 
                                 ADAM
                        And I’m telling you I do. I’m 
                        hearing clicks on my phone, Ry.

                                 RYAN
                        And what to it? This is what you 
                        signed up for, isn’t it? You’re in 
                        it now.

                                 ADAM
                        Well, no. Not necessarily.

           Adam grabs the tin, holding it over the fireplace. Ryan 
           gets up and angrily walks over. Adam holds Ryan back.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Just hear me out. Ditch the plan, 
                        burn the supply, and we stay quiet 
                        for a couple months. Then we can--

           Ryan snatches the tin from Adam and angrily pushes him 
           back. He lifts his shirt up, revealing a pistol holstered 
           by his waist. Adam looks back nervously.

                                 RYAN
                        Don’t you threaten me. I’m a day 
                        away from a deal with the biggest 
                        private school in the state. This 
                        isn’t the time to go quiet.

                                 ADAM
                             (then, nervously)
                        Well that noise you’re making is 
                        attracting a lot of attention, Ry.

                                 RYAN
                        Mind your own business, stay the 
                        course, and I’ll figure it out.

                                 ADAM
                        You say that like a solution will 
                        just magically appear before us--

                                 WYATT
                             (interrupting, runs over)
                        Holy crap! Ryan? Ryan Guerrero?

           Wyatt walks over to Ryan and Adam. Ryan turns to Wyatt.

                                 RYAN
                        Wyatt Yaacobi?

           Ryan walks up to Wyatt and daps him up.
                                 ADAM
                        Ry. Who the hell is this?

                                 RYAN
                        Adam. This is Wyatt Yaacobi. We 
                        graduated together.

                                 WYATT
                             (to Adam, re: Ryan)
                        This dude used to sell me so many 
                        drugs back in the day.

           Adam, maddened, shoots an unimpressed glance to Ryan. 
           Ryan ignores it, turning around and pampering Wyatt up.

                                 RYAN
                        What on Earth are you doing here?

                                 WYATT
                        I came with my cousins. They 
                        brought me along ‘cuz I promised I 
                        wouldn’t be a fuckboy!

           Ryan pulls out the tin, walking back over to Wyatt.

                                 RYAN
                        Well, what a nice get-together. 
                        Here. I want you to try this.

           Ryan shows the tin to Wyatt. Wyatt looks down, taking off 
           the lid and revealing a sizable portion of brownies.

                                 RYAN
                        How about you bring these bad boys 
                        inside, share like one or two with 
                        your cousins, then give the tin 
                        back to me when you’re done, okay?

           Wyatt gives the brownies a big, heady whiff. He smirks.

                                 WYATT
                        Well, what can I say? Thank you, 
                        Ryan! That’s real generous of you.

           Ryan closes the lid and hands the brownie tin to Wyatt.

                                 RYAN
                        No problem, Man. Have fun!

           Wyatt crosses and exits. Ryan takes a joint out from 
           behind his ear and lights it. Adam looks to Ryan.

                                 ADAM
                        Now, what the fuck was that?
           Ryan takes a hit of his joint. He smirks to Adam.

                                 RYAN
                        Coming up in a pinch.

           INT. KANG HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A crowd forms around the table. Dustin and Kyle stand on 
           one end, FITZ and ROBBY, two varsity football stars, at 
           the other. One red solo cup remains on both sides.

           Fitz stands beside a PRETTY GIRL. He puts the ball up to 
           the girl’s lips-- the girl blows on his ball. Fitz then 
           turns back to the table, taking a shot-- and sinking it!

                                 CROWD
                        Oh!

           Dustin and Kyle begin their rebuttal. Dustin fetches a 
           ball and puts it up to Josh’s lips. Josh burps on it.

           Dustin then turns to the table, shooting his shot. The 
           ball rims out of the cup, missing ever so slightly.

                                 CROWD
                        Ohhhhhhhhh....

           Dustin turns to Kyle, shaking his head.

                                 DUSTIN
                        It’s up to you now, Kyle.

           Kyle holds the ball determinedly. He brushes the ball 
           against his jacket, then looks out, eyeing his target. 

           Locked-on, he prepares his shot, lining up and aiming.

                                 KYLE
                             (saying in Japanese)
                        Anta O Korosu Tame Deke Ni Ore We 
                        Ikite Kita!
                             (translation on screen)
                        I’ve Lived For The Sole Purpose of 
                        Killing You!

           Kyle shoots. The ball flies slowly through the air, 
           soaring with accuracy as it sinks into the last cup!

                            CROWD
           Wow!!
                                                       PARTYGOERS
                                              Holy shit did you see that?

           Kyle smirks and does the Bernie. Dustin gives him a big 
           hug. The jocks shake their heads, resetting their cups.
                                 DUSTIN
                        That’s what I’m talking about! 
                        Sudden Death! Let’s get it!

           Dustin and Kyle break from their hug and line up cups.

                                 DUSTIN
                             (looks into crowd, then)
                        Don’t look now, but you got a fan.

           Kyle looks into the crowd, immediately catching his gaze 
           on Meggie. Meggie sits on the kitchen counter, chatting 
           with her friends as she watches the game. Kyle blushes.

                                 DUSTIN (CONT'D)
                        Too bad she only dates older 
                        dudes. Tony told me she’s seeing 
                        the guy who created Vemma. Must be 
                        like twenty-three, twenty-four.

           WITHIN THE CROWD

           Nate crosses, pushing others aside as he moves toward the 
           beer pong table. He gets rows away from the action, as--

                                 WYATT (O.S.)
                        Yo, Nate!

           Wyatt pushes himself through the crowd to Nate.

                                 WYATT
                        Follow me. I saved you a spot!

           Wyatt crosses, heading to the table. Nate follows behind.

           BESIDE THE TABLE

           Nate and Wyatt stand court-side, watching the pong game.

                                 WYATT
                        How long have you two been keeping 
                        this from me? Kyle’s a BP G-d.

                                 NATE
                        I actually don’t think Kyle’s ever 
                        played. Kid is just a competitor.

           As Nate watches, he overhears bickering from the crowd. 
           He turns, spotting a couple chattering HIGHBOYS.

                                 HIGHBOY 1
                        Dude, this kid is fucking nuts.
                                 HIGHBOY 2
                        I know, right? Who would have 
                        thought boner kid had game!?

           Nate shakes his head, turning away from the highboys.

                                 NATE
                             (to Wyatt, sincerely)
                        I just hope high school isn’t as 
                        hard on him as he is on himself.

           The crowd around the boys erupts in CHEERS.

                        DUSTIN (O.S.)
                                                      KYLE (O.S.)
           Yes!
                                              Yes!

           Nate and Wyatt look out, watching Dustin and Kyle jump in 
           excitement. Wyatt rushes toward the table. Nate follows.

           AT THE PONG TABLE

           Dustin and Kyle shake hands with Fitz and Robby. Wyatt 
           walks over to the table-- Nate behind him.

                                 WYATT
                        That was absolutely incredible!

                                 KYLE
                        Well, thanks man.

                                 WYATT
                        The three of us should celebrate. 
                        Let’s get high like old times.

           Wyatt pulls out the tin of brownies. He presents them to 
           the boys. Kyle and Nate stare down, taking in a whiff.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, nervously)
                        I don’t know, Man. Getting high on 
                        Yom Kippur? That doesn’t feel 
                        kosher.

           Nate grabs a brownie from the tin.

                                 NATE
                        Neither is eating after sunset.

           Nate lifts the brownie over his head and drops it in his 
           mouth. He smiles to Kyle as he chews, grabbing another.

                                 WYATT
                             (off Kyle’s concern)
                        Come on, Kyle. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYATT (CONT'D)
                        This could be a night to remember 
                        for the rest of our lives. Have 
                        some fun for once.

           Wyatt grabs a brownie from the tin, looking back at Kyle. 
           Kyle stares back at the two-- Nate and Wyatt cheer him 
           on. Kyle then reluctantly motions for the tin.

                                 KYLE
                        I guess one brownie never hurt 
                        anybody.

           Kyle grabs a brownie. Nate and Wyatt smile back. The 
           three boys “cheers” one another with their brownies as 
           they lean in, all taking a big bite.

           MUSIC CUE: “HOUSE PARTY” BY MEEK MILL plays as we--

                                                                  CUT TO:

           MONTAGE:

           - Partygoers pour liquor into Kyle and Dustin’s mouth.

           - Nate aims a shot at the beer pong table. He makes his 
           shot, and the crowd cheers around him.

           - Wyatt shares a joint with six CHEERLEADERS.

           - Kyle shoots back a rebuttal shot at the beer pong 
           table, making the shot. The crowd cheers with him.

           - Wyatt does a keg-stand in the living room.

           - Kyle sits with Meggie on the couch. She makes a move 
           toward him, and the two begin to make out.

           - The crowd cheers as Wyatt completes his keg-stand. 
           Partygoers help him down as he spits out alcohol.

           - Josh Weinstein consumes beer can after beer can.

           - A crowd of partygoers have formed around Wyatt. Wyatt 
           showcases his dance moves from the middle of the circle.

           - Nate showcases his moves in the middle of the circle.

           - Kyle showcases his moves in the middle of the circle.

           - Back on the couch, Meggie gets up and grabs Kyle’s 
           hand. She directs him into another room. Kyle goes along.

           - We time lapse on the tin. Partygoers take brownies here 
           and there. The bountiful tin quickly empties.
           - Nate, Wyatt and Kyle all share a piece of a brownie, 
           smiling and laughing amongst themselves as we--

                                                        DISSOLVE TO BLACK:

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - KYLE’S ROOM - DAY

           Kyle wakes up abruptly to the sound of KNOCKING.

                                 KATH (O.S.)
                        Time to get up, Kyle. Services 
                        start in a ten minutes.

           INT. NATE/KYLE HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Directly outside of the room, we see Kath and Don 
           knocking on both Kyle and Nate’s bedroom doors.

                                 KATH
                             (sighing, then)
                        We should have taken the locks off 
                        these doors a long time ago.

                                 DON
                        Trust me. With two teenage boys, 
                        there are certain things you want 
                        to be locked out from seeing...

           INT. NATE’S CAR - DAY

           Kath and Don sit in the front of the Prius, quiet amongst 
           themselves as Don drives.

           Nate and Kyle quietly sit in the back of the car, both 
           visibly distraught and exhausted.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, turning)
                        What the fuck happened last night?

                                 NATE
                        I have no clue. No recollection 
                        whatsoever.

                                 KYLE
                        That’s not what I’m looking for!
                             (grabbing his stomach)
                        I’m churning. I feel like Gollum 
                        as he melted in the depths of 
                        Mount Doom.
                                 NATE
                        You’re probably just hung-over. 
                        Embrace it... I remember my first 
                        beer.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you patronizing me?

           EXT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY

           Dianna patiently stands outside of the synagogue. A large 
           congregation of SERVICE GOERS file their way inside.

           Kath, Don, Nate and Kyle walk up to the Synagogue.

                                 DIANNA
                        Aww. Look at the four of you. You 
                        all look so beautiful.

           Dianna hugs Don and gives him a kiss on the forehead.

                                 DIANNA (CONT'D)
                        My son and his beautiful family.

           Dianna hugs Kath and Nate.

                                 KATH
                        Hi, Di. How are you?

                                 DIANNA
                        I’m a lot better now that I’ve 
                        found you. You had me schvitzing.
                             (then, turning to Kyle)
                        Ah. Look at this one. I could eat 
                        him right up.

           Dianna gives Kyle a big hug. Whiffing in Dianna’s 
           perfume, Kyle gags in his mouth.

           Dianna lets go of Kyle, as Rina and Jed approach.

                                 DIANNA
                        Ah, and look at that timing.
                             (then)
                        What’s the matter with you two? 
                        You don’t use clocks?

                                 RINA
                        Hi, Mom. How are you?

           Dianna gives Rina a hug. She lets go, turning and glaring 
           a Jed for a beat.
                                 DIANNA
                        Where’s my grandson?

                                 RINA
                        We were hoping the boys could help 
                        us figure that out, actually.
                             (then)
                        Wyatt didn’t come home last night, 
                        and isn’t responding to his phone.
                             (then)
                        Not that this isn’t unusual for 
                        Wyatt. But, he knew about 
                        services. I don’t get it.

           Nate and Kyle nervously turn to each other.

                                 RINA (CONT'D)
                        You two wouldn’t have happened to 
                        catch where Wyatt went last night 
                        after the game, would you?

           Nate gives Kyle a “stick to my lead” glare.

                                 NATE
                             (turning to family)
                        Oh, yeah. Yeah, come to think of 
                        it, we did.
                             (thinking as he goes)
                        He, went, home... With, a...

                                 KYLE
                             (interrupting)
                        Person on the volleyball team!

           The family all turns to Kyle in surprise.

                                 DIANNA
                             (in disbelief, to Kyle)
                        Wyatt went home with a stranger 
                        Erev Yom Kippur?

           Kyle nods. The whole family looks back in surprise.

                             JEFF
           Jesus. That fucking kid.
                                                         DIANNA
                                              I just, I-- I-- don’t know.

           Dianna, shaking her head, frantically paces.

                                 DIANNA
                        Well, services will start any 
                        minute. We can’t wait for lovebird 
                        any longer.
                             (crossing into Synagogue)
                        You coming, Kids?
           The family, flustered, holds in place. Then Don turns and 
           follows Dianna. Rina, Kath and Jed follow suit.

           Now alone, Nate angrily turns to Kyle.

                                 NATE
                        What was that?

                                 KYLE
                        I was following your lead.

                                 NATE
                        Which I was still in the process 
                        of leading. You can’t just make up 
                        an enormous fib like that.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, sarcastically)
                        Oh right. Sorry. Because you 
                        clearly had it handled...

           The two cross, joining the family in the Synagogue.

           INT. TRAP HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           An old, dirty, unfinished basement. Very minimalist, the 
           basement interior consists of concrete, fiberglass, and 
           drywall. Corded swag lights shine down from above.

           Wyatt lays on the ground-- his back tied-up to a 
           lightning rod that goes through the ceiling. A cloth 
           covers his face, shrouding his view from anything.

           Wyatt abruptly wakes into consciousness. His mouth 
           muffled by tape, he wiggles around the floor.

                                 WYATT
                             (muffled)
                        Help! Help!

                                 RYAN (O.S.)
                        Save your energy, Pal.

           A hand crosses in, pulling off the cloth covering Wyatt’s 
           face. Wyatt, panting for breath, looks around the barren 
           basement, spotting Ryan and Adam.

                                 RYAN
                        No one can hear you here.

                                 WYATT
                        Ryan? Where the fuck am I?
           Ryan circles around Wyatt.

                                 RYAN
                        Well, this is a basement. Some 
                        people choose offices, some 
                        warehouses. But this is where I 
                        choose to do my business.

                                 WYATT
                        Business?

                                 RYAN
                        You think trapping is a hobby?

           Ryan leans down, entering Wyatt’s eye line as he wipes 
           his finger on the ground and inspects a layer of dust.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                             (to himself)
                        Gotta mop this floor down soon...

                                 WYATT
                        I’m sorry, Man. That’s cool and 
                        all. But I’m really confused. 
                             (then)
                        Why the fuck am I here?

           Ryan walks toward a workstation in the distance. He grabs 
           a metal tin from a workstation shelf, handing it to Adam.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh, right. Why you’re here. Well, 
                        last night, if you do recall, you 
                        took something from me. And today, 
                        well, today I need it back.

                                 WYATT
                        Wha- what are you talking about?

                                 RYAN
                        Okay. We want to play dumb, huh?

           Adam stuffs the tin in Wyatt’s grill, squishing his face.

                                 RYAN
                        Take a sniff. See if this 
                        refreshes your memory.

           Adam steps back, opening the tin up and revealing the 
           weed brownies inside. Wyatt closes his eyes and takes a 
           whiff-- it’s a rush to the system.

                                 WYATT
                        Wow. That shit’s fucking loud!
           Ryan laughs to himself as he stands up over Wyatt.

                                 RYAN
                        That shit you’re referring to is a 
                        highly addictive culinary mixture 
                        of Caramel, cocoa powder, and the 
                        best weed in the market, melted 
                        down into a delicious schmear of 
                        cana butter. Otherwise known... as 
                        Pudgy Fudgy.

                                 WYATT
                             (giggling)
                        Pudgy Fudgy.

                                 RYAN
                        Wha- what’s so funny?

                                 WYATT
                        Nothing, Mr. Fickelgruber. I’ll 
                        just get on my way to the 
                        Chocolate Factory now.

                                 RYAN
                             (growing frustrated)
                        Pudgy Fudgy isn’t a joke. We’ll 
                        soon be deploying around the 
                        entire county!

                                 WYATT
                        Better call for the Oompah 
                        Loompahs then!

                                 RYAN
                        You really don’t like the name?

                                 WYATT
                        I mean, I’d probably like it if it 
                        was a children’s book.

                                 RYAN
                        You know what. Just shut up! Shut 
                        up. Adam, shut him up!

           Wyatt laughs at the interaction. Adam slaps Wyatt across 
           the face. Wyatt, taken aback, quickly quiets himself up.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        I was very upset to discover I’m 
                        missing a tin of my supply. And I 
                        believe it’s in your possession.

           Wyatt, concerned, looks around in shock.
                                 WYATT
                             (pointing at himself)
                        Mine?

                                 RYAN
                        Don’t play coy with me. You took 
                        my tin! Now tell me where my 
                        fucking drugs are!

           Wyatt, looking around nervously, takes a beat to himself.

                                 WYATT
                        Oh... Well, we ate them all.

                                 RYAN
                        What do you mean you ate them all? 
                        I said have a couple and give the 
                        tin back when you’re done!

                                 WYATT
                        Oh. I thought you meant have all 
                        the brownies, then just return the 
                        tin back to you...

                                 RYAN
                        Okay. Well then where’s my tin?

                                 WYATT
                        Yeah, that’s gone too...

           Wyatt, without any other defense, sits and nervously 
           smiles at Ryan and Adam. Ryan and Adam stare back.

                                 RYAN
                             (then, turning to Adam)
                        Do you still own that Scalpel?

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah.

                                 RYAN
                        I want you to go get it, please.

           Adam crosses, rushing up the stairs. Ryan folds him arms, 
           staring angrily at Wyatt. He then crosses upstairs.

           Wyatt, left all alone to himself, gulps loudly.

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY

           The Synagogue CONGREGATION fills up every pew of the 
           Synagogue. It’s a completely packed house.
           A RABBI stands at the podium, reading from the Torah. 
           Behind him rests a large Torah arc.

           The Yaacobi family stands in two rows of pews. Dianna 
           stands at the end of the pew-- Kyle beside her. To Kyle’s 
           side stands Nate. Don, Kath, Rina and Jed stand behind.

                                 RABBI
                             (in Hebrew)
                        She-ma Yisrael, Adonai Eloheinu, 
                        Adonai echad. Baruch shem kavod 
                        malchuto l’olam va-ed. 

           The congregation sings along with the Rabbi.

                            RABBI
           V’ahavta et Adonai 
           Elohecha, b’chol l’vavcha 
           uv’chol nafsh’cha uv’chol 
           m’odecha--
                                                      CONGREGATION
                                              V’ahavta et Adonai 
                                              Elohecha, b’chol l’vavcha 
                                              uv’chol nafsh’cha uv’chol 
                                              m’odecha--

           NOW, WITH THE YAACOBI FAMILY

           The congregation takes a seat. The Yaacobis follow along.

           As he sits, Kyle’s stomach GROWLS loudly. Dianna notes it 
           with her eyes and tries to ignore it. Nate does the same.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, groaning)
                        Ohhhh.

           Nate, concerned, puts his program down and turns to Kyle.

                                 NATE
                        Dude. Are you okay?

                                 KYLE
                             (groaning quietly)
                        I have to throw up.

           Nate looks back at Kyle with concern.

                                 NATE
                        Well, like how soon? Give me an 
                        ETA.

                                 KYLE
                        Now.

           Nate raises his eyebrows to their highest level. He looks 
           around-- they’re at the very front of the Synagogue.
                                 NATE
                        We just got through the Shema.

                                 KYLE
                        I-- I--

           Kyle quickly leans over, stuffing his head into the book 
           holder backing of the pew. All goes silent as we--

                                                             CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - MOMENTS LATER

           MUSIC CUE: “ENDERS TOI” BY TAME IMPALA

           We slowly open on the synagogue, now from Kyle’s POV.

           Kyle looks to the podium. The Rabbi has disappeared, but 
           his words spew out from above, playing slowly and 
           ominously through the Synagogue like the Halo song.

                                 RABBI
                             (slow and ominous)
                        V’shinantam l’vanecha v’dibarta
                        bam b’shivt’cha b’veitecha--

           Kyle turns to Nate, who inaudibly shouts back to Kyle. 
           All the people around the synagogue begin to slowly 
           implode in shape, squeezing in to form blue circles.

           The objects in the synagogue then begin to alter in 
           shape, shifting before Kyle’s eyes into big red squares.

           Kyle begins to float up into the air. He flails his arms, 
           keeping up as he doggie paddles through the Synagogue. 

           Kyle paddles over to the Synagogue podium, landing and 
           walking over to the Torah.

           Kyle unfolds the long, ancient Hebrew scroll. The sides 
           of the Torah unwind and roll onto the floor. The Hebrew 
           text shifts in shape and size, now forming a pixelated, 2-
           dimension image of Kyle’s face. The 2D Kyle face pulls a 
           large joint, also formed out of Hebrew text, up to his 
           face. He lights it and inhales.

           The 2D Kyle exhales, and a wave of colors flow out from 
           all around him-- dispersing out like a lava lamp.

           As the face of the 2D Kyle radiates a serine smile, we--

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS

           Now, back in reality, Kyle sits hunched over, his head 
           buried into the aisle pew as he violently throws up.

           The service has temporarily stopped. Service goers all 
           look over at Kyle. Nate and Dianna comfort Kyle, patting 
           his back as he throws up.

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - LOBBY - DAY

           Kyle sits on a bench at the synagogue entrance. Nate 
           stands before him, engaged in a chat with Kath and Don. 

                                 NATE
                        Look, I’m sure it’s just nausea or 
                        something. These symptoms aren’t 
                        uncommon when you’re fasting.

           Kath and Don look to each other. Don shrugs in agreement.

                                 KATH
                        I’d just hate for us all to leave 
                        services. Your mother’s been very 
                        excited for today...

                                 NATE
                             (speaking up)
                        Well, we don’t all have to leave.

           Kath and Don turn back to Nate. They listen closely.

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        I could take the car back to the 
                        house, look after Kyle until the 
                        break fast, then meet up with you 
                        all at Nanni’s after services.

           Kath looks to Don. They ponder the thought for a beat.

                                 KATH
                        We could catch a ride with your 
                        mom. I’m sure she’d appreciate 
                        some extra hands setting up.

                                 DON
                        Okay... Well, if you say so.

           Don reaches into his pocket, grabbing the car keys. He 
           throws the keys to Nate. Nate catches them in his hand.
                                 DON
                        See you at sunset, Kid. Don’t do 
                        anything stupid.

                                 NATE
                        Sunset!

           EXT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY

           The boys swing open the Synagogue doors, walking outside.

                                 NATE
                             (impressed)
                        That was exactly the distraction 
                        we needed, Man! Nice thinking.

                                 KYLE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 NATE
                        How did you get yourself to vomit 
                        on command?

                                 KYLE
                             (thoughtfully)
                        Oh sure. Well, how I did that was--
                             (angrily)
                        I didn’t! I vomited on reflex. 
                        Because that’s how people vomit.
                             (then)
                        I feel very sick right now. Like a 
                        high fever. Like that Joseph 
                        Gordon-Levitt movie where he has 
                        to keep moving or he dies. So if I 
                        could just go home and get a 
                        moment of peace and quiet--

                                 NATE
                        The Dark Knight Rises?

                                 KYLE
                        The Dark Knight Rises what?
                             (then, frustrated)
                        Did you just suggest The Dark 
                        Knight Rises as that JGL movie? 
                        Why in the world would I refer to 
                        The Dark Knight Rises as that JGL 
                        movie? There’s like two JGL scen--
                             (then, remembering)
                        Premium Rush! That’s the name of 
                        the movie I was thinking of. 
                        Premium Rush. Figured it out, no 
                        thanks to you...
           Nate, deep in thought, ignores Kyle completely as he 
           brainstorms. Metaphorical lightbulbs go off in his head.

                                 NATE
                        No. No. We’re not going home now, 
                        Kyle. We’re going to find Wyatt!

                                 KYLE
                             (shaking his head angrily)
                        Nate. I just puked in Synagogue. I 
                        need to lay down, pull out my 
                        laptop, and write my article as I 
                        replenish with Pedialyte. The only 
                        place I’m going right now is home.

           Nate steps into the car and starts it up.

                                 NATE
                        Okay. Well, good luck with that. 
                        I’m gonna go find our cousin.

           Nate closes his door and starts driving. The car begins 
           to exit the parking lot. Kyle musters back a weak yell.

                                 KYLE
                        Wait! Wait! Nate!

           Kyle slowly walks after the moving car, crossing as we--

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - DAY

           Nate pulls into the parking lot and exits the car. Kyle 
           follows close behind as Nate walks around the school.

                                 NATE
                        Are you familiar with the concept 
                        of state-dependent memory, Ky?

                                 KYLE
                        No, what’s that?

                                 NATE
                        Well, I first learned about it my 
                        junior year... Kelly Kyber got 
                        fubar drunk at Stetson’s New Years 
                        party and lost her car keys at his 
                        house. No one could drive their 
                        family Pontiac for months! Kelly’s 
                        whole family had to take a bus!
                                 KYLE
                        I really don’t care, Nate.

                                 NATE
                        Just chill out. You didn’t even 
                        let me finish...

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           INT. STETSON HOUSE - NIGHT

           CHYRON: 2011

           We stroll into a lively high school party. It’s a throng 
           of drinking games, puking teens and make out sessions.

           A CROWD has formed around KELLY KYBER (17, FUBAR drunk), 
           cheering her on as she takes shot after shot of Fireball.

                                 NATE (V.O.)
                             (recounting his memory)
                        Now, flash forward to spring break 
                        and Stetson hosts another party. 
                        Kelly Kyber shows up her usual 
                        Fubar-esk self and takes like six 
                        shots of Fireball. Then she just 
                        straight books it to the kitchen.

           The entire party watches in amazement. Then, as if she 
           hit a wall, Kelly stops drinking. Turning away, she 
           quickly crosses. The crowd quiets.

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           INT. STETSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Kelly drunkenly stumbles into the kitchen. She pushes 
           herself toward the kitchen counter, where a Quaker Oats 
           barrel sits by itself.

           Reaching the counter, Kelly drops her hand into the oats 
           barrel, digging around inside.

                                 NATE (V.O.)
                        Kelly stuffs her hand into this 
                        family-sized Quaker Oats barrel... 
                        And boom! There are her car keys.
           Kelly pulls her hand out of the oats barrel, now holding 
           a Maryland flag lanyard in her grasp. At the end of the 
           lanyard rest her car keys. As Kelly smiles at her keys--

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - DAY

           Returning back to present-day, Nate finishes his story.

                                 NATE
                        Her keys were in Stetson’s Oats 
                        for four months! Isn’t that crazy?

                                 KYLE
                        Why didn’t the family just get a 
                        second key made for their car?

                                 NATE
                        Ugh. Because then I would have 
                        never learned this valuable lesson 
                        on the power of state-dependent 
                        memory. Duh!

           Nate stops as he reaches the Washington Catholic Academy 
           tool shed. He smirks, pulling against the toolshed door.

           INT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - TOOL SHED - DAY

           The doors to the shed open, and Nate and Kyle walk 
           inside, revealing the space from years past.

           Kyle looks around in awe. Not much has changed to the 
           space since he was here last-- the couches and chairs 
           look as old and rusty as ever before. 

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        So, I’m thinking... Similarly to 
                        Kelly Kyber, if we can get as high 
                        as we were last night, it may 
                        refresh our memory as to what 
                        happened to Wyatt.

           Nate walks over to an extra cushy cushion chair in the 
           back of the shed. He digs in to the cushy chair’s chunky 
           ridges, pulling out the infamous Barack Obama matte gold 
           bong from years past. It shines back majestically.

                                 KYLE
                             (surprised at the sight)
                        Barack O-Bong-A?
                             (then, in disbelief)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        You’re kidding right? This is your 
                        big plan? Getting high?

           Nate cleans the bong up, preparing it for use.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                             (then, off Nate’s silence)
                        We’ll go to hell for this, Nate. 
                        When we die, this is what G-d will 
                        point to on our resumes to keep us 
                        from entering Heaven. It’s the 
                        face tattoo of Heaven admission.

                                 NATE
                        If there’s one thing Kelly Kyber 
                        taught me, it’s that you make the 
                        worst choices under the influence. 
                        And, also, that to best remember 
                        those poor choices, it helps to be 
                        under the influence again.

                                 KYLE
                        I feel like neither one of these 
                        things are really good things.

                                 NATE
                        Look, Man. Think of it this way.
                             (a long beat, then)
                        You threw up in a Synagogue. 
                        You’re already going to hell, so--

           Kyle, frustrated, grabs the bong and begins to pack it.

                                 KYLE
                        Man, fine. Let’s just do this 
                        then. I’m ready for it!

           Nate nods, ready to commence the plan, as we--

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - Kyle sets the bong down on the table.

           - Nate packs the bong with weed.

           - Kyle cuts off the lighter’s safety and strikes a light.

           - Kyle and Nate now stand over Barack O-Bong-A. Packed 
           pristinely, the bong glistens back brightly at the boys.

                                 KYLE
                             (letting out an exhale)
                        Fuck, Man. I guess it’s time to 
                        Yolo this shit.
                                 NATE
                        Ugh. That’s so four months ago.

                                 KYLE
                        Yolo isn’t cool anymore?

                                 NATE
                        It aged poorly after Drake got his 
                        hands on it.

                                 KYLE
                        Fucking Drake.

           Kyle strikes the bong with his lighter. Nate puts his 
           mouth to the bong, inhaling as he takes in the whole hit. 

           As he finishes, Nate moves his face away from the bong, 
           taking a beat, then exhaling a great deal of smoke.

                                 NATE
                        Now your turn.

           INT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - TOOL SHED - LATER

           Kyle sits in a cushioned seat. Visibly nervous, he tries 
           to keep himself calm as Nate packs the bowl. Kyle looks 
           at the bong, exchanging stares with Barack O-Bong-A.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you sure we should do this?

                                 NATE
                        Dude.
                             (loses train of thought)
                        ...Yes.

           Kyle metaphorically straps himself in.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, here goes.

           Kyle puts his lips on the bong. He braces himself.

                                 NATE
                        In five, four, three, two, one--
                             (then)
                        Blastoff!

           Time slows down as Nate strikes the lighter. Kyle sucks 
           in as the lighter flame burns the tightly packed bowl.

           Smoke travels up the bong, through Barack O-Bong-A’s 
           stoic, patriotic gaze, as it reaches Kyle’s lips.
           Kyle inhales, taking in every last puff. As smoke enters 
           Kyle’s body, we push in on Kyle, who thinks deeply as we--

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. KANG HOUSE - VARIOUS

           We flash through brief instances of the night that were 
           previously blocked out from Kyle’s memory:

           - Playing beer pong with Nate, Wyatt and Dustin.

           - Making out with Meggie on the couch.

           - Crowd surfing over a large group of partygoers.

           - Eating brownies with Nate and Wyatt.

           As we watch Kyle, Wyatt and Nate bite into the brownies--

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - TOOL SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle jumps out of his seat, shooting into consciousness.

                                 KYLE
                        Brownies.

           Nate, taking another hit in the corner, quickly turns.

                                 NATE
                             (coughing, then)
                        What?

                                 KYLE
                        Wyatt gave us a tin of weed 
                        brownies last night. We all took 
                        one. And everything after that is 
                        a blur. Could those brownies maybe 
                        trace us back to Wyatt?

                                 NATE
                        I mean, I guess it’s not impossib--

           A RINGTONE goes off from Kyle’s pocket, interrupting the 
           riff. Nate turns to Kyle, who reaches for his phone.

           Picking up his cell phone, Kyle looks down, but there’s 
           no call-- weird. The phone continues to ring.
           Kyle searches his body, reaching into the pocket of his 
           jacket, and pulling out a circa 2005 RAZR FLIP PHONE.

           Nate glances at Kyle, looking down at the phone in 
           confusion. Kyle shrugs back, then flips the phone open.

           INSERT: A new message from “<3.” The message reads, “Hey 
           Babe. Need to pick up tin.”

                                 KYLE
                             (reading aloud)
                        “Hey Babe. Need to pick up tin.”

           Kyle clicks the curser, moving to the next message.

                                 KYLE
                        “Can you grab it from your gym 
                        locker and meet me at three pm on 
                        the soccer field?”

           Kyle turns away from the phone and looks to Nate.

                                 NATE
                        Who is that?

                                 KYLE
                        The number’s saved as “less than 
                        three.” Could this be a pen name?

           Nate snatches the phone from Kyle, taking a look.

                                 NATE
                        That’s a heart symbol, you fool.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh. Well that explains Babe.
                             (then, disappointed)
                        So it’s not the Pig in the city...

                                 NATE
                        No. But whoever that phone belongs 
                        to, they know about the brownies.
                             (then, typing into phone)
                        I think I have an idea...

                                 KYLE
                        Hey. That’s mine.

           Kyle tries to grab the phone back but Nate restrains him.

                                 NATE
                             (as he types)
                        The fuck are you kidding? You just 
                        found it in your jacket.
                                 KYLE
                        Jacket is mine, ergo phone belongs 
                        to me.

                                 NATE
                             (as he finishes typing)
                        Okay whatever. How’s this?
                             (reading his message)
                        “Of course I’ll grab it, you sexy 
                        load. What locker number?” Sent!
                             (then, to Kyle)
                        I ended the text with six dashes 
                        and a greater sign to make it look 
                        like a long penis.

           Kyle snatches the phone back from Nate.

                                 KYLE
                        Why the fuck would you ask him 
                        what the locker number is? That’s 
                        such a sus response--

           Kyle is interrupted as the phone rings again. He looks.

           INSERT: From “<3”, “609 ;)”

           Kyle reads the message, then gives the phone to Nate.

                                 NATE
                        Six-o-nine. Looks like we just 
                        found ourselves a lead!

           Kyle nods in agreement, folding the phone closed.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, looking around)
                        Holy shit. Have we been inside 
                        this whole time?

           INT. TRAP HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           Wyatt sits tied up, looking around as he tries to collect 
           his bearings of the basement. Taped along the basement 
           walls are detailed maps of the D.C. Metropolitan area. 
           Certain areas are circled, others are slashed out.

           As Wyatt looks around, the basement door OPENS. Wyatt 
           turns to the staircase, listening as FOOTSTEPS approach.

           As the steps gets closer, a small Asian boy appears down 
           the staircase. Holding a non-stick pan, he HUMS to 
           himself as he walks over to the basement workstation.
                                 WYATT
                             (yelling out)
                        Hey! You! You over there.

           Startled, the small Asian boy tosses the pan. Weed 
           brownies fly into the sky as he looks over. Nervously 
           spotting Wyatt, he quickly turns back to the workstation.

                                 ASIAN BOY
                        Oh, no. No one here. No me.

                                 WYATT
                        Your response only makes me more 
                        certain you’re there! Who are you?

           The Asian boy turns around, stepping closer to Wyatt and 
           revealing himself. This is JAEHWAN (18).

                                 JAEHWAN
                        My name a Jaehwan.

           Wyatt stares at Jaehwan, perplexed.

                                 WYATT
                        What? Your name is Jamal?

                                 JAEHWAN
                        No, racist. My name Jaehwan.

           Jaehwan begins to pick up the brownies from the ground.

                                 WYATT
                        I know. I heard you the first 
                        time. You can’t be a Jamal. Jamal 
                        is like... an African name.

                                 JAEHWAN
                        You’re really digging yourself a 
                        deep hole right now. If I recorded 
                        this conversation, they’d put you 
                        on a Fuckboy list.

                                 WYATT
                        Right. Easy for you to say! You’re 
                        in a basement making drugs.

                                 JAEHWAN
                        I would not be Fuckboy for making 
                        drugs. You would be Fuckboy 
                        because you are a racist!

           Jaehwan, holding a dozen brownies under his arm, spits at 
           Wyatt. Wyatt scoots himself out of the way-- avoiding.
                                 JAEHWAN
                        You’re disgusting.

           Jaehwan turns, walking back toward the workbench.

                                 WYATT
                        Wait! Please. Wait! Please don’t 
                        leave me here. Those people. 
                        They’re going to hurt me.

           Jaehwan turns back around, angrily glaring at Wyatt.

                                 JAEHWAN
                        They will not hurt you. They only 
                        want to extort you until they get 
                        what they want from you.

           Wyatt, mouth agape, attempts to break out of his ropes.

                                 WYATT
                        You fucking sick people. What 
                        makes you think you can just 
                        kidnap and tie up innocent people?

           Jaehwan, looking down at Wyatt, shakes his head.

                                 JAEHWAN
                        No... We are both prisoners.
                             (then, with a sigh)
                        If I left this house, Ryan will 
                        call immigration and try to have 
                        me sent back to my home country. 
                        That is why I must work.

           Jaehwan lowers his head, going back to work. Wyatt looks 
           to Jaehwan, spotting an ankle monitor on his leg.

                                 WYATT
                        Listen here, Jamal. My name is 
                        Wyatt Yaacobi. And I promise you. 
                        I’m gonna get you out of here!

           Jaehwan, focused at his workstation, shakes his head.

                                 JAEHWAN
                        You don’t know what you’ve gotten 
                        yourself into, Wyatt Yaacobi...

           The basement door OPENS, and Ryan and Adam appear from 
           upstairs. Adam walks toward Wyatt, cutting off his ropes.

                                 ADAM
                             (yelling out)
                        Get up. Get up now.
           Freed from the ropes, Wyatt slowly gets up, facing Ryan.

                                 RYAN
                        If you can’t give me back my goods 
                        then you’ll pay them off with your 
                        service. Once your debt is paid, 
                        then I’ll let you go. Probably.

           Adam strikes Wyatt in his back. Wyatt coughs.

                                 RYAN
                        And it just so happens I got your 
                        first task right now.

           Wyatt stands up straight, nervously nodding back to Ryan.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           GIRLS freely walk about the locker room, wearing bras and 
           underwear as they change post-volleyball practice.

                            GIRL 1
           Oh my gosh, Becky. Your 
           tits are so perky.
                                                         GIRL 2
                                              Can I bounce another dime 
                                              on your ass, Alexa? It’s 
                                              just so fun.

           The girls all laugh and chatter amongst themselves. One 
           girl crosses, passing by a janitor’s closet as she makes 
           her way to the locker room shower.

           We hold on the janitor’s closet, pushing in as we--

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - JANITOR CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Nate and Kyle stand squished inside the dark closet, 
           struggling to keep still as they step on boxes, mops and 
           dead rats. Kyle, bent over, looks out the closet keyhole.

                                 NATE
                             (struggling for balance)
                        Come on, Man! Give me a turn.

                                 KYLE
                        No way. This is a dream come true.

           Watching through the keyhole, Kyle spots the captain of 
           the volleyball team, SYDNEY MORGAN, step onto an aisle 
           bench in the center of the locker room.
                                 SYDNEY
                        Okay, ladies. Who’s ready for the 
                        eleventh annual boob comparing 
                        competition!?

           Nate rushes toward the door, pushing Kyle out of the way.

                                 NATE
                        Okay, it’s my turn now.

           Kyle pushes back against Nate for a peek at the action. 
           The two fight back and forth from the janitor’s closet.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           The girl’s locker room has now emptied out. One last GIRL 
           grabs her belongings and crosses out of the locker room.

           As the locker room door CLOSES, the janitor closet door 
           flies open. Nate and Kyle rush out, breathing for air.

                                 NATE
                        Jesus, Man. Wear some fucking DEO.

                                 KYLE
                        Maybe when you stop farting up 
                        your fucking lentil bean burritos.
                             (then, frustratedly)
                        I’m like legitimately concerned 
                        for your gastrointestinal tract.

           The brothers turn and walk down the hallway, looking for 
           locker number 609. Kyle inspects the lockers on the left, 
           Nate inspects lockers on the right.

           Finally, Kyle spots it-- locker number 609-- sitting 
           above two other lockers in the middle of the aisle.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay I found it! 609.

           Nate turns and looks over at the locker. 

                                 NATE
                        Great. Great. That’s it, alright.
                             (then, noticing lock)
                        Just one issue here.

           Nate grabs ahold of the lock to the locker. He pulls 
           hard, but it doesn’t budge.
           Kyle inspects the lock’s six-letter combination padlock.

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Should I check the janitor’s 
                        closet for pliers?

                                 KYLE
                        No no. We can’t break the lock.

                                 NATE
                        Okay... and what do you suggest?

                                 KYLE
                        Well, it’s a six-letter 
                        combination padlock with seven 
                        possible letters per wheel. Do the 
                        math and that’s only...
                             (doing math in his head)
                        Five-thousand-forty permutations 
                        to choose from. We’ll figure it 
                        out in no time.

           Nate looks back, shaking his head in total disagreement.

                                 NATE
                        What? No we won’t. What you’re 
                        suggesting is like if Boggle 
                        fucked CIA encryption software and 
                        had a child.

                                 KYLE
                        You’re blowing all of this out of 
                        proportion. Watch this.

           Kyle grabs the lock and puts it up to his ear. He listens 
           closely as he turns the letters on the lock.

                                 KYLE
                             (quietly, as he listens)
                        Just got to listen closely for the 
                        click as I turn, and the combo 
                        will reveal itself to me.

           Kyle nods and inputs a code. Smiling, he looks to Nate 
           and pulls on the lock-- nothing budges.

                                 KYLE
                        Damnit.
                             (reading his combination)
                        It’s not hurrah? It worked exactly  
                        like that in this episode of 
                        Sherlock I saw.
                                 NATE
                        Sherlock makes everything look 
                        easy! The man possesses an 
                        unrealistic set of tools for 
                        deduction.

                                 KYLE
                             (disappointed)
                        Well. I guess we do have a 
                        problem, then--

           Kyle is cut off as the door to the locker room SQUEAKS 
           open. Kyle and Nate stare to each other nervously. Then, 
           without a word, the two turn, searching for hiding spots.

           Nate runs toward a locker room aisle in the distance. 
           Kyle, hearing the footsteps closing in, drops to the 
           ground, hiding himself under the locker room aisle bench.

           Kyle squeezes in, shutting his eyes as he becomes one 
           with the bench. As the FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, Kyle opens one 
           eye, looking up at the feet of a girl as she stops at 
           locker 609 and enters the locker combination.

           Her face blocked by the locker room bench, Kyle watches 
           her arm enter the locker, grabbing a sweatshirt, and 
           revealing a metal tin in the back of the locker.

           Kyle looks up in shock at the sight of the tin. The 
           girl’s foot steps back, hitting Kyle. Kyle covers his 
           face, holding in a nervous gasp, as--

                                 MEGGIE (O.S.)
                        Kyle?

           Kyle opens his eyes. Meggie Xiong stares down at him.

                                 MEGGIE
                        Kyle, what are you doing here?

                                 KYLE
                             (a beat, then, nervously)
                        I could ask you the same thing, 
                        you know.

           Meggie pauses, looking around the Girl’s locker room.

                                 MEGGIE
                        No. You really can’t.

           Kyle pushes himself out from under the locker room bench.
                                 KYLE
                        Well I’m-- I’m writing an article 
                        for The Warrior about how creaky 
                        the benches in the girl’s locker 
                        room are. So, thought I’d do some 
                        investigative reporting to get the 
                        dirt myself, you know.

           Kyle pushes the locker room bench. It doesn’t creak.

                                 MEGGIE
                        Mhm.
                             (then, changing subject)
                        Hey, can I actually talk to you 
                        about something real quick?

                                 KYLE
                        Um, yeah, sure. What’s up?

                                 MEGGIE
                             (relieved)
                        Okay, great. Um...

           Meggie looks around-- it’s quiet, but not quiet enough. 
           She grabs Kyle with her as she walks to a different spot.

           Meggie stands with Kyle in a secluded area of the locker 
           room-- her back now turned away from her locker.

                                 MEGGIE
                             (working up courage, then)
                        Look, Kyle. Last night was fun.

           Kyle looks back in surprise. He’s truly speechless. 

           As he stares blankly at Meggie, Kyle spots Nate out of 
           the corner of his eye. Nate quietly walks over to 
           Meggie’s locker, searching for the tin.

                                 MEGGIE (O.S.)
                        And, I know we agreed for what we 
                        did to be our little secret... 
                        But, I felt bad keeping something 
                        like this from my boyfriend...

           Kyle quickly looks back to Meggie, his face turning red.

                                 KYLE
                        Boyfriend?

           Meggie nervously smiles.
                                 MEGGIE
                        You’re really cute, Kyle. But, the 
                        guy I’m seeing. My boyfriend. And 
                        his crowd. They wouldn’t be very 
                        happy with me, or with you, if 
                        they saw the two of us together 
                        after what we did last night.
                             (then)
                        So, maybe we can just keep a 
                        distance for a little, and forget 
                        about what happened? That okay?

           Kyle, speechless, stares at Meggie for a long beat.

           Out of the corner of his eye, Kyle watches as Nate pulls 
           out the tin from Meggie’s locker. Holding the tin, Nate 
           quickly sneaks away to another part of the locker room.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, confused)
                        Wait. What happened last night?

                                 MEGGIE
                             (smiling back)
                        Exactly.

           Meggie kisses Kyle on the cheek, walking to her locker.

           Kyle, frozen in space, watches as Meggie grabs her jacket 
           and closes her locker door. Meggie waves to Kyle then 
           crosses, heading out the locker room door.

           As the door CLOSES SHUT, Nate slides back into the aisle, 
           holding the tin in his hand as he looks to Kyle.

                                 NATE
                             (re: tin)
                        Look what I foun--
                             (stopping himself)
                        Holy shit, Man. You have a giant 
                        erection!

           We look back to Kyle, now spotting a giant pant tent 
           erection that appears to only be growing.

                                 NATE
                        Have you learned nothing? Tuck 
                        your boner in your waistband!
                             (then)
                        You gotta stop leaving yourself 
                        wide open to embarrassment, Ky.

           Nate puts the tin down, shaking his head as he tucks 
           Kyle’s boner in his waistband.
           Kyle, still mesmerized, stands perfectly still in place.

                                 KYLE
                             (dazed, short of breath)
                        I’ve never been so in love and 
                        scared at the same time...

                                 NATE
                        Jesus, Man. What happened between 
                        you and her?

                                 KYLE
                        I honestly have no clue. But I’m 
                        going to get so high tonight to 
                        recount every second of it.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Nate and Kyle walk out the locker room door, stepping 
           outside and walking toward the soccer field.

                                 NATE
                        Okay, we got our tin. It’s nearly 
                        three pm. What time did your sext 
                        buddy say to meet him?

           Kyle, ahead of Nate, jots down on a notepad, ignoring 
           Nate’s comment.

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Kyle, are you good?

           Kyle comes back to reality, turning back to Nate.

                                 KYLE
                        What’s that? Yeah.

                                 NATE
                             (spotting notepad)
                        Are you writing notes?

           EXT. SCHOOL - SOCCER FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Nate and Kyle walk onto a poorly-trimmed, uneven public 
           school soccer field. There’s nothing special to it. A 
           forest rests downhill, left of the field.

           Nate and Kyle stop as they reach the center of the field.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah. Well, no. Well... I told 
                        you. I got a story due tomorrow.
                                 NATE
                        We’re about to deliver a tin of 
                        weed brownies to a rando on a 
                        burner phone. Our cousin is 
                        missing. And you find this to be a 
                        good time to begin breaking a 
                        story? Is this a joke to you?

                                 KYLE
                        Does it sound like a joke? Am I 
                        fucking laughing, Nate?
                             (then)
                        I’m more than just an accomplice 
                        on your stupid suburban 
                        excursions. I want to go home.

                                 NATE
                        You could have went home at any 
                        point in this, Kyle!

                                 KYLE
                        Are-- you-- fucking serious, Nate? 
                        You’re really telling me that I--

           A RUSTLING from the forest startles the two. Nate jumps, 
           quickly hiding behind Kyle

                                 NATE
                        Shh. Shh.

           Nate and Kyle turn to the forest, spotting Wyatt. Wyatt 
           wades through the bushes as he walks onto the field.

                                 NATE
                        Wyatt?

           Wyatt looks up. Spotting Nate and Kyle.

                                 WYATT
                        Nate? Kyle? What are you guys 
                        doing here?

                                 NATE
                        We left services to come find you. 
                        What are you doing he--

                                 KYLE
                             (interrupting)
                        No! No more of this small talk. 
                        What the fuck is going on, Wyatt?

           Wyatt joins Nate and Kyle at the center of the field.
                                 WYATT
                        Look. I think we should all calm 
                        down a bit. I can explain this. 
                        But first I need that tin.

           Nate and Kyle look back at Wyatt, unloading their anger.

                             NATE
           We were all worried sick 
           about you. And you’re out 
           here pushing weed brownies?
                                                          KYLE
                                              I’ve had it up to here with 
                                              you, Wyatt. I trusted you. 
                                              I threw up in Synagogue.

           Wyatt takes insults left and right from Nate and Kyle. As 
           the yelling calms, he leans in toward the boys.

                                 WYATT
                             (quietly, to boys)
                        Guys, please just do this for me. 
                        Don’t make me fuck this up...

           Before Wyatt can finish, SIRENS go off from afar. 
           Headlights beam down at them from the parking lot above. 

           The boys turn and look up, spotting a police car. The 
           flashing red and blue lights overwhelm their perspective.

           Two POLICE OFFICERS stand outside the car. An OFFICER 
           speaks into the intercom. The sound echos across the 
           field-- to the boys it feels like a million cops.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                             (through car intercom)
                        No one move. You’re surrounded.

           Wyatt, Nate and Kyle hold for a beat, standing in fear.

                                 WYATT
                             (then)
                        Run!

           Wyatt takes the tin from Kyle’s hands and quickly books 
           it for the forest. Nate and Kyle chase after Wyatt.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Wyatt runs through the forest, carrying the brownie tin 
           by his side as he navigates around trees and branches. 
           Nate and Kyle chase after Wyatt from behind.

                                 KYLE
                        You better fucking talk, Wyatt!

           Wyatt, facing forward, yells backward as he runs.
                                 WYATT
                             (short of breath, running)
                        Look. I’m being blackmailed, Guys. 
                        The brownies. They’re more than 
                        just weed brownies...

                                 NATE
                        I’m sorry. What do you mean more 
                        than just weed brownies?

                                 WYATT
                        It’s a whole drug ring. You don’t 
                        want to get involved in this. Ryan 
                        will be very unhappy if I don’t 
                        get this tin to him.

                                 KYLE
                        Ryan? Who the fuck is Ryan?
                             (then)
                        Hey. Are you dating Meggie?

           Wyatt continues to run, visibly perspiring.

                                 WYATT
                        Meggie? Is that the girl who gave 
                        you a boner in your YouTube video?

           Wyatt begins to cough. He stops, putting his hands on his 
           knees as he breathes heavily. Nate and Kyle catch up.

                                 NATE
                        Wyatt, look. We need to know 
                        what’s going on here.

           Wyatt, getting his breath back, gets up from his fetal 
           position. He turns to Nate and Kyle.

                                 WYATT
                        This doesn’t have to do with you 
                        two. But me, I have a debt to pay. 
                        And the sooner I pay it off, the 
                        sooner this can all go back to 
                        normal. So just fucking let me be.

                                 NATE
                        Wyatt, if you’re being blackmailed 
                        right now, then this is a much 
                        bigger problem that involves all 
                        of us. And we should work with the 
                        police while we have the chance.

           Wyatt shakes his head.
                                 WYATT
                        Don’t get yourself involved in 
                        other people’s business, Nate.

           Wyatt grabs the brownie tin from the ground and books it 
           to the end of the forest. Nate and Kyle sprint after him.

           EXT. FOREST / EXT. SKATE PARK - DAY

           Wyatt reaches the end of the forest, looking out to the 
           open road, and spotting two police cars already 
           positioned outside waiting for him.

           Wyatt looks to his right, spotting a skate park. He 
           sprints toward the fenced-off skate park.

           Nate and Kyle turn and follow after Wyatt.

           INT. SKATE PARK - DAY

           Wyatt climbs the skate park fence, hurdling over, and 
           dropping down inside. YOUNG KIDS skate around him.

           One young skater, TIMMY (9), wears a helmet and pads as 
           he stands below Wyatt, looking up in fear. Wyatt grabs 
           Timmy’s skateboard, pushing him down as he runs away.

           Nate and Kyle drop down into the skate park. They grab 
           two skateboards along the fence and follow after Wyatt.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Wyatt skates on the asphalt of the open road. A police 
           car, SIRENS WAILING, chases up to him from behind.

           Nate and Kyle catch up, skating past the wailing cop car. 
           As the road slopes downhill, The boys look down-- the 
           slope tilts more and more as they stare. A police 
           blockade at the very end of the slope blocks the road.

           Nate nervously stares down at the blockade. He turns to 
           Kyle, who bobs his head while he chuckles to himself.

                                 NATE
                        Kyle! Why are you laughing?

                                 KYLE
                             (evidently out of it)
                        I thought of something funny.

           Nate shakes his head frustratedly, turning back to Wyatt.
                                 NATE
                             (yelling out)
                        Wyatt. Watch out!

           Wyatt cruises downhill, looking behind him as the chasing 
           cop car flees. He smirks, laughing joyfully as he turns 
           forward, now spotting the awaiting police blockade.

           With too much momentum to stop, Wyatt surveys the area 
           ahead. He spots a divot in the road beside the blockade.

           Wyatt locks onto the divot, bracing himself as he speeds 
           up. He crouches down, leveling himself with his board.

           Feet away, Wyatt pops the tail of his skateboard, doing 
           an ollie over the divot and propelling himself into the 
           air. Wyatt scales the car, landing past the blockade.

           Nate and Kyle look out, watching Wyatt’s landing.

                             NATE
                                                          KYLE
           Woah!
                                              Holy!

           Wyatt stops his board, looking out from the other end of 
           the blockade as he catches his breath.

           Now Nate’s turn to cross, he attempts Wyatt’s routine, 
           crouching down and popping the tail of his skateboard. 
           Nate lifts up, grabbing major air as he flies over the 
           police blockade.

           Kyle watches Nate land his jump. Excited, but nervous, he 
           now prepares himself for the police barricade. Closing 
           his eyes, Kyle crouches down and leaps up in the air.

           Time slows down as Kyle mystically pops up on his board, 
           floating in the air as he approaches the blockade.

           Wyatt and Nate watch nervously as Kyle flies in the air.

                                 WYATT
                             (time ramped down)
                        Woaaaaaah.

           Kyle opens his eyes, looking forward from mid-air and 
           spotting the police blockade feet away. He SQUEAKS in 
           fear-- He doesn’t have the air he needs to cross it.

                                 KYLE
                             (time ramped down)
                        Fuccccccck.

           Time speeds back up as Kyle prepares to jump ship and hop 
           off his board. He quickly attempts to re-navigate.
           With too much momentum behind him, Kyle and his board 
           hurtle right into the police car.

           Kyle hits the police car door, ricochetting off, and 
           falling onto the ground. Off Kyle’s VIOLENT CRASH, we--

                                                             CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. POLICE STATION - JAIL CELL - DAY

           Kyle’s eyes slowly open. Regaining his consciousness, he 
           looks around, spotting himself in an empty jail cell.

                                 KYLE
                             (defeated)
                        No. No. No. No. No.

           Kyle quickly gets up from the ground, looking around more 
           intensively, and walking over to the jail cell bars.

           Kyle shakes the bars, frustration growing as he shakes.

                                 KYLE
                        Someone help me! There’s been a 
                        mistake! I’m not the one you want.

                                 NATE (O.S.)
                        Oh, thank G-d. You’re awake.

           Kyle peeks his head out from behind the bars, following 
           the sound of the voice, and spotting Nate, looking back 
           at him from the jail cell to his right.

                                 KYLE
                             (mellowed)
                        Nate. You’re here too?

                                 NATE
                        Don’t get too excited. There’s a 
                        lot of other places I’d rather be 
                        right about now.

                                 KYLE
                        Well where the fuck is Wyatt? He’s 
                        the one who should be behind bars!

                                 WYATT (O.S.)
                        Sounds like you got your wish...

           Kyle turns to the jail cell to his left, spotting Wyatt.
                                 WYATT
                        How you feeling? That was a pretty 
                        gnarly wipeout you had earlier.
                             (then)
                        You straight Nigel Beaverhausen-ed 
                        that shit, Man.

           Wyatt starts laughing. Nate joins along in the joke.

                                 KYLE
                             (angrily yelling back)
                        Hey, how about you just shut the 
                        fuck up already, Wyatt!

                                 WYATT
                        Come on, Man. Have a little fun.

                                 KYLE
                        Your fun is what got us into this 
                        mess to begin with.

                                 WYATT
                        What? No it’s not. It’s Nate’s 
                        fault for bringing us to that 
                        party to begin with.

           Nate angrily turns to Wyatt’s jail cell.

                                 NATE
                        Oh yeah? You’re really gonna say 
                        this is my fault?

                                 KYLE
                             (yelling, interrupting)
                        Can we all just stop for a minute?

           Kyle’s yell quickly shuts both Nate and Wyatt up.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        This isn’t one of your faults. 
                        It’s both!
                             (then)
                        I never asked to go to your party! 
                        I never asked to eat your fucking 
                        brownies. And when Aunt Rita and 
                        Uncle Jed couldn’t find you, I 
                        couldn’t have cared less about 
                        finding you.
                             (then)
                        Everything I’ve ever done, I’ve 
                        done because it’s what one of you 
                        two wanted. Now I’m being punished 
                        for it in the most extreme way. I 
                        hate you both so much! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        When this is over I don’t want to 
                        see your fucking stupid faces ever 
                        again!

           Kyle lets out the last breath of his angry rant. Nate and 
           Wyatt, visibly embarrassed, look away.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                             (then, chiming in)
                        You know your buddies are only in 
                        here because they came back for 
                        you, right?

           Kyle looks up, following the voice and spotting a 
           SECURITY GUARD. Surprised by this information, Kyle turns 
           to Wyatt, who shrugs back. Kyle then turns to Nate, who, 
           head lowered, nods back.

           The silent, tense moment is interrupted by a loud BUZZ 
           from the prison room door. The door opens, and a young 
           cop, OFFICER YATES, enters.

                                 OFFICER YATES
                        Yaacobi. Wyatt, Nathanial and 
                        Kyle. Detective Sergeant Barbosa 
                        would like a word with you three 
                        in her office. Now.

           The prison room door BUZZES once again as Wyatt, Nate and 
           Kyle’s cells are electronically opened. As the three step 
           out, Kyle looks over to Wyatt and Nate nervously.

           INT. POLICE STATION - SERGEANT BARBOSA OFFICE - DAY

           Nate, Kyle and Wyatt busy up the small office, sitting on 
           office chairs opposite the desk of County Police 
           Detective Sergeant MARLENE BARBOSA.

           Barbosa sits at her desk, reading a charging document.

                                 BARBOSA
                        Possession. Possession with the 
                        intent to sell--

           Nate stands up in shock.

                                 NATE
                        Selling? No. We aren’t selling an--

                        Avoiding arrest... Sit back down.

                        Three counts of petty theft for 
                        those skateboards you boys stole.
                             (then, to Wyatt)
                        And the phone we confiscated from 
                        you has three different torrented 
                        versions of Toy Story Three...

           Nate and Kyle look to Wyatt, who shakes his head.

                                 WYATT
                        I couldn’t find the English Dub.

           Nate turns back to Detective Sergeant Barbosa.

                                 NATE
                        Look, Ma’am. This is all just a 
                        giant misunderstanding.

           Barbosa takes off her glasses, motioning for Nate to sit.

                                 BARBOSA
                        That’s Detective Sergeant Ma’am to 
                        you, son. And if you don’t sit 
                        back down, I’ll throw all three of 
                        you back behind bars and let the 
                        judge determine your fate.

           Nate sits back down in his chair, quieting himself up. 
           Barbosa pulls out a plastic-wrapped bag of the brownies.

                                 BARBOSA (CONT'D)
                        We ran a detailed toxicology test 
                        on those sweets you were carrying, 
                        and found absurdly high traces of 
                        THC in each individual brownie.
                             (then, with seriousness)
                        This product is unregulated, 
                        potent, and highly dangerous. You 
                        could really mess someone up 
                        selling these out to the masses.

           A beat of silence lulls over the room. Nate and Kyle turn 
           to Wyatt. Wyatt turns back, shrugging in disappointment.

                                 WYATT
                        This is my fault. I stole those 
                        brownies at a party last night.
                             (then)
                        The only reason these two are here 
                        is because they were good cousins, 
                        and went to find me when I didn’t 
                        show up to services this morning. 
                        They’ve done nothing wrong.

                        If there’s a penalty to pay for 
                        this, it belongs to me. Not them.

           The boys comfort Wyatt, patting him on the back. Barbosa 
           nods, dropping the charging document onto the table.

                                 BARBOSA
                        I’m gonna be frank with you three.
                             (then)
                        We’ve been on the scent of a major 
                        drug ring for almost three months 
                        now. This is a very tip-top, 
                        coordinated effort, conducted by 
                        vetted, experienced individuals. 
                             (then, pointing to Wyatt)
                        This one has a juvenile offense 
                        for trespassing onto a farm and 
                        videotaping himself sucking a cow 
                        utter. Why would you even do that?

                                 WYATT
                        2010 was a different time...

           Barbosa leans in toward the boys.

                                 BARBOSA
                        Our bust earlier came from an 
                        anonymous call. But anyone with a 
                        little experience in this line of 
                        work can tell pretty straight 
                        forwardly that the whole deal was 
                        nothing more than a set-up.

                                 KYLE
                        What do you mean a set-up?

                                 BARBOSA
                        I don’t know. Every once in a 
                        while we see a situation where 
                        someone tries to protect their own 
                        skin in the game by throwing 
                        someone else under the bus.
                             (then)
                        I know you three aren’t the 
                        kingpins behind this operation. 
                        You’re too dumb.

                                 NATE
                        Well, have I just heard the most 
                        backhanded compliment or what?
                                 BARBOSA
                        But, you were caught red handed, 
                        with a list of offenses to each of 
                        your names, meaning you’ll be 
                        tried. And if you’re found guilty 
                        on these counts, you’ll likely get 
                        a couple months in Juvie.
                             (then, aside, to Wyatt)
                        Two to six years in federal for 
                        you, though. That cow utter shit 
                        will get you tried as an adult.

                                 WYATT
                        It always comes back to the cow 
                        utter shit.

                                 BARBOSA
                        Unless you three would be willing 
                        to work with us to bring in the 
                        real kingpin. Then, I could likely 
                        get you boys off Scott-Free.

           Barbosa sets her arms on the table, awaiting a response. 
           The boys look to one another, nodding in agreement.

                                 NATE
                        Listen, whatever it is we have to 
                        do. If it means no jail time, then 
                        you got yourself a deal.

                                 WYATT
                        Wait. Add the cow utter thing into 
                        the arrangement! We help you, and 
                        you take that video off the 
                        Internet using your police powers.

                                 BARBOSA
                             (shaking her head)
                        Sorry. You’re on your own on that 
                        one, Kid.

                                 WYATT
                             (a beat, then, nodding)
                        Touché...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Nate and Kyle tread back and forth on the grass. Wyatt 
           sits on a stone dam that looks over a small lake.

           As he looks out at the quiet lake, Wyatt’s phone rings. 
           Wyatt looks down to his phone, spotting that he has 
           seventeen new messages. He reads the most recent text.
           INSERT: “Get your puny ass to your Grandmother’s tonight 
           to break fast, or no Xbox for a whole year. XOXO, Dad.”

                                 WYATT
                             (putting phone away, then)
                        You guys think it’s nice in 
                        Mexico?

                                 NATE
                        I mean, probably... Why?

                                 WYATT
                        Well, after our chat with Mrs. 
                        Officer, I see it we got about 24 
                        hours to change our names and flee 
                        the country. I’m thinking Lance 
                        Calzone. I’ll go door to door 
                        selling Calzones to the Mexicans.

                                 NATE
                        Dude, you have to stop with this.

                                 WYATT
                        It’s not my fault you didn’t think 
                        of the name sooner, Nate.

           Kyle, pen and notepad out, turns to Wyatt.

                                 KYLE
                        We aren’t leaving the country.
                        We agreed with Detective Barbosa 
                        that we’re going to help bring in 
                        this kingpin. And if any of us has 
                        the info we need to do it, it’s 
                        you. So, let’s talk, Wy.

           Wyatt, taken aback, stands up and smirks to Nate.

                                 WYATT
                        What’s gotten into him? I’ve never 
                        seen him so snippy before.

                                 KYLE
                        You’ve never seen me stand between 
                        freedom and Juvie before.

                                 WYATT
                        Nate, you seeing this? Little Kyle 
                        wants to boss me around and tell 
                        me what to do. How cute is this?

           Kyle angrily runs over to Wyatt, getting into his grill 
           as he stares him down.
                                 KYLE
                             (speaking in Japanese)
                        Kimi wa boku no sonzai riyuu o 
                        ubatte shimatta.
                             (translation on screen)
                        You have taken away my life 
                        purpose.

                                 WYATT
                             (then, agitated)
                        What’s wrong with you, Man?

                                 NATE
                        You’ve angered him, Wyatt. Kyle 
                        yells in Naruto when he’s angry.

           Kyle cuts his gaze, catching his breath as he turns away.

                                 KYLE
                        I have only two wishes left at 
                        this point. To finish my story, 
                        and to not go to jail. So don’t 
                        you fucking mess with me, Wy.

           Wyatt steps back, nodding along.

                                 WYATT
                        Okay. Don’t plotz on me, Man.

                                 KYLE
                             (then, looking to notes)
                        Wyatt, while we were running, you 
                        mentioned a Ryan. Who is that?

                                 WYATT
                        Ryan is the kingpin. Ryan 
                        Guerrero. He graduated with me-- I 
                        think. Or maybe he didn’t graduate 
                        now that I think about it.
                             (then, remembering)
                        Oh my gosh! I forgot about Jamal.

                                 KYLE
                        What? What are you talking about?

                                 WYATT
                        Jamal. The little Asian boy that 
                        Ryan trapped in his basement to 
                        make his drugs! I promised Jamal 
                        I’d get him out.
                             (then)
                        Guys, what I said about Mexico. 
                        Forget it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYATT (CONT'D)
                        From now on, I’m focused on this 
                        mission. Jamal’s waiting for me!

           Kyle and Nate stare back at Wyatt for a solid beat.

                                 NATE
                        Wait. Do you mean Jaehwan?

                                 WYATT
                        He said his name was Jamal.

                                 NATE
                        There’s no Asian kid named Jamal, 
                        Wyatt.

                                 WYATT
                        That’s what I said and he yelled 
                        at me. He called me a fuckboy.

                                 NATE
                        That’s because you are a fuckboy.
                             (then)
                        Jaehwan is a kid in my Physics 
                        class. He once proved Mr. Howard’s 
                        two trains prompt wrong... But he 
                        hasn’t shown up to class for at 
                        least a month now. Are you saying 
                        Jaehwan is trapped in Ryan 
                        Guerrero’s basement?

                                 WYATT
                        I swear on my own mother.

                                 NATE
                        Okay, well don’t do that, because 
                        that’s also our aunt...

           Kyle excitedly steps forward, jotting notes.

                                 KYLE
                        Can you take us to this basement?

                                 WYATT
                        I mean, I can try.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The boys walk out of the woods, stepping into suburban 
           civilization as they turn onto the sidewalk.

                                 WYATT
                        Well, transparently, I was 
                        blindfolded. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYATT (CONT'D)
                        But I remember it like it was my 
                        own house. Small. Smelly. Lots of 
                        stairs.

                                 KYLE
                        In the time between the house and 
                        the school... how long would you 
                        say you were in the car?

                                 WYATT
                        I don’t know. I’d say about six, 
                        seven minutes.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay... That’s somewhere between a 
                        two to three mile proximity. Nate, 
                        search for townhouse communities 
                        within three miles of Ardwood.

           Nate pulls out his Android phone and begins a web search.

                                 NATE
                        On it.

                                 KYLE
                        Great. Now Wyatt. Think deep here. 
                        Who else have you met that may be 
                        involved in this drug ring?

                                 WYATT
                        Well, there’s this one guy who 
                        acts as the muscle of the 
                        operation. His name is--
                             (then)
                        Oh, fuck.

           Wyatt stops in his tracks, spotting a van directly ahead. 
           Adam Holland stands outside, awaiting the boys.

           Adam, holding a pellet pistol in his hand, taps his 
           pistol on the van’s metal door loudly.

                                 ADAM
                        Time for a ride, Boys.

                                 NATE
                        Wyatt. Who’s that?

                                 WYATT
                             (nervously)
                        That’s him.

                                 NATE
                        That’s Oh Fuck?
                                 WYATT
                        Yeah. Just act cool and follow me.

           Wyatt, clearly trying to look cool, slowly struts over to 
           the van. Nate and Kyle shake their heads as they follow.

           INT. ADAM’S VAN - DAY

           The boys enter, stuffing themselves into the back seat. 
           Adam steps into the driver’s seat. He turns to the boys.

                                 ADAM
                        So, if it isn’t the three little 
                        troublemakers.

           Wyatt, Nate and Kyle look back nervously.

                                 WYATT
                             (nervously professing)
                        Look, Adam. I know we’ve had our 
                        hardships in the past, but I 
                        promise you. Just let us live, and 
                        I’ll let you do whatever you want 
                        with me. Anything. Say the word.

           Adam shakes his head in disgust.

                                 ADAM
                        What? No. No. I’m not gonna kill 
                        you. Are you crazy?

           The boys sit in the back of the van, semi-relieved.

                                 NATE
                             (then, raising his hand)
                        Um. Okay. If I may, Mr. Adam. If 
                        you’re not gonna kill us, then why 
                        are we in the back of your van?

           Kyle reaches into his pocket, taking out his notepad.

                                 ADAM
                        Look, I followed you three from 
                        the station.

                             KYLE
           Mhm. Fascinating.
                                                          NATE
                                              Wouldn’t have thought that.

                                 ADAM
                        And I’m no stranger to a 
                        shakedown. I take it they let you 
                        out in exchange for helping them 
                        catch Ryan?
           The boys look back in surprise.

                                 WYATT
                        How did you know that?

                                 KYLE
                        Wait. He may not know anything. 
                        He’s just saying this in hopes we 
                        admit we worked out a plea...
                             (realizing his mistake)
                        I mean... Fuck.

                                 WYATT
                        Fine. You got it out of us. We 
                        worked out a plea in order to 
                        catch your boss. What’s it to you?

                                 ADAM
                        Everything. Ryan’s gone off the 
                        rails. He’s hell-bent on 
                        controlling the DMV area drug 
                        scene... That’s why he set you 
                        three up. To cover his trail.
                             (a beat, then)
                        It seems we have a common enemy. 
                        I’d like to team up. I help you 
                        three put Ryan behind bars, and we 
                        can all clean our slate of this 
                        once and for all. What do you say?

                                 WYATT
                        It depends. Can you take videos 
                        involving cow utters off the web?

                                 NATE
                        Shut up about your cow utters.
                             (then, to Adam)
                        This sounds great and all, but I’m 
                        still lost. Why would Ryan set me 
                        and Kyle up? He doesn’t know us.

                                 ADAM
                             (pointing to Wyatt)
                        Oh. Well, he tried to set you and 
                        Meggie up. But I guess the message 
                        was lost in translation... 
                             (then)
                        Apparently she cheated on him with 
                        another guy last night. And, well, 
                        he’s furious.

           Kyle’s eyes pop open in shock.
                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        I mean, I’ve seen Ryan mad before. 
                        But this... If he ever discovered 
                        who hooked up with Meggie last 
                        night, he would...
                             (then)
                        I worry just thinking about it. 
                        Hopefully that’ll never happen.

           Kyle looks around nervously.

                                 WYATT
                        Geez. Sounds like that person 
                        would be toast.

                                 ADAM
                        Toast indeed.
                             (then)
                        Well, anyway. Are you guys in on 
                        this plan, or what?

           Nate and Wyatt nod their heads. Kyle nervously smiles.

           INT. DIANNA'S HOME - SUNSET

           The home is decorated for company. A platter of food 
           traditional for breaking fast lays out on a large table.

           Don and Jed eat Nova Lox bagels from the table as Kath 
           and Rina furiously type on their phones.

                                 KATH
                        I just don’t get it. The boys are 
                        seeing our texts, right?
                             (then, turning to Don)
                        Or maybe they’re not getting them?

                                 DON
                        They’re getting them. Believe me. 
                        I’ve seen our family cell bills.

                                 RINA
                        Wyatt’s read receipts say he’s 
                        seen every one of my texts. I even 
                        threatened to take away his Dairy 
                        Queen privileges and still 
                        nothing.

                                 JED
                        Kid’s a fuckboy. What’d you 
                        expect?
                                 DON
                        Okay. Look. I know we’re all 
                        feeling a little bit worried right 
                        now. But, at least it brings me 
                        some solace knowing that we’re 
                        dealing with all this together.

           Rina and Jed angrily turn to Don.

                                 RINA
                        The fuck is that supposed to mean?

                                 JED
                        I knew it was a bad idea to let 
                        our beautiful angel hang out with 
                        your two little devil-children.

           Don angrily turns to Jed.

                                 DON
                        Oh yeah? Devil children? Your kid 
                        is the one who taught my boys what 
                        a brown eye was.

                                 JED
                        Well, it’s a good thing he did, or 
                        else they’d never know.

                                 DON
                        Oh fuck you, Jed.

           Don drops his plate. Jed angrily takes a big bite of his 
           nova lox, dropping his plate and staring back at Don.

           Don and Jed go at it, tussling and pulling at each 
           other’s hair as Rina and Kath shake their heads.

           INT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - TOOL SHED - NIGHT

           Nate, Kyle, Wyatt and Adam burst into the shed. Adam 
           carries a large postal tube in his arm.

           INT. WCA TOOL SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           The boys all sit down. Adam sets the postal tube down on 
           a foldable table beside Barack O-Bong-A.

                                 ADAM
                        Tonight Ryan’s making a deal with 
                        the Washington Catholic Academy’s 
                        prime dealer, Blake Mcgowan. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        It’s important we catch him in the 
                        act if we want to take him down.

           The boys watch attentively as Adam unravels the tube, 
           revealing a large poster blueprint of a suburban mansion.

                                 ADAM
                        This is how it’s gonna go...

           We hold on the mansion’s blueprint image as we--

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. RYAN GUERRERO TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           Adam stands outside Ryan’s house. He knocks on the door.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        At eight-thirty p.m. I arrive at 
                        Ryan’s townhome.

           After a beat, Ryan opens the door, letting Adam in.

           As Adam steps inside, Ryan looks out, checking both ways 
           before walking inside and closing the door behind him.

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           INT. RYAN GUERRERO TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Ryan paces nervously. Adam stands and talks inaudibly.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        I explain the bust. That the 
                        county police have captured you 
                        three and that we’re in the clear.

           Ryan smiles, cheering as his anxiety dissipates.

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           INT. RYAN GUERRERO TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - LATER

           Now, at the basement workstation, we see a large metal 
           tin slide onto the table. The lid reads, “Pudgy Fudgy.”

           Ryan takes the top off the tin, setting evenly sized 
           squares of brownies down into the container. Ryan fills 
           the tin to the brim, closing the lid and crossing.

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:
           EXT. RYAN GUERRERO TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           Ryan and Adam exit through the front door. Adam heads 
           toward a convertible Jaguar XJ8 car parked outside. 

           Ryan locks the front door of the townhouse, walking over 
           and stepping into the passenger seat of the car.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        At nine p.m. Ryan and I leave the 
                        house and head over to Blake 
                        Mcgowan’s party. We’ll drive out, 
                        turn the corner...

           The car backs up, turning onto the road.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        And at nine o’one you three enter.

           As the car drives away, Wyatt’s head pops out of the 
           shrubbery. Wyatt looks out, then waves in Nate and Kyle.

           Nate and Kyle cross in, helping Wyatt out of the bushes. 
           The three walk toward the house garage. Kyle plugs a 
           combination into the garage keypad and the garage opens.

           The three walk into the garage, as we--

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           INT. RYAN GUERRERO TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Kyle, Nate and Wyatt walk down the basement staircase. 
           Jaehwan’s face lights up at the sight of Wyatt.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        You three enter the basement and 
                        free Jaehwan.

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           INT. RYAN GUERRERO TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - LATER

           Jaehwan slides a Pudgy Fudgy tin onto the workbench. He 
           takes off the lid, revealing the tin’s empty insides.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Then, with Jaehwan’s help. You’ll 
                        dummy up the tin with a tape 
                        recorder. This way, we’ll be able 
                        to record everything that’s said 
                        during the deal.
           Jaehwan places a tape recorder at the bottom of the tin 
           and turns it on. He then conceals the recorder under a 
           red, circular cardboard trap door.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Fill it, close the lid, and take 
                        it along with you.

           The boys fill the tin with brownies and cover it with its 
           signature lid. Kyle carries the tin as the boys cross.

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           EXT. RYAN GUERRERO TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           Nate starts the car. Kyle sits in the passenger seat. 
           Wyatt sits backseat, waving to Jaehwan as the car pulls 
           out of the driveway.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        At nine-thirty p.m. you three load 
                        the car and drive off.

           Nate’s car turns onto the street. Jaehwan waves back. As 
           Nate’s car drives down the quiet lamp-lit street, we--

                                                              WHIP PAN TO:

           INT. WASHINGTON CATHOLIC ACADEMY - TOOL SHED - NIGHT

           Back in the shed, Adam concludes his step-by-step 
           voiceover spiel. Nate, Wyatt and Kyle listen intently.

                                 ADAM
                        Kyle and Nate. I’ll set out some 
                        clothes in the garage for you two 
                        to change into.
                             (then)
                        You’ll enter Blake’s party and 
                        swap the tins out by ten-fifteen 
                        so that Ryan has the dummy tin by 
                        the time of his meeting.

           Adam goes into a bag beside him, taking out walkie-
           talkies and handing one to each boy.

                                 ADAM
                             (re: walkie)
                        We’ll use these to communicate 
                        with each other through the night.
                             (then)
                        Any questions?
           Kyle raises his hand. Adam points to him.

                                 KYLE
                        What do we do if one of us is in 
                        trouble?

           Adam holds a walkie up to his face, showing the boys.

                                 ADAM
                        If you’re in danger, codeword is 
                        Frankenweenie.

           The boys confusedly nod back. Nate raises his hand.

                                 NATE
                        Why Frankenweenie?

                                 ADAM
                        It’s my little cousin’s favorite 
                        movie. That a problem?
                             (as the boys shrug)
                        Guys. This is literally a word 
                        we’d only need to use if something 
                        goes wrong.

           The boys stare back nervously.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeaaaaah...

                                 WYATT
                        Can we do something maybe more 
                        festive? Like Mazel Tov? Knishes?

           Adam flails his arms, giving in.

                                 ADAM
                        Okay then. Codeword is Mazel Tov. 
                        Now, any important questions?

           A long beat, then Wyatt raises his hand.

                                 WYATT
                        Yeah. Well, you mentioned Nate and 
                        Kyle in the plan once we get to 
                        Blake’s. But you didn’t mention 
                        me? What do you want me to do?

           Adam turns, staring at Wyatt for a long beat.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, right. Ummmm...

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. NATE’S CAR / EXT. MCGOWAN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Wyatt, dressed in sweats, sits in the driver’s seat of 
           Nate’s Prius. He yells out the window to Nate and Kyle.

                                 WYATT
                        This is so fucking unfair. I have 
                        to sit in the fucking pixie wagon 
                        all night while you two get to 
                        party in a mansion?

           Nate and Kyle, looking polished-up in button down polos 
           and Khakies, stand outside on the lawn beside the 
           mansion’s long driveway. Kyle wears his lucky jacket.

                                 NATE
                        First off. It’s not a pixie wagon, 
                        it’s a getaway car.

                                 WYATT
                        Your fucking dashboard lights up 
                        when you plug in an aux cord. You 
                        think The General Lee did that?

                                 KYLE
                        Wyatt. Adam made it very clear. 
                        Stay back in the getaway car, and 
                        call for help if something goes 
                        wrong. You can’t come inside. If 
                        Ryan saw you he’d get suspicious.

                                 WYATT
                        Man, I never get any action. Now I 
                        don’t even get to shoot my shot?
                             (then)
                        This is unconstitutional. George 
                        Washington Carver would not 
                        approve.

           Kyle and Nate look back in confusion.

                                 KYLE
                        George Washington Car--
                             (stopping himself)
                        Wait. Do you really not know who 
                        the first president of the United 
                        States was?

                                 WYATT
                        I just said it, stupid.
                             (off their confused faces)
                        And he would not be happy to hear 
                        that you two are keeping me from 
                        getting my artichoke squeezed...
                                 NATE
                        Dude. Can’t you just shut up and 
                        watch Porn or something?

           Wyatt looks back-- a lightbulb going off in his head.

                                 WYATT
                             (deceivingly)
                        I cannot believe you’d suggest I 
                        just sit here and watch porn all 
                        night without distraction. How 
                        disgusting.
                             (then, in a hurry)
                        Okay, don’t you guys have to like, 
                        go inside now or something?

           Nate and Kyle look away from Wyatt, concealing their 
           smiles as they turn to one another. 

           The two stare at each other for a serious beat. Nate 
           hands Kyle the Pudgy Fudgy tin.

                                 NATE
                        You ready for this?

           Kyle nods and stuffs the tin into his jacket.

           The two turn, stepping off of the lawn and walking onto 
           the mansion’s long concrete driveway.

           EXT. MCGOWAN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           MUSIC CUE: “CLIQUE” BY KANYE WEST 

           We follow Nate and Kyle as they cross in, walking up the 
           driveway toward a sprawling suburban mansion. 

           Preppy-dressed Partygoers walk amongst them, holding 
           liquor bottles and 30-packs as they near the mansion.

           INT. MCGOWAN MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           A Chandelier hangs over a sprawling party venue. A DJ 
           stands behind a booth, bumping along to his mix. Strobe 
           lights refract off the Chandelier’s glass, bouncing 
           through the ballroom.

           Partygoers are spread about, drinking and dancing on the 
           dance floor. Elevated tables rest on both ends of the 
           ballroom dance floor.
           Nate and Kyle enter the ballroom, flabbergasted as they 
           eye the luxurious scene around them. 

                                 NATE
                        If only Tony Kang could see this.

           Nate and Kyle prop up at an elevated table.

                                 KYLE
                        This house party would be like if 
                        Tony Kang’s house party died and 
                        went to house party Heaven.

           A WAITER arrives at the table with a tray of appetizers.

                                 WAITER
                        Smoked Salmon?

           Nate and Kyle light up with excitement. They rush for the 
           Waiter’s plate, taking more than a modest helping each.

                                 NATE
                             (taking a bite, delighted)
                        Ughhh. It’s so good.

                                 KYLE
                             (as he bites in)
                        I could not think of one better 
                        food to break fast to.

           The waiter nods, smirking as he crosses off.

                                 WAITER
                             (softly, in German accent)
                        Jews.

           Nate looks down to his watch, checking for the time.

           INSERT: Nate’s analog watch reads 10:09.

           Nate looks up, turning toward the ballroom entrance. 

           On Nate’s turn, Ryan and Adam enter-- right on cue. Ryan, 
           carrying the tin of brownies to his side, walks with Adam 
           to a table on the other end of the ballroom. 

           Nate, eyeing Ryan and Adam’s entrance, turns to Kyle. He 
           taps his nose (a la The Sting), nodding in Ryan’s general 
           direction. Kyle looks down to his watch.

           INSERT: Kyle’s digital Naruto watch reads 10:10.

           Kyle looks up, nodding to Nate. Nate then turns, heading 
           across the ballroom floor. Kyle stays put, keeping watch.
           AT THE OTHER END OF THE BALLROOM:

           Nate walks over to Ryan’s table, interrupting.

                                 NATE
                        Hey. I’m so sorry to bug you man, 
                        but I couldn’t help but notice... 
                        You’re the guy who rolled in with 
                        the XJ8, right?

           Ryan turns, sizing Nate up.

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah. What about it?

                                 NATE
                        I think I just saw some kids 
                        messing with your hood ornament.

                                 RYAN
                        Are you fucking--
                             (turns, snaps at Adam)
                        Keys. Keys.

           Adam digs into his pocket, pulling out Ryan’s keys. He 
           tosses them to Ryan. Ryan catches them.

                                 RYAN
                        Stay here and keep watch.
                             (then, motioning to Nate)
                        Come with me. Show me who you saw.

           Kyle, on the other side of the ballroom, watches Ryan and 
           Nate cross outside. As Ryan and Nate exit the ballroom, 
           Adam gives Kyle The Sting gesture, motioning him to come.

           Kyle nods, nervously walking across the ballroom floor. 
           Partygoers grind, twerk, and Dougie all around him as he 
           squeezes himself through the congested dance space.

           Kyle digs into his jacket, pulling out the dummy tin. 
           Feet from the table, he prepares to swap the tins, as--

           Meggie crosses in, stopping in the line between Kyle and 
           the table. She looks to Adam.

                                 MEGGIE
                        Adam, do you know where Ryan wen--
                             (then, spotting Kyle)
                        Kyle?

           Kyle stops in his tracks, quickly concealing the brownie 
           tin back into his jacket.
                                 KYLE
                             (nervously)
                        Meg-- Meggie?

           Adam steps in.

                                 ADAM
                        You two know each other?

                            MEGGIE
           Uh. No.
                                                          KYLE
                                              No. What a crazy thought...

           Adam stares back suspiciously for a beat. A silence looms 
           over the three-- and is broken as Ryan crosses back in.

                                 RYAN
                             (then, to Adam)
                        False alarm. Couldn’t find anyone 
                        out there. I convinced that dumb 
                        kid to watch my car, though.

           Then, spotting Meggie, Ryan wraps his arm around her.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh, hey Babe. Nice to see you.

           Meggie turns to Ryan. The two kiss. Adam turns to Kyle, 
           shrugging as he notes the tin with his eyes.

           Kyle takes the hint, quickly grabbing the dummy tin from 
           under his jacket. Without blinking an eye, Kyle swaps the 
           tin on the table out with his dummy tin. He quickly 
           stuffs Ryan’s tin into his jacket, then looks to Adam, 
           nodding.

           Meggie and Ryan break out of their kiss. Ryan smiles to 
           Meggie, then checks his watch.

           INSERT: Ryan’s digital watch turns from 10:14 to 10:15.

                                 RYAN
                             (then, looking to Meggie)
                        Sorry to make this short, but we 
                        gotta go. Have an important 
                        meeting scheduled.

           Ryan leans down toward the table and takes his tin. On 
           his way back up, he trades a glance with Kyle, who 
           nervously stares back. Ryan points to Kyle, confused.

                                 RYAN
                        And, uh, who are you?

           Kyle nervously pauses. Meggie then speaks up for him.
                                 MEGGIE
                        This is my friend Kyle. He’s in my 
                        class and wanted to say hi before 
                        he left. Isn’t that right, Kyle?

           Kyle terrified, stares mindlessly at Ryan.

                                 KYLE
                             (coming to his senses)
                        Yes. Yes that’s right.

           A long beat as Ryan looks back at Kyle inquisitively.

                                 RYAN
                        You look familiar? Do I know you?

                                 KYLE
                        No-- No, I don’t think so.

           Ryan stares for a second longer, then nods back.

                                 RYAN
                        Are you fucking cool, Kyle?

                                 KYLE
                             (a beat, then, nervously)
                        Um, sure. Yeah, I’m cool.

           Ryan smirks to himself.

                                 RYAN
                        Okay. Then prove it.

           Ryan removes the lid of the tin, showcasing the brownies 
           to Kyle. Kyle stares at the tin for a nervous beat.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                             (then, aggressively)
                        Show me that you’re cool.

           Kyle turns to Adam, who shares a nervous glance.

           Kyle then turns back to Ryan, staring for a beat then 
           nodding. He takes a brownie from the tin, and slowly puts 
           it up to his mouth. Meggie and Adam watch back nervously.

           Kyle takes his time as he slowly bites into the brownie. 
           Ryan nods, smiling as Kyle chews and swallows.

                                 RYAN
                             (then, patronizing)
                        Mhm. Nice to meet you, Kyle.
           Ryan turns away, motioning for Adam to follow. He waves 
           goodbye to Meggie, then crosses.

                                 KYLE
                             (as Ryan crosses)
                        Nice to meet you...

           Meggie and Kyle, now alone at the table, turn to each 
           other. Kyle shrugs. Meggie scoffs, then crosses away.

           Kyle, distraught, shakes his head as he turns, crossing.

           EXT. MCGOWAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Kyle walks down the driveway to the getaway Prius. Wyatt 
           sits inside, parked in the same spot as before. Nate, 
           leaning on the hood, turns to Kyle as he approaches.

                                 NATE
                             (excited)
                        How’d it go?

                                 KYLE
                        Fine.

           Kyle pulls Ryan’s brownie tin out from under his jacket 
           and drops it in the passenger seat of the car.

                                 WYATT
                        That wasn’t convincing.

                                 KYLE
                        Neither is your Mexican accent.

           Nate turns to Kyle.

                                 NATE
                        What’s going on with you, Kyle?

                                 KYLE
                        Nothing. I’m just trying to focus 
                        on my payback. How about you?

           As Kyle stares to Nate and Wyatt, the boys’ walkie-
           talkies begin to go off.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                             (through walkie)
                        The Eagle has landed. Engage alpha 
                        two protocol.

           Kyle then turns, leading the way back to the mansion.
           Nate, spotting Kyle walk away, quickly rushes after him.

                                 WYATT
                             (now by himself)
                        Okay... Good luck you guys.

           Wyatt stares out the window, watching as the boys leave 
           eyesight. He then begins to unbutton his pants.

                                 WYATT
                        Now back to my Wy time.

           INT. MCGOWAN MANSION - VIP SECTION - NIGHT

           MUSIC CUE: “THUG WAFFLE” BY FLATBUSH ZOMBIES

           Ryan and Adam walk through a set of beaded shell curtains 
           as they enter a secluded hallway.

           Adam looks around, surprised by everything happening 
           around him-- kids drinking, taking lines, playing darts, 
           dropping it low on stripper poles.

           Overwhelmed, Adam turns forward, following Ryan as he 
           approaches another door. DEWSHANE, Blake’s bodyguard, 
           stands watch, motioning for Ryan to stop.

           Ryan ignores, crossing through the door, and entering the 
           other room. Adam follows suit, crossing--

                                 DEWSHANE
                        Woah woah. He’s in a meeting.

           INT. MCGOWAN MANSION - BLAKE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ryan and Adam enter, spotting BLAKE MCGOWAN (18, a Nate 
           Jacobs-type) sitting behind an office desk as he looks up 
           at the ceiling. Spotting the door open, Blake turns.

                                 BLAKE
                             (caught off guard)
                        Woah, ever heard of knocking.

           A GIRL pops up from under his desk and rushes away. Blake 
           recomposes himself. Dewshane enters from behind.

                                 DEWSHANE
                        Excuse me. You two can’t be back--

                                 BLAKE
                             (interrupting)
                        No, D. It’s all good.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BLAKE (CONT'D)
                             (spotting the brownie tin)
                        This is exactly the man I’ve been 
                        waiting for.

           EXT. MCGOWAN MANSION - NIGHT

           Nate and Kyle walk back up the long mansion drive-way. 
           Kyle angrily storms forward. Nate catches up from behind.

                                 NATE
                        Yo. Cool it, Man. What’s got your 
                        panties in a bundle?

           Kyle stops, he looks down to the ground, taking a beat.

                                 KYLE
                        I’ve lost, Nate. Meggie won’t ever 
                        like me. I’ll never be the writer 
                        I want to be. I’ll just always be 
                        a loser like everyone in this 
                        fucking town.

                                 NATE
                        This is all because that girl 
                        isn’t interested in you?

           Kyle, angered, walks away.

                                 KYLE
                        Fuck off.

                                 NATE
                        Come on. Just talk to me.

           Nate, chasing after Kyle, grabs his arm. Kyle looks back.

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Kyle. You’re the most gifted, 
                        hardworking, fucking encyclopedia-
                        brained human I known. And I’m not 
                        saying that just to make you stop 
                        whining. You’re bound for 
                        greatness. And I’m thankful to see 
                        that greatness in my own blood.
                             (then)
                        I’d hate to say it out loud, but 
                        you’re kinda the hero we all need, 
                        but don’t deserve.

           Kyle smirks at the comment.
                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        That’s why I say, with all 
                        sincerity, it’s time you fucking 
                        recognize it. You don’t need this 
                        chick to prove how great you are.

           Kyle takes a beat to absorb Nate’s comment. He nods back.

           INT. MCGOWAN MANSION - BLAKE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Blake sits at his desk-- Dewshane by his side. Ryan sets 
           his tin on the desk. 

           Blake opens the tin, looking down in awe as he rests his 
           eyes on the brownies.

                                 BLAKE
                        So this is it. The holy grail.
                             (then)
                        I must admit, I’ve been excitedly 
                        awaiting the day I’d get to see 
                        your goods with my own eyes. I’ve 
                        heard so much about them.

           Ryan, complimented, smiles back.

                                 RYAN
                        Word spreads fast when the news is 
                        good. You let me sell these on 
                        your school grounds, and I’ll give 
                        you ten percent of my profits.

           Blake smiles at the offer. He lets it settle for a beat.

                                 BLAKE
                        Unfortunately, the news I’ve heard 
                        is not all good.
                             (then)
                        My sources tell me that you have 
                        some heat on your trail.

                                 RYAN
                        I assure you, whatever you heard, 
                        it’s handled. The scent is lost.

           Blake looks down at the brownies as they rest in the tin.

                                 BLAKE
                        Well, as happy as I am to hear 
                        it... I’m still not assured.
                             (then)
                        I want forty percent. Then you can 
                        sell on my grounds.
                                 RYAN
                             (infuriated)
                        You’re crazy.

                                 BLAKE
                        Forty percent of your profits. 
                        Otherwise, the liability is truly 
                        just not worth it for me.
                             (then)
                        Either that, or, you can go back 
                        to selling on public school turf. 
                        Your call.

           Blake leans back in his chair. Ryan turns to Adam. Adam 
           looks back, shaking his head no. Aggravated, Ryan turns.

                                 RYAN
                        You know what?
                             (sighing, defeated)
                        You have yourself a deal.

                                 BLAKE
                        Good. That’s what I was hoping.

           Blake smirks, leaning forward and placing the brownie tin 
           on his lap. Reaching into the tin, he picks out a brownie 
           and inspects it thoroughly.

                                 BLAKE (CONT'D)
                        Your product will be very popular 
                        on my grounds.
                             (mesmerized by brownie)
                        And, with my influence, I expect 
                        we’ll see a major uptick of sales 
                        within the next three months--

           Before he can finish, a GUNSHOT goes off, shooting Blake 
           right in the chest.

           Blake falls out of his chair and onto the ground. The 
           tin, and all the brownies inside of it, fly into the air.

           Dewshane runs for the door. But, before he can escape, a 
           bullet shoots him down. Dewshane falls, joining Blake, 
           and the tin on the ground.

           Adam nervously looks down at the mess below him. He turns 
           to Ryan, who now stands with his pistol in his hand. Ryan 
           takes another shot at Blake, then holsters his pistol.

           Adam, speechless, reaches down to his walkie, 
           nonchalantly pressing down on the talk button.
                                 ADAM
                             (quiet, nervously)
                        Mazel Tov. Mazel Tov.

           EXT. MCGOWAN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           The party continues to go on inside. Nate and Kyle reach 
           the front doorstep, when--

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                             (through walkie)
                        Mazel Tov. Mazel Tov.

           Nate and Kyle turn, quickly staring at one another 
           anxiously for a beat. The two then nod, running inside.

           EXT. MCGOWAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Wyatt sits in the driver’s seat of the getaway Prius, 
           watching PornHub on his phone.

                                 PORNHUB GIRL (O.S.)
                             (moaning, through phone)
                        Ohhh. Ohhh, fuck.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                             (then, through walkie)
                        Mazel Tov. Mazel Tov.

           Wyatt, taken aback, quickly turns to his Android phone, 
           flipping off PornHub and switching to his dial-pad.

           Wyatt dials “911”. He clicks “call”, waiting for the 
           phone to dial-- as his screen turns black.

           A “charge battery” visual appears on Wyatt’s screen.

                                 WYATT
                             (with a heavy sigh)
                        No! Damn you, PornHub.

           Wyatt frantically puts his phone into the car’s USB 
           adapter. As he does, the dashboard changes colors. Wyatt 
           impatiently sits, letting the phone charge.

                                 WYATT
                        C’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon.

           Wyatt looks down at the phone, checking its charge. The 
           phone continues to show the charge battery screen.
                                 WYATT
                        Ahhhhhhh.

           INT. MCGOWAN MANSION - BLAKE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ryan leans down, checking Blake’s pulse.

                                 ADAM
                        Wha-- what did you do that for?

           Ryan begins to pick up the brownies on the floor.

                                 RYAN
                        He was mocking me. You heard it. 
                        He thought he could take advantage 
                        of me. Well, that’s what he gets.

                                 ADAM
                        Are you joking? He was harmless. 
                        You just shot a kid, Ryan! How are 
                        you going to explain this?

           Ryan ignores Adam, reaching for the flipped over brownie 
           tin. He flips the tin over, revealing the voice recorder 
           inside of it. Ryan stares concernedly at the recorder.

                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                             (off Ryan’s silence)
                        Are you listening to me?

           Ryan holds the recorder in his hand, turned away from 
           Adam so he cannot see it.

                                 RYAN
                        I don’t know. How about you tell 
                        me?

           Ryan slowly stands up from the ground. As he gets up, he 
           turns, facing Adam as he holds the recorder in his hand.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        Did you do this, Adam?

           Spotting the recorder in Ryan’s hands, Adam slowly puts 
           his hands up. He motions for Ryan to stay calm.

                                 ADAM
                        Look. I can explain.

           Ryan pulls out his gun, slowly stepping closer to Adam.
                                 RYAN
                        I trusted you, Adam. I trusted you 
                        and this is how you pay me back?

           Ryan stops, pointing the gun at Adam as he aims his shot.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        No more explaining.

           Ryan squeezes the trigger, FIRING, as the door flies 
           opens, hitting Ryan and knocking him to the ground.

           Nate and Kyle enter the room, quickly rushing over to 
           Adam, who now hunches over on the ground. Nate spots 
           Adam’s foot bleeding from the gunshot.

                                 NATE
                        Adam. Adam. Are you alright?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m fine. Don’t worry about me. 
                        Get Ryan!

           Nate tends to Adam as Kyle turns away, scanning the room 
           and spotting two dead bodies and a gun on the ground. 

           Looking away from the gun, he then spots Ryan, slowly 
           shaking off the fall as he starts to get back up.

           Ryan looks up, collecting his bearings and spotting Kyle. 
           The two stare down for a beat, focusing on the gun.

           Then, like one strong seismic wave to the frontal lobe, 
           the brownie hits Kyle’s system. His vision warps-- the 
           room slowly turning into a kaleidoscope image.

           Kyle watches as what appears to be nine different Ryans 
           all get up from the ground and rush toward the gun. Kyle 
           quickly comes to his senses, sprinting forward.

           It’s neck and neck. Ryan swoops down, reaching for the 
           gun. Kyle sprints with full-force, sliding past Ryan as 
           he picks up the gun and grasps it in his hand.

           Spotting the gun in Kyle’s hand, Ryan turns, booking it 
           out of the room. In a fog, Kyle turns to Nate and Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        Run! Chase him down!

           Kyle nods, turning and running after Ryan.
           INT. MCGOWAN MANSION - VIP SECTION - CONTINUOUS

           Party-goers, oblivious to everything around them, party 
           on. Ryan pushes party-goers out of the way, rushing 
           through the VIP section shell curtains. Kyle follows.

           INT. MCGOWAN MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           The DJ blasts music through his speaker-- it plays slowly 
           and ominously through the ballroom like the Halo song.

           A door to the ballroom opens as Ryan makes a beeline to 
           the mansion entrance. Kyle follows from close behind.

           EXT. MCGOWAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Wyatt sits, impatiently waiting for his phone to charge.

                                 WYATT
                        Okay, let’s do this now.

           Wyatt checks his phone status, still seeing the “charge 
           battery” visual on the phone screen.

                                 WYATT
                        You have to be kidding me!

           Wyatt frustratedly takes his phone out of the charger and 
           throws it at the windshield. Off its ricochet, the phone 
           lands in Wyatt’s lap and loads a welcome screen.

                                 WYATT
                        Oh, fuck you, Google.

           Wyatt dials “911”. He sits, waiting for the line to 
           connect, as he looks out the windshield.

           As he looks forward, Wyatt spots Ryan furiously sprinting 
           away from the mansion.

                                 DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                             (through phone)
                        9-1-1, what’s your emergency?

           Wyatt continues to look out the window, now spotting 
           Kyle, running after Ryan with a gun in his hand.

                                 WYATT
                             (focused on the chase)
                        Hey, one second.
                                 DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                        Okay...

           Wyatt grabs the brownie tin and steps out of the car. He 
           runs after the two, holding his phone to his ear.

                                 WYATT
                        Okay, hi. This is Wyatt Yaacobi 
                        calling. I need to be directed to 
                        Detective Sergeant Barbosa 
                        immediately. It’s an emergency.

           Wyatt rushes forward, chasing after Kyle.

           EXT. BACKYARD - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           Ryan runs through various backyards, ducking swing sets, 
           dogs and sprinkler systems. Kyle follows close behind.

           Ryan grabs the stake of a badminton net out from the 
           ground and throws it back at Kyle.

           Kyle spots the stake coming at him in kaleidoscope 
           vision. He leans back, doing the Matrix limbo as he 
           dodges the stake. Then, recomposing himself, Kyle sprints 
           forward, crossing--

           INT. DIANNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Adults and their children walk about, playing games and 
           schmoozing with each other as they eat off small plates.

           Kath and Don talk to GUS (80s), the family’s great uncle. 
           He looks like a turtle. Kath and Don listen as they eat.

                                 GUS
                             (slow and incongruently)
                        Then I decided to take my manure 
                        and put it in my living room. That 
                        way, I wouldn’t have to go outside 
                        when I was feeling runny, you see?

           Kath, disgusted, looks away, spotting Dianna walking by 
           out of the corner of her eye. She looks disappointed.

                                 KATH
                        Excuse me for a second--

           Kath exits the conversation, walking over to Dianna.
                                 KATH
                        Hey, Di. I just wanted to say. I’m 
                        so impressed with that platter you 
                        put together. So beautiful.

                                 DIANNA
                             (aloof)
                        Oh. Thank you, Katherine.

                                 KATH
                        Anything else we can help with?

                                 DIANNA
                        Nothing you can do. I just wish my 
                        grandchildren cared to show up.

           Dianna sighs, crossing away and leaving Kath by herself.

           EXT. BACKYARD - VARIOUS - DAY

           Kyle continues to chase Ryan-- their breath getting 
           heavier and heavier as they run.

                                 KYLE
                             (exhausted)
                        Stop. Running!

                                 RYAN
                             (just as tired)
                        Fuck. Off.

           Ryan turns forward, spotting a tall wooden fence ahead of 
           him. He quickly changes course, rushing uphill to a 
           nearby road. Kyle pivots along with Ryan, turning.

           EXT. DIANNA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ryan runs up from the backyard, jumping over a garden of 
           roses planted in the front yard, and crossing--

           Kyle runs up from the backyard, arriving at the garden.

                                 KYLE
                        Stop resisting. Stop resisting--

           Kyle hurdles the tall rose garden, getting snagged on a 
           thorn in the process. Losing his balance, Kyle falls to 
           the ground, generating a loud THUD. His gun falls out, 
           flying onto the lawn.
           INT. DIANNA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Gus stands by the door, continuing his chat with Don.

                                 GUS
                        Most people my age can’t poop. Me, 
                        I cant stop pooping! I don’t unde--

           A loud THUD from outside grabs Gus’s attention. Gus turns 
           toward the door window, looking out and spotting Kyle.

                                 GUS
                        Oh my! There’s a boy trapped in 
                        your rose garden, Dianna.

           Don runs to the door, spotting Kyle on the ground.

                                 DON
                             (looking out window)
                        Kyle?

           The comment grabs the attention of Dianna, who quickly 
           walks over to the front door.

           Don, Dianna, Kath, and the extended Yaacobi family now 
           huddle at the door, looking out the front door window.

           EXT. DIANNA’S HOME - FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle lays on the ground, grabbing his back in pain.

           Ryan stops, turning back around at Kyle. Now spotting his 
           gun on the ground, Ryan smirks. He walks toward it.

                                 RYAN
                        So, this is the fucking kid.
                             (then)
                        I recognize you now. You’re the 
                        kid from the boner video. You’re 
                        the one who hooked up with my 
                        girlfriend!

           Kyle lays in the garden, painfully grabbing his back. 
           Thorns have gouged themselves into Kyle’s lucky jacket.

                                 KYLE
                        Ow. Oh, Man.

           Ryan leans down, picking up his gun from the ground.
                                 RYAN
                        And, if I wasn’t angry enough at 
                        your stupid fucking face, now I 
                        have to remember it as the one 
                        that went and fucked up my deal.

           Ryan cocks his gun and points it at Kyle.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        You thought you could be a fucking 
                        hero? Well guess what? You failed. 
                        And now I’m going to show you what 
                        happens to heroes who fail.
                             (then)
                        Any last words?

           Kyle squirms around on the ground. Out of breath, he 
           gives up, looking up at Ryan.

                                 KYLE

                        jinbutsudesu.

           Ryan looks back, confused. He shrugs.

                                 RYAN
                        What?

                                 KYLE
                        A hero isn’t the one who never 
                        falls. He’s the one who gets back 
                        up without losing sight of his 
                        dreams.

           Ryan, confused, shakes his head at Kyle. He recomposes, 
           realigning his shot on Kyle, as--

           WHACK, a red metal saucer comes flying through the sky, 
           smacking Ryan in the face. The saucer ricochets off of 
           Ryan’s face as Ryan comes falling to the ground.

           Running into frame is Wyatt-- holding the base of the 
           brownie tin as he quickly grabs the gun from the ground. 
           He sets a foot down on Ryan, keeping him from getting up.

           Wyatt surveys the land, looking to the rose garden and 
           spotting Kyle on the ground.

                                 WYATT
                        Kyle!
           Kyle slowly begins to get himself up from the ground.

                                 KYLE
                        Wyatt!

           Kyle rushes forward. The two hug over Ryan’s unconscious 
           body. As they hug, police SIRENS wail from a distance.

           Dianna, Kath, Don, Rina and Jed run out from the house, 
           comforting Kyle and Wyatt.

           Police cars arrive on the street, their sirens wailing 
           and lights blinking as they approach the scene, and we--

                                                        DISSOLVE TO BLACK:

           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - VARIOUS - DAY

           MUSIC CUE: “POLISH GIRL” BY NEON INDIAN

           The bell rings, and students rush out of their 
           classrooms, walking about as they switch classes. 

           CHYRON: TWO WEEKS LATER

           Students bicker all about the busy hallway, reading a 
           copy of the Warrior Newspaper as they navigate the hall.

           Tony Kang crosses in, displaying copies of the newspaper 
           in his hand for any passing student who wants one.

                                 TONY
                        Fresh off the press! Read all 
                        about it. It’s paper day. Get your 
                        Warrior Newspaper today!

           Two students pass by, grabbing copies from Tony’s hands 
           and walking along to class.

           The students read their papers, crossing as they pass by 
           a hallway wall with the front page taped up to it.

           PAPER HEADLINE: “Ardwood Cousins Bust Public School Drug 
           King on Highest Holy Day,” Written by John Blake.

           INT. SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER CLASSROOM - DAY

           Jacob stands next to Kyle, a newspaper open in his hands 
           as he nods respectfully to Kyle.
                                 JACOB
                        I must admit I had my doubts. But, 
                        you came through like you said you 
                        would. I’m quite impressed.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, thank you Jacob.

                                 JACOB
                        No. I’m not kidding, Kyle. This 
                        here is a real story. A story that 
                        could start a career.
                             (then)
                        So, given all that, I just can’t 
                        understand why you insist on 
                        publishing with a pen name.

           Jacob hands Kyle the paper. Kyle reads, nodding.

                                 JACOB (CONT'D)
                        John Blake. Who’s John Blake?

           Kyle puts the paper down, looking at Jacob.

                                 KYLE
                        I’ve just decided I’d rather stay 
                        away from the attention for a 
                        while. You take the credit.

           Jacob stares back at Kyle in complete disbelief. Kyle 
           nods, then crosses out of the classroom.

           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

           The bell rings and Kyle exits the newspaper classroom. He 
           walks the hallway, passing by students at their lockers.

           As he walks, Kyle passes by Adam-- his foot in a boot as 
           he leans against the wall and talks with his friends.

           Spotting Kyle in the distance, Adam turns and playfully 
           gives Kyle The Sting signal. Kyle smiles, giving the 
           signal back as he crosses down the hallway.

           INT. SCHOOL - MEGGIE’S LOCKER - DAY

           Meggie puts her books away as she chats with her friends, 
           BECKY and ANA.

                                 BECKY
                        So Meggie, you’d be down to go 
                        thrifting on Monday, right?
                                 ANA
                        “Walk into the club like, what’s 
                        up? I got a big cock!”

           The girls all laugh amongst themselves.

                                 BECKY
                        Anastasia, stop. You’re too funny.

                                 ANA
                        If I was lucky enough, I’d strap-
                        up and fuck that Macklemore in all 
                        his holes. He’s a lyrical genius.

                                 MEGGIE
                             (embarrassed)
                        You two are too fucking much.

           Becky stops laughing, turning and spotting Kyle patiently 
           standing by. She taps Ana’s shoulder. The girls all turn.

           Kyle stands feet away from the girls, quietly working up 
           the confidence to speak.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey Meggie. Can I talk to you?

           Becky and Ana smile, chuckling as they turn to Meggie.

                                 BECKY
                             (turning to phone)
                        Oh wow. Look at the time. We have 
                        a study session we’re late to.

           Becky and Ana turn, leaving Meggie and Kyle alone.

                                 ANASTASIA
                        See you tonight, Meggie.

           Meggie closes her locker, turning to her friends.

                                 MEGGIE
                        See you tonight!

           Meggie then drops her smile, turning to Kyle. Kyle 
           stares, working up the courage.

                                 KYLE
                        Hi.

                                 MEGGIE
                             (crossing her arms)
                        Hi.
                                 KYLE
                        How are you doing?

                                 MEGGIE
                        I’m okay.

           Kyle, without a follow-up, nods for a beat.

                                 MEGGIE
                             (then)
                        Ryan and I broke up.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh. I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 MEGGIE
                        It’s okay. Adam told me 
                        everything.
                             (then)
                        Turns out Ryan wasn’t as nice a 
                        guy as I thought he was...

                                 KYLE
                             (nervously)
                        Yeah... what an assfuck.

           Meggie smirks at the comment. Kyle smiles back.

                                 MEGGIE
                        Yeah. An assfuck indeed.

           Meggie cracks a smile, opening up to Kyle.

                                 MEGGIE
                        What brings you this way, Kyle?

                                 KYLE
                             (a beat, then)
                        Well. I was curious if you’d ever 
                        be interested in hanging out with 
                        a nice guy sometime...
                             (nervously pausing, then)
                        Maybe I could take you out to Cold 
                        Stone this weekend? On me.

           Meggie smirks. Kyle anxiously awaits Meggie’s response.

                                 MEGGIE
                             (then, smiling)
                        Yes. Yes you could. I’d like that.

           Kyle smiles. Meggie swings her backpack on.
                                 MEGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Walk with me to class?

                                 KYLE
                             (excitedly)
                        Sure.

           Kyle and Meggie grab their belongings and begin to walk.

           MUSIC CUE: “YOU’RE A JERK” BY NEW BOYZ

                                 MEGGIE
                        So, tell me more about our date 
                        this weekend.

                                 KYLE
                        I was thinking I’d have my 
                        chauffeur pick you up around seven 
                        and drop us off at the Coldstone 
                        in the Hillcrest Village Center.

                                 MEGGIE
                        Oh wow. A chauffeur. How fancy.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, he just got his associates 
                        and is looking to break in to the 
                        transportation industry. So I 
                        thought I’d give him a shot.
                             (then)
                        He’s also my cousin...

           As Meggie and Kyle romantically stroll through the 
           hallway together, we--

                                                             CUT TO BLACK:

           ROLL CREDITS

           The cast all does the jerk over rolling credits.
