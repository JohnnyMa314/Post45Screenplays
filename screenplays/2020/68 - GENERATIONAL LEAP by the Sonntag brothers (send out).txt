           OVER BLACK --

                                 MORGAN’S VOICE
                        The early bird gets the worm, 
                        right? Well... not always.

           That blackness gives way to millions of specs of light. But 
           even they can’t overcome the darkness that is DEEP SPACE. 
           Cold, sterile, and brutally unforgiving at a constant -457°F.

                                 MORGAN’S VOICE
                        Imagine a nest of birds and they’re 
                        out of worms. Dire stuff. So one 
                        brave bird volunteers to fly out 
                        across the land and save the nest. 
                        But while she’s out on her perilous 
                        journey, the R&D department back in 
                        the nest creates a jetpack. They 
                        strap that sucker on a second bird, 
                        and suddenly the second bird passes 
                        the first bird, gets the worm, and 
                        returns to the nest a hero. 

           Against the darkness, two specs glow brighter than the rest.

                                 MORGAN’S VOICE
                        It may sound like a joke, but 
                        astronauts have a name for this 
                        phenomenon. “The Wait Calculation.” 

           One of the bright specs is rapidly approaching the other.

                                 MORGAN’S VOICE
                        How long should someone wait to 
                        leave so they won’t get lapped by 
                        something better? It’s the hardest 
                        question for an explorer to get 
                        right because there is no answer. 

           And just as that rapidly-approaching spec reaches the other --

                                 MORGAN’S VOICE
                        The future is always coming. 

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. NASA SPACE SHUTTLE

           THREE HUMAN-SIZED RECTANGULAR STASIS PODS ARE OPEN -- 
           translucent, each like a sarcophagus from the near future.

           But right now -- SENSORS, ALARMS, RED LIGHTS go off in 
           succession. Something has gone terribly WRONG.
           THREE ASTRONAUTS float out of the pods in ZERO-G. 

           ISAIAH WILKINS -- early 30’s, surgeon smart, quarterback 
           handsome with a “never say die” attitude --

                                 ISAIAH
                        Stay calm! We have oxygen!

           LELAND WONG -- mid 40’s, whip-smart, rugged, a few gray hairs 
           that make him the “elder statesman” of this crew --

                                 LELAND
                        Only a ship emergency should 
                        jettison us from stasis, but it’s 
                        saying all systems are functional.

           Last but not least --

           MORGAN REED -- early 30’s, modern-day explorer, give her a 
           bullhorn and a soapbox and watch her turn an angry mob into a 
           peaceful protest, or vice versa. And right now --

                                 MORGAN
                        Everyone, shut the fuck up!

           Morgan’s eyes are locked on something across the room. 
           Everyone follows her gaze to the CLOCK -- “116 YEARS” 

                                 ISAIAH
                        We’re early...

           The ship JOLTS again. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Something interrupted our journey. 

           Leland floats to a porthole window and stares out. What he 
           sees causes him to go DEAD STILL, even in zero-G. 

           The rest of the crew join him and look outside. 

           Each is immediately struck with the exact same look -- 

           TOTAL AND UTTER TERROR.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           DARKNESS

           Silence, then --

           The sound of an ENGINE ROARING TO LIFE. 
           INT. MECHANIC’S GARAGE - DAY

           A MECHANIC finishes working under the hood of a Mercedes S-
           Class that now purrs like a kitten. 

           The Mechanic steps back, revealing their identity -- 

           Morgan. Less astronaut, more grease monkey. 

           SUPER: “118 YEARS EARLIER -- 2039.”

           The BUSINESS MAN and owner of the Mercedes is impressed. 

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        Complicated in there. Almost like 
                        you’d need to go to school for it.

                                 MORGAN
                        I did. 

           She slams the hood shut.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        M.I.T.

           INT. MORGAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Small and one-story. Morgan enters. She takes off her 
           baseball cap and tosses it in a pile. 

           A NURSE grabs her coat off a rack as she gets ready to leave.

                                 NURSE
                        He was able to eat. I made extra. 

           Morgan smiles thankfully.

                                 NURSE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, and today is already Thursday. 
                        I hate to bring it up again, but...

                                 MORGAN
                        No. I understand. I’ll talk to the 
                        insurance company tomorrow.

           The Nurse nods and leaves.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Morgan passes a SET OF PHOTOS in the tiny hallway. They are 
           mostly of her father PHILLIP -- a handsome, honest, and hard-
           working mechanic like his daughter.
           But the Phillip seated on the couch struggling with an iPad 
           is much older now. More frail.

           Morgan enters and sits down next to him. 

                                 PHILLIP
                        I miss ink on my fingertips.

           Morgan smiles. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Yeah, and I miss ‘NSync, but 
                        something tells me J.T. ain’t 
                        coming back.

           She takes the moment to nestle against his shoulder.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Morgan helps give her father a bath. 

           What you do for a parent who once did everything for you...

           INT. PHILLIP’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Morgan tucks her father into bed. Tonight, as she does --

                                 PHILLIP
                        You shouldn’t be here.

           Morgan slowly pulls back. He stares at her. 

           She waits a moment, then kisses him on the forehead.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m right where I need to be.

           INT. MORGAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Morgan’s naked body is reflected back in a mirror. She is 
           trim and athletic. She moves to a chair and puts her PJs on.

           Above it, a POSTER OF THE APOLLO 11 CREW hangs on the wall. 
           The three astronauts proudly smile to a homecoming crowd.

           But under the hopeful poster lies DOZENS OF UNPAID BILLS.

           EXT. MORGAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Morgan leaves the next morning.
           INT. MORGAN’S TRUCK - DAY

           Morgan gets in and turns the key. The engine SPUTTERS. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Houston... we have a piece of shit.

           She lowers her head onto the steering wheel, already feeling 
           drained, and wondering what her life has come to. But like 
           she’s always done, she throws the door open to make it work --

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           -- and stops dead in her tracks. She’s suddenly surrounded by 
           TWO BLACK SUVS along with SEVERAL MEN IN SUITS.

                                 MAN IN SUIT
                        Morgan Reed?

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Morgan is let inside as a door shuts ominously behind her. 

           She’s completely alone in the massive room. But as she looks 
           forward, she spots a SINGLE TABLE... and a VR HELMET.

           She walks up to the table and sees a note -- “FOR MORGAN.”

           Morgan skeptically looks around. Curiosity gets the best of 
           her... and she slowly fits the VR HELMET onto her head.

           The second she does -- 

           THE IMAGE OF A MAN APPEARS IN FRONT OF HER WITH HIS BACK 
           TURNED.

           After a moment, The Man turns around. It’s ISAIAH. He greets 
           her with the warm smile of an old friend and wears a business 
           suit as handsomely as he did a spacesuit.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Hello, Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Isaiah... where are we?

                                 ISAIAH
                        You’re in L.A. I’m in Cape 
                        Canaveral.

           He walks up to her. 
                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        How’s your father doing?

                                 MORGAN
                        What’s this about, Isaiah?

           Isaiah nods. He turns and waves his hand -- digitally 
           transporting them to a CUTTING-EDGE NASA LABORATORY. 

           He starts to walk through the simulation. Morgan follows.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Since you left four years ago, 
                        we’ve had a breakthrough. 

           Morgan is suddenly transfixed by THREE RECTANGULAR PODS. 
           Pristine, clear and big enough for a person in each one. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Stasis?

           Isaiah nods.

                                 ISAIAH
                        It’s not a theory anymore. With 
                        these, a person can remain alive 
                        and unconscious indefinitely. 

           Isaiah smiles.

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        It’s a generational leap, Morgan.

           Morgan turns and looks at him.

                                 MORGAN
                        What’s the destination?

                                 ISAIAH
                        A distant planet called Meliora.

                                 MORGAN
                        Little green men?

                                 ISAIAH
                        No, thankfully. 

           Isaiah can barely contain his excitement --

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        It’s beautiful, Morgan. Early 
                        readouts are showing oxygen in the 
                        air and a dense, mineral rich soil. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        But we won’t know for sure until we 
                        land on it. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Guinea pigs.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Interstellar explorers. 

           Morgan is quiet. Isaiah doubles-down.

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        Our generation inherited a climate 
                        crisis we might not be able to fix. 
                        We’re trying, but things are 
                        reaching a tipping point. We have 
                        to know there’s hope out there if 
                        things don’t go the way we plan. 
                        You and I are explorers. This gets 
                        us back to what NASA was founded 
                        on. A mission not just for our 
                        generation, but for every 
                        generation that follows us... 

           Morgan is silent, running the numbers that most people can’t 
           even hold in their head -- 

                                 MORGAN
                        If we’re traveling at one sixty-
                        fourth the speed of light, with 
                        solar sails plus acceleration, 
                        it’ll take nearly --

                                 ISAIAH
                        -- three hundred years. 

           It hangs there. 

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        It seems like a long-time, but if 
                        we actually establish a base on 
                        another planet for others to 
                        follow, three-hundred years is a 
                        snapshot in our species’ history.

           Morgan is unreadable. Is she considering it?

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        Morgan... because of the sacrifice 
                        you’ll be making, there are people 
                        willing to step up in your absence.

           She looks Isaiah right in the eye, but doesn’t speak.
                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        He’d get the best care. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Don’t use him as a bargaining chip.

                                 ISAIAH
                        I just meant -- 

                                 MORGAN
                        The answer is no.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Morgan, listen, please --

           She takes off the VR HELMET --

           -- and is suddenly alone again in the empty warehouse.

           INT. NASA OFFICE - DAY

           Isaiah sits with several HIGH-RANKING NASA OFFICIALS. 
           MORGAN’S FILE is in front of them along with her original 
           astronaut photo. She holds her helmet and has a huge smile.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Morgan Reed was one of the best 
                        astronauts we ever trained. The 
                        mind of an engineer with the heart 
                        of an explorer. But like a star 
                        athlete on a rebuilding team, her 
                        talents were wasted. Our funding 
                        was slashed right when she was 
                        getting her wings. Then her 
                        father’s health deteriorated. 

           The Officials trade a look.

                                 NASA OFFICIAL
                        How long are we prepared to wait?

           Isaiah points down to a line in the file -- 

                                 ISAIAH
                        “Consistently rises to meet a 
                        challenge, no matter how extreme.”

           Isaiah closes the file and stares at the Officials.

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        Let’s see if the file’s right.
           EXT. MECHANIC’S GARAGE - DAY

           Morgan sits down to get under the engine of a JAGUAR. She 
           already looks overworked, and the short fuse of the OBNOXIOUS 
           OWNER doesn’t make things easier. 

                                 OBNOXIOUS OWNER
                        Is this necessary?

                                 MORGAN
                        I couldn’t see the leak you 
                        mentioned from under the hood, so 
                        this will give me a better idea.

           Morgan rolls under the car.

           UNDER THE ENGINE --

           Morgan looks up... 

           ... and sees SEVERAL RATS burrowed inside.

           She quickly wheels back out and stands up.

                                 OBNOXIOUS OWNER
                        So? Is there a problem?

           Morgan hesitates, then --

                                 MORGAN
                        Tony!

           She hurries over to another MECHANIC finishing his lunch. 

                                 TONY
                        What’s up, Morgan?

                                 MORGAN
                        Rats in the engine... 

                                 TONY
                        How bad we talking?

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s their world. We’re just living 
                        in it.

           Tony smiles, understanding.

                                 TONY
                        No worries. I got this one.

           Morgan nods a thanks as Tony heads over. Morgan exhales.
           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Morgan juggles a phone on her shoulder as she’s trying her 
           best to boil some pasta and work a sauce on the stove all at 
           once. These are her real problems --

                                 MORGAN
                        I understand, but we’ve always made 
                        our payments, even if we’re a 
                        little late. If I could just have -- 

           She dumps some pasta in the water, but the pasta water begins 
           to BOIL OVER -- SHIT. She tries to turn off the stove when 
           suddenly, from outside -- HER TRUCK STARTS IN THE DRIVEWAY.  

           Morgan’s face instantly fills with fear.

           EXT. MORGAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Morgan dashes out to see the pickup truck backing out of the 
           driveway... AND PHILLIP BEHIND THE WHEEL.

                                 MORGAN
                        Dad, stop!

           A CAR SWERVES out of the way to avoid a collision with him. 

           HONK!

           Phillip panics. Confused. Worried. 

           It all happens in an instant -- 

           The pickup SPEEDS BACKWARDS and CRASHES into a pole.

           It crunches the rear bed of the truck. 

           Morgan runs up, leans in the window and yanks out the keys. 
           But worse -- Phillip’s head is bleeding from the dust-up.

                                 PHILLIP
                        Where’s the other nurse!

           That hurts Morgan deeply... now more than ever before.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Phillip lies asleep in bed, cut bandaged on his head. Morgan 
           sits next to him. Her eyes are red from crying. A NURSE walks 
           in, checks his vitals, then turns to leave.
           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Morgan steps out. She takes out her cell phone. Her hand 
           trembles nervously. But finally, she dials --

                                 ISAIAH
                             (through the phone)
                        Morgan...?

           As a tear rolls down her cheek --

                                 MORGAN
                        What kind of care could he get?

           EXT. PREMIER CLINIC - DAY

           Big, modern, and full of life. Three NURSES for every 
           PATIENT. Only the rich get this. But now Phillip does, too.

           He stands overlooking a gorgeous garden. Morgan joins him. 
           They stand in silence for a moment. Morgan hesitates, then --

                                 MORGAN
                        I wanted to say thank you. For 
                        everything you and Mom did for me. 
                        The sacrifices you guys made... I 
                        want you to know none of it was 
                        wasted. It’s going to be the 
                        foundations of a brand new world.

           Phillip is silent. Morgan has to wonder... did any of that 
           make it through? Phillip finally turns and looks at her.

                                 PHILLIP
                        I had my time...

           He smiles proudly.

                                 PHILLIP (CONT'D)
                        It’s your time now. 

           It seems it did.

           Morgan fights back tears and hugs him tightly.

                                 MORGAN
                        Goodbye, Dad. I love you.

           EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           A 747 lands.
           INT. NASA HANGAR - DAY

           Isaiah escorts Morgan through the facility.

                                 ISAIAH
                        We’ll be training for just under a 
                        year. All of it from this base.

                                 MORGAN
                        Sounds good.

           Leland is seated at a table sipping coffee as Isaiah and 
           Morgan approach them.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Morgan, this is Leland Wong... 

           Leland stands and they shake hands. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Leland Wong... you were an 
                        instructor during my first year.

                                 LELAND
                        Yes, I’m the decrepit age of 42. 
                        Just don’t call me gramps and we’ll 
                        get along fine.

           Morgan pauses.

                                 MORGAN
                        Your mother was Natalie Wong, 
                        right? She was the first female to 
                        break the record for consecutive 
                        months spent in orbit. She was a 
                        hero of mine.

           Leland smiles with a heavy heart.

                                 LELAND
                        Mine, too.

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s nice seeing a son follow in 
                        his mother’s footsteps.

                                 LELAND
                        Well, hopefully not all the 
                        footsteps. I’d like to avoid the 
                        “blowing up in space” one.

           Morgan doesn’t know how to react to that.
                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay. You can laugh. 

           Isaiah playfully throws his arm around Leland.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Gramps has a weird sense of humor.

           Morgan smiles.

           EXT. NASA HANGAR - DAY

           Everyone exits the east side of the hangar, revealing --

           “THE MARATHON” 

           Think the Space Shuttle Endeavor crossed with a DC-10. 140 
           feet long, 90-foot wingspan and a 60-foot tail height. 
           Sculpted like a ship from the future built to honor the past.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Welcome to The Marathon.

           Morgan takes a deep breath -- she’s reached her dream.

                                 MORGAN
                        So, when do we start? 

           And off her smile --

           INT. “THE MARATHON”

           -- WE’RE BACK IN THE CHAOS OF THE OPENING PAGES.

           SENSORS, ALARMS, RED LIGHTS going off in succession. 

           Isaiah, Leland, and Morgan drifting out of their pods.   

                                 ISAIAH
                        Stay calm! We have oxygen!

                                 LELAND
                        Only a ship emergency should 
                        jettison us from stasis, but it’s 
                        saying all systems are functional.

                                 MORGAN
                        Everyone shut the fuck up!

           Morgan’s eyes are locked on the CLOCK -- “116 YEARS” 
                                 ISAIAH
                        We’re early...

           The ship JOLTS again. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Something interrupted our journey. 

           Leland floats to a porthole window and stares out. The rest 
           of the crew joins him and looks out. 

           Terror strikes each of their faces --

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- 

           They now see they are DEEP IN OUTER SPACE.

           But more pressing at the moment --

           -- IS THE MASSIVE BLUE SPACE CRAFT APPROACHING THEM. 

           Its design is completely foreign. Sleek, colorful, and 
           GIGANTIC. Ten times the size of The Marathon. 

           The mysterious blue craft moves closer...

           ... and begins to ENGULF THE MARATHON like a whale. 

           Isaiah floats beside Morgan. Just as stunned at the sight. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        It’s drawing us in! 

           As The Marathon is drawn into the other ship, a LIGHT begins 
           to shine in from the porthole. 

           GRAVITY SUDDENLY KICKS IN! 

           The three crew members SLAM to the ground -- hard. 

           Leland lands on his elbow -- CRACK! -- snapping a bone. 

           Pulsing lights seem to scan the interior of the ship. An 
           otherworldly laser show. Unnerving yet hypnotic.

           From somewhere inside their ship... 

           ... comes the sound of the AIRLOCK OPENING. 

                                 LELAND
                        They’re inside the airlock! 

           FOOTSTEPS are heard approaching through their ship. 
           The hatch to the room they’re currently in OPENS, revealing -- 

           THREE TALL, SKINNY FIGURES. DEEP BLUE WITH GOLDEN HEADS. 

           Exotic and other-worldly. 

           The crew is too shocked to move. Everyone’s heart racing.

           The Figures step closer and their shapes become more clear --

           -- SPACE SUITS. 

           ... and through their golden helmets, they are seen to be --

           HUMAN.

           Morgan can only muster one word --

                                 MORGAN
                        What...?

           Without speaking, the Figures PULL EACH OF THE FIRST CREW’S 
           HELMETS OFF AND -- VWIP! -- INJECT A SYRINGE INTO THEIR NECK. 

           As Morgan’s eyelids get heavy and shut --

                                                         SMASH TO BLACK

           DARKNESS. 

           Silence for a moment. Until --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INFIRMARY

           Morgan’s eyes slowly open. Groggy, she starts to shake off 
           the effects of whatever was jammed into her neck. 

           She isn’t sure if she just woke up from one nightmare into 
           another. But while one was jarring, this new one is serene.

           As her eyes focus, she begins to take in her surroundings -- 

           An infirmary mixed with a spa. Spacious with white walls. 
           Plenty of room, and flowers between separate hospital beds. 
           Calming music fills the area. The other beds vacant. 

           A WOMAN washes her hands in a sink with her back to Morgan. 

           Morgan spots a tray beside her bed. It has a PLASTIC SPOON 
           and a CUP OF JELLO. The Woman turns and sees her. 
                                 WOMAN
                        You’re up.

           Morgan quickly takes the spoon and SNAPS the round tip off to 
           create a plastic shiv. She rolls out of bed and backs into 
           the corner as she holds up the plastic shiv, ready to use it.

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        My name is Alyx Rishika... 

           ALYX RISHIKA, late 20’s, toned with a shaved head and left 
           arm covered in a sleeve tattoo of the staff of Hermes. 
           Uncensored in appearance and behavior.

                                 ALYX
                        ... and you look like shit.

                                 MORGAN
                        Who are you?

                                 ALYX
                        I’m an astronaut, just like you.

           Legs still weak, Morgan catches herself from stumbling.

                                 ALYX (CONT'D)
                        Easy now, cowgirl.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Alyx walks a few feet ahead of Morgan, who still has the 
           plastic spoon in her grip like she’s walking her at knife-
           point through the halls of a surprisingly large ship.

           A ship that doesn't have the same tight, industrial feel of 
           The Marathon. The shape of the walls has an aerodynamic, art-
           deco aesthetic. High ceilings with streamlined corners.

           If The Marathon was built for utility, this place seems to 
           have an element of interior design. Gold trim accents give 
           this ship an almost elegant feel. 

           Digital screens appear and disappear on the walls as they 
           walk past. Silent, and highly efficient.

           Morgan realizes the strangest thing about this place --

                                 MORGAN
                        There’s gravity in here...

                                 ALYX
                        Yeah. Get used to these things.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           Alyx and Morgan enter. 

           Isaiah and Leland are seated and recovering around a long, 
           oak table like a board room. 

           They all look BLITZED. Leland has his arm in a sling that 
           seems to be MASSAGING IT. Isaiah moves closer to Morgan. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        You okay?

                                 MORGAN
                        Who are they?

           HUNTER VEGA -- early 30’s, full beard like a blue-collar oil 
           driller in the artic with the focused determination of a 
           jogger who wakes up early to run at sunrise.

                                 HUNTER
                        I’m Hunter Vega, captain. You met 
                        Alyx Rishika, our medical expert. 

           Alyx catches Leland staring at her.

                                 ALYX
                        Want to take a photo, grandpa?

           Leland goes quiet at that word.

                                 LELAND
                        It’s just gramps...

                                 HUNTER
                        And that pup in the corner is Yuri 
                        Pheiffer, our lead programmer.

           YURI PHEIFFER -- mid 20’s, youngest of the group with black-
           rimmed glasses and very skinny. He looks like he’d be more 
           comfortable behind a desk than in an astronaut’s suit, the 
           kind of person who had a stutter and fears people still know.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Programmer?

                                 HUNTER
                        This entire ship is A.I. 
                        controlled. Yuri is our version of 
                        what you might call... a mechanic.

           Morgan finds that hard to believe. Yuri pushes up his 
           glasses, nervous to be in the spotlight for even a moment.
                                 YURI
                        I, uh, just bottle the engine 
                        runoff and make Neptune crystals 
                        out of it. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Neptune what?

                                 YURI
                        Just kidding. Bad joke. 

                                 LELAND
                        That’s usually my job...

                                 YURI
                        Defensive mechanism, I suppose. 
                        When I’m nervous. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Why would you be nervous?

           Isn’t it obvious?

                                 YURI
                        Never met anyone famous before.

           Morgan looks at Hunter --

                                 MORGAN
                        Who are you people?

                                 HUNTER
                        We’re you. Only faster.

           Hunter turns and touches the wall behind him and the 
           translucent image of space changes to -- THE NASA LOGO -- but 
           sleeker. Like the company went through a re-branding effort. 

                                 MORGAN
                        You work for NASA? 

                                 HUNTER
                        Yes. Currently en route to Meliora.

                                 LELAND
                        That’s our mission. 

                                 HUNTER
                        It was. 116 years ago.

                                 MORGAN
                        When did you leave Earth? 
                                 HUNTER
                        20 years ago. 

                                 MORGAN
                        ... 96 years after us? 

           Hunter taps the smart wall. A gigantic info-graphic of a 
           digitized EARTH appears on the left side of the wall. 

                                 HUNTER
                        This is Earth. And this is you 
                        leaving on your historic journey. 

           The info-graphic shows a small “MARATHON SHIP” leaving Earth 
           and heading in a straight line across the wall. 

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        96 years after that monumental day, 
                        we leave on our journey. 

           He taps the screen. A second, BIGGER SHIP leaves Earth. It 
           moves FASTER across the wall, catching up to The Marathon. 

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        And instead of taking us the 116 
                        years to reach how far you got, it 
                        took us only 20 years. 

           Silence. Morgan is deep in thought for a moment, then --

                                 MORGAN
                        The wait calculation. 

           Hunter nods -- that’s right.

                                 HUNTER
                        A phenomenon that can only happen 
                        over great distances, like space 
                        itself. You leave Earth in your 
                        ship. Time passes. Meanwhile, 
                        technology advances like it always 
                        does. Then one day, a new ship 
                        leaves Earth equipped with that 
                        technology. If they’re headed to 
                        the same place, well, eventually...

           The two ships reach the SAME EXACT SPOT on the wall. 

                                 MORGAN
                        ... the newer ship catches up.

                                 HUNTER
                        What took your technology over a 
                        century took ours only twenty. 
           Isaiah, Morgan, and Leland remain quiet.

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        As I said. We’re you, just faster.

           Morgan turns and sees the name of the bigger ship on the wall 
           that caught up to them -- the ship they’re currently now on --

           “THE SPRINT.”

           (In a very real way, it’s like the crew from the original 
           Apollo missions on one side of the room... and the crew from 
           the Jetsons on the other.)

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        Neal, can you start preparing 
                        dinner for our guests?

           A BLUE CAMERA in the corner of the ceiling GLOWS in response.

                                 NEAL
                        Of course, Captain.

           “Neal” seems to be their onboard A.I. system.

                                 HUNTER
                        Get changed, then we’ll have a tour 
                        before dinner. And you can all 
                        relax. Nobody is being replaced. 

           The first crew shares a glance -- “replaced?”

           INT. MORGAN’S PRIVATE QUARTERS

           A porthole on one wall shows outer space whizzing by. Morgan 
           finishes zipping up a fresh suit with the new NASA LOGO. 

           She touches it, expecting a patch, but it’s a THIN HOLOGRAM.  

           INT. LELAND’S PRIVATE QUARTERS

           Leland stands at the shower and removes the sling from his 
           arm. He stretches his elbow. Amazingly, it’s HEALED. 

           He goes to turn on the shower, but it has no knobs of any 
           kind. He’s at a loss, so he takes a punt at it --

                                 LELAND
                        Water... on?
           But instead of water, a CLEANSING MIST sprays out and 
           surrounds Leland. It only takes a moment, but when the mist 
           is gone, his entire body and hair are fully clean and dry. 

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        Okay... now where do I pee?

           INT. ISAIAH’S PRIVATE QUARTERS

           Isaiah stands near a porthole window and stares out, lost in 
           thought. He rubs a SWISS ARMY KNIFE between his fingers, 
           seemingly stewing on that terrifying final word -- replaced.

                                 HUNTER
                             (pre-lap)
                        As you can see, it’s more important 
                        than ever we reach Meliora.

           INT. HOLOGRAPHIC OBSERVATORY

           Both crews stand inside a MASSIVE HOLOGRAM OF EARTH. 

           It ZOOMS IN ON NEW YORK CITY... and they’re suddenly 
           surrounded by a CHAOTIC FUTURISTIC SPRAWL. A mess of 
           highways, automated cars, people, and elevated trains that 
           wrap through the city like a demented M.C. Escher painting.

                                 LELAND
                        What the hell happened?

                                 HUNTER
                        We managed to get a handle on 
                        climate change shortly after you 
                        left. People came together. It was 
                        wonderful. But then it led to a 
                        population boom that threw our 
                        balance with the planet into flux.

                                 MORGAN
                        How much of a boom are we talking?

                                 ALYX
                        52 billion.

                                 MORGAN
                        52?!

                                 LELAND
                        Holy shit, is that even possible?

           Hunter isn’t so sure anymore.
                                 HUNTER
                        For a moment, it seemed like it 
                        was. But overpopulation has caused 
                        dormant tensions between countries 
                        to re-ignite. World War has become 
                        a constant threat. Because while 
                        resources are no longer limited, 
                        land still is. Now more than ever.

                                 MORGAN
                        Wait, how are resources not limited 
                        with 52 billion people?

           Yuri pushes up his glasses, ready to explain.

                                 YURI
                        It’s called synth.

           INT. LOWER DECK - SYNTH GARDEN

           A rainbow drapes over lush plants and ripe vegetation growing 
           on long, healthy vines inside this Garden of Eden-like 
           biodome. A HAND pierces the rainbow. It fizzles into static. 

           Yuri leads both crews over to a pot growing STALKS OF CORN.

                                 YURI
                        Synth is carbon-based edible 
                        nanites able to transform into any 
                        material we need. Even food.

           Yuri slips on a CONTROL PAD over his hand that seems to fit 
           like a pair of BRASS KNUCKLES with dozens of lights FLASHING 
           in unique patterns. 

                                 YURI (CONT'D)
                        All I have to do is program it.

           Yuri moves it over the stalk of corn. 

           The stalk of corn suddenly MELTS LIKE A MANNEQUIN UNDER A 
           HEAT LAMP and reverts to its original form -- 

                                 YURI (CONT'D)
                        This is what we call “raw synth.”

           Flesh-colored, oval, GELATINOUS BLOBS no bigger than a dime, 
           but each packed with thousands of nanites that sizzle inside 
           like beautiful fireflies. Hard to tell what’s more dominant 
           in this tempestuous marriage -- the technology or the nature.  
                                 YURI (CONT'D)
                        The whole “supply and demand” thing 
                        you guys had, well, it kind of went 
                        out the airlock. But humanity’s 
                        resurgence has caused new problems.

           As Morgan, Isaiah, and Leland keep staring at the synth, 
           Hunter can see they’re a little freaked out.

                                 HUNTER
                        You guys had 3-D printers, right? 

                                 ISAIAH
                        This your version of that?

                                 ALYX
                        Sort of. This is a bit of a 
                        generational leap.

           Morgan and Isaiah share a look.

           INT. DINING QUARTERS

           Everyone is seated around a delicious spread of gourmet food. 
           Leland slices off a hunk of “filet mignon” and it sizzles 
           like it just came off a grill. He cautiously takes a bite... 

                                 LELAND
                        It’s... chewy. But not terrible.

           That’s a huge compliment coming from him right now.

                                 HUNTER
                        Synth is really best viewed as a 
                        workaround to a bigger problem.

                                 MORGAN
                        You mean climate change?

           Hunter nods.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        So you didn’t really “fix” it then?

                                 ALYX
                        Did you?

           Tool’s “Schism” plays in the background. 

           Yuri tries using it to break any mounting tension.

                                 YURI
                        Uh, great tunes you guys brought.
                                 MORGAN
                        Thanks...

                                 YURI
                        I always loved classic rock.

           But he does just the opposite. 

           Seeing their reactions, he tries catching himself.

                                 YURI (CONT'D)
                        Oh. I mean... just rock.

           A moment passes. 

                                 LELAND
                        We should keep track of this stuff.

                                 ALYX
                        What “stuff?”

                                 LELAND
                        The things that successfully made 
                        it from one generation to the next. 
                        Like, let’s say for instance...

           Leland looks at Morgan and Isaiah. Morgan takes a shot --

                                 MORGAN
                        Football... ?

           The second crew shares a blank look.

                                 MOGAN
                        Wow, really?

           Leland takes another stab --

                                 LELAND
                        How about... Playstation?

           In unison --

                                 YURI
                        Oh, for sure. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Why wouldn’t it?

                                 ALYX
                        Yeah, is “water” still around?

           The first crew shares another look. 
                                 LELAND
                        This has been an enlightening 
                        experience, thank you.

           Hunter leans forward -- more serious and back on track.

                                 HUNTER
                        We have a mission to complete. 
                        Reach Meliora, find out if it’s 
                        habitable, then relay the answer 
                        back to Earth before it’s too late.

                                 MORGAN
                        Why did you stop for us then? 

                                 HUNTER
                        You were part of the mission. To 
                        help you. Astronauts have always 
                        looked out for each other, right?

           Morgan eyes Leland and Isaiah, feeling somewhat... skeptical.

           Silence, then --

                                 ISAIAH
                        Who steps out on Meliora first?

           A few looks are shared. Isaiah has clearly been thinking 
           about this, but he can’t seem to hold it in a moment longer.

                                 HUNTER
                        It’s not really our main concern...

                                 ISAIAH
                        We left our lives behind for this. 
                        People we cared about.

                                 HUNTER
                        Are you asking for the sake of the 
                        mission? Or your legacy?

                                 ISAIAH
                        I’m asking about our purpose. 

           Hunter nods. He wants to be sympathetic. But also realistic.

                                 HUNTER
                        We’re not trying to take away your 
                        purpose -- we’re trying to give it 
                        back to you. You’d be floating for 
                        another two hundred years out here. 
                        By the time you’d reach Meliora, 
                        the mission would have been over. 
           He has a point... but it might not feel like it to them.

           INT. ISAIAH’S PRIVATE QUARTERS

           The first crew is together, trying to make sense of it.

           But... none of them know what to say.

           After a moment, Leland takes a crack at it --

                                 LELAND
                        Remember when Nick at Nite started 
                        playing Fresh Prince instead of I 
                        Love Lucy? 

           That might be the scariest thing anyone’s said yet.

           After a moment, Isaiah stares down at his swiss army knife.

                                 ISAIAH
                        My dad gave me this when he walked 
                        out on my mom and me. You know what 
                        his last words were to me?

           Isaiah pauses.

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        “Fuck it. It’s your mess now.”

           Just then, the door opens. Hunter steps inside. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Listen, I think we got off on the 
                        wrong foot. As captain of this 
                        ship, I take full responsibility.

           He walks over to them.

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        Here. An olive branch. 

           He opens up his palm, revealing -- 

           THREE TINY SQUARE TRANSLUCENT PATCHES.

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        To help you sleep tonight. Has 
                        several essential nutrients, too.

           Isaiah picks up one of the patches. Morgan and Leland take 
           theirs. But none of them put it on their neck.
                                 MORGAN
                        When do we re-enter stasis?

                                 HUNTER
                        Soon. We want to use this break to 
                        make sure the ship is in good 
                        condition for the rest of the trip. 

           Morgan nods.

           She and Leland turn and exit. Hunter follows them. He remains 
           by the door and smiles at Isaiah, then shuts the door.

           Isaiah stares back at his “patch.”

           INT. MORGAN’S PRIVATE QUARTERS

           Morgan lies awake in bed. She turns and glances at her own 
           patch on the bedside table. Does she take it? 

           She stands up and throws on her suit again, then moves to the 
           door. She gets there and --

           -- it doesn’t open.

           Morgan waves her hand over a sensor -- it blinks RED.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hey... I need to get out. Niles... 
                        Neal... whatever, are you there?

                                 NEAL
                        Yes.

                                 MORGAN
                        Open my door. 

                                 NEAL
                        I’m sorry. All crew must remain in 
                        their quarters. If you’re having 
                        trouble sleeping, the patch can be--  

                                 MORGAN
                        Screw the patch. Let me out.

                                 NEAL
                        I cannot do that. All safety 
                        measures are for your own good.

           Morgan slams her fist into the door.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hello! Anyone?
           No response. Morgan moves to her desk and grabs a chair. She 
           picks it up and SWINGS IT INTO THE DOOR, but it bounces off.

           Morgan stares at the door, and now out of breath -- TRAPPED.

           EXT. “THE SPRINT”

           You might not know it, but just like that, it’s the next day.

           INT. MORGAN’S PRIVATE QUARTERS

           Morgan is slouched on the floor. Dog tired. Locked in her 
           room the entire night, when -- the sensor turns GREEN.

           EXT. HALLWAY

           Morgan runs out, extremely on-guard. 

           The door beside her opens. It’s Isaiah. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We were locked in.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Yeah. All god damn night.

           From the bags under their eyes -- NEITHER TOOK THE PATCH. 

           The third door opens and Leland steps out. He... YAWNS, 
           awoken from a refreshing slumber. He removes the patch.

                                 LELAND
                        Oh, were we not supposed to...

           Morgan and Isaiah start to move. Leland follows.

           INT. EXERCISE QUARTERS

           Alyx, Yuri and Hunter work out with HOLOGRAPHIC WEIGHTS. 

           Morgan, Isaiah, and Leland enter. They feel a strain on their 
           shoulders as the gravity has been INCREASED in this room.

           Hunter racks a BAR and the “weights” on it dissolve into 
           holographic static. He wipes off a bead of sweat and takes a 
           deep breath, seeing the crew. He stands up and walks over.

                                 HUNTER
                        Neal, pause gravity training.
           He wipes his brow and greets Isaiah. 

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        Didn’t take the patches, huh? I can 
                        tell by the bags under your eyes, 
                        it’s very early-21st century of yo--

           Isaiah cuts Hunter off.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Why the hell did you lock us in our 
                        rooms for the night?

           There’s a loaded silence, when Morgan notices something. 
           Isaiah and her aren’t the only ones with bags under their 
           eyes -- each of the second crew also has them. 

           Like they’ve been up all night.

           In that moment, Morgan realizes --

                                 MORGAN
                        Because they had to.

           Everyone looks at her.

                                 LELAND
                        What?

                                 MORGAN
                        There’s only one real reason they’d 
                        ever risk their mission and stop 
                        for us. 

           She pauses and stares Hunter dead in the eyes.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Because it was life or death, but 
                        not for us...

           The second crew is quiet. 

           After a long, final silence --

                                 HUNTER
                        Clean water.

                                 LELAND
                        What?

                                 HUNTER
                        Our ship was hit by micro-meteors. 
                        Everything was fine except our 
                        water filtration system.
                                 YURI
                        It was damaged beyond repair...

                                 ALYX
                        And damn it if you still can’t 
                        survive a trip across space without 
                        reusable water. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        So you locked us in our room as you 
                        what, stripped our ship for parts?

                                 YURI
                        Part, technically...

           Isaiah fumes. But Hunter coldly stares back at him.

                                 HUNTER
                        Like I said, you’d be out here 
                        another two hundred years if it 
                        weren’t for us. Our bad luck was 
                        actually the --

           Isaiah suddenly grabs him by the collar.

                                 ISAIAH
                        You lied to us!

                                 HUNTER
                        Let go of me.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Or what?

                                 HUNTER
                        Neal, reverse gravity.

           Everyone is suddenly FLIPPED UPWARDS.

           Right as everyone finds their balance on the ceiling --

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        Neal, normalize gravity.

           Everyone FALLS BACK DOWN.

           And when they do --

           Hunter has now pinned Isaiah to the ground.

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        Ready to act your age?

           Isaiah doesn’t answer.
                                 YURI
                        If we’re going to reach Meliora 
                        now, it’ll take both our 
                        generations working together.

           Just as Isaiah finally has to make a choice between 
           swallowing his pride... or his tongue --

                                 NEAL (O.S.)
                        ALERT! I’m detecting an unknown 
                        construct in the vicinity.

           What did he just say?

           Isaiah throws Hunter off him and rolls out. Both crews stand 
           and stare at each other from across the room. 

           Everyone is suddenly more concerned with what Neal just said.

           INT. FLIGHT DECK

           The bow of the ship. Both crews stand in front of a PANORAMIC 
           VIEW OF SPACE surrounded by holographic consoles. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        What the hell is that?

           Everyone stares out in amazement, as deeper in space --

           The “Unknown Construct.”

           From their vantage point, it looks to be a METALLIC HIVE. 
           Oval-shaped with jagged protrusions sticking out of it like a 
           grenade that was frozen mid-explosion.

                                 NEAL
                        I am getting no response.

           Leland looks at the others.

                                 LELAND
                        What did we just find out here?

                                 MORGAN
                        Or what just found us...

           Isaiah steps forward to the window. His face is so close that 
           his reflection seems to haunt the Unknown Construct.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Has it given off any type of 
                        distress signal?
                                 HUNTER
                        Distress signal?

           Hunter and Alyx share a look.

                                 ALYX
                        Sounds like you’ve read too many 
                        sci-fi novels.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Is that a fucking no!

           Yuri looks at his computer.

                                 YURI
                        Uh, yeah, that’s a no.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Then we need to board it.

           Hunter shakes his head defiantly.

                                 HUNTER
                        No. None of us are stepping foot on 
                        that thing. We have a mission.

           Isaiah turns, angered --

                                 ISAIAH
                        This is the mission -- find out if 
                        it’s safe to reach Meliora. We  
                        might actually be on the verge of 
                        answering the most important 
                        question our lifetime ever faced --

           Even he can’t help but smile at the possibility --

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        “Are we alone in the universe?”

           Silence. 

           But for some reason...

           ... the second crew doesn’t share in his enthusiasm.

                                 ALYX
                        About that “question”...

           The first crew slowly looks at each other, shocked --

                                 MORGAN
                        What are you talking about?
                                 HUNTER
                        Look, it’s all very technical, but 
                        in 2084 there was an experiment 
                        called the TWS -- Tipton Wave Sync. 

                                 YURI
                        Cover of Time magazine, etc.

                                 LELAND
                        Print is still alive? That’s the 
                        craziest thing yet...

           Morgan approaches Hunter, needing to know --

                                 MORGAN
                        So? What was the answer?

           Hunter hesitates, then --

                                 HUNTER
                        There is no other life. It’s just 
                        us.

           Isaiah walks back to the window and defiantly points out at 
           the Unknown Construct. He turns and stares at the first crew.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Maybe your generation got it wrong.

           INT. AIRLOCK

           Morgan, Isaiah, Leland, and Yuri are all suited-up in the 
           second crew’s more advanced spacesuits. 

                                 ALYX
                             (over radio-link)
                        Remember, only use propulsion in 
                        short bursts. Also, you have helmet-
                        cams, so we see what you see.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Yeah, we had these in our day, too.

           They approach the outer airlock. Morgan looks at Yuri.

                                 MORGAN
                        Sure you’re up for this?

                                 YURI
                        Yeah. Sure. Like I said, we need to 
                        work together, right?

           The AIRLOCK OPENS.
           INT. THE SPRINT - FLIGHT DECK

           Hunter and Alyx watch the helmet feeds on FOUR LARGE SCREENS. 
           Hunter nervously pulls at his beard. 

                                 HUNTER
                        What the hell are we doing?

           EXT. THE SPRINT

           Morgan, Isaiah, Leland, and Yuri lift out of the airlock...

           ... into outer space...

           ... and begin to guide themselves to the Unknown Construct.

           INT. THE SPRINT - FLIGHT DECK

           ON THE SCREENS: The Unknown Construct looms closer.

           EXT. UNKNOWN CONSTRUCT

           There appear to be SLITS in the surface’s exterior. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        There. Looks like we can go inside.

           Isaiah takes the lead. As they get closer, the Unknown 
           Construct looks less like a mysterious alien structure...

           ... and more like a DERELICT SPACESHIP.

           INT. UNKNOWN CONSTRUCT

           Morgan, Isaiah, Leland and Yuri drift inside like deep-sea 
           explorers swimming through a sunken ship. Cramped. 

           LAYERS OF THICK ICE cover every wall of the structure and 
           each surface is rounded with FROST. 

           Morgan ducks under an ICICLE jutting out of the ceiling.

           INT. THE SPRINT - FLIGHT DECK

           ON THE SCREEN: The group passes under more ICICLES.

                                 ALYX
                        It’s frozen...
           INT. UNKNOWN CONSTRUCT

           Very soon, they suddenly comes across a series of THREE 
           RECTANGULAR CUBES covered in snowy powder. Each is roughly 
           the size of a large coffin. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        What are these things?

           Morgan floats to another wall as something catches her eye. 
           She lifts her gloved hand and brushes away a layer of ice. 

           As she does, her eyes go wide...

                                 MORGAN
                        Guys...

           The others turn to see what she’s revealed -- 

           A PICTURE FRAME. 

           Hanging on the wall. 

           RONALD REAGAN’S PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO. Smiling back at her.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        They’re... us.

           INT. THE SPRINT - FLIGHT DECK

           ON THE SCREENS: Morgan wipes more ice off the wall, revealing 
           a silver crest near the photo -- NASA. Older, less sleek.

           Hunter and Alyx watch in amazement.

                                 HUNTER
                        This was a NASA mission?

           INT. UNKNOWN CONSTRUCT

           They each start brushing frost and ice off the walls and 
           platforms. With each swipe, more of the ship is revealed -- 

           -- warnings of power levels and integrity WRITTEN IN ENGLISH. 

           -- A FROZEN AMERICAN FLAG that’s become rigid in the cold. 

           -- AND A SINGLE COMPUTER with a green, CRT monitor. Old tech.  

                                 YURI
                        I found their computer.
           They all crowd around it. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Does it still have power?

           Yuri stares down cluelessly at the clunky, grey computer. 

                                 YURI
                        Before my time...

                                 ISAIAH
                        Looks like an old IBM.

                                 YURI
                        A what?

           Morgan glances at Leland.

                                 MORGAN
                        Add it to the list.

           With that, she takes the initiative and slams the space bar.

           Amazingly, THE MONITOR BLINKS TO LIFE. 

           Writing begins to automatically scroll along the screen -- 

           ....VESSEL DESIGNATION: PHEIDIPPIDES....

           ....CREW: 3 - Two male - One Female - F1 for details....

           ....DESTINATION: MELIORA....

           ....LAUNCH DATE: October 4th, 1987....

           ....ETA: 574 YEARS....

           They all stare at the screen in shock --

                                 ISAIAH
                        They were heading to Meliora. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re on the other side of it...

                                 YURI
                        The other side of what?

                                 MORGAN
                        The wait calculation.

           Morgan looks at the THREE GIANT ICE CUBES, realizing --
                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        They’re us... only slower. 

           Isaiah floats over to the cubes. He can’t see inside.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Jesus, is this their version of 
                        stasis? Literally frozen?

                                 YURI
                        What’s a “Pheidippides?”

                        “Who.” Neal is saying he’s an 
                        ancient Greek figure. He ran from 
                        Marathon to Athens. 

                                 MORGAN

           Morgan, Isaiah, and Leland all share a look.

                        NASA sent a ship before us to 
                        Meliora? In the 1980’s?

                        It was during The Cold War. These 
                        projects were all top secret... 

           INT. UNKNOWN CONSTRUCT/PHEIDIPPIDES

           Leland remains at the computer as the others keep searching.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Not to mention 1987 was only a year 
                        after the Challenger accident. They 
                        probably wanted to keep it secret 
                        in case it ended in disaster again.

           Yuri’s eyes skittishly glance around the icy tomb.

                                 YURI
                        That’s definitely a word for it. 
                        They must have lost pressure. 
                        Travelling on this old tech, 
                        something had to have gone wrong. 
                                 ISAIAH
                        Did it? The computer still works. 
                        The ship is on course. Otherwise we 
                        never would have come across it.

                                 YURI
                        What are you saying?

                                 ISAIAH
                        That maybe everything’s working 
                        just fine here. 

           They go quiet. 

           Leland looks back at the computer. 

           There’s more written under a layer of frozen ice. He wipes 
           away the ice, revealing the final line of text -- 

           “... THAW: Y/N?”

           They all see it now.

           Hunter looks at Alyx as they, too, see the choice.

           INT. PHEIDIPPIDES

           Isaiah is the first to give his answer --

                                 ISAIAH
                        No. 

                                 MORGAN
                        ... no? 

                                 ISAIAH
                        They’re not the mission. Meliora 
                        is. And if they are on course, 
                        they’ll reach it in 500 years.

           As they continue discussing it, Leland taps “F1” on the 
           computer. Readouts of all of the frozen crew members reflect 
           off his helmet. His eyes open wide...

                                 MORGAN
                        After we get there. They’re 
                        expecting a new planet. In 500 
                        years the planet will be developed.

                        Even better. Less work for them. 

           Leland has moved to the three, symmetrical “ice pods.” 

           He seems to try and stare into one in particular. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We need to return to the ship and 
                        think this through. This shouldn’t 
                        be a fast decision down here. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        I vote to leave. Everyone else?

                        Optimal mission success dictates 
                        more crew members would put a 
                        severe strain on resource 
                        threshold. We will leave them.

           Hunter nods.

                        “Verified?” Whoa hold on, you’re

                        Neal is the arbiter. He keep us 
                        from in-fighting. It works.

                                 ISAIAH
                        For once we agree.

           Morgan finds Isaiah’s stare.

                                 MORGAN
                        No. We can’t let some A.I. decide 
                        their fate. This is human life.

                                 ISAIAH
                        How do we know the mere act of 
                        interfering won’t cause some type 
                        of cataclysmic systems failure? 
                        They could just be hibernating. 
                        Like the ship. We’re the variable.

           Leland starts to wipe off the top layer of ice on one of the 
           pods. He begins to see the face of an astronaut inside. They 
           appear to have a BREATHING APPARATUS ON INSIDE A SEALED SUIT.

           And for some reason, he seems to RECOGNIZE them. 

                                 MORGAN
                        The Sprint might have the 
                        technology to help them. We 
                        shouldn’t rush this decision. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Or we let them reach Meliora when 
                        they originally planned. 
                                 MORGAN
                        They’ll be dinosaurs when they 
                        arrive. Like we would have been...

                                 ISAIAH
                        Their technology, and whatever’s 
                        happening here, is as foreign to us 
                        as our technology was to them.

           Distracted by the disagreement, none of them see Leland swim 
           away from the frozen astronauts back towards the computer...

           INT. THE SPRINT - FLIGHT DECK

           Hunter takes a deep breath, already frustrated.

                                 HUNTER
                        Look, this is exactly what we’re 
                        talking about. We’re on the same 
                        page up here. You guys need to co--

                             (over radio-link)
                        You don’t get to make this call.

           INT. THE PHEIDIPPIDES

           Morgan and Isaiah are now inches apart.

                                 MORGAN
                        This is an entire generation of 
                        people we’re talking about.

                                 ISAIAH
                        So let them remain in stasis. We 
                        were never here.

                                 MORGAN
                        What about us, Isaiah? Should we 
                        have remained in stasis? 

                                 ISAIAH
                        We’re different.

           Neither of them see that Leland is now at the computer.

           “... THAW? -- Y/N”

           His gloved hand reaches out...

           Yuri sees him just as --
                                 YURI
                        Hey, uh, Leland...

           -- he strikes “Y.”

           The ship begins to echo with strange noises, the 
           reverberating sounds of warping metal and twisting pipes. 
           Some internal power source now changing gears.

           Leland swims back to the frozen astronauts.

           He watches as the archaic stasis chambers HEAT UP...

           ... and begin to THAW. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Leland, what the hell are you --

                                 LELAND
                        Shut up!

           Droplets of water start to rise up through the air around the 
           ice pods... followed by larger chunks of ice BREAKING OFF...

                                 YURI
                        This isn’t good...

                                 LELAND
                        Get ready to help them!

           One of the ASTRONAUTS is already almost finished THAWING -- a 
           WOMAN -- white-haired, late-40’s. 

           Leland frantically tries breaking away the rest of the ice 
           pod as her body SHIVERS in her suit, still unconscious. 

           He seems to take special care of her, making sure her 
           breathing apparatus remains secured. 

           Then -- her eyes OPEN.

           She looks PANICKED. Primal confusion. Struggling to breath 
           with the mask on. 

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        Hey, it’s okay! It’s okay!

           Her eyes fill with PANIC. She starts to THRASH AROUND.

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        Calm down, we’re here to help!

                                 MORGAN
                        Leland, what’s going on!
           He ignores Morgan, focusing on the Woman.

           Her muscles seem to TWITCH AND SPASM UNCONTROLLABLY.

                                 LELAND
                        Mom, it’s me! It’s okay!

           Everyone shares a look -- did he just say “mom?!”

           But it doesn’t seem to register with the woman. 

           Her arm flails out and grabs something -- AN ICICLE.

           Before Leland can react --

           WHAM! -- THE WOMAN SLAMS IT INTO HIS CHEST!

           It pierces his suit and the pressure instantly changes...

           ... BLOOD SPLASHES OUT. 

           Leland looks down -- she stabbed him right in the HEART.

           Morgan swims up behind Leland as the WOMAN’S SUIT BEGINS TO 
           CRYSTALLIZE. Something is going very wrong.

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        No...

           The ship CREAKS like a submarine breaking under the weight of 
           the ocean. The metal walls START TO CRACK and the entire ship 
           begins to FRACTURE. The photo of Ronald Reagan SHATTERS.

                                 MORGAN
                        We need to go!

           Morgan forcefully grabs Leland and starts to swim away with 
           him like a lifeguard saving a drowning victim. 

           He reaches out for the Woman as her SUIT BURSTS OPEN and her 
           exposed body INSTANTLY FREEZES IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE.

           With her eyes open -- TERRIFIED -- she suffocates --

           -- and DIES.

           INT. THE PHEIDIPPIDES

           The four of them glide around a corner as the ship continues 
           to WARP like a haunted house trying to kill them. 

           Morgan continues to pull Leland with her.
                                 MORGAN
                             (over radio-link)
                        We got an injury, be ready!

           Metal, debris, exhaust -- all seemingly aiming to not let 
           them go. Morgan keeps swimming, maneuvering through a 
           SHRINKING PASSAGE, about to be crushed by the metal walls.

           EXT. SPACE

           The hull SPLINTERS as they make their escape.

           And just as they propel themselves back to The Sprint...

           ... The Pheidippides BURSTS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES!

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. THE SPRINT - HALLWAY

           Leland is RUSHED ALONG ON A GURNEY with both crews by his 
           side. They remove his helmet as he COUGHS UP BLOOD.

           His skin has severe frostbite from the extreme loss of 
           pressure and cold from his broken suit. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Get him to the infirmary!

           INT. INFIRMARY

           Leland is pushed inside. Alyx is already scanning his body 
           with a WAND-LIKE DEVICE. She shows the readout to Hunter.

                                 HUNTER
                        Punctured his heart.

                                 ALYX
                        Massive trauma to his lungs from 
                        the sudden drop in pressure. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Can you save him?

           Hunter pushes Leland on the gurney so he’s close to the wall.

                                 HUNTER
                        Prep for surgery.

           Isaiah reaches out and grabs Hunter by the arm, but Hunter 
           swiftly turns around and lightly pushes him back. 
                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        You never should have been on that 
                        ship.

           Suddenly -- VWIP! -- A GLASS PARTITION SLIDES SHUT --

           EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

           -- separating Morgan, Isaiah, and Yuri on the OUTSIDE...

           INT. INFIRMARY

           ... Alyx, Hunter and Leland on the INSIDE.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE INFIRMARY - SAME

           Morgan and Isaiah can only stare in like medical observers.

           THROUGH THE GLASS --

           Alyx pulls a privacy curtain back, revealing -- 

           A STEEL CHAIR WITH DOZENS OF ROBOTIC LIMBS ARCHING OUT THE 
           BACK OF IT like the throne of some monstrous Spider King. 
           Part advanced medical device -- part medieval torture device. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        What the hell...

                                 YURI
                        Listen, what you’re about to see 
                        may look, uh, strange, but...

                                 ISAIAH
                        But what!

                                 YURI
                        They’re going to save his life. 

           INT. INFIRMARY

           Alyx and Hunter lift Leland’s body into the chair. 

           Suddenly, a CIRCULAR HOLE IN THE CEILING opens...

           ... and a METALLIC HALO LOWERS DOWN ABOVE THE CHAIR.

           Alyx and Hunter secure Leland in the chair. The metal halo 
           FASTEN’S AROUND LELAND’S FOREHEAD like a crown. 
           It straps his head back and tilts it up... exposing his neck. 

           The spidery, robotic limbs start to move on their own and 
           reach into a WALL OF DRAWERS like a MORGUE COOLER. 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE INFIRMARY - SAME

           THROUGH THE GLASS --

           A CLOUD OF NITROGEN FOG spews out of a drawer as it’s opened, 
           obscuring the view. 

           The bellowing nitrogen fog starts to CLEAR... revealing that 
           one of the robotic limbs now holds a SWORD-SIZED BLADE. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Save his life... how?

                                 YURI
                        Well, his body is beyond saving. 
                        But not his, uh, brain...

           Morgan and Isaiah exchange a look -- what the hell?

           THROUGH THE GLASS -- 

           The blade presses into Leland’s neck. It starts to carve into 
           his skin like a pumpkin. ARTERIAL SPRAY splashes the curtain.

                                 MORGAN
                        Oh, shit...

           The blade traces an outline around Leland’s trachea...

           Isaiah spots a LOOSE PIPE in the hallway. He rushes over, 
           grabs it, then runs back to the glass.

                                 YURI
                        Hey, wait you have to trust --

           WHAM! -- Isaiah hits the glass and a CRACK begins to form.

           THROUGH THE GLASS -- 

           Two of the other robotic limbs CLAMP onto Leland’s head like 
           it’s a carnival prize, then -- 

           With a bone-crunching SNAP -- the robotic limbs RIP LELAND’S 
           HEAD OFF! His spine dangles and blood drips off it. 

           Isaiah and Morgan want to vomit and scream at the same time.
                                 YURI (CONT'D)
                        I know it looks bad, but --

           Isaiah points the pipe at Yuri.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Don’t say another fucking word!

           Isaiah slams the pipe into the glass again.

           WHAM! -- the CRACK WIDENS. 

           THROUGH THE GLASS -- 

           The metal halo lifts LELAND’S SEVERED HEAD off his body. 

           The seat with Leland’s decapitated body suddenly SWIVELS INTO 
           THE WALL, taking his headless body with it...

           ... and a SECOND SEAT ROTATES INTO POSITION WITH A FRESH, 
           HEADLESS, NUDE, MALE BODY DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH. 

           WHAM! -- Isaiah hits the glass -- and it SHATTERS!

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Isaiah charges in. Hunter sees him.

                                 HUNTER
                        Look, we would have briefed you, 
                        but there was no --

           ISAIAH TACKLES HUNTER TO THE BLOOD-DRENCHED FLOOR. 

                                 ALYX
                        Stop! 

           Isaiah throws a punch, going on the offensive. Hunter tries 
           to block it, but Isaiah pummels him -- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

           Maybe with a little extra venom, too...

                                 ALYX (CONT'D)
                        We’re helping him, asshole! 

           Hunter tries reaching up for a scalpel, but Isaiah headbutts 
           him back down and grabs the scalpel instead.

           He’s about one millisecond away from killing Hunter when --

                                 LELAND (O.S.)
                        Wait...
           Everyone in the room goes dead still. 

           Was that... Leland?

           And as they all turn and look up at him --

           -- LELAND IS ALIVE AND WELL...

           ... A HALF A FOOT TALLER THAN BEFORE...

           ... WITH A STEEL COLLAR AROUND HIS NECK.

           Silence, then --

                                 MORGAN
                        What the FUCK just happened?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           Both crews are standing across from each other. Except for 
           Leland, who is the only one seated, enjoying some hot coffee.

                                 ALYX
                        It’s called a “BUB.” Backup Body. 
                        Grown from stem cells. No brain.

                                 MORGAN
                        So it’s not... synth?

                                 ALYX
                        No. Completely human tissue.

           Leland delicately blows on his coffee. Still... recovering.

           Isaiah remains a skeptic --

                                 ISAIAH
                        You decapitated him. 

                                 ALYX
                        Sure, and in your day to perform 
                        heart surgery, they would use a saw 
                        to cut into the rib cage and hold 
                        the chest cavity apart with pliers.

                        Imagine being from the 19th century 
                        walking in on that.
                                 ALYX
                        Without knowing what’s actually 
                        going on, you’d think you were 
                        witnessing some satanic ritual...

                                 HUNTER
                        ... when really you were walking in 
                        on one of the most advanced medical 
                        techniques ever invented.

           Silence. Hunter looks down at Leland.

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        The real question is -- why did you 
                        thaw their ship?

           Leland pauses. He stares forward, still lost in that moment.

                                 LELAND
                        I... I was trying to save her. 

                                 ALYX
                        Who?

                                 LELAND
                        Natalie Wong. I saw her name on the 
                        computer. She was inside one of 
                        those... blocks of ice. 

                                 YURI
                        Wong... you mean...

                                 LELAND
                        My mother.

           Silence.

                                 YURI
                        How is that possible?

           Leland’s emotions are still in flux. Eyes red. Delirious. Any 
           “sunny side” he had is now darkened amid a growing anger.

                                 LELAND
                        NASA told me she died in a training 
                        accident thirty years ago. I was 
                        just a boy. They... fucking lied.

           He pauses.

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        You were all bickering. But there 
                        was no way I was going to let her 
                        stay out there another 500 years.
           His eyes start to water again as he faces the consequences of 
           his decision.

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        They should have told me!

           Morgan puts her hand on his shoulder, trying to console him.

           Isaiah stares at Hunter.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Well, at least we learned your crew 
                        lets the A.I. decide everything. 

           Hunter holds Isaiah’s stare, both with unfinished business.

                                 HUNTER
                        I told you. He’s a tool we use to 
                        avoid disagreement.

                                 ISAIAH
                        That’s a nice way of saying you 
                        avoid making the tough choices.

           Alyx points to the rest of her crew.

                                 ALYX
                        We’re on the same page. When you 
                        were down there, you couldn’t agree 
                        on anything. If there’s a fracture 
                        on this mission, it’s not between 
                        generations -- it’s between you.

           Silence. Yuri just shakes his head, and with real concern --

                                 YURI
                        We read your generation was 
                        divided, we didn’t know how much...

           As tensions keep rising, Hunter tries maintaining order.

                                 HUNTER
                        Look, we re-enter stasis in six 
                        hours. Let’s all take a breather 
                        until then. Meet back for dinner.

           As everyone reluctantly agrees to step away and cool off --

                                 MORGAN
                        Wait.

           Both crews stop and look at her.
                                 HUNTER
                        What?

                                 MORGAN
                        The Wait Calculation...

                                 ALYX
                        Yeah, we get it. You explained --

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s going to happen again.

           Silence. The others share a look. Yuri smirks --

                                 YURI
                        C’mon. 

                                 MORGAN
                        “C’mon,” what?

                                 YURI
                        That would be... ridiculous. Right?

                                 MORGAN
                        Why?

                                 YURI
                        Because... we’re different.

           Morgan walks up to the screen. She uses her finger to trace 
           out some quick math next to the diagram of the two ships.

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re not even a third of the way 
                        to Meliora. If the math works out 
                        roughly the same as before, and the 
                        next crew continues to be faster...

                                 ALYX
                        Next crew?

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s not ridiculous at all...

           She stops and looks at them.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        ... it’s guaranteed.

           They start to realize she might be right.

                                 LELAND
                        So what are you saying, that if we 
                        go in stasis again --
                                 MORGAN
                        A faster ship will wake us up. Just 
                        like you did to us. Just like we 
                        did to the Phedipeddies. 

           Silence. Morgan stares at each of them --

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Don’t you guys get it? The danger 
                        we thought we’d face out here? It’s 
                        not aliens or some asteroid. It’s 
                        this. The wait calculation. 

           Another long, tense moment passes. Isaiah looks at her --

                                 ISAIAH
                        Shit. It’s even worse than that.

                                 MORGAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 ISAIAH
                        You’re right. A new ship is 
                        guaranteed to catch up to us, but 
                        it isn’t guaranteed to stop for us.
                        What if it just... passes us by?

           Everyone starts to realize what that means --

                                 ALYX
                        We’ll still eventually arrive at 
                        Meliora, but a fully-developed one. 
                        And we won’t be pioneers or 
                        explorers. We’ll be the dinosaurs.

           Not even Morgan had anticipated that. Silence, then --

                                 ISAIAH
                        ... unless we do something to make 
                        them stop for us.

           Morgan isn’t sure she likes the sound of that. 

                                 MORGAN
                        By doing something like that... 
                        we’d be choosing our lives ahead of 
                        the mission. If another ship is 
                        meant to get there faster, with or 
                        without us... it’s their decision.

           Isaiah holds her stare.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Is it?
           As everyone dwells on that --

                                 ALYX
                        I think I might have an idea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RECORDING ROOM

           Everyone is huddled around a MICROPHONE. An opened bottle of 
           JACK DANIELS is on the table. 

           Alyx looks down at a WRITTEN MESSAGE. Lines are crossed out, 
           words have been altered and re-written.

           Morgan stands off to the corner. Not drinking. 

           Alyx takes another swig of whiskey, cracks her neck, then --

           INT. “THE SPRINT” - HALLWAY - SAME

           Her VOICE echoes through the different halls and rooms.

                                 ALYX (V.O.)
                        This is the U.S.S. Sprint, codex 
                        alpha 44-7. 

           After much practice, and a little whiskey, her voice is the 
           perfect combination of grave yet somehow... alluring.

           INT. LELAND’S PRIVATE QUARTERS - SAME

           Leland stands naked facing a mirror as he examines his new, 
           younger body. He rubs the collar keeping his head attached. 

                                 ALYX (V.O.)
                        Something has happened. We have 
                        vital information you need to 
                        complete your journey to Meliora.

           He spots something in the mirror on his skin just above his 
           left kidney. He twists to get a look at it -- A BAR CODE.

                                 ALYX (V.O.)
                        We’ve made a major discovery. And 
                        we need your help.

           He takes out a PHOTO, decades old. It’s of him as a young boy 
           with his MOTHER standing beside him in her astronaut suit.

           Leland raises his hand to his face... and begins to CRY.
           INT. ISAIAH’S PRIVATE QUARTERS - SAME

           Isaiah stares out his window into space. But he doesn’t cry. 
           Instead, he continues to fiddle with his swiss army knife.

           But unlike before... it now slices into his skin as droplets 
           of blood hit the floor. And he doesn’t even seem to notice.

                                 ALYX (V.O.)
                        You are in danger, like we were. 
                        You must stop and find us, for your 
                        own sake, and that of the mission. 

           INT. RECORDING ROOM - SAME

           Alyx finishes just above the mic, a hypnotic hint of ASMR to 
           the final words of her “distress signal.”

                                 ALYX
                        We have so much to tell you. You 
                        will not make it to Meliora without 
                        our help. We must make it there... 
                        together.

           And with that, the MIC turns off. 

           Alyx looks at the others, and they look at her. 

           Knowing what they’ve just done.

                                 YURI
                        I’d stop for that.

                                 ALYX
                        Don’t thank me. I got the idea from 
                        him. 

           Alyx points at Isaiah.

                                 ALYX (CONT'D)
                        How’s that for a distress signal?

           Isaiah smiles back. 

           Are these crews actually... bonding?

                                 HUNTER
                        All we have to do now is send it 
                        and enter stasis.

           Hunter reaches out to a holographic button -- 

           “SET TO BROADCAST LOOP.” 
           Morgan steps forward and holds his stare.

                                 MORGAN
                        If we choose to do this, we have to 
                        be willing to accept the future 
                        when it gets here... and all of the 
                        consequences it brings.

           A moment, then --

           Hunter hits “BROADCAST.”

           INT. STASIS CHAMBER

           Everyone is dressed down to their underwear as they step 
           forward to each enter their own VERTICAL STASIS POD.

           Hunter has shaved his beard, seemingly wanting to look his 
           best in case they get boarded by “the future.”

           Morgan and Isaiah are the last ones to enter their pods. 
           Morgan looks at him, and for the first time... is fearful.

                                 MORGAN
                        What have we just done, Isaiah?

                                 ISAIAH
                        Assured our survival.

                                 MORGAN
                        You mean our relevancy.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Staying relevant is survival.

           Isaiah turns and gets in his pod. 

           Morgan stares at her own... then steps inside.

           She turns around and the pod SEALS with a suffocating HISS. 
           Her breathing constricts. Her eyes close. A mist starts to 
           cover her skin. And very soon... she’s peacefully in stasis.

           But in her slumber --

           THE FLASH OF A DREAM... OR A MEMORY --

           Her father Phillip when he was young and healthy. SEVEN-YEAR 
           OLD MORGAN is by his side as they tend do an old car.

                                 PHILLIP
                        What’s the problem, Morgan?
           Seven-Year Old Morgan doesn’t answer.

                                 PHILLIP (CONT'D)
                        Remember, a good mechanic has to 
                        actually get INSIDE the engine.

           Morgan kneels down and gets on her back. She scoots 
           underneath the engine. 

           UNDER THE ENGINE --

           Everything looks normal... until parts of the engine suddenly 
           appear to MOVE... 

           Morgan quickly scoots back out and recoils into the safe 
           clutches of her father’s dirty work gloves. 

           Phillip tries not to laugh.

                                 PHILLIP (CONT'D)
                        What did you see, Morgan?

                                 MORGAN
                        Rats...

           Philip smiles.

                                 PHILLIP
                        That’s right. The rats are there 
                        because the engine wasn’t 
                        maintained. But if we’re going to 
                        do our part and fix this car, we 
                        have to be the ones to confront it. 

           BACK TO ADULT MORGAN IN STASIS, EYES SHUT --

                                 PHILLIP (V.O.)
                        So, Morgan, will you do your part?

           And just as that question echoes --

           HER EYES SHOOT OPEN AS A RED EMERGENCY LIGHT BATHES HER FACE!

           Everyone is ejected out of their pods. But instead of 
           floating out, they fall forward and drop to the floor, in 
           need of catching their breath. Hunter looks up and SHOUTS --

                                 HUNTER
                        Neal, what’s going on?

                                 NEAL
                        Another ship is in proximity.

           Isaiah sees the clock -- “74 YEARS...”
                                 ISAIAH
                        Holy shit, it worked...

           Both crews start to quickly get dressed.

           INT. AIRLOCK

           A massive, steel elevator-like door. Sealed shut, impossible 
           to penetrate. Both crews turn the corner and stare at it.

                                 HUNTER
                        Everyone relax. Nothing can get -- 

           Suddenly, a LIQUID METAL begins to seep through the small 
           crack between the doors of the airlock. It starts to harden 
           then begins to EXPAND -- prying the airlock door open. 

           The metal airlock CREAKS like an old ship. Then --

           BOOM! -- IT BURSTS OPEN and a CLOUD OF SMOKE fills the air. 

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                             (through the smoke)
                        Stay calm!

           No one can see for a moment. A sense of panic rising.

           When the smoke settles...

           THREE MASSIVE FIGURES HAVE STEPPED ABOARD!

           Each is over 6-FEET TALL -- IMPOSING with SHARP, METAL SKIN 
           and JAGGED, PYRAMID-LIKE HEADS WITH NO MOUTHS OR NOSES.

           Just two, pearly-white EYES.

           Each of the Figures holds a freakish WEAPON of some type -- a 
           COBALT GUN that’s part sniper rifle, part medieval javelin. 

           And they are each aimed right at the original two crews.

           The two crews FREEZE -- clearly at the mercy of this third 
           presence, until --

           One by one, the metal skin seems to mechanically RETRACT from 
           each of the figures. Exo-skeleton armor now revealing --

           THEY ARE HUMAN.

                                 YURI
                        Oh, thank God.
           But they appear more like SOLDIERS than astronauts. Faces 
           HEAVILY SCARRED -- shaved heads -- battle-hardened -- they 
           look wary. Knights of the roundtable with breathing helmets. 

           Like the crews before them, they are split two men, one 
           woman, each a different ethnicity. But they are taller and 
           stronger with an... authoritarian temperament. 

           Morgan walks right up to the first Soldier and stares at a 
           strange emblem displayed right on the front of his suit --

           NASA.

           Redesigned and more militaristic.

           Each of the three soldiers also have identification on their 
           uniforms like nametags -- “A.1.” “B.2.” “Z.3.” 

                                 A.1.
                        We got your distress signal.

                                 B.2.
                        Where is it!

           Hunter raises his hands, trying to answer diplomatically.

                                 HUNTER
                        Look, there’s a lot to explain, but 
                        we’re fine. There is no threat. 

                                 ALYX
                        We just had to say something so we 
                        wouldn’t be stranded out here.

           The Soldiers share a look...

                                 Z.3.
                        They don’t know yet...

           The first two crews trade a glance.

                                 YURI
                        Uh, excuse me, don’t know what yet?

           INT. “THE SPRINT” - HALLWAY

           The Soldiers move with purpose. 

           One of them uses a SMALL PYRAMID-SHAPED DEVICE that gives 
           them immediate three-dimensional readouts of every hallway.

           Everyone follows.
                                 B.2.
                        Stay back and let us do our job!

                                 ALYX
                        Didn’t you hear us -- we’re not in 
                        danger! There is no threat!

           The Soldiers stop outside a door and raise their guns.

                                 A.1.
                        It’s in here.

           INT. SYNTH GARDEN

           Peaceful fields of strawberries, bananas, and potatoes. But 
           that peace is shattered as the Soldiers storm in. They don’t 
           see a luscious garden... they see a dangerous battlefield.

                                 A.1.
                        My God. It’s everywhere.

                                 Z.3.
                        It may have already started 
                        changing.

                                 HUNTER
                        Changing?

                                 A.1.
                        Burn it all!

           Each of the Soldiers press a button on their guns -- and they 
           seem to SHIFT into something more resembling a FLAMETHROWER.

                                 ALYX
                        No, wait --

           VWOOOOOSH! -- the Soldiers blanket the garden with a unique 
           MERCURY-COLORED FLAME!

                                 HUNTER
                        That’s our food supply!

           Hunter makes a move to stop one of them -- WHAM! -- one of 
           the Soldiers knocks him in the head so he falls to the floor.

           As the Soldiers continue to torch the beautiful garden --

           Something eerie can be heard... SHRIEKING.

           Like the garden itself is howling out in pain.

           Like the garden is... alive.
           As the fire starts to eat away at everything, the nanostalks 
           seem to lift up into the air like they’re reaching to escape. 

           But the flames are too strong, and they eat away at the roots 
           of the stalks until and they begin to go limp and burn off.

           The Soldiers stand near the door, then --

                                 A.1.
                        Neal, seal all ventilation and 
                        contain the fire inside the room.

                                 NEAL
                        Yes, Captain.

                                 HUNTER
                        Captain? Wait, I’m --

           The Soldiers STEP BACK.

                                 A.1.
                        I’m sorry.

           VWIP! -- 

           A DOOR SLIDES DOWN -- JUST LIKE THE INFIRMARY BEFORE.

           Except this time... the first two crews are INSIDE THE ROOM -- 

           -- while the Soldiers are OUTSIDE IT -- GONE.

                                 HUNTER
                        Neal, open the door!

           NO RESPONSE.

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        Neal, open the god damn door!

                                 MORGAN
                        They must have hacked your ship 
                        before they came aboard.

                                 HUNTER
                        They can’t do that.

                                 MORGAN
                        We don’t know what they can do...

           Leland stares out one of the portholes. He sees TWO LONG 
           RAILS now attached to The Sprint like a set of tracks. They 
           seem to come from a THIRD, SILVERY SHIP IN THE DISTANCE.

           But in here, the flames start TAKING OVER THE ROOM.
                                 ALYX
                        Why the hell would they do this!

           They all start to COUGH -- SMOKE IS EVERYWHERE -- and the 
           fire is all consuming. They have seconds, not minutes.

                                 YURI
                        If we can get to an emergency 
                        terminal, I can override Neal.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Is there one in this room?

                                 YURI
                        No. We need to get out of here.

           Flames ROAR and smoke begins to blanket the ceiling.

           Morgan suddenly looks around, realizing -- 

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re surrounded by synth...

                                 ALYX
                        No shit.

                                 MORGAN
                        Can’t we make it whatever we need?

           Yuri looks up at Morgan -- she’s right.

                                 YURI
                        Backup.

                                 MORGAN
                        Where?

                                 YURI
                        No. The backup...

           Yuri slides the special pair of BRASS KNUCKLES THAT CONTROL 
           THE SYNTH over his right hand and points it at the fire. 

           Instantly, whatever synth is still alive suddenly SLITHERS 
           TOWARDS THE SEALED DOOR LIKE A SNAKE, then SLIDES UNDERNEATH 
           the imperceptible gap under the door. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Where are you sending it?
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The nanites rapidly coalesce into a SMALL SYNTH CLOUD. It 
           travels through the hallway also with purpose. But it doesn’t 
           go to the docking bay, instead it turns...

           INT. SYNTH GARDEN

           A STALK OF NANITES crumble in the fire and cascade to the 
           floor, kicking up smoke. Everyone has to duck to avoid it as 
           it’s becoming increasingly difficult to breathe. 

           Leland tries smashing the door with his new body, but no 
           matter how strong he is, the door doesn’t budge.

           Just then, BEEPING comes from the other side of the door.

           The airlock RELEASES and the DOOR SLIDES OPEN. The rush of 
           air PULLS THE FLAMES out for a second, then they subside.

           And when they do, their savior is seen on the other side of 
           the door -- A SYNTH/BACKUP-BODY HYBRID.

           A NUDE, MALE BODY... WITH A FLESH-COLORED HEAD MADE OF RAW 
           SYNTH. It has NO FACIAL FEATURES. No nose. No eyes. No mouth. 

           Just a blank head like a mannequin. 

           Incredibly... unnerving. 

           The crew members share a look, then rush out of the room. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone keeps running from the fire, along with the Hybrid. 
           Yuri seems to be controlling it with the BRASS KNUCKLES. 

           Hunter rips the cover off a CONTROL PANEL, then quickly 
           inputs a code. The words “MANUAL OVERRIDE ACCEPTED” flash.

                                 HUNTER
                        Neal!

                                 NEAL
                        Yes, captain.

           They share a glance -- they have control again.
           INT. HALLWAY

           The Soldiers move quickly, using the pyramidal device to 
           continue scanning each room of the ship. 

           INT. DINING HALL

           The Soldiers enter as the pyramidal device BLINKS --

                                 Z.3.
                        Last strand in here!

                                 A.1.
                        Then let’s finish it and get the 
                        hell off this relic!

           But before they can --

           The door suddenly SEALS BEHIND THEM. 

           THE LIGHTS SHUT OFF -- REPLACED BY RED EMERGENCY LIGHTING.

                                 Z.3.
                        Shit, it’s a trap!

                                 B.2.
                        Must already be sentient! Visuals!

           SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS. It is SWIFT and VICIOUS as 
           it charges Z.3. -- WHAM! -- ramming him out of formation. The 
           others try to react, but it’s already gone. 

                                 A.1.
                        Target!

           They see something move in the corner.

                                 Z.3.
                        There!

           They OPEN FIRE and their advanced firepower has a deep 
           orchestral rhythm to it. But the intruder stands unaffected 
           by their gunfire as it reveals itself -- the HYBRID. 

           It’s body is now filled with bullet holes. But 
           miraculously... nanites start swarming off its head and zoom 
           down to its human body as it START HEALING ITSELF. 

                                 B.2.
                        It’s the Synth!

                                 A.1.
                        We know what to do! Light it up!
           Their guns suddenly MORPH and that MERCURY-COLORED FIRE FLOWS 
           OUT OF THEM LIKE BEFORE -- TORCHING THE HYBRID!

           The Hybrid’s human body starts to disintegrate and the 
           swarming nanites are unable to heal itself faster than it’s 
           melting. 

           But it quickly reaches out and GRABS FOOD -- CONVERTING FRUIT 
           BACK INTO RAW SYNTH AND USING IT TO HELP PATCH ITS WOUNDS. 

           The Hybrid -- almost angry and in a state of aggression -- 
           LUNGES FORWARD and begins to disarm the Soldiers one-by-one, 
           sending their weapons one way, and their bodies another.

           When it’s all over, the Soldiers are recovering on the floor 
           while the Hybrid finishes healing in the middle of the room. 

           The door opens... and the first two crews step inside.

           Yuri moves the brass knuckles and the Hybrid joins his side.

           A.1. looks up at them, horrified --

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        You don’t know what you’ve just 
                        done...

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           Everyone is crowded around the table. But now instead of TWO 
           CREWS EQUALING 6 -- there are THREE CREWS EQUALING 9.

                                 A.1.
                        We don’t have names. We have 
                        designations. That’s B.2. and Z.3. 

           She signals out each of her crew. 

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        And I’m A.1.

           The first two crews share a glance.

                                 YURI
                        Like the steak sauce?

           A.1. pauses. She’s never heard of it.

           Yuri leans in to the others.

                                 YURI (CONT'D)
                        No steak sauce.
           A.1. just stares back at them.

                                 A.1.
                        Our only priority is Meliora.

                                 ALYX
                        Sounds familiar...

                                 Z.3.
                        And keeping it pure.

           Silence -- say what?

                                 HUNTER
                        What does that mean?

                                 A.1.
                        All you need to know is that war 
                        broke out. Worse than ever before. 
                        Within months, a third of the 
                        world’s population was gone. 

                                 YURI
                        War? That’s, uh, not possible. 

                                 Z.3.
                        You synthies would say that.

                                 ALYX
                        Excuse me, “synthies?”

                                 Z.3. 
                        We’re cleaning up your mess.

                                 YURI
                        What “mess?”

                                 B.2.
                        The synth crops.

           It hangs there. 

                                 A.1.
                        The nanites started... changing. On 
                        their own. Weaponizing. 

                                 Z.3.
                        Then they started killing us.

                                 ALYX
                        Bullshit.

                                 A.1.
                        This is Earth now --
           A.1. walks to the wall and touches her glove to it. 

           It suddenly PROJECTS AN IMAGE FOR ALL TO SEE -- 

           CRUMBLING CITY BUILDINGS COVERED IN SYNTHETIC NANITES. Like 
           mold reclaiming a corpse. Blown-out tanks fill city streets. 

           A WAR-BATTERED HELLISH LANDSCAPE. 

                                 ALYX
                        No... synth cured world hunger. 

                                 B.2.
                        Yeah. And then it caused the 
                        greatest loss of human life the 
                        world has ever known.

           Silence.

                                 A.1. 
                        That’s the thing -- synth was a 
                        “quick fix” to a bigger problem. A 
                        bigger problem that that should 
                        have been solved a long time ago. 

           Morgan can’t help but feel a sense of guilt. 

                                 Z.3.
                        There aren’t enough resources now. 
                        Meliora is our last hope.

                                 A.1.
                        If the Synth get there... it would 
                        be the end of humanity.

           No one knows exactly what to say for a moment.

                                 HUNTER
                        So... you were always out here 
                        searching for us?

                                 B.2.
                        No. We didn’t even know you 
                        assholes were out here until we 
                        heard your distress signal.

           The first two crews share a glance.

           INT. THE MARATHON - SAME

           As the three crews try and get on the same page...
           ... strands of melted synth drip down around The Marathon 
           like battery acid...

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           Alyx walks right up to the Hybrid and stares up at it.

                                 ALYX
                        We control it. Otherwise, if it 
                        wanted to, it would just kill me.

           She stares right at it.

                                 ALYX (CONT'D)
                        So kill me, you piece of shit!

           It stares right down at her...

           ... and stares...

           ... and stares...

           A.1. exhales, at the end of her rope.

                                 A.1.
                        Why won’t you just listen to us...

           A SUDDEN JOLT grabs everyone’s attention, then --

           INT. DOCKING BAY

               BOOOOOOM! -- The Marathon EXPLODES!

           Whatever that dark plasma is, it CATCHES FIRE and begins to 
           fork through DIFFERENT VENTS -- bringing DESTRUCTION with it.

           INT. DINING QUARTERS

           Alarms begin to BLARE. The ceiling’s fire retardant system 
           begins to rain water down on all of them. Chaos brewing... 

                                 HUNTER
                        Neal, what’s happening!

                                 NEAL
                        Cascading failures are being 
                        detected... detected... detected...

                                 B.2.
                        It’s the synth...
                                 LELAND
                        Or it’s a mechanical fire because 
                        of the fire you started.

                                 A.1.
                        Either way, we have to go!

                                 HUNTER
                        Neal, how long do we have!

           No response. 

           Poor old Neal is the first casualty.

           Isaiah walks right up to A.1.

                                 ISAIAH
                        You’re taking us aboard your ship. 

           Yuri points his brass-knuckled hand out, and with it, the 
           Hybrid treads up to A.1. and stares down at her.

                                 YURI
                        Seems he’s still listening to us. 

           A.1. stares up at the faceless Hybrid. 

                                 A.1.
                        Only if this abomination goes down 
                        with the ship.

           Hunter and Yuri trade a look. A final moment, then --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY

           ALL 3 CREWS now sprinting down the hall -- TOGETHER.

           The Hybrid is nowhere in sight.

           BOOM! -- another EXPLOSION from deeper in the ship.

           Alyx stops and opens a SET OF EMERGENCY LOCKERS and starts 
           distributing BLUE SPACE SUITS AND GOLDEN HELMETS.

           The original two crews have to SUIT UP... but the third crew 
           just taps a button on their shoulder and their METALLIC SUITS 
           re-form over their body like before.
           INT. “THE SPRINT” - AIRLOCK

           They reach the airlock. Cramped together in a small 10 x 20 
           foot sealed chamber with a TRANSPORT TRAIN secured to a 
           SQUARE SET OF TRACKS -- TWO RAILS above, TWO RAILS below. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Everyone crowd in!

                                 A.1.
                        No! It has to be three at a time. 
                        The train won’t move if it’s more.

           Another EXPLOSION rocks the ship. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We go in shifts. Mix up the crews.

           INT. TRANSPORT TRAIN

           A.1., Yuri, and Leland strap into the seats of the transport 
           train like they’re securing into a roller coaster. 

           A moment, then --

           WHOOOSH! -- the train LAUNCHES FORWARD. 

           EXT. SPACE

           The train rushes over the tracks in silence. But the tracks 
           TREMBLE under the sheer force of the rushing train. 

           INT. THIRD SHIP - AIRLOCK

           The transport train DOCKS into the third ship. 

           Everything is INDUSTRIAL STONE GRAY. Like smoke that has 
           somehow hardened and formed a ship. Wartime monochromatic. 

           EXT. SPACE

           The empty train SOARS BACK THROUGH SPACE. 

           INT. “THE SPRINT” - AIRLOCK

           The train returns and docks in the airlock. 
           INT. TRANSPORT TRAIN

           Z.3., Isaiah, and Alyx get on and strap in, then --

           WHOOOSH! -- the train launches forward. 

           EXT. SPACE

           The train speeds through space. 

           Again, the tracks TREMBLE. 

           ... maybe a tad more severely than before.

           INT. THIRD SHIP - AIRLOCK

           The train pulls back in and the second shift climbs out. 

                                 A.1.
                        Last trip!

           EXT. SPACE

           This train comes back and docks with The Marathon.

           INT. TRANSPORT TRAIN

           Morgan, Hunter, and B.2. are the last three. They get onboard 
           and strap in as the TRAIN DOORS SEAL SHUT.

           EXT. SPACE

           VWOOSH! -- the train DEPARTS towards the third ship.

           INT. TRANSPORT TRAIN

           Hunter looks at Morgan.

                                 HUNTER
                        You were right. We never should --

           EXT. SPACE

               BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! -- 

           THE SPRINT EXPLODES.
           INT. TRANSPORT TRAIN

           Morgan, Hunter, and B.2. are VIOLENTLY JOSTLED AROUND.

           EXT. SPACE

           SHRAPNEL BLASTS OUT EVERYWHERE!

           The tracks BREAK AWAY FROM THE SHIP AND CURL from the force 
           of the blast... CAUSING THE TRAIN TO ROCKET DOWN THE TRACKS!

           INT. THIRD SHIP - AIRLOCK

           Everyone moves away from the window as shards of the The 
           Sprint begin to pepper and crash into the third ship. 

           INT. TRANSPORT TRAIN

           Morgan looks out the window -- they’re COMING IN HOT.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hold on!

           As each of them grip their seats --

                                                         SMASH TO BLACK

           DARKNESS. 

           Silence for a moment. Until --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UNKNOWN

           A DEEP INHALE OF BREATH --

           Morgan wakes up. Coughing. Groggy. Her vision comes to. 

           She’s in an INFIRMARY. Only this one doesn’t have the warmth 
           of before. Now the walls are cold and lifeless. 

           And for some reason, it’s hard for her to BREATHE. 

           She lifts her legs up and stands, but her balance is weak.
           EXT. HALLWAY

           Dark, gunmetal gray. Straight lines and sharp angles. Like 
           running through a mausoleum of carved rock. 

           Morgan passes a WINDOW that looks out into space.

           The stars seem to be STREAKING BY. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re moving...

           Much faster than either The Marathon or The Sprint, too.

           She keeps walking, but her balance is off. 

           INT. DARKENED ROOM

           Morgan cautiously stumbles inside a room as she continues to 
           try and figure out where she is, unsure of her surroundings. 

           As she takes several steps inside... 

           LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME ON

           The room she’s in is FULL OF KNIVES, GUNS, GRENADES. All 
           sealed behind DISPLAY GLASS like objects in a museum. There’s 
           even a SHOOTING RANGE on the other end of the room. 

           She suddenly STAGGERS and has to hold onto the wall for 
           support. The moment she does -- CLANK!

           That was a strange sound for her hand to make.

           She looks at her right arm and her eyes fill with shock --

           HER ARM HAS BEEN REPLACED -- it’s now a hyper-sophisticated 
           AUGMENTED PROSTHETIC. BLACK METAL and CARBON-FIBER TENDONS. 

                                 MORGAN
                        What... happened...

           Morgan is at a loss.

           But she suddenly turns and sees someone in the doorway --

           Z.3. 

           And just like her, he seems to be breathing heavily.
           INT. HALLWAY

           Morgan follows Z.3. through the ship.

           A RED LIGHT splashes over her from a scanner in the ceiling.

                                 DEEP A.I. VOICE
                        DISARM YOURSELF!

                                 MORGAN
                        Armed? I’m not --

           In a flash, Morgan’s METALLIC ARM STARTS TO TRANSFORM. 

           Metal pieces sliding back and forth, in and out, until her 
           augmented prosthetic is no longer an arm at all.

           It’s now a big, nasty fucking gun. 

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        ... armed.

                                 DEEP VOICE
                        RELINQUISH YOUR WEAPON IN FIVE 
                        SECONDS... FOUR... THREE...

                                 Z.3.
                        Neal, verify Morgan Reed! 

           THE RED LIGHT TURNS BLUE and VANISHES.

                                 MORGAN
                        That’s Neal now?

           Z.3. shrugs. Morgan raises her augmented prosthetic. 

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        And why the fuck is my arm a gun?

                                 Z.3.
                        Because your real arm is probably 
                        in a black hole somewhere. And 
                        that’s the last prosthetic we had.

           Morgan’s augmented gun suddenly SHIFTS BACK INTO AN ARM.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m not doing that.

                                 Z.3.
                        I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it. 

           The ship TREMBLES. 
           An aftershock... or a precursor for something worse?

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           An oblong room with doors leading out in every direction. A 
           360 view of outer space is seen through a domed ceiling. 

           The ship is moving so fast through the universe that every 
           star appears to be shooting by. 

           All 9 members of each of the three crews stand. 

                                 B.2.
                        We can’t! The train hit in the 
                        worst possible spot on this ship!

           (In a very real way, it’s like the crew from the original 
           Apollo missions AND The Jetsons on one side... and a squadron 
           of post-apocalyptic space marines on the other.)

                                 HUNTER
                        How bad is it?

           A HOLOGRAM suddenly forms of the now DAMAGED THIRD SHIP, 
           along with the FLOATING DEBRIS FROM THE SPRINT all around it. 

           The damage is SEVERE. 

                                 A.1.
                        The train impacted directly with 
                        oxygen and life support systems.

                                 MORGAN (O.S.)
                        But we’re still moving.

           Everyone turns and sees her enter the room. 

                                 B.2.
                        Fuel cells are on the other side of 
                        the ship. Lucky us, I guess.

                                 MORGAN
                        How long until we reach Meliora?

           B.2. points to a COUNTDOWN on the other wall -- 

           “16 HOURS... 33 MINUTES... 47 SECONDS...”

           Morgan stares at it. 

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Neal, how much time do we have left 
                        with the remaining oxygen?
           The COUNTDOWN RE-FORMS --

           “29 MINUTES... 9 SECONDS...”

           Everyone goes silent.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        So that explains why we’re all out 
                        of breath. 

           Another long silence, then --

                                 Z.3.
                        Neal, how much time would we have 
                        with 3 people on board?

                                 ALYX
                        Asshole, there’s 9 of us...

           The COUNTDOWN RE-FORMS AGAIN --

           “5 HOURS... 14 MINUTES... 55 SECONDS...”

           Yuri glances around, relieved.

                                 YURI
                        Dodged a bullet there, right guys? 
                        I mean, it still isn’t -- 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Neal, how much time would one 
                        person have?

                                 YURI
                        Oh, don’t do that...

           The COUNTDOWN RE-FORMS ONE MORE TIME -- 

           “17 HOURS... 4 MINUTES... 23 SECONDS...”

           No one has to say it. 

           NOT A SINGLE FUCKING WORD.

           There’s enough oxygen... FOR EXACTLY ONE PERSON.

                                 Z.3.
                        If only one person can make it, 
                        then it’s someone from our crew. 

                                 LELAND
                        It was our mission before it was 
                        yours. We started it, we end it.
                                 ALYX
                        What about us?! You wouldn’t even 
                        be alive if we hadn’t saved you.

           Isaiah just shakes his head --

                                 ISAIAH
                        I can’t be the only one here who 
                        appreciates irony, can I?

           He stares at each of them with a different perspective.

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        We left because Earth was running 
                        out of clean air, and yet here we 
                        are again -- out of oxygen.

           He turns to Hunter.

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        You left because Earth was 
                        overpopulated, and yet here we are  
                        -- overpopulated. 

           Isaiah turns to A.1. 

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        And you left Earth because of war, 
                        and yet... here we are.

           “WAR.”

           Each of the three crews starts to appear a tad more 
           defensive... eyes shifting to the person beside them.

           But Morgan’s transfixed on THE REAL-TIME MODEL OF THE THIRD 
           SHIP. She sees the NAME ON THE SIDE OF IT. The hull has been 
           shattered, and only part of it remains -- “...ELAY.”

                                 MORGAN
                        What’s the name of your ship?

           B.2. adjusts levers on the stone controls. The model of their 
           ship REWINDS THE DAMAGE, HEALING THE MODEL SHIP. 

           The name is now clearly displayed -- “THE RELAY.”

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        The Relay...

           And slowly... tears fill her eyes. 
                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        We have to break this cycle. No 
                        matter what happens between 
                        generations, instead of helping 
                        each other... we fight each other. 

           She pauses.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        We’re not supposed to be enemies.

           Hunter wants to believe that, but --

                                 HUNTER
                        Maybe it’s a bigger problem than we 
                        can solve, Morgan. 

           Alyx seems to agree --

                                 ALYX
                        It’s not as easy as just stopping.

           Morgan’s suddenly struck by that word.

                                 MORGAN
                        How fast are we going?

                                 A.1.
                        Close to the speed of light, why?

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re moving too fast to be caught.

           A.1. trades looks with her two crewmates.

                                 A.1.
                        Yeah, I’m afraid we’ve entertained 
                        you as much as we can.

           Their hands move closer to their holstered weapons...

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        It is our ship, after all.

           Everyone, including Morgan, can sense what they’re implying.

                                 MORGAN
                        No, if we stop then the next --

           The third crew now shares another loaded look.

                                 LELAND
                        I think they’re done “waiting.”
           A.1. nods to B.2. and Z.3. -- 

           And just as the they draw their weapons --

           SLASH! -- ISAIAH IS A FRACTION OF A SECOND FASTER AND 
           DEFENSIVELY SLICES A.1. ACROSS THE EYE WITH HIS SWISS ARMY 
           KNIFE!

                                 MORGAN
                        No!

           A.1. falters. 

           Isaiah uses the momentum and GRABS HER GUN. 

           B.2. and Z.3. draw their weapons when -- 

           VA-BOOM! -- Isaiah pulls the trigger and a MASSIVE CONCUSSIVE 
           FORCE is blasted out of his gun, launching B.2. and Z.3. 
           backwards against the wall. 

           The gun is too powerful for Isaiah and it FLIES OUT OF HIS 
           HANDS across the room. Isaiah barely has time to register the 
           power of the weapon when A.1. recovers --

                                 A.1.
                        Seal them in!

           Z.3. collects himself and hits a panel on the wall.

           The door to the room starts to SLIDE CLOSED, but Leland leaps 
           across the room and uses all his strength to prop it open.

                                 LELAND
                        Move!

           The first two crews quickly dash out past Leland. Isaiah is 
           the last one heading for the door --

           B.2. shakes off the concussive blast and aims his gun --

           As he does, his gun RECONGIGURES ITSELF, shifting into a new 
           attack mode -- AND HE OPENS FIRE! 

           BULLETS TEAR THROUGH THE ROOM!

           Leland is the last to make it as he rolls out. 

           The door SLAMS SHUT.
           INT. HALLWAY

           Bullets are heard reflecting off the other side of the door 
           as the first two crews race out. 

                                 ALYX
                        They’re going to kill us...

           But Leland looks down... bleeding in his side from a bullet.

                                 LELAND
                        Might have already started.

                                 ISAIAH
                        It always had to end this way.

                                 ALYX
                        What way?

                                 ISAIAH
                        Survival of the fittest.

           Morgan tries to plead with Isaiah --

                                 MORGAN
                        No, we have to find the bridge! We 
                        can still make it out --

                                 YURI
                        Fuck this! 

           Yuri runs off in a panic.

                                 MORGAN
                        Wait, we have to stay together!

           But it’s already too late. Amidst the fear and confusion, 
           everyone has already to DISSAPEAR INTO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, 
           running for their lives.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           The third crew stands alone. 

           A.1. gets back up and looks at B.2. and Z.3. 

                                 A.1.
                        This is our ship...

           Her left eye is slashed and bleeding. 

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        This is our time...
           She slaps a PATCH over her eye. It seamlessly melds with her 
           skin and masks the wound... but not the pain.

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        Kill them all.

           INT. COLD STORAGE

           Frozen mist fills the air. Steel crates piled high and 
           covered in frost. Quick bursts of steam shoot upwards from 
           behind a row of crates like a tiny train chugging along.

           BEHIND THE CRATES --

           Leland looks for something to cauterize his wound, going 
           through supply crates that he has no idea what’s inside.

           But he suddenly stops breathing, noticing SHORT, STEAMY 
           BREATHS coming from behind a different crate. 

           It’s Alyx. 

           She’s also found a similar spot... and a CROWBAR.

           They see each other. Leland raises his finger to his lips. 

           Because he suddenly hears something else --

           FOOTSTEPS coming from somewhere else in the room.

           Leland looks through a crack in the crates and sees Z.3. 
           stalking through the storage unit.

           ... carrying a FLAMETHROWER. 

           Alyx sees it, too. Leland looks at her, trying to communicate 
           a gameplan, when Alyx --

           -- steps out in front of Z.3.  

           Z.3. sees her and raises the flamethrower.

                                 Z.3.
                        We never should have let you board.

           Knowing it’s now or never, Leland looks down at his body --

                                 LELAND
                        Time to see what this thing can do.

           -- and BRAVELY STEPS OUT BESIDE ALYX. 
                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        Look, we’re not enemies, so let’s --

           WHAM! -- 

           ALYX SMASHES LELAND’S LEG WITH THE CROWBAR! 

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        What!

           Leland falls to the floor as Alyx dashes away.

           Z.3. approaches Leland with the flamethrower...

                                 Z.3.
                        Damn, she did you... cold.

                                 LELAND
                        I still got some life in me.

           Leland quickly spins out of the way and charges Z.3., 
           knocking him back. As they spar over the flamethrower --

           INT. ANGULAR HALLWAY

           Morgan sprints down a separate hallway on her own.

           She keeps running, but everything here is fog and smoke. Like 
           a battlefield after a bomb has gone off. 

           She turns another corner and COLLIDES INTO A.1. 

           Blood soaks the edges of A.1.’s eye patch.

                                 MORGAN
                        Listen to me, we’re running out of 
                        time. I need to get to the bridge.

           A.1. grabs her by the throat and SLAMS HER AGAINST THE WALL. 

                                 A.1.
                        Do you even know what year it is?

           Morgan raises her arm up and grabs A.1.’s wrist from around 
           her neck. And that’s when she remembers... 

           HER ARM IS METALLIC. 

           SHE CLOSES HER METAL FINGERS AROUND A.1.’S WRIST and A.1. 
           grits her teeth, but Morgan pulls her arm off her neck. She 
           PUNCHES her in the chest and A.1. FLIES BACK. 

           A.1. gathers herself and stands up, staring back at Morgan. 
                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        You’re stronger than you look.

           Morgan tries transforming her arm into a gun again -- but 
           nothing happens. She’s just... pointing her arm at A.1.

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        Still can’t tap into it, though. 
                        They teach us in basic training --

           A.1. raises her arm at Morgan AND IT TRANSFORMS INTO A GUN!

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        It’s all in the wrist. 

           Morgan DIVES INTO A CONNECTING HALLWAY just as a STRING OF 
           BULLETS tear into the wall. 

           INT. HALLWAY

           Yuri keeps running and looking over his shoulder. He has 
           something in his right hand. Something he clearly just found.

           The halls seem to be warping around him, then --

           He stops as he sees someone at the end of the hall --

           ISAIAH.

           Yuri freezes in his tracks. 

           Are they teammates... or enemies?

                                 YURI
                        Hey, whoa, what’s up, man?

           Isaiah doesn’t react.

           Because he sees what’s in Yuri’s hand.

           Another strange, pistol-like weapon. 

           Yuri quickly raises it and points it at Isaiah. 

           But Yuri doesn’t seem like he knows how, or necessarily 
           wants, to shoot it. He’s just... confused and terrified.

                                 YURI (CONT'D)
                        We’re on the same team, right? 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Yes. Now put the weapon down.
           Yuri doesn’t. Isaiah pauses, then --

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        Damn it, if we’re going to survive 
                        this, we have to come together, not 
                        fall apart. That means leading with 
                        love, not hate. Passing our skills 
                        down to the next generation so they 
                        can learn from us. I know it’s 
                        hard, but we have to be selfless. 
                        Accept that our time might have 
                        come, preserve our resources and...

           YURI LOWERS HIS GUN.

           Isaiah exhales, relieved.

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Good.

                                 YURI
                        I just don’t want to die...

           Isaiah takes a step forward... and pulls Yuri into a hug.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Neither do I.

           Around the corner, Morgan suddenly stops and sees Isaiah 
           embracing Yuri. But in Isaiah’s hand... THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE.

                                 MORGAN
                        No!

           THWICK! -- Yuri’s eyes go wide -- 

           -- as Isaiah STICKS THE KNIFE INTO THE BACK OF HIS NECK!

           Yuri’s gun drops from his hand and drops through a grate as 
           Isaiah slowly lowers his body to the ground. Yuri slinks out 
           of his grasp and falls to the floor -- the sacrificial lamb. 

           Isaiah looks up and sees Morgan. He SHOUTS to her --

                                 ISAIAH
                        It’s us or them now, Morgan!

           Morgan slowly backs up -- horrified at what Isaiah’s become -- 
           and turns to run.

           Isaiah nods to himself, realizing Morgan has made her choice. 
           He picks up the gun and leaves the knife in Yuri’s neck. 
           INT. COLD STORAGE

           Leland and Z.3. remain locked in a life-or-death struggle for 
           the flamethrower. They wrestle for control, pushing 
           themselves into different corners of the room -- until the 
           flamethrower drops from both their grasps and hits the floor.

           Z.3. throws a jab and hits Leland right in the stomach. He 
           follows it up with a flurry of quick punches.

           But... Leland takes PUNCH AFTER PUNCH. Z.3., growing 
           frustrated, gives him his best shot in Leland’s gut.

           But again... Leland looks like he barely felt it. 

           And before you know it, Z.3. is completely out of breath.

                                 LELAND
                        Too young to know what a “rope a 
                        dope” is, huh, kid?

           Leland throws his first punch and knocks Z.3. across the room 
           with the cleanest and nastiest right hook he’s ever thrown!

           Z.3. flies back and hits the floor, shocked. He scatters back 
           as Leland grabs the flamethrower.

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        You see, I may be old...

           Z.3. continues to scamper backwards as Leland steps closer. 
           He turns on the flamethrower and the tip of it catches fire.

                                 LELAND (CONT'D)
                        ... but my body is brand new.

           Leland points the flamethrower down at him, when --

           Z.3. quickly spins and hits a button on the wall beside him.

           TWO METAL DOORS INSTANTLY SLAM DOWN AROUND LELAND!

           Leland turns and sees Z.3. on the other side of the door.

                                 Z.3.
                        Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, 1974. 

           Z.3. taps a panel on the wall and very suddenly the ENTIRE 
           AREA AROUND LELAND STARTS SHIFTING -- walls turn inside out 
           like he’s trapped inside a rubik’s cube. Before he knows it --
                                 NEAL 2.0 
                        EMERGENCY AIRLOCK ACTIVATED. 
                        DEPRESSURIZATION OVERRIDE. EVA 
                        SUITS REQUIRED.  

           Leland is inside an EMERGENCY AIRLOCK with a NEW DOOR NOW 
           LEADING DIRECTLY INTO OUTER SPACE! 

           But as amazing as the third crew’s ship might be, something 
           else seems to be bothering Leland even more --

                                 LELAND
                        So you guys don’t have football, 
                        but you do have boxing?

           The outer door OPENS A CRACK as the pressure RAPIDLY CHANGES.

                                 Z.3.
                             (through the window)
                        Never missed a fight, gramps.

           Z.3. turns and leaves.  

           Knowing he’s finished, Leland takes out the photo of him and 
           his mother. He looks at it --

                                 LELAND
                        See you soon, Mom.

           The airlock finishes opening, and in an instant --  

           VWOOSH! -- Leland is yanked out into the vacuum of space.

           EXT. SPACE

           Leland’s body hurls through space as he dies with the photo 
           of him and his mother forever frozen in his hands.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Z.3. keeps running, but struggles to breathe. 

           Just then, he hears something down the hallway -- a WHIMPER.

           He cautiously treads forward... until he sees someone face 
           down in a POOL OF BLOOD -- ALYX.

                                 ALYX
                        Help... someone...

                                 Z.3.
                        Who did this? Are they still --
           THWICK! -- Alyx turns and STABS Z.3. IN THE NECK!

           She stands. Whatever blood she’s covered in, it ain’t hers.

           Z.3. drops to the floor with a HEAVY THUD.

           Alyx YANKS THE SHIV back out of his neck -- the PLASTIC JELLO 
           SPOON SHIV. She re-pockets it. 

           But before she goes, she sees Z.3.’s belt... 

           ... and a SET OF MYSTERIOUS GRENADES attached to it.

           INT. UNKNOWN AREA

           Across the ship, Hunter dashes inside a room. CAGES line the 
           walls with GUNS, GRENADES, and BULLETPROOF ARMOR. 

                                 HUNTER
                        The armory...

           He sees a STRANGE LOCK on the cage. Inscrutable future tech.

           Suddenly, the SILHOUETTE OF A PERSON covers the lock.  

           Hunter turns and sees Isaiah under a glowing red light. 
           Isaiah aims his gun at Hunter. Hunter doesn’t flinch. 

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        You really were only in this for 
                        the glory. It was never about 
                        helping anyone other than yourself.

                                 ISAIAH
                        That how you speak to your elders?

           Hunter suddenly CHARGES and is able to KNOCK THE GUN UP just 
           as Isaiah fires -- VA-BOOM! -- launching some type of 
           CONCUSSIVE BLAST WAVE that hits one of the weapon lockers.

                                 HUNTER
                        You should have died 200 years ago. 
                        I’ll make sure history forgets you.

           The weapon skids across the floor as Isaiah lowers his 
           shoulder and RAMS HUNTER BACK INTO ONE OF THE METAL CAGES. 

           Hunter LIFTS HIS KNEE UP and delivers a kick to Isaiah’s gut 
           that causes him to stumble back. But both men are quickly 
           exhausted and almost out of breath due to the low oxygen.
           The two men wrestle for dominance. Violent, brutal, sloppy. 
           Two wounded animals fighting for survival. Isaiah manages to 
           bring his leg up and KICK Hunter to the floor. 

           Hunter looks up -- THE WEAPON LOCKER IS OPENED.

           He crawls forward and reaches out, almost there...

           ... when Isaiah leaps on his back, YANKS HIS HEAD BACK, and --

           CRACK! -- COMPLETELY SNAPS HUNTER’S NECK!

           Hunter goes lifeless as Isaiah rolls off him and stands up.

           Isaiah grabs the gun and stares down at Hunter. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        History remembers the winners.

           INT. HALLWAY

           A VENT along the ceiling is PUNCHED OUTWARDS. 

           Morgan falls out and stands up. Alone. 

           She’s runs up to a SEALED DOOR MARKED “BRIDGE.” 

                                 MORGAN
                        I found it...

           As she checks the wall beside the door -- a LIGHT SCANS HER.

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        BRIDGE CODE NEEDED.

                                 A.1. (O.S.)
                        I knew exactly where you were 
                        going.

           Morgan turns and sees A.1.

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        I believe you called it... home 
                        court advantage?

           Morgan aims her arm at A.1. -- still not shifting. 

           A.1.’s gun starts to spin, warming up to obliterate, when --

           DINK! -- A GRENADE ROLLS UNDER HIS FEET. 

           She looks down -- then turns and sees Alyx. 
           WA-WOOM! -- A FLASH OF LIGHT EMANATES FROM THE GRENADE -- BUT 
           INSTEAD OF AN EXPLOSION -- A GRAVITY WELL EXPANDS AROUND HER! 

           She’s lifted up off the ground as WAVES OF ENERGY pulsate 
           around her and PUSH HER UPWARDS. She floats in SLOW-MOTION -- 
           caught in a bubble that distorts time and space around her. 

           Unable to move, her gun/arm still revs up...

           THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! -- 

           It FIRES DOWNWARDS. But the bullets RICOCHET and COME BACK AT 
           HER IN SLOW-MOTION INSIDE THE GRAVITY WELL!

           One by one, THEY SLOWLY PIERCE HER TORSO and BLOOD SPLATTERS 
           in the gravity well like a red snow globe. 

           THE GRAVITY WELL EVAPORATES and A.1.’s body hits the floor.

           Morgan rushes up beside her and rolls her over. She coughs up 
           blood, dying. Lungs rapidly filling. Morgan tries to put 
           pressure on the wounds to stop the bleeding, but it’s no use. 

                                 A.1. (CONT'D)
                        Why... help me...

                                 MORGAN
                        Because you’re not my enemy. 

           A.1. stares up at Morgan. 

           In that moment of closure, comes clarity...

                                 A.1.
                        I... want to do my part...

           She weakly waves her hand for Morgan to lean closer. 

           ... or something else?

           Alyx tries to warn Morgan --

                                 ALYX
                        She’s lying. She’ll kill you.

           Morgan pauses. She looks down into A.1’s dying eyes, then --

           She chooses to trust her and LEAN IN. 

           A.1. stares at Morgan... then whispers something into her 
           ear. Morgan nods back... as A.1. dies in her arms.

           Morgan stands up. Alyx look at her.
                                 ALYX (CONT'D)
                        What did she say?

           Morgan faces the door, then --

                                 MORGAN
                        Neal, access code TJ-521.

           The light turns GREEN -- AND THE BRIDGE DOOR OPENS. 

           INT. BRIDGE

           Morgan and Alyx enter. A MASSIVE WINDSHIELD stretches out in 
           front of them. Space flies past at unconscionable speeds. 

           The consoles look more like stone sculptures than keyboards.

                                 MORGAN
                        Do you know what happened to any of 
                        the others?

                                 ALYX
                        I... haven’t seen anyone else.

           They start searching the console to operate this technology. 

                                 MORGAN
                        A hundred years of updates really 
                        screws with a user interface. 

           As she continues searching, Morgan doesn’t notice... 

           ... but Alyx has begun to PALM THE JELLO SHIV IN HER HAND.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM

           B.2., seemingly the sneakiest of the bunch, hustles inside.

                                 B.2.
                        Time for an upgrade.

           He finds a locker and TYPES IN A CODE. 

           The locker SLIDES open. But as it does -- 

           Someone steps into the room behind him.

           B.2. turns and sees Isaiah.

           They both stare at each other, ready for a fight...
           INT. BRIDGE

           Morgan keeps working different controls, moving stones 
           around, trying everything she can -- 

                                 NEAL 2.0

                        DETECTED. ONLY 3 PEOPLE ON BOARD.

           Just then, a HOLOGRAM forms above a STONE LEVER, reading -- 

               “WARNING! EMERGENCY STOP!”

                                 MORGAN
                        There!

           But just before she can pull it --

           She sees the shiv in Alyx’s hand.

           Morgan dodges just as the shiv grazes her skin. 

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing!

                                 ALYX
                        I’m done “waiting.” Every time we 
                        succumb to the wait calculation, 
                        things only get worse. We can’t 
                        risk stopping for yet another one.

                                 MORGAN
                        We have to trust them. That’s been 
                        our mistake -- we always fear them.

                                 ALYX
                        Then it’s their turn to fear us.

           Alyx lunges for Morgan. Morgan raises her arm and deflects 
           the shiv. They STRUGGLE TO BREATHE as Alyx KICKS OUT MORGAN’S 
           KNEE. Morgan stumbles as Alyx makes a move for her throat. 

           Morgan swings her arm harder and NAILS Alyx SQUARE IN THE 
           JAW. Alyx stumbles back and touches her lip, seeing blood.

           Alyx RUSHES Morgan, when -- 

           VA-BOOM! 

           A SONIC SHOCKWAVE seems to hit Alyx from behind.

           She suddenly stops in her tracks.

           She CLUTCHES HER CHEST... feeling her heart give out...
           ... and DROPS DEAD.

           Standing where Alyx just was is a PERSON IN ONE OF THE THIRD 
           CREW’S ARMORED SUITS holding one of their MYSTERIOUS WEAPONS.

           But the armor around their head RETRACTS. 

           And this time, it’s not a member of the third crew...

           ... it’s ISAIAH.

           Isaiah looks at the gun, impressed.

                                 ISAIAH
                        What will they think of next? 

                                 MORGAN
                        How... how many people have you 
                        killed, Isaiah?

                                 ISAIAH
                        How many people did Cortes kill? 
                        Columbus? We’re explorers, Morgan. 
                        And expansion always has a cost.

           Just then, Morgan’s arm -- SWOOOSH! -- THUNK! -- shifts into 
           a GUN SHE CAN SUDDENLY CONTROL. She points it at Isaiah. 

           He doesn’t move -- willingly putting himself at her mercy. 

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        Now you’re getting it.

           The gun starts to WHIRL...

           Isaiah doesn’t move... 

           Then -- 

                                 MORGAN
                        I won’t play by the old rules.

           -- Morgan leaps forward and GRABS THE LEVER. 

           SHE YANKS IT BACK... AND --

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        EMERGENCY LOCK STILL IN PLACE.

                                 MORGAN
                        What? No!
           Isaiah smirks.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Ouch. So close...

           WHAM! --

           -- he swings the gun across her face and sends her flying 
           back. He raises the gun. The kill shot. When --

           TWHIP! -- 

           SOMETHING STABS HIM IN THE SPINE! 

           He slowly turns to see his assailant --

           YURI. 

                                 ISAIAH (CONT'D)
                        How...

           Isaiah’s legs give out and he drops to his knees. He reaches 
           to his back to see what just sliced his spin... and pulls out 
           THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE.

           Holding it in his hand, Isaiah COLLAPSES to the floor.

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        WARNING! ONLY 1 PERSON ON BOARD.

           Morgan and Yuri meet eyes. 

           But... something about what Neal 2.0. just said...

                                 MORGAN
                        You find yourself one of those 
                        “back-ups” or...?

           Yuri doesn’t answer.

           In fact, he has no reaction. 

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Only one, huh, Neal...

           Her gun defensively WHIRLS to life...

           ... as Yuri’s face is suddenly COMPLETELY BLANK. 

           Like, no facial features whatsoever. 

           And very quickly, anything resembling “Yuri” is shed. 

           Because what now stands in front of Morgan is something NEW --
           The SYNTH PURE -- full-bodied, sizzling with electrical 
           nanites under flesh-colored, gelatinous exterior. Primordial 
           stew collected, resurrected, and posture perfected.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        A stowaway...

           The Synth Pure seems to look at the lever Morgan just pulled.

           And with it, Morgan realizes --

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        You want me to stop it... so you 
                        can board the next ship and make it 
                        to Meliora.

           The Synth Pure turns and stares at her.

           Its chillingly silence is clearly a “no shit.”

           But in that moment... Morgan finds a deeper resolve. As if a 
           bigger mystery that’s haunted her has now been solved.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        I know what you really are now... 

           The Synth Pure tilts its head at her.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        You’re the rat in the engine. 

           She doesn’t wait a second longer --

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        But it’s time I do my part.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

           -- she empties her entire arm into the Synth.

           The Synth begins to weaken and split apart, when --

           Her arm stops SHOOTING and starts BEEPING -- “RECHARGING...”

           The barrage of gunfire might have momentarily disrupted the 
           Synth, but just like before, it begins to heal itself as “raw 
           synth” spools around it like bees protecting a hive.

           Morgan ain’t going to wait -- she turns and RUNS.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Morgan turns a corner and sprints as fast as she can.
                                 MORGAN
                        Neal! Who’s captain now?

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        YOU ARE.

                                 MORGAN
                        Activate self-destruct!

           The Synth suddenly turns behind her -- now part bi-pedal, 
           part nanobite/insect cloud.

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        SELF-DESTRUCT CAN ONLY OCCUR WHEN 
                        THERE IS A CRITICAL ENGINE FAILURE.

           Morgan looks back and sees the Synth gaining.

                                 MORGAN
                        The engine, huh?

           She drops one of the GRENADES she got from Alyx and --

           WA-WOOM! -- and a GRAVITY WELL CATCHES THE SYNTH INSIDE IT. 

           Morgan keeps running and turns another corner.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM

           Morgan enters. She spots a FRESH ARMORED SUIT. She leaps 
           inside it and it AUTOMATICALLY FITS OVER HER BODY. 

           With it, a HOLOGRAPHIC MAP OF THE SHIP FORMS IN HER HELMET.

           INT. HALLWAY

           The nanites flutter inside the gravity well, trying to poke 
           their way to the edge and escape...

           INT. LOWER LEVEL

           Morgan follows the map and runs as fast as she can, passing 
           an AIRLOCK. She opens it, but keeps running down the hallway.

           INT. HALLWAY

           The gravity well EVAPORATES. The nanites drop to the floor 
           and instantly RE-FORM INTO THE BI-PEDAL/SWARM MONSTROSITY.

           And even though it has no expression... it seems PISSED.
           INT. ENGINE ROOM

           Where the last ship had a beauty to its mechanical design, 
           this one continues to contain an aggressive decor to it that 
           makes every room feel like a battle zone.

           And the engine room is no different. Sharp pipes, hostile 
           steam shooting off in every direction, and fires burning in 
           every corner. It feels more like a furnace than an engine.

           Morgan runs inside. She keeps moving forward -- deeper -- 
           avoiding the fire and exhaust that spits out around her.

           She kneels down and begins BURROWING HERSELF INSIDE THE 
           ENGINE. She goes until she can’t go any father, nestled in 
           the farthest corner. 

           Her map blinks in her helmet, notifying her she’s on a METAL 
           GRATING with an EMERGENCY HATCH.

           But she stays right where she is. 

           She takes a deep breath, then --

           -- the SYNTH ENTERS.

           It suddenly and horrifically expands into TENTACLES as it 
           tries to find her, scouring every inch of the engine room...

           ... until it sees her NESTLED IN THE VERY CORE OF THE ENGINE.

                                 MORGAN
                        Like I said...

           The Synth SUDDENLY BURSTS INTO A DARK WEBBING, violently 
           expanding until it INFESTS THE ENTIRE ENGINE. Nanites fester 
           into every piece of metal, wire, and fuel rod.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        ... rats in the engine.

           And just as it consumes so much the engine that it begins 
           warping the metal around Morgan to scald and kill her --

                                 NEAL
                        CRITICAL ENGINE FAILURE DETECTED! 

                                 MORGAN
                        Neal, activate self-destruct!

                                 NEAL
                        YES, CAPTAIN. THIRTY SECONDS...

           The Synth is now face to face with her. 
           But Morgan is unafraid of the darkness she once avoided --

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s our world, mother fucker. 
                        You’re just living in it.

           She KICKS THE HATCH and the grate underneath her RELEASES. 

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

           Morgan falls down a level and SLAMS into the floor. Wind 
           knocked out of her, no time for pain, she STANDS... 

           ... AND RUNS FOR HER LIFE. 

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        TWENTY-FIVE SECONDS...

           As she does...

           INT. MYSTERIOUS ROOM

           ... someone else seems to be dragging themselves into a 
           different room deep inside the ship. 

           ISAIAH. 

           Neal 2.0. might have been premature in calling his death. 

           Isaiah wheezes as he coughs up blood, barely alive. He uses 
           every last ounce of energy to keep shuffling forward... 

           ... until he’s in front a CHAIR...

           ... an oddly-familiar, MEDIEVAL-LOOKING ONE.

           Isaiah lifts himself up beside a computer. He taps the 
           controls and the screen lights up -- “BACK-UP BODY -- READY!” 

           Miraculously... the machine COMES TO LIFE.

                                 ISAIAH
                        The fight is never over.

           With the last of his energy, Isaiah plops down in the chair. 
           A hole in the ceiling opens and the METAL HALO lowers around 
           his skull and fastens it in place. 

           Isaiah grits his teeth. Ready to be reborn. 
           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Morgan continues to run as she turns another corner. 

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        TEN SECONDS...

           INT. BACKUP ROOM

           A FRESH BACKUP BODY ROTATES OUT OF THE WALL.

           But as it starts to rotate into position....

           IT JAMS. 

           But the knife is still working properly...

           Isaiah’s eyes dart around -- no one is coming to help him.

           In his final moments, he can only think of one thing to say --

                                 ISAIAH
                        Fuck it. It’s your mess now. 

           SLICE! -- the knife CUTS HIS HEAD OFF and the halo raises it 
           into the air. But with the back-up body jammed on the 
           tracks... it releases his head and it BOUNCES OFF THE SEAT.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Morgan REACHES THE AIRLOCK.

                                 NEAL 2.0
                        THREE... TWO... ONE...

           She gets inside --

           INT. AIRLOCK

           She seals herself in, and just as she pulls the RELEASE --

               BOOOOOOOOOOOM! --

           EXT. SPACE

           -- the SHIP EXPLODES!

           Morgan is blasted out of the airlock.

           Debris shoots off in all directions.
           A STRING OF SYNTH NANITES PASS RIGHT BY HER -- almost trying 
           to reach out and grab her... 

           ... but like all the other debris from the ship, they slowly 
           just fly right past her...

           Until, after a long moment --

           Morgan is ALONE IN SPACE.

           Adrift and floating amongst the stars.

           The debris of the ship gets farther and farther away...

                                 SUIT A.I.
                        OXYGEN LEVELS... DEPLETED.

           BEEEEEEP.

           The interior of her HELMET BLINKS RED.

           OUT OF OXYGEN -- AND OUT OF TIME.

           She takes her last breath and her eyelids get HEAVY.

           And just as they might shut forever --

           A BLINDING LIGHT SUDDENLY FLASHES IN FRONT OF HER.

           A splash of primordial space dust amid a vortex of darkness. 

           Bursts of light in the dead of night. 

           A spectrum of colors the brain can barely process. 

           When it’s finally over...

           ... A SPACESHIP UNLIKE ANY OTHER IDLES IN FRONT OF HER.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. NEW SHIP’S INFIRMARY

           Morgan peacefully wakes up in a medical bay. 

           She slowly sits up. And when she does, she sees something 
           familiar beside her -- A CUP OF JELLO.

           Standing at the other end is a YOUNG WOMAN.

           Before either can say a word --
           Morgan leaps out of bed and raises her metallic arm -- 
           shifting it into a gun. Seems she’s got the hang of it.

                                 MORGAN
                        Why are you here!

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        What? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Answer the god damn question!

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        To reach Meliora. We were looking 
                        for you when we saw the explosion.

                                 MORGAN
                        And the synth?

           A moment, then --

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Extinct.

           Morgan keeps her gun held high. 

           Finally...

           -- SHE LOWERS IT.

           And with it, she can’t help but start to cry.

           EXT. MELIORA - DAY

           A sherbet sunrise warms a pair of dueling waterfalls 
           cascading down a flowery meadow. New colors and wondrous 
           plants that seem like something out of a fairy tale.

           Meliora is more spectacular and magnificent than any location 
           on Earth. This is a planet of pure, untapped potential. 

           In a word -- HEAVEN. 

           A LANDING VESSEL disembarks from the spaceship high above the 
           planet’s crystal-clear atmosphere. 

           It safely touches down in front of a gorgeous lake.

           EXT. LANDING VESSEL - DAY

           Waiting on the platform are SEVERAL YOUNG MEMBERS OF THE 
           NEWEST CREW.
           They watch as Morgan stands alone at the very tip of the 
           landing platform. Full of life. Healed.

           And with just one more step...

           ... she’d be the first person on Meliora.

           Morgan stares out at the vast planet before her. 

           She takes a breath. The sweetest air. 

           But instead of walking forward... SHE TURNS AROUND. 

           She walks back to the Young Woman. 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Is something wrong?

                                 MORGAN
                        No. It’s just...

           She pauses and remembers her father’s last words to her --

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        I had my time...

           Morgan steps aside, allowing the Young Woman to go first.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        What happens next is up to you.

           The Young Woman is surprised, knowing the honor Morgan is 
           giving her. But Morgan nods. The Young Woman walks forward. 

           With a breath of anticipation... she takes the first step
