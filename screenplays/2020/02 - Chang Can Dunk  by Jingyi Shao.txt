           CARD OVER BLACK: THE “SLAM DUNK”

           Standing under a hoop in an indoor basketball court, an OLD-
           SCHOOL BASKETBALL COACH (50s) in high-waisted slacks and a 
           polo shirt. Standing next to him, an OLD-SCHOOL BASKETBALL 
           PLAYER in short shorts and tall socks. 

                                 BASKETBALL COACH
                             (to camera)
                        This next move is called the “slam 
                        dunk”. It’s when a player jumps and 
                        throws the ball directly into the 
                        hoop from close range. Often using 
                        a “dunking” motion.

           The Player jumps and dunks with two hands. No flair.

                                 BASKETBALL COACH (CONT'D)
                        Well done. How did that feel?

                                 PLAYER
                        Pretty good coach.

                        It may look simple but when it 
                        happens in a game, it can sure be 
                        exciting.

           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           INSERT ON: A TOY HOOP hanging on a closet door frame, 
           weathered by years of abuse. 

                                 CHANG (O.S.)
                        Chang with the rock. Between two 
                        defenders! 

           BOOM. CHANG (16) Chinese-American, dunks on the poor toy hoop 
           still in his underwear, his boyish energy a little young for 
           his age. Chang’s bedroom is small, cluttered but somehow 
           pulled together by a massive KOBE BRYANT poster.    

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Uh oh, double team. What’s that? 
                        Bam. Behind the back. Eurostep! 
                        ARGGHH!

           BOOMSHAKALAKA. Chang slams it. This kid loves basketball.

           Between basketball moves, Chang styles his hair, modeling it 
           after multiple reference photos, pulled from youtube, tik 
           tok, instagram and now posted on his bedroom mirror. He 
           tweaks and retweaks with perfecting diligence. 

           BZZZT, an incoming Facetime from a BO. Chang answers. BO 
           (16), Asian-American, a bit on the chunky side, exclaims...  

                                 BO
                        Wowww.

                                 CHANG
                        I did it. 

                                 BO
                        I barely recognize you.

                                 CHANG
                        I know! It’s awesome!

           Chang checks the mirror again, beaming. 
                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        I feel it. This is what I needed. 
                        Right now I’m here.

           Chang gestures with his hand. Near the bottom. 

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        After this, I’ll get some new fire 
                        clothes. Then I’ll be more 
                        confident and I’ll start expanding 
                        my social media presence. Make a 
                        viral video or two. Boom. 
                        Girlfriend. Boom. Parties. Boom. 

           Chang gestures again. At the top.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        I’m up here.

                                 BO
                             (skeptical)
                        You really think so? 

                                 CHANG
                        I know so. 

                                 BO
                        But what if you end up trying too 
                        hard?

                                 CHANG
                        Trying too hard? That’s just a 
                        concept that haters came up with.

           Chang points behind him at the Kobe poster.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Do you think Kobe ever asked 
                        himself, “oh gee, am I trying too 
                        hard?” Hell no.

           Through his phone screen, Chang stares into his best friend’s 
           eyes. Powerful words are about to be uttered...

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        What would Kobe do Bo. What. Would. 
                        Kobe. Do?

           Bo squints, searching for the correct answer.

                                 BO
                        Uh, Be himself?
                                 CHANG
                        No! I mean yes, obviously be 
                        himself. But be better than 
                        himself.

           Chang checks out his hair one more time. Awesome.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        You’ll never get anywhere, if all 
                        you do is stand still.

                                 BO
                        I don’t know. You know I get tired 
                        when I move around too much.

           Chang groans. Bo grins, cheeky.

                                 CHEN (O.S.)
                        Lan Lan!

                                 CHANG
                        I gotta go. See you at practice?

                                 BO
                        Yeah. Hey, it looks good man.

                                 CHANG
                        Thanks homie. I really feel like 
                        it’s gonna change things.

           Chang hangs up. He grabs his things. As he scrambles out, he 
           picks up the basketball and takes one last shot.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Kobe!

           BRICK.  

           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - DAY

           The house is modest, filled with aged furniture that seems 
           rarely used. The rooms are cluttered with stuff that should 
           be put away but is instead organized and placed into a 
           temporary neatness. 

           Waiting impatiently by the door in hospital scrubs is Chang’s 
           Mom, CHEN (45), serious, her forehead wrinkled by years of 
           frowning. Chang hustles down the stairs, a bit wary. Her eyes 
           lock on his head like a targeting laser.

                                 CHEN
                             (a slight accent)
                        What that?
                                 CHANG
                        What?

           Chen reaches for Chang’s head, a disapproving frown on her 
           face. He dodges her hand like Neo.

                                 CHEN
                        Why you do this?

                                 CHANG
                        I’m just trying it out. It’s a new 
                        style. It’s cool.

           Chen considers it...

                                 CHEN
                        No, it look weird on you. 

           Chang’s loses some wind in his sail.

                                 CHANG
                        Whatever, let’s just go.

           EXT. CHANG’S HOUSE - DAY

           The house is modest, Ranch style, typical of North Jersey. 
           Protruding from the side of the home is the weathered 
           skeleton of a house extension project, long abandoned. 
           Really, the whole house needs a makeover.  

           Chang and Chen hustle out and hop into an old minivan.

           EXT. MOUNT DAVIS HIGH FRONT - A BIT LATER 

           The minivan pulls up to the curb. Students loiter on the 
           steps waiting for the bell. The school is mostly white with a 
           dash of melanin here and there. Chang hops out.

                                 CHEN
                        Are you coming to the hospital on 
                        Saturday? 

                                 CHANG
                        I was actually thinking about that. 
                        I know volunteering at the 
                        hospitals is like a good look for 
                        colleges but most of the other kids 
                        have jobs and...like, money.

                                 CHEN
                        You will have lots of money after 
                        you go to a good college. 
                                 CHANG
                        First of all, that’s not 
                        necessarily true in today’s economy 
                        and secondly, it’s been shown that 
                        having a high school job better 
                        prepares a kid for college success.

                                 CHEN
                        Lan Lan. You always change your 
                        mind. You need to find something 
                        and stick to it.

                                 CHANG
                        I will. When I find the right 
                        thing.

           Chen gives Chang a disappointed look. Chang relents.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Okay, okay. I get it. Volunteering 
                        it is.

                                 CHEN
                        I’m working late. Cook something 
                        for yourself okay?

                                 CHANG
                        Okay Mom. Have a good day.

           Chen drives off. Chang turns to the school and suddenly his 
           confidence gives way to nervous anticipation. He takes a deep 
           breath and proceeds forward.

           INT. GYM CLASS - LATER

           Students in athletic wear line up in two teams for basketball 
           drills. On one team, Chang. On the other, three jocks. MATT 
           (17), tall, White, dreamy blue eyes, OWEN (17), cocky Black 
           kid, and SYD (17), White, jacked bro of bros. The leader, 
           MATT, has the SAME hair as CHANG - but pulled off way better.   

           MR. BENNEVIDO, the Gym teacher, a literal square of a man, 
           (35), gives out instructions.

                                 BENNEVIDO
                        ...foul shot, then through the 
                        cones, lay-up, sprint back, score 
                        however you want. First team 
                        through gets a pat on the back. 
                        Okay? 

           Bennevido eyes Chang’s hair.
                                 BENNEVIDO (CONT'D)
                        That’s a fresh look Chang. I dig 
                        it.

           The other students look at Chang, most in agreement. He nods 
           back modestly.

                                 OWEN
                        Why you gotta swaggerjack Matt 
                        though!

           Laughter. Matt gives a cackling Owen a shove. 

                                 BENNEVIDO
                        Okay okay. Ready?

           Bennevido blows the whistle. Off to the races. The teams 
           cheer and clap on their comrades. Some of the kids are 
           decent, some are horrible. It’s lighthearted fun.

           Not for Chang. He breaths deep and wipes his clammy hands on 
           his shorts in anticipation. He’s last on his team. The 
           closer. He looks across at his match-up. Matt.

           Ball comes to Chang first. He explodes from the start line. 
           First, the foul shot. Chang sets his feet, bends his knee and 
           shoots. Clean follow through, perfect arc and spin. SWISH. 
           Okay, Chang. 

           Matt gets the ball as Chang sprints through the cones. Cross, 
           cross, behind the back. Matt chases, his long gait quickly 
           closing the gap. 

           Chang hits the lay-up and sprints back, Matt now right behind 
           him, about to pass.  Suddenly, Chang makes a full stop. Pull 
           up three! On target. It’s GOO--

           BOOOOM!!! Matt throws down a thunderous tomahawk jam, 
           knocking Chang’s ball out of the hoop at the last second. The 
           whole class erupts in Ooo’s and Aah’s. 

                                 BENNEVIDO (CONT'D)
                        Whoooa! Team 1 wins!

           Matt high-five his bros while the other students look at him 
           in awe. Chang, panting, puts his hands on his hips.

           INT. BOY’S LOCKERROOM - LATER

           Chang changes while Matt’s boys reenact Matt’s dunk. On their 
           way out, Matt pats on Chang on the back.
                                 MATT
                        Almost dude. Next time dunk it.

           Matt’s friends snicker and walk out. Chang looks up at 
           himself in the mirror. He reaches for his hair... 

           INT. GYM CLASS - A BIT LATER

           Chang walks out alone, his hair now flat and bland. A new 
           look already abandoned. As he heads for the exit, he notices 
           a forgotten ball. He picks it up and turns to one of the 
           hoops. A wishful thought crosses his mind for just a moment.

           He drops the ball and leaves.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTER SCHOOL

           Flags twirl and fly through the air as loud big band music 
           sounds out into the evening. The fabled Mount Davis Marching 
           Band stomps in rhythm and formation. A well-oiled machine. In 
           the back, part of the drum line, are Bo and Chang, banging 
           away on the massive bass drums slung over their shoulders,  

                                 MR. RYAN
                        Stop. STOP!

           The band freezes. The band instructor, MR. RYAN (32) balding, 
           intense, shakes his head at this pitiful interpretation of 
           Seven Nation Army. He stomps out onto the field towards the 
           cause of his displeasure - MELISSA (16), the awkward, 
           slightly chubby Tuba player. As Mr. Ryan scolds her 
           mercilessly, Chang and Bo take a breather.

                                 BO
                        So, what happened with the hair?

                                 CHANG
                             (shrugs)
                        Eh. I wasn’t really feeling it.

                                 BO
                        I thought you would stick with it 
                        for at least a day.

                                 CHANG
                        I will. When I find the right cut.

           Bo nods. Something catches Chang’s attention. Coming from the 
           bleachers, a vision in black. KRISTY (17), slender, with long 
           black hair and draped head to toe in black clothing. She 
           leans against the fence, observing the commotion.
                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Who is that?

                                 BO
                        I don’t know but I need her insta 
                        right now.

           Mr. Ryan returns to the front. He steps onto his podium.

                                 MR. RYAN
                        Okay, can we not ruin it this time 
                        please? 

           Mr. Ryan raises his hands. And...

           EXT. BLEACHERS - LATER

           Exhausted band members put away their instruments. Chang 
           chugs a bottle of water. Adjacent, sitting alone, Melissa the 
           clumsy Tube player. 

                                 CHANG
                        Hey. Keep going. You’ll get it.

           Melissa looks up, surprised. She nods.

                                 MR. RYAN
                        Chang!

           Ryan waves Chang over, KRISTY next to him.

                                 RYAN
                        This is Kristy, she’s gonna be our 
                        new snare player. 

                                 KRISTY
                        Sup.

           Kristy gazes over at Chris. Her hair sways like black waves 
           over her pale freckled face. Her soft brown eyes glistening, 
           copper coins dropped in a mountain spri --

                                 RYAN
                        Chang, hello!

                                 CHANG
                             (snapping out of it)
                        Sorry.

                                 RYAN
                        Take Kristy to the storage locker 
                        and get her a kit.
                                 CHANG
                        Okay.

           INT. BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lights flick on in the dark band room. Championship banners 
           from Marching Band competitions hang proudly from the walls.

                                 KRISTY
                        Wow. You guys take this pretty 
                        seriously.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah. I don’t know if you noticed 
                        but Mr. Ryan is pretty intense.

                                 KRISTY
                        I like intense. Means you’re 
                        passionate about something.

           Chang ponders it, agreeing. He unlocks a storage locker, 
           revealing spare instruments. 

                                 CHANG
                        So you’re like new in town?

                                 KRISTY
                        Yeah. Just moved here with my Mom.

                                 CHANG
                        You like it?

                                 KRISTY
                        Good so far. Kinda white though.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, but most of them know how to 
                        use chopsticks so.

                                 KRISTY
                        Ohh. So they can stay.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, for diversity.

           Kristy giggles. Chang beams, suddenly invigorated. She points 
           at the spare drum.

                                 KRISTY
                        This it right here?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah. Let me help you--
           Before Chang can help her, she yanks it out by herself. She 
           taps the head, adjusting the tamber.    

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        You play a lot?

                                 KRISTY
                        I do.

           Kristy picks up the sticks and give them a twirl before 
           unleashing them on the dusty drum, accelerating into a 
           blazing speed pattern. Then, on a dime, she flows into a 
           groovy riff. She closes her eyes and sticks her tongue out 
           the corner of her mouth like Michael Jordan. Chang is 
           crushing, hard.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Chang walks Kristy home. Kristy talks favorite bands. It’s 
           mostly rock and grunge. Chang knows none of them but he plays 
           along. 

                                 CHANG
                        I wouldn’t say I’m the biggest 
                        music head. I’m a dabbler.

                                 KRISTY
                        How’d you get into drums then.

                                 CHANG
                        Bass drum. It ain’t exactly rocket 
                        science.

                                 KRISTY
                        So you like doing things that are 
                        easy.

                                 CHANG
                        Uhh...

           Kristy smirks. She enjoys tilting Chang.

                                 KRISTY
                        I’m just giving you shit.

           They stop in front of a condo complex.

                                 KRISTY (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for walking me home. 
                             (beat)
                        See you at school?
                                 CHANG
                        Bet.

                                 KRISTY
                             (mockingly)
                        Bet.

           Kristy grins and turns away. Chang searches for a follow-up.

                                 CHANG
                        What would Kobe do. What would Kobe 
                        do. What would -
                             (to Kristy)
                        Hey. You wanna...chillax this 
                        weekend?

           Uggggh. Kristy turns back, amused.

                                 KRISTY
                        Uh, okay. What day?

                                 CHANG
                        Saturday?

                                 KRISTY
                        Maybe. I was gonna check out this 
                        basketball game. 

                                 CHANG
                        Basketball game? Is it like a 
                        traveling team?

                                 KRISTY
                             (shrugs)
                        I dunno. This guy Matt invited me.

           Chang’s heart falls to his feet.

                                 CHANG
                        Oh. Yeah I know Matt...

                                 KRISTY
                        Why don’t you come? I don’t know 
                        anybody else there.

           Chang thinks about it, searching for some courage...

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, sure. Meet there?

                                 KRISTY
                        Cool. Nice meeting you Chang.
                                 CHANG
                        Same.

           Kristy goes inside. Chang exhales, suddenly remembering to 
           breathe. He looks around, lost.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Where...am I?

           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - LATER

           Chang digs through the fridge, pulling random ingredients and 
           putting them into a boiling stew. Propped on a bowl, is Bo on 
           Facetime, himself busy in a game of Fortnite. 

                                 BO
                        Dude. She’s suuuper hot man. 

                                 CHANG
                        Sooo hot.

                                 BO
                        But like in a sad, tragic way.

                                 CHANG
                        Like a painter with not enough 
                        colors. 

                                 BO
                        Save her man. Save her from her 
                        eternal melancholy.

           Chang ladels his concoction of meat and veggies and something 
           into a bowl. Waiting as a side, some Pop Tarts.

                                 CHANG
                        This is would be like the Lakers 
                        getting Pau Gasol. Instant 
                        contenders. 

                                 BO
                        I’m not following.

                                 CHANG
                        Think about it, Kristy is new to 
                        the school. She’s hot, she’s cool. 
                        All the guys are gonna be fighting 
                        over her. If I get with her first, 
                        I’ll get all the clout AND a really 
                        cool girlfriend.

           Chang’s mind wanders wistfully into a Kristy-filled future.
                                 BO
                        Okay. But what are you going to do 
                        about Matt?  He’s obviously got his 
                        beautiful blue eyes on her.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah but I don’t think he’s her 
                        type.

                                 BO
                        Say that when he’s flying through 
                        the air in front of her like a 
                        Greek God.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, but I’ll have more one-on-one 
                        time. And, I, you know, respect her 
                        or whatever. 
                             (concerned)
                        Right?

                                 BO
                        I don’t know dude, I’m a virgin. 
                        But you know who isn’t. Matt. 
                             (gets killed in Fortnite)
                        WHAT THE! You Motherfu--

           Bo curses at a offscreen enemy. Chang bites into his pop 
           tart, worried. Shit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE - MATT’S TIK TOK/IG

           - At school. Matt looks into the camera phone, giggling. 

                                 MATT
                        Oh, there’s Thompson. Watch this. 
                        He has no idea.

           He approaches an innocent kid, THOMPSON (15) in the hallway.

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        Yo Thompson. You like facials?

                                 THOMPSON
                        What do you mean?

           Thompson smiles, sheepish. From behind, Syd creeps up, a 
           miniature basketball hoop in his hand. He holds it above 
           Thompson’s head as Owen suddenly appears, smashing a rubber 
           ball viciously through the hoop, right off Thompson’s head.
                                 MATT
                        CUZ YOU JUST GOT FACIALED!

           - Matt approaches another kid, ROBERT. The kid looks at Matt 
           suspiciously.

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        Yo Roberts. You like facials?

                                 ROBERT
                        No!

           Roberts tries to run away. He’s too slow. Owens and Syd 
           appear and DUNK on his head.

                                 MATT
                        CUZ YOU JUST GOT FACIALED!

           - Matt approaches a group of cool girls, who look at him 
           longingly. He singles one out, TIFFANY. 

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        Yo Tiffany. You like facials?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Depends. Is it from you?

           Tiffany bites her lip suggestively. Matt turns to camera, his 
           mouth agape.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           It’s dark, save for the glow from Chang’s phone. Chang 
           rewatches Matt’s TikTok starring Tiffany.

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        ...Is it from you?

           Chang recoils, his face phasing between shock, disgust, 
           curiosity, envy and horror. Doom creeps up his spine. He 
           closes his eyes, trying to think of what to do...

           He rolls over and begins a search: How to show a girl you 
           respect her. He scrolls to the top result. Pay attention to 
           her interests...

           Suddenly, headlights flash outside his window triggering the 
           rumble of a garage door opening. Chris sticks his phone under 
           his pillow and rolls over.
           Steps creak up the stairs. The door opens, revealing the 
           silhouetted face of Chen, worn from a 14 hour shift. 

                                 CHEN
                             (quietly)
                        Lan Lan?

           Chang, lies stiff, eyes still open. After a beat, Chen closes 
           the door. Chang breaths a sigh of relief. He pulls out his 
           phone, continuing his research...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Two AAU (high school amateur) teams battle in a gym packed at 
           max capacity. The score is close. Attendees scream and holler 
           with each basket.

           Matt, drenched in sweat, makes a nice move, blowing past his 
           defender. The opposing center meets him at the rim. Matt 
           misses and is knocked to the ground. No foul.

           The crowd protests. Chief among them, Matt’s parents, MRS. 
           O’NEIL (40) and MR. O’NEIL (46), their tanned Hamptons look a 
           contrast to their current red-faced fury.

                                 MR. O’NEIL
                        ARE YOU BLIND REF! THEY’RE TRYING 
                        TO MASSACRE MY BOY!!! 

           Matt climbs to his feet and argues with the ref.

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        IT’S OKAY HONEY, THIS REF IS AN 
                        IDIOT. AN IDIOOOOOOT. 

           Whistle. The Ref gives Matt a tech. The crowd howls.

                                 MR. AND MRS. O’NEIL 
                        ARE YOU KIDDDING ME!!!

           ON BLEACHERS

           Chang pumps his fist, subtly celebrating Matt’s misfortune. 
           Beside him, Kristy watches, a bit lost. 

                                 KRISTY
                        What happened?
                                 CHANG
                        Matt was whining too much so the 
                        Ref T’ed him up. 
                             (shakes his head)
                        Unsportsmanlike. Just play dude. 

                                 KRISTY
                        You seem pretty into basketball.

                                 CHANG
                        Oh yeah, I’m a huge basketball 
                        head. I used to play 5 hours a day.

                                 KRISTY
                        Really? How come you’re not out 
                        there then.

                                 CHANG
                        Uh because I swore an oath to Mr. 
                        Ryan that all my free time would be 
                        entirely dedicated to Marching 
                        Band. 

           Kristy smiles. Chang perks up. Prepared. 

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Actually, I heard there’s a show 
                        for some local bands. I think you 
                        might like it. Everybody seems real 
                        angry on the poster.

                                 KRISTY
                        Yeah? That sounds cool. I’m super 
                        down.

           Chris beams. Matt’s team calls a time-out. Play stops.

                                 CHANG
                        Actually we should leave now. Don’t 
                        wanna get caught in the throng. 

           They stand and begin inching towards the exit, passing by the 
           bench of Matt’s team. Big mistake.

                                 MATT
                        Yo Kristy! You made it!

           Heads swivel towards Chang and Kristy. They stop, frozen by 
           the sudden attention.

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?
                                 CHRIS
                        Uh, we were actually about to 
                        leave.

                                 MATT
                        No you’re not. Not with a minute 
                        left. 

           Matt locks onto Kristy with his hypnotic dreamy blue eyes. 
           Chris is left out of the staring contest. 

                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        Stay. You don’t want to miss this.

           Kristy looks back at Chang. With no choice, Chang relents. 
           Whistle. The teams retake the floor. Matt smiles at Kristy 
           one last time.

           ON COURT

           1 minute left. Home team down three. Matt gets the ball and 
           with a quick move, scores. The crowd erupts. 1 point game! 

           BLEACHERS

           The visitors inbound the ball.

                                 CHANG
                        C’mon. Score.

           Matt’s team double-teams a visiting player. TURNOVER. 

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Damnit!

                                 KRISTY
                        Who are you rooting for?

           Home team ball. The crowd stands, including Kristy and 
           reluctantly, Chang. 

           ON COURT

           Matt gets the ball. 30 seconds on the clock. He waves off his 
           teammates. I got this. 

           10...9...8... Matt makes his move. He drives, but then on a 
           dime, stops. Pull up jumper. The ball flies through the air 
           in seemingly slow motion. SWISH! HOME TEAM UP 1!

                                 KRISTY (CONT'D)
                        Ohhhhhh!!!
           The crowd is going nuts. 7 seconds left. The visitors, 
           completely flustered, rushes another inbounds pass. TURNOVER 
           AGAIN! The ball finds Matt, streaking  downcourt all alone. 
           He rises...and SLAMS IT! AT THE BUZZER! 

           The gym explodes. People rush the court and envelop Matt, 
           their local deity. Matt ignores the adulation, scanning the 
           crowd for someone. Kristy.

                                 MATT
                        I told you!

           Kristy shrugs and nods her head in agreement. Chang can only 
           stand by as this tragedy unfolds in front of him.

                                 CHANG
                             (to himself)
                        You have got to be kidding me.

           INT. MATT’S HOUSE - LATER

           Teenagers pile into the massive McMansion. Solo cups litter 
           the place, adjacent to pictures of a happy O’Neil family, 
           both vibrating from the loud music. It’s a rager. 

           By the doorway, Matt regales his recent triumph to guests. 
           His mother appears above him, at the top of the spiral 
           staircase.

                                 MRS. O’NEIL 
                        Honey!

                                 MATT
                             (annoyed)
                        Yes, Karen?

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        We’re going to bed. You and your 
                        friends have fun okay? Let us know 
                        if you need anything.  

                                 MATT
                        Just some condoms!

           Matt’s yes-men giggle like fools. 

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                             (amused)
                        Oh, you.

           Mrs O’Neil retires. Matt pulls over Syd and Owen. He whispers 
           instructions and nods over to the kitchen. In their line of 
           sight: Kristy and Chang.  
           LIVING ROOM

           Amongst the revelry, Chang and Kristy, sipping from solo 
           cups. Chang, head bobbing awkwardly to the music, tries to 
           look like he belongs. He takes too big of a sip and gags.

                                 KRISTY
                        You know people here?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, most of them are from school. 
                        Sup Todd!

           Todd walks by, zero acknowledgment. Yikes. Chang checks the 
           time on his watch.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Hey, we should go soon if you still 
                        wanna check out that show.

                                 KRISTY
                        Okay. Let me just use the bathroom 
                        real quick. Do you know where it 
                        is?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, down the hall, 2nd door on 
                        the right.

           Kristy breaks away. Chang pours the remnants of his drink 
           into a plant. 

                                 OWEN (O.S.)
                        Chang with the Thang! 

           Owen and Syd approach, half-drunk. They put their arms around 
           Chang, sandwiching him with their muscular frames.

                                 SYD
                        Who invited you?

                                 CHANG
                             (flustered)
                        Uhh. I--

                                 SYD
                        I’m just playin! C’mon, let’s go do 
                        a shot.

           They drag him into the...
           KITCHEN

           Owen browses the lineup of bottom-shelf booze as Syd keeps 
           Chang in place. Owen picks a handle of Tito’s and pours a 
           shot. He turns to Chang, his hand in a fist.

                                 OWEN
                        Rock, Paper, Scissors. Winner has 
                        to down this shot.

           Chang looks at the fist and sighs. Fine, whatever.

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        I only throw rock. 

                                 CHANG
                        What?

                                 OWEN
                        Rock is my only move.

                                 SYD
                        It’s true.

           Chang squints at Owen, who is dead serious. They line up 
           their hands.

                                 OWEN AND CHANG
                        Rock, Paper, Scissors!

           Chang throws paper. True to his word, Owen throws rock. He 
           downs his shot and then immediately pours double shot.

                                 OWEN
                        Double or nothing. 

                                 CHANG
                        Uhh.

                                 OWEN
                        C’mon man, you gotta give me a 
                        chance to get one back.

                                 SYD
                        You already know what he’s going to 
                        throw!

           People are beginning to gather around the commotion. Chang 
           relents. He lines up his hands.

                                 OWEN AND CHANG
                        Rock, Paper, Scissors!
           Chang, paper. Owen, rock. Owen covers his face as the 
           onlookers break into laughter and mockery. Owen downs the 
           double shot, recoiling at the taste. Syd cheers and gives 
           Chang a high five. A momentary smile breaks on Chang’s face, 
           before he spots out the corner of his eye, Matt and Kristy 
           outside by the pool. Alone. Before he can move, Owen grabs 
           his arm. 

                                 OWEN
                        C’mon. Last round.

                                 CHANG
                        No, no, no. I gotta go. 

           Owen pours again. It’s a long pour. 

                                 OWEN
                        Quadruple or nothing!

           A crowd gathers. Hungry for a show. 

                                 SYD
                        Don’t be a quitter Chang.

                                 OWEN
                        You already know what I’m gonna 
                        throw.
                             (taunting)
                        ...Rock.

           Chang squints, suddenly unsure. He searches in Owen’s half-
           drunk eyes for a clue. There’s nothing, just emptiness. The 
           crowd jeers impatiently, eager for blood. Chang looks 
           outside. Kristy and Matt and standing closer now.

                                 CHANG
                        Fine. Let’s go.

                                 OWEN
                        ROCK! PAPER! SCISSORS!

           Owen’s hand comes down, clenched in a fist. ROCK. Out of 
           Chang’s hand, shoot two fingers. SCISSORS. Disaster.

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        I TOLD YA’LL! ROCK BABY! 
                             (kisses his fist)
                        WOOOOO! Drink up Chang!

           The crowd celebrates. A dumbstruck Chang looks into the cup, 
           half-full with clear liquid. He’s losing time! He downs it 
           two gulps.
                                 CROWD
                        Ohhhh shit!

           Chang pushes through the crowd.

           OUTSIDE

           Kids dance around a glistening pool. In the far corner, Matt 
           whispers in Kristy’s ear. Chang makes his way over but as he 
           does, it hits him. A rush of warmth waterfalling down his 
           face and into his body. The world blurrrrrrrrs. 

           Chang approaches, a goofy grin stretching ear to ear. Matt 
           and Kristy pause their conversation.

                                 CHANG
                        Hey guys.

                                 MATT
                        Yo.

                                 KRISTY
                             (concerned)
                        You okay?

                                 CHANG
                        Perfect.
                             (slurring)
                        You know Matt. You’re pretty cool.

                                 MATT
                        Thanks. We were like having a 
                        private conversation though so --

                                 CHANG
                        -- But I can’t figure out why. I 
                        mean yeah you’re tall and good 
                        looking and you wear dope clothes. 
                        But other than that. What are you? 
                        Like what’s your identity. Your 
                        values? Where’s your soul bro?

           Kristy hides a smile. Chris notices and laughs obnoxiously. 
           Matt is irked now.

                                 MATT
                        Dude, you’re wasted and you’re 
                        pissing me off. 

                                 CHANG
                        I got it! You can dunk. That is 
                        pretty cool. But WHOOP-DEE-DOO 
                        Matt, so can a lot of people!  
                                 MATT
                        Not you.

                                 CHANG
                        Not me? Says who?

           Matt laughs. 

                                 MATT
                        Dunk then.

           Chang’s smile disappears. 

                                 CHANG
                        I could if I tried. 

                                 MATT
                        What? Listen man --

                                 CHANG
                        I could if I tried.

           Chang gets in Matt’s face. Matt is at wit’s end.

                                 MATT
                        No. You could not.

                                 CHANG
                        Why not?
                             (angry)
                        Why not?!

                                 KRISTY
                        Okay, okay, let’s go.

                                 CHANG
                        I bet you I can.

                                 MATT
                        I’ll take that bet all day. 

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah? What are the stakes?

                                 MATT
                        I don’t care. It does not matter 
                        because you’ll never, EVER be able 
                        to dunk. It doesn’t matter how hard 
                        you try. You. will. never. DUNK.

           Chang and Matt glare at each other, neither backing down. 
           Kristy pulls Chang away.
                                 KRISTY
                        C’mon.

           Jaw clenched, Chang utters one last parting remark.

                                 CHANG
                        We’ll see. We’ll se--

           Chang’s ankle catches on the corner of a lounge chair. Before 
           Kristy can grab him, he stumbles back, right into the pool. 
           SPLASHHH!

                                 PARTY CROWD
                        Ohhhh! Chang overboard!

           Chang paddles water, trying to clear his eyes. He looks up to 
           see Matt, pointing a cameraphone at him.

                                 MATT
                        Yo Chang, you like facials?

           Chang floats backwards, revealing a pool hoop directly behind 
           him. Out of nowhere, a flying SYD slams a basketball in the 
           hoop on top of Chang’s head just before powerbombing into the 
           pool. A wave of water smacks Chang right in the face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. O’NEIL SUV - LATER

           Chang, hair and clothes still wet, sits in the passenger side 
           of a nice SUV. Mrs. O’Neil is driving while Kristy sits in 
           the back. They pull up to Kristy’s condo.

                                 MRS. O’NEIL 
                        Good night Kristy. It was nice 
                        meeting you.

                                 KRISTY
                        Nice meeting you too Karen. Thanks 
                        for the ride.
                             (to Chang)
                        See ya.

                                 CHANG
                             (weakly)
                        Bye.

           Mrs. O’Neil pulls away. Chang reaches into his pocket for his 
           phone. It’s waterlogged. Broken. He reaches for something 
           else. Two soggy tickets to: A NIGHT OF GRUNGE. He balls them 
           up and sticks it back in his pocket.
                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        It’s been so long Chang. How come 
                        you don’t come around the house 
                        like you used to? We miss you.

                                 CHANG
                        Just been a bit busy. With school 
                        and stuff.

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        Oh. I bet. Smart kid like you. 

           Mrs. O’Neil smiles warmly at Chang. Chang does his best to 
           smile back.

           EXT. CHANG’S HOUSE - A BIT LATER.

           They pull up to Chang’s house. The kitchen light is still on. 
           Chang gulps. 

           The front door swings open as Chang gets out of the car. It’s 
           Chen in her pajamas. 

                                 CHEN
                        Lan Lan?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah.

                                 CHEN
                        Where have you been!

           Mrs. O’Neil sticks her head out the window.

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        Hi Chen! 

                                 CHEN
                        Hi. Karen? 

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        Hey! Sorry to worry you like this. 
                        Matt had some friends over and they 
                        were having too much fun and lost 
                        track of time. 

           As Chang passes, Chen notices water dripping from Chang’s 
           clothes. 

                                 CHEN
                        You’re all wet!
                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        Oh yeah, they were horsing around 
                        and Chang fell in the pool. You 
                        know how boys are.

                                 CHEN
                        Oh I’m so sorry. Thank you for 
                        drive him back.
                             (to Chang in Chinese)
                        Get inside.

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        Not at all. Good seeing you! Good 
                        night.

                                 CHEN
                        Okay, good night.

           She turns, a scowl on her face. Uh-oh.

           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           They enter. 

                                 CHEN
                        Don’t move you’re making a mess.

                                 CHANG
                        Mom, I can clean up myself.

           Chen ignores him. She starts drying him with towels.

                                 CHEN
                        Why you make me worry? You say you 
                        come volunteer today. You don’t 
                        come so then I call you. But you 
                        don’t pick up. 

                                 CHANG
                        Well I couldn’t because...

                                 CHEN
                        Because why?

           Chang is at loss for words. Before he can even react, Chen 
           reaches into his pocket and retrieves his broken phone. 

                                 CHANG
                        It was an accident. 

                                 CHEN
                        Lan Lan. Phone is a lot of money.
                                 CHANG
                        I’ll pay for a new one. 

                                 CHEN
                        Somebody push you?

                                 CHANG
                        No, why would you even say that?

                                 CHEN
                        Lan Lan. I’m your mother. I know 
                        when you upset.

                                 CHANG
                        You’re making me upset!

           Chang breaks free and rushes upstairs, leaving Chen alone in 
           the dark. She sighs, tired.

           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Chang, cleaned up, in bed on his laptop. He watches a recent 
           tik tok posted on Matt’s account.

           ON SCREEN: Chang in the pool. Syd dunking on him. Kids 
           laughing. Matt looks into camera.

                                 MATT
                        Cause you just got FACCIALLLLED!

           Below, hundreds of likes and thousands of views. Chang slams 
           his laptop closed, head spinning with vengeful thoughts. 
           Something pulls his eyes up to the just above the foot of the 
           bed. A poster. Kobe. Flying through the air. Fire in his 
           eyes. The BLACK MAMBA. 

           The proverbial clouds part. A golden light shines down on 
           Chang. A gift of inspiration. Courage. Chang’s mouth curls 
           into a defiant snarl.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MOUNT DAVIS HIGH - CONTINUOUS

           Chang marches up the school steps. Other students whisper and 
           glance as he walks by. He keeps his chin up, determined.

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Bo catches up to Chang in the hallway. 
                                 BO
                        Hey man, I saw what happened. Are 
                        you okay?

                                 CHANG
                        No, I was humiliated. But that’s 
                        okay. The Mamba spoke to me. 

                                 BO
                        Oh, uh, okay. Did you talk to 
                        Kristy yet?

                                 CHANG
                        Not yet. 

           Chang stops abruptly.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        I know finally know what I need to 
                        do. 

                                 BO
                        What?

                                 CHANG
                        I need to dunk a basketball.

           The bell rings. Bo doesn’t know what to say. Chang marches 
           on, his destiny awaiting.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - A BIT LATER

           Chang approaches the doors to the school gym. He peeks in. 
           Horsing around on the bleachers, Matt, Syd and Owen, 
           oblivious to the woes of others.

           Suddenly Chang’s courage shrinks. He reaches for the door 
           handle but then turns away. It’s a retreat.

           As he is about to turn the corner, something comes over him. 
           He grits his teeth.

           INT. GYM CLASS - CONTINUOUS

           Chang heads for his target Matt like a guided missile. 

                                 CHANG
                        Matt!

           The class goes silent. Matt looks up, amused.
                                 MATT
                        What is it Chang? 

                                 CHANG
                        Stand up when I’m talking you.

                                 OWEN
                        Yo, you trippin’.

                                 CHANG
                        Shut up. Sidekick.

           Matt holds Owen back. He stands. He’s taller than Chang by 
           almost a foot. The phones come out.

                                 MATT
                        You coming in with some strong 
                        energy today.

                                 CHANG
                        You said I couldn’t dunk. Well I 
                        bet you I can.

                                 MATT
                        Are you joking? You’re still on 
                        this?

                                 CHANG
                        On the night of the last home 
                        football game, I bet you that I 
                        will dunk on that hoop right there.

           Chang points to the center hoop.

                                 MATT
                        That’s the dumbest thing I have 
                        ever heard.

                                 CHANG
                        Is it Matt? Or, are you just afraid 
                        cuz you’re a little BITCH?

           The crowd hollers. Chang is turning them. Matt doesn’t like 
           his position challenged. He laughs it off.

                                 MATT
                        Okay Chang. You want it you can 
                        have it. What we puttin’ down?

           Chang looks up at Matt’s luscious locks. 

                                 CHANG
                        Loser has to shave their head. 
                                 ONLOOKER
                        That’s it?

                                 MATT
                        Nobody gives a shit if you shave 
                        your head Chang.

                                 CHANG
                        Well, then...Loser ALSO...has to 
                        run around the track. Butt. Ass. 
                        Naked.

           Nods in the crowd, that build to cheers in favor. Matt scoffs 
           and shakes his head. Chang stares back, dead serious...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Different POVs of Chang’s lunchroom challenge. The moment is 
           already immortalized. At the end, Chang and Matt shake hands. 
           The deal is sealed. The crowd reacts. Shit is LIT.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLEACHERS - LATER

           Bo watches the montage of clips while the Marching Band gets 
           ready for practice. He’s in disbelief.

                                 BO
                             (hyped)
                        Bro, I’m getting chills just 
                        watching this! 

                                 CHANG
                        My legs were shaking like crazy! 
                        Could you tell? 

                                 BO
                        Hell no. You held it down!

           They pound fists. Chang turns and sees Kristy, approaching 
           while playing a snare roll on her drum. Chang straightens up. 
           Kristy stops right in front of him.

                                 CHANG
                        Hey. 

                                 KRISTY
                        Hey.
                                 CHANG
                        I, uh, just wanted to --

                                 KRISTY
                        -- Yeah, yeah. You better dunk this 
                        god damn basketball.

           Kristy gives Chang a look that could sail a thousand ships. 
           Chang, devoid of words, nods. Bo sticks his head in.

                                 BO
                        Oh, he will.

           Kristy smiles. 

                                                              FADE OUT:

           OVER BLACK - 12 WEEKS UNTIL DUNK DEADLINE

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Chang flies through the air, dunking repeatedly on a personal 
           basketball hoop, the kind that are portable. He double pumps, 
           he 360s, he throws it off the backboard to himself. He looks 
           graceful, strong. It looks easy.  

           We pull back to see that the hoop is only 8 feet tall. Chang 
           is playing against some neighborhood children and showing no 
           mercy at all. He slams it one last time, hanging on it and 
           yelling like Tarzan. The little kids scream with him. 

           Across the street, shaking his head is Bo.

           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Chang and Bo watch a video on youtube.

           ONSCREEN: The video is labelled 5’5” WHITE BOY TEACHES YOU 
           HOW TO DUNK. 1.2 Million views. MikeyG (24), white, short but 
           athletic expounds on his “dunk journey”. We see a quick 
           montage of MikeyG throwing down a series of very impressive 
           dunks intercut with some tips and workouts.

           Chang jots down notes, enraptured. MikeyG wraps it up.

                                 MIKEYG (O.S.)
                        -- some people are just born with 
                        bounce. For the rest of us, we 
                        gotta grind a little bit more.  But 
                        I promise you, if you put your mind 
                        to it, you too can dunk.  --
           MikeyG turns and dunks it two handed. Fin. Bo and Chang are 
           fired up.

                                 BO
                        5’5”!

                                 CHANG
                        I’ve got 4 inches on this dude. If 
                        he can throw a reverse two-
                        hander...

                                 BO
                        You could probably do a windmill!

           Chang gets up. He grabs the ball for his toy hoop. 

                                 CHANG
                        A tomahawk!

                                 BO
                        Between the legs!

                                 CHANG
                        On Matt’s stupid head!

           Chang slams it. 

                                 CHANG AND BO
                        Let’s goooooooo.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE - POUNDING PLATES

           - Chang fired up. He does jump rope. He does box jumps.

           - Bo cheers him on.

           - Chang does lunges with weights. He checks his notes.

           - Chang finishes a set and screams. He high fives the shit 
           out of Bo. 

           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The alarm wakes Chang up. He groans, his body sore 
           everywhere. Finally, he sits up and tries to stand...only to 
           collapse to the floor, his legs like two limp noodles.
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - EVENING

           The marching band reaches the climax of their last song.  The 
           formations are tighter, the music is crisp.  The band is 
           looking good.

           Playing from a chair on the sidelines is Chang, banging away 
           on his drum.

           A BIT LATER

           The band wraps up. Bo comes over to Chang who is chewing on 
           some kind of jerky.

                                 BO
                        How you feeling now?

                                 CHANG
                        I think I’ll walk again soon.

                                 BO
                        What is that?

                                 CHANG
                        Deer jerky. You want some?

                                 BO
                        Psh. Duh.

           Chang hands Bo some deer jerky.

                                 CHANG
                        Joe Rogan says deer are the super-
                        athletes of animals. 90% fast-
                        twitch muscle. It’s like if you ate 
                        Usain Bolt.

           Bo chews. Not bad. Kristy comes over.

                                 KRISTY
                        Bo says your butt hurts.

                                 CHANG
                        It’s better now.

                                 KRISTY
                        C’mon, walk me home then.

           Kristy turns. Bo gives Chang a thumbs up. Chang jumps up and 
           awkwardly hobble steps behind Kristy.
           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Kristy and Chang walk and talk. Their chemistry is easier, 
           more familiar now.

                                 KRISTY
                        ...You don’t know the song Rape Me? 

                                 CHANG
                        I...do not. How does it go?

                                 KRISTY
                             (sings)
                        Raaaape meeeeee. Raaaaape meeeee.

                                 CHANG
                        Wow. Catchy. 

           Kristy laughs. 

                                 KRISTY
                        So how’s the dunking going?

                                 CHANG
                        Good. If I add like 1/3 of an inch 
                        per day, I’m all set.

                                 KRISTY
                        Mmm. 
                             (beat)
                        So why’d you come over that night 
                        then? When Matt and I were talking.

                                 CHANG
                        I...Don’t know.

                                 KRISTY
                        Were you afraid he was gonna seduce 
                        me?

                                 CHANG
                        No...

           Chang tenses up, afraid to say the wrong thing. Kristy smiles 
           mischievously.

                                 KRISTY
                        You’re such a kid. You pull it off 
                        though. 

                                 CHANG
                        Thanks.

           They stop in front of her condo. 
                                 KRISTY
                        Wanna see my drum set?

           INT. KRISTY’S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           Kristy and Chang enter the duplex. The living room is filled 
           with moving boxes, waiting to be unpacked. They hustle up the 
           stairs to...

           INT. KRISTY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kristy turns on the lights. It’s a mess of rock band posters 
           and clothes, lit by colored string lights. At the center, a 
           shiny, black full drum kit.

                                 CHANG
                        Wow.

                                 KRISTY
                        My Dad got it for me. He used to 
                        play too. In a band.

                                 CHANG
                        He doesn’t play anymore?

                                 KRISTY
                        He’s dead. Cancer.

                                 CHANG
                        Oh, I’m sorry.

                                 KRISTY
                        Don’t be, it happens. I used to 
                        fight a lot with my Mom and my 
                        sister but now we’re all kinda 
                        close. Funny how that stuff works.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah.

                                 KRISTY
                        How about you? What’s your family 
                        like. 

                                 CHANG
                        Um, my parents divorced when I was 
                        just a kid. I live with my Mom now. 
                        We’re cool I guess.

                                 KRISTY
                        You ever wonder if she’s lonely?
           The question freezes Chang. He hasn’t. He looks up and the 
           two lock vulnerable eyes, their faces inches away from each 
           other. Chang, nervous, looks away.

                                 CHANG
                        Let’s hear something.

                                 KRISTY
                        Okay.

           Kristy gets up and gets behind her drum kit. She starts to 
           play. Chang can only watch.

           OVER BLACK - 10 WEEKS UNTIL DUNK DEADLINE

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           Bo and Chang, wearing hospital Volunteer shirts, push meal 
           trolleys down the sterile hall. They stop at each room to 
           hand out meals to waiting patients.

                                 CHANG
                        I can almost touch rim.

                        That’s less than last week.

                        I know.

                                 BO
                        Maybe you’re tired.

                                 CHANG
                        I’m only 16, how can I be tired?

                                 BO
                        You know what might work?

                        Steroids?

                                 BO
                        Not jerking off.

                                 CHANG
                        What?
                                 BO
                        It’s called No-Fap. You refrain 
                        from jerking off and it’s supposed 
                        to give you heightened clarity and 
                        strength.

                                 CHANG
                        So what, I turn into Beast from X-
                        Men?

                                 BO
                        He does jump really high. 

           Chang scoffs. They turn towards opposite directions.

                                 BO  (CONT'D)
                        You wanna hang later?

                                 CHANG
                        I can’t, I’m finally getting my new 
                        phone.

           They nod goodbye. Chang continues down the hallway. Suddenly 
           he stops. Further down, an annoyed NURSES SUPERVISOR 
           reprimands Chen with patronizing body language. Chen just 
           takes it before being sent off.  As Chen walks away, the 
           supervisor turns and shakes her head at some colleagues. They 
           snicker. Chang catches it all. He continues on.

           INT. TOM’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Chang, wearing a hospital Volunteer shirt, leans over a 
           patient, TOM, (82), effusive despite his frail appearance, 
           and sets down a hot lunch. Chang lifts the cover revealing a 
           very unappealing meal. 

                                 CHANG
                        Ta-da.

                                 TOM
                        Now this. This is a 5-star meal 
                        right here. 
                             (to Klaus)
                        Look Klaus. Look upon this feast.

           Tom’s visitor, KLAUS (75), cold but dignified, fixes the 
           napkin tucked under Tom’s chin. He gives Chang a look. 

                                 KLAUS
                        It’s look cold.

                                 TOM
                        Like your heart.
           Tom looks at Klaus and pointedly chews some food like a 
           rabbit. Klaus rolls his eyes, much to Tom’s amusement.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        As fun as it is to deliver meals to 
                        us old people, don’t you think you 
                        should be outside young man? It’s 
                        Saturday.

                                 CHANG
                        I don’t know how to break it to you 
                        but kids don’t hang out outside 
                        anymore. 

                                 TOM
                        That’s nonsense. Klaus, you should 
                        take Chang and his mother up in 
                        that little plane of yours.

                                 CHANG
                             (impressed)
                        You have a plane? 

                                 KLAUS
                             (modest)
                        It’s small. 4 people max.

                                 CHANG
                        I would be super down!

           A knock on the door. In walks Chen, dressed in nurse’s 
           scrubs. She gives Chang a look, before pulling back the 
           curtain.

                                 CHEN
                        Hi Tom. How are you feeling today?
                             (to Chang)
                        Ready to go?

           Chang nods.

                                 TOM
                        Chen, every time I see your son, he 
                        looks more and more like you. And 
                        so handsome and tall.

                                 CHEN
                             (modest)
                        Oh, you’re too nice. I wish he was 
                        taller.

           Chang diddles his thumbs. Nice.
                                 TOM
                        Well he deserves a reward for 
                        working so hard on a Saturday. So 
                        we decided that Klaus is going to 
                        take you and your son up on his 
                        plane for a nice little tour of our 
                        great state.

                                 CHEN
                        Oh no no.

                                 TOM
                        You’ll be fine. Klaus will take 
                        good care of you. 

                                 CHEN
                        I don’t want to trouble Klaus.

                                 TOM
                        Your son already expressed his 
                        enthusiasm. C’mon live a little.

           Chen gives Chang a look. Klaus notes the interaction.

                                 CHEN
                        Thank you so much but we really 
                        cannot accept. It’s too much 
                        trouble.

           EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - A BIT LATER 

           Chang steps out as Chen says good bye to Tom and Klaus. Chen 
           grabs Chang’s arm as she steps out. 

                                 CHEN
                        Tom and Klaus are old. Why do you 
                        want to trouble them? 

                                 CHANG
                        They invited me. All I said was 
                        that it would be cool.

                                 CHEN
                        You don’t understand what is 
                        manners. Let’s go. I don’t have 
                        long.

           Chen turns to leave. Chang, frustrated, follows her. 
           INT. AT&T STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Chen enters the strip mall phone shop, Chang in tow. 
           Immediately, DEVIN (32) the African American sales rep, 
           confident with glasses and a crispy fade, comes over. He even 
           makes the AT&T staff shirt look good.  

                                 DEVIN
                        Good afternoon! My name is Devin. 
                        How can I help you guys

                                 CHANG
                        Hi. I need a new phone.

                                 DEVIN
                        Well we got the newest models right 
                        over --

                                 CHEN
                        He don’t need too new.

                                 DEVIN
                        Oh. I hear that. Let’s take a look 
                        over here.

           Devin shows them some mid-tier phones. He’s got the whole 
           pitch down. Never have phones been so enthusiastically sold. 
           Chen gets a page on her hospital beeper. Something stressful. 
           She takes out her credit card and gives it to Chang.

                                 CHEN
                        I have to go back to work. Can you 
                        get yourself home?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah.

           Chen excuses herself. Chang looks at Devin.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                             (points to nice phones)
                        I guess it’s time...to go back over 
                        there.

                                 DEVIN
                        Word? You not gonna do your Momma 
                        like that are you.

                                 CHANG
                             (plays it off)
                        Of course not. Heh heh.

           A BIT LATER
           Devin rings up Chang’s new mid-tier phone up. Chang catches a 
           glimpse of Devin’s desktop background.

           ON SCREEN: A younger Devin in a basketball kit, soaring 
           through the air, ball cocked back, two helpless defenders 
           below him.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        That’s you?

                                 DEVIN
                        Yessir. Check this out.

           Devin takes out his phone. He plays a video on youtube 
           labelled DEVIN ADAMS HIGHLIGHT REEL. Clips play of Devin 
           breaking ankles, splashing jumpers and lastly, dunking on 
           heads, over a cheesy hip-hop track. Neither the production 
           value of the video or the competition he’s playing against 
           are particularly high quality but Devin’s passion and love 
           for the game are obvious. The video ends with Devin lifting 
           an MVP trophy. 

                                 CHANG
                        Sick. What league was this?

                                 DEVIN
                        Romania. Back to back champs baby.

           Devin pulls out a chain with two rings on it. Chang is 
           impressed.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        You hoop? You look like you hoop.

                                 CHANG
                        Really?

                                 DEVIN
                        I know a baller when I see one. You 
                        play for a team?

                                 CHANG
                        I just play for fun.

                                 DEVIN
                        Well, let me know if you wanna get 
                        serious and need some training. I 
                        got this youtube channel where I 
                        teach some skills or what not.

                                 CHANG
                        That’s cool
                             (beat)
                        Do you teach how to dunk?
                                 DEVIN
                        Why? You trying to dunk?

           Devin laughs. He catches himself when he sees Chang’s face.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        Word? Okay.
                             (thinks)
                        How much height you need?

           EXT. MOUNT DAVIS HIGH - LATER 

           The school is empty. Chang and Bo wait by the outside 
           entrance to the gym. No one is around. A beat up Ford Taurus 
           pulls up. Devin steps out.

                                 DEVIN
                        Sup.

                                 CHANG
                        Hey, this is Bo.

           Bo and Devin greet each other. Devin checks his watch. 
           Suddenly the back door of the gym is open by a JANITOR (52), 
           bald with a grey beard. 

                                 JANITOR
                        My man Doc Devin!

           INT. GYM - A BIT LATER

           Chang, eyes focused, gets low and explodes into a sprint. He 
           takes two big steps and LEAPS, cocking the ball back and 
           stretching his body as high as he can...

           The ball grazes the net, giving it a gentle tickle. Bo makes 
           a face. Yeesh. Devin processes the task at hand.

                                 DEVIN
                        Well first of all, your jump 
                        mechanics are all wrong. You’re not 
                        really generating much power from 
                        here and here.

           Devin points to Chang’s hips and core.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        You’re also only bringing the ball 
                        halfway up. Try this.

           Devin corrects Chang’s dunking motion. Chang lines up again 
           and jumps! This time, the ball hits the rim. It’s a first.
                                 BO
                        Holy crap!

                                 CHANG
                        That was like a 6 inch difference! 

                                 DEVIN
                        Yup.

                                 CHANG
                        So what do you think, could I dunk?

                                 DEVIN
                             (shrugs)
                        I mean you’re probably still 
                        growing, so if you’re consistent 
                        with working out, half a year, a 
                        year, I don’t see why not.

                                 CHANG
                        I need to do it in 10 weeks.

                                 DEVIN
                        Say what?

           Chang looks at Bo. Bo takes out his phone and plays the 
           cafeteria clips for Devin. Chang laying down the gauntlet, 
           Matt accepting, people cheering. Devin’s eyes grow big. 

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        Damn. 

                                 CHANG
                        I need help man. I’ll do anything.

           Devin looks at Chang sympathetically. He scratches his chin.

                                 DEVIN
                        You know what. I’m in.

                                 CHANG
                        Really?!

                                 DEVIN
                        How much you gonna pay me though

           Chang and Bo look at each other. The thought did not cross 
           Chang’s mind.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        You thought I was gonna coach you 
                        for free?
                                 CHANG
                        Yeah for your youtube channel.

                                 DEVIN
                        My brother. If you wanna dunk in 10 
                        weeks. We gotta do this right. That 
                        means mornings, evenings, Saturday 
                        and Sunday. And I can’t do all that 
                        for free. 

                                 CHANG
                        I don’t have any money.

                                 DEVIN
                        Well, unless you wanna be butt ass 
                        naked in front of the whole 
                        school...you need to get a job.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah but...my mom won’t let me.

           Devin is in disbelief.

                                 DEVIN
                        Your mom won’t let you get a job? 
                        That doesn’t even make sense.

                                 BO
                        It’s an Asian thing.

                                 DEVIN
                        Well. If you want me to be 
                        committed, I got to know you’re 
                        committed too.

           Chang weighs his options. He sticks out his hand.

                                 CHANG
                        I’m committed. 

           They shake.

           MONTAGE FROM BO’S CAMERA

           1) EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN

           Bo’s camera phone is framed up on Devin, in the middle of an 
           empty suburban street.

                                 BO
                        Okay. I’m rolling. Start walking.
           Bo follows Devin, coming around very cinematically. Devin’s 
           breath mists in the cold morning air. 

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        Oooo your breath looks great. Now 
                        rub your hands together.

           Devin rubs his hands together. 

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        Perfect.

           2) EXT. CHANG’S HOUSE - A BIT LATER

           Outside Chang’s house. Devin looks into camera and points at 
           his watch. It reads: 5:05 AM.

                                 DEVIN
                        It’s day one. And my dude already 
                        late. 

           Devin shakes his head.

           3) EXT. CHANG’S HOUSE - A BIT LATER

           Chang finally emerges, groggy as hell. Bo zooms in on a pop-
           tart in his hand. 

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        Well look who decided to join.

                                 CHANG
                        Hey can I talk to you about 
                        something? Since I’m paying you do 
                        we have to do this youtube thing?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The three stand in the middle of the street. We see Bo’s 
           camera setup, a go-pro on a handheld stabilizer.

                                 DEVIN
                        It’s for my VLOG. We’re gonna 
                        document your whole journey.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah but I don’t want Matt and his 
                        friends see this. They’re gonna 
                        trash me.
                                 DEVIN
                        If you can’t be in a little youtube 
                        video how are you gonna dunk in 
                        front of actual people under all 
                        that pressure.

                                 CHANG
                        That’s different. I’m gonna be able 
                        to dunk by then. Right now I’m just 
                        gonna look dumb.

                                 DEVIN
                        That’s the point. To see your 
                        progress. Comparing yourself to an 
                        ideal future self that hasn’t 
                        happened yet doesn’t get you 
                        anywhere. What does is comparing 
                        yourself to who you were yesterday. 

           Chang looks wary.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        The haters are always gonna hate 
                        but you, you gotta recognize your 
                        own growth.

                                 CHANG
                        You’re right.

                                 DEVIN
                        You’re gonna show Matt he doubted 
                        the wrong dude right?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah.

                                 DEVIN
                        Alright, let’s set an intention. 
                        Let’s put your desire out in the 
                        world. Who are you and what are you 
                        trying to do?

                                                                CUT TO:

           POV FROM BO’S CAMERA

           Bo frames up Chang who is obviously camera shy. 

                                 CHANG
                        Hi, I’m Chang. I’m 16. 5 foot 8 
                        inches. And I, uh, I’m trying to 
                        dunk a basketball. Hopefully.
                                 DEVIN (O.S.)
                        Cut. Cut. Where’s your swag man?

           Chang cracks a smile.

                                 CHANG
                        Long gone.

           Bo pans to Devin who looks into camera.

                                 DEVIN
                        We gonna work on that.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE OF DEVIN’S WORKOUT PLAN

           We intercut into each scene some bits of footage from Bo’s 
           camera, injecting each scene with some candid moments.

           - Chang and Devin doing a morning run. They do a playground 
           workout. Sit-ups, push-ups, dips etc.

           - Bo edits their first video. They upload it and wait for 
           their first comment. Its: lol. Chang throws up his hands. 
           Devin and Bo try to make him feel better.

           - They go lift weights. Devin fixes Chang’s technique.

           - They go to the supermarket. They buy a ton of chicken 
           breasts. Chang sneaks some deer jerky in there.

           - We see Chang struggle. He struggles to lift the weight. He 
           struggles to reach the rim. He can’t eat anymore chicken. He 
           throws up after overworking himself. He wants to quit.

                                 BO
                        WHAT. WOULD. KOBE. DO??

           Chang finds the strength to get up. To keep going.

           - Bo uploads more videos. They’re getting more views. More 
           positive comments.

           - Marching Band practice. Chang falls asleep while marching. 
           Bo pushes him awake, which startles him into randomly banging 
           on his drum. Mr. Ryan chews him out, while Kristy has a 
           laugh.

           - Through Bo’s videos we see Chang is more consistent now. 
           He’s preparing his own meals. Following his training plan. 
           And the videos are getting more views. More positive 
           comments.
           - Chang wakes up, crack of dawn. He gets himself out of bed 
           and goes on a run on his own. Chen catches him leaving. She’s 
           surprised. 

           - People are starting to notice at school. He has a more 
           confident air about him. In the locker room, Chang takes off 
           his shirt, revealing a new six pack. Matt and his friends 
           see. Chang meets their gaze.

           - At school Chang stops to look at something posted outside 
           the gym. It’s a signup sheet for the BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PLAYGROUND COURTS - DAY

           Chang readies himself. He explodes and leaps, his muscles 
           flexing tight, his form now graceful and powerful. He grabs 
           the rim and hangs on it for a celebratory moment as Devin 
           claps and Bo shoots. Chang flexes for the camera.

           Behind them on the main court, a group of adults play pick-up 
           full court. The competition is solid. One of the players 
           comes over. 

                                 PICK-UP PLAYER
                        Yo, ya’ll wanna run? We need two.

           Chang shrinks. Devin gets up and pulls Chang.

                                 DEVIN 
                        C’mon bruh. I got your back.

           Chang reluctantly follows Devin. They get in the game. Chang 
           is the smallest on the court. Chang is quickly lost in the 
           flow of the game. His defender bullies him. The other team is 
           dominating.

           Devin decides that he’s had enough. He begins to take over 
           like the Two time Romanian League MVP that he is. He makes a 
           point to keep feeding Chang the ball. Chang gets the ball 
           behind the three point line. He shoots...and makes it.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        Nice bucket!

           Chang is injected with some confidence. He wakes up. He 
           starts to make more nice plays. We see that he can ball. 
           Devin and Chang’s team come back and win the game. Devin daps 
           Chang and gives him a knowing look.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        I know a baller when I see one.
           Chang is beginning to understand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           OVER BLACK - 1 WEEK UNTIL DUNK DEADLINE

           A CLIP FROM DEVIN’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL

           A sweaty Chang sits under a tree. Devin acts as an 
           interviewer.

                                 DEVIN (O.S.)
                        One week out. How you feeling 
                        Chang?

                                 CHANG
                        I feel good.  

                                 DEVIN (O.S.)
                        You’ve come a long way.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah. Not there yet though. Still 
                        off by this much. 

           With his fingers, Chang gestures a distance of about 2 
           inches. He smiles and stands up 

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Almost there.

           INT. DEVIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house is quaint but warm and welcoming.  Trophies, shoes, 
           jerseys, team photos, are proudly displayed around the house. 
           The entirety of Devin’s hoop dreams.  

           Chang and Devin watch old highlights of Devin.

                                 DEVIN
                        Watch this, this is my go-to right 
                        here.

           ON SCREEN: Young Devin crosses his man and explodes to the 
           basket and slams it.

                        Man, that must feel so good to do 
                        in a game. 

                                 DEVIN
                        It’s unbelievable. It’s a spiritual 
                        experience man. Everybody in the 
                        room gets hit with this energy. 
                        They’re all feeling the same thing. 
                        And it’s from you. 

           Chang nods, trying to imagine.

                                 CHANG
                        Did you ever try to make the

                        You know I did. After college I had 
                        a try out or two. I worked my ass 
                        off. Nobody worked as hard as me. 
                        But it didn’t work out.

                        Why not?

                                 DEVIN
                        I don’t know. Sometimes no matter 
                        how bad you want something, you 
                        just can’t quite get there.

           Chang nods, contemplatively. Devin notices.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        But, you won’t know unless you try. 
                        And a lot people don’t try or give 
                        up before they realize how close 
                        they were. But the most important 
                        thing to remember is that no matter 
                        what happens, to keep going.
                             (beat)
                        Just look at me. You think I’m 
                        gonna be a sales rep at AT&T 
                        forever. Hell no. I’m gonna be 
                        manager by next year and that’s if 
                        I haven’t successfully monetized my 
                        youtube channel to the point of it 
                        paying all my bills. You know what 
                        I’m saying.
                                 CHANG
                        Yeah. 

                                 DEVIN
                        Let me ask you a question. Why do 
                        you want to dunk so bad? And don’t 
                        tell me it’s just to stick it to 
                        Matt.

           Chang ponders it for a long time.

                                 CHANG
                             (honest)
                        I don’t know. I just know that I 
                        have to do it.

                                 DEVIN
                        Word.

           The front door opens. It’s Devin’s Mom, MAE (60), witty, 
           gregarious with a unique sense of style.

                                 MAE
                        Why are you still in my house?

                                 DEVIN
                        Because I love Momma and I wish to 
                        spend more time with her.

                                 MAE
                        That’s why you still working at 
                        AT&T and hanging out with high 
                        school kids. 

           Boom, roasted. 

                                 MAE (CONT'D)
                        Hey Chang. You hungry?

                                 CHANG
                        I’m okay Ms. Adams. Thank you.

                                 DEVIN
                        I’m starving. 

                                 MAE
                        Nobody was talking to you.

           Mae leans down and Devin gives her a kiss on the cheek. Chang 
           watches enviously.  
           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Chang cooks dinner for two.  It’s an upgrade from his usual 
           stew. The front door opens. Chen, coming back from work. 

                                 CHANG
                        Hey Mom. You hungry?

           Chen comes over and takes a look. 

                                 CHEN
                        When you’d learn how to do this?

                                 CHANG
                        Been practicing.

           Chen sits down, she shrugs her shoulders, trying to release 
           the tension. It’s obvious it’s been a rough day. She takes a 
           bite.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        You like it?

                                 CHEN
                        It’s a little salty. But it’s good. 
                        Thanks.  

           Chen smiles. Chang takes what he can get.  

                                 CHEN (CONT'D)
                        How’s school?

                                 CHANG
                        Good. 

                                 CHEN
                        You seem very busy these days.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah. I felt like I could take on 
                        some new things, so I have. 

                                 CHEN
                        Like what?

                                 CHANG
                        Like you know. Band. Volunteering. 
                        Working out. Making some money here 
                        and there. 

                                 CHEN
                        You have a job?

           Chang hesitates. Shit.
                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, but it’s just a part time 
                        thing. Just to make some money.

                                 CHEN
                        For what?

                                 CHANG
                        I dunno, myself? Is it that big of 
                        a deal?

                                 CHEN
                        I’m just asking questions.

           The tone of the conversation shifts. Chang is already 
           flustered.

                                 CHANG
                             (getting agitated)
                        Yeah but what are you getting at?

                                 CHEN
                        I just want to know what are you 
                        doing. Is that okay?

                                 CHANG
                             (triggered)
                        Yeah, but it sounds like you’re 
                        implying something. Like whatever 
                        I’m doing is a waste of my time. 

                                 CHEN
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 CHANG
                        But that’s what you meant!

           Chen looks up at her son who is suddenly heated.

                                 CHEN
                        Why are you getting angry. I’m just 
                        asking you.

                                 CHANG
                        Because everything you say feels 
                        like a judgment.

                                 CHEN
                        How can I judge you. I am your 
                        mother. I know you.

                                 CHANG
                        Oh really? Tell me then, who am I?
                                 CHEN
                        Lan Lan. Every since you little, 
                        you always so sensitive about what 
                        other people think -- 

                                 CHANG
                        -- What does that have to do with 
                        anything!

                                 CHEN
                        Because it make you very easy get 
                        upset! You always focus on what 
                        other people think, not yourself. I 
                        tell you if you care too much about 
                        other people, you always 
                        disappointed. 

                                 CHANG
                        What are you even talking about?

                                 CHEN
                        I’m just look out for you, okay? 

           Chang looks down at the food he’s cooked. He shakes his head.

                                 CHANG
                        Whatever.

           Chang storms upstairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           OVER BLACK - 1 DAYS UNTIL DUNK DEADLINE

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           Big painted banners hang, commemorating the last home game of 
           the season. On the court, Chang, now muscular and lean, leaps 
           with the ball in hand. He misses the dunk but its close. He 
           goes again and again, but each time it’s a close failure. 

           Chang’s got a number of fans. Kristy, Bo, Devin, some of his 
           bandmates.  They cheer him on, but it’s not enough to quell 
           his frustration.

           It’s time to go. Devin stands up and hands Chang a box.

                                 DEVIN
                        We got you something.
           Chang open its up. It’s a gold and purple lakers jersey but 
           instead of BRYANT it says CHANG on the back. Chang is 
           grateful. Devin puts his hand on Chang’s shoulder.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        You’re there.  Tomorrow, the 
                        adrenaline is gonna give you that 
                        extra bounce that you need

           Chang nods and hugs his friends.

                                 BO
                        I can’t wait to see Matt’s face.

           Chang locks eyes with Kristy. She nods.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHANG’S VLOG - LATER

           Chang finishes one last recording from his bedroom. Chang is 
           reflective. Trying to be brave.

                                 CHANG
                        Tomorrow’s the big day. I’m still 
                        not hitting it. But I’m really 
                        close. Whatever happens. I’m really 
                        grateful for everything that’s 
                        happened because of this. It’s been 
                        an incredible journey. Wish me 
                        luck.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Chang uploads the video. He takes a moment to process. 
           Suddenly a new comment. “You ain’t dunking, bruh.”

           Chang clenches his jaw, turmoil in his eyes.

           EXT. SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

           Chang, face obscured by his hoodie, sneaks towards the empty 
           school. He lifts himself up a wall and climbs in through a 
           window.

           After a moment, he opens the gym door to the outside. He 
           retrieves a step ladder and brings it into the gym.
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           The Mount Davis Marching Band performs their final home 
           halftime show. It’s near flawless. The crowd loves it. 

           EXT. BLEACHERS - NIGHT

           Chang looks up at the clock. The game is almost over. It’s 
           time.

           He gets up. His fellow bandmates wish him good luck. Even Mr. 
           Ryan gives him some words of encouragement. Finally he passes 
           Melissa, the Tuba player.

                                 MELISSA
                        Hey Chang. Don’t worry. You’ll get 
                        it.

           Chang nods. He turns one last time to his bandmates and 
           salutes them.

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - A BIT LATER

           Devin is already waiting.

                                 DEVIN
                             (smiles)
                        You ready big man?

           Chang nods. He takes off his band uniform. Underneath, his 
           friends’ gift, his custom purple and gold jersey.

           As he changes, curious people start to filter in. Finally, 
           Matt, Syd and Owen enter, relaxed as can be. As Chang starts 
           to do his warmup stretches, Owen comes over with his phone to 
           start recording. 

                                 OWEN
                        Yo Chang. It’s not too late to back 
                        out man. Matt says he’ll let you go 
                        scott free. Otherwise we filming 
                        everything. 

                                 DEVIN
                        Man get the hell --

                                 CHANG
                        -- I got this. 
                             (to Owen)
                        Nah, film all you want man. Your 
                        boy is getting his head shaved.
           The gym is half full now. There’s an impatient murmur in the 
           crowd. People have their phones out. 

                                 SYD
                        Yo, lets go already.

           Devin nods at Chang. Chang takes a deep breath and approaches 
           the hoop, looking up at it one last time. Matt meets him at 
           the center.

                                 MATT
                        I’ll give you three tries. 

                                 CHANG
                        I’m only gonna need one. 

           Matt nods and takes his place in the crowd. It’s almost 
           quiet. Chang looks at Devin who nods back. He lines up and...

           He pauses. In the distance, the faint sound of a snare drum 
           roll, coming closer and closer. Heads turn. Suddenly the 
           unmistakable opening riff of Seven Nation Army is heard, 
           building and building until the doors of the gym swing open, 
           revealing the entire marching band, led by Kristy and Bo.  

           The crowd parts as music fills the entire gym. The band lines 
           up in block formation as the song concludes. Collectively, 
           they salut Chang. Chang looks at his fellow bandmates, 
           glowing with appreciation. He looks at Bo and Kristy, his 
           best friends. They nod at him.

           An energized Chang looks back to the basket. I can do this. 

                                 KRISTY
                        ...Chang. Chang. Chang.

           The crowd begins to join in.

                                 CROWD
                        Chang. Chang. CHANG. CHANG!

           The whole crowd is on his side now. Everyone is chanting 
           except for Matt and his friends. They shrink. Chang focuses 
           on the rim, recalling everything Devin taught him. He sprints 
           forward.

           Time slows. Its quiet. Chang explodes forward, his now 
           muscular frame firing with maximum power and efficiency. He 
           hits his final step and leaps. He raises the ball high, with 
           one hand...

           And SLAMS IT!!! He drops to the ground in disbelief. The gym 
           explodes and he’s surrounded. Kristy and Bo embrace him. Owen 
           and Syd are slack jawed. 
           Chris pushes his way through the crowd to meet Matt in the 
           middle. Matt looks down at Chang, looking up at him with a 
           smirk. Matt smiles, and offer his hand. They dap.

                                 MATT
                        Props.

           Chang nods in appreciation. 

                                 ONLOOKER
                        Shave his head. Shave his head!

                                 CROWD
                        Shave his head! Shave his head! 
                        SHAVE HIS HEAD!

           A chair and clippers are brought. Matt sits down and the 
           clippers are handed to Chang. The phones are out. He teases 
           Matt with clippers, bringing them close and backing away, 
           close and then backing away. Chang is really savoring this 
           moment. 

           Finally in one fell swoop. He buzzes the entirety of Matt’s 
           head, right down the middle of the scalp, Full Metal Jacket 
           style. The crowd erupts as Chang buzzes haphazardly across 
           Matt’s head. Matt gestures to the crowd to bring it on. Even 
           he looks like he’s enjoying himself.

           Chang finishes. Matt gets up. We hear more than a smattering 
           of whistles. With tantalizing intent, he lifts his shirt, 
           exposing his lean, muscular chest. He starts to unbuckle his 
           belt, pushing through the crowd as he drops his pants and 
           then as he nears the exits, his drawers. Girls cheer and give 
           chase, eager to get a good look, or even better a good snap. 
           Matt sprints out into the darkness.

           Center court, Chang gets his props from everybody. He’s 
           glowing. Devin approaches. They hug.

                                 DEVIN
                        My man.

                                 CHANG
                        I don’t want to stop. I want to try 
                        out for the basketball team.

                                 DEVIN
                             (nods)
                        Let’s do it.

           Lastly, Kristy. The two look at each other. Suddenly 
           something comes over Chang.
                                 CHANG
                        You wanna get out of here. 

           Kristy nods. He grabs her hands pulls her away from the 
           crowd.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They run through the dark hallway, laughing. 

           INT. BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the dark room, hormones raging. Chang pulls Kristy 
           close.

                                 CHANG
                        My heart can’t stop pounding. 

                                 KRISTY
                        I can tell.

           They look into each others eyes. Even now, Chang is nervous. 
           But he’s different too. He knows what he should do.

                                 CHANG
                        I’m really into you.

                                 KRISTY
                        Yeah? Prove it.

           Chang closes his eyes and leans it. They kiss. Fireworks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           SOCIAL MEDIA MONTAGE - CHANG’S DUNK

           A series of clips from different angles, different accounts 
           of Chang’s dunk.  The drama is all there. The crowd, the band 
           entrance, the chant, the dunk, the haircut. It’s wild.

           We see in the final clip, that it’s from Bo’s camera. We see 
           Devin and Kristy celebrate as Chang is rushed. They push 
           through the crowd to get to Chang. Finally we see the kid of 
           the moment at the center, surrounded, a huge smile on his 
           face.

           Finally, we see the views and comments rise on Devin’s 
           account at a rapid fire pace. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM

           Chang is blissfully asleep. Next to him, his phone buzzes 
           repeated from notifications and messages. Finally, he comes 
           to. He looks at his phone and jumps up. His video already has 
           tens of thousands of views. 

           He opens his video and scrolls to the comments. It’s a flood 
           of positive messages: The kid did it; I’m inspired, no cap; 
           yo he get bounce for real; I’m crying right now.

           Chang raises his hands in the air.

                                 CHANG
                        YES!

           Chang can’t stop smiling. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Changs struts through the school like a king. As he passes, 
           other students shout props and give him pats on his back. 
           This is everything he’s ever wanted. 

           Bo catches up to him.

                                 BO
                        Dude! Did you see the stats on 
                        yesterday’s video?

                                 CHANG
                        Yes! I think it’s gonna go viral.

                                 BO
                        Bigger than viral bro. Look at 
                        this.

           Bo takes out his phone and shows a snapshot from the video of 
           Chang surrounded by his classmates who are adoring him. 
           Captioned below: Me when I take out some gum in school. 

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        You’re gonna be a MEME!

                                 CHANG
                        Did I do it? Am I actually, finally 
                        cool?

                                 BO
                        You’ve been cool Chang. Now just 
                        everyone else sees too. 

           Chang grins, playfully.
                                 CHANG
                        Especially Kristy.

                                 BO
                        Yoo! Give me the deets.

                                 CHANG
                        Sorry man, I don’t kiss and tell.

                                 BO
                        Ya’ll kissed?! What?!

           The bell rings.

                                 CHANG
                        I’ll tell you later?

                                 BO
                        Bet!

           The two friends dap. Chang continues on.

           INT. GYM CLASS - CONTINUOUS

           Chang enters. Everyone starts to clap. Even Matt and his 
           friends.

                                 BENNEVIDO
                        Chang. I heard about your great 
                        feat. I’m proud of you man.
                             (to class)
                        Look at this dude. Look at him! All 
                        muscle.

           Bennevido pokes Chang on the shoulders and arms, playfully. 

                                 BENNEVIDO (CONT'D)
                        You gonna try out for the team this 
                        year or what? 

                                 CHANG
                        Thinking about it.

                                 BENNEVIDO
                             (to Matt)
                        You better watch out Matt. He 
                        already snatched all your hair.

           Chang gives Matt a look. As class starts, Chang turns his 
           attention to the center hoop, perhaps to relive his crowning 
           moment. But then a reminder comes flashing into his memory. 
           The rim.
           Bennevido takes out basketballs for shooting practice. Matt 
           grabs a ball and starts to shoot. CLANG, back rim. He shoots 
           another, another CLANG. Other students shoot, everybody is 
           missing.  

                                 MATT
                        Damn I’m off today.

                                 OWEN
                        Must be the hair.

           Owen and Syd burst out laughing but Chang is sweating 
           bullets. A frustrated Matt misses again. He grabs a ball and 
           runs in for a dunk. He slams it HARD...and pulls the rim 
           right off. The class gasps. Bennevideo runs over.

                                 BENNEVIDO
                        Are you okay?!

                                 MATT
                        Yeah. I think so.

           Matt gets to his feet. 

                                 SYD
                        Yo Chang, you dunked too hard 
                        yesterday man!

           The class laughs. Chang cracks a smile. Relieved. Suddenly, 
           the door to the gym opens. It’s the PRINCIPAL ELLIOT (45), 
           professorial and a bit intimidating. Her eyes lock on Chang. 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Chang! Can you step outside for a 
                        second? 

           Chang runs over, slight concerned. He steps into the hallway. 
           Waiting outside with the principal, a LOCAL NEWS CREW. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LOCAL NEWS REPORT

           A snippet of Chang’s dunk plays, above a headline banner: 
           LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL BET GOES VIRAL. The video cuts to a 
           REPORTER standing in front of MOUNT DAVIS HIGH.

                                 REPORTER
                        ...Not willing to back down from 
                        his classmate’s challenge, he began 
                        a rigorous three month training 
                        regime in hopes of achieving his 
                        life long ambition of dunking.
           We cut to the REPORTER interviewing Chang. 

                                 CHANG
                        ...It was really tough. There were 
                        a lot of times I wanted to quit but 
                        every time I did, I’d say to myself 
                        “what would kobe do, what would 
                        kobe do.”...

           INT. TOM’S HOSPITAL ROOM

           We pull back from the news report to show it playing off a 
           TV. Watching are Chang, Tom and Klaus. Tom grabs Chang’s arm 
           and gives it a squeeze.

                                 TOM
                        Look at you! You’re a star. Such a 
                        natural on camera. Right Klaus?

           Klaus nods. 

                                 CHANG
                        You’re not gonna believe this but 
                        ESPN saw the video too. They want 
                        me to come for a special segment!

                                 TOM
                        ESPN! That’s amazing!

           Klaus nods.

                                 CHANG
                        In New York! 

                                 TOM
                        New York! Klaus!

           Klaus nods.

                        KLAUS! NEW YORK!

           Klaus cracks a smile. Tom and Chang laugh.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                             (shakes head)
                        Forgive him, he needs an oil

                                 CHANG
                        Actually I haven’t told her yet. 

                                 TOM
                        Why not? She’ll be so proud.

                                 CHANG
                        I don’t know. I don’t think so. 
                        She’ll probably think its silly.

                                 TOM
                        What? No way. She talks about you 
                        all the time. She’s very proud of 
                        you. 

                                 CHANG
                             (surprised)
                        Really?

           Klaus takes in the boy’s reaction. A knock at the door. Chen.

                                 CHEN
                        Hello, everybody!

                                 TOM
                        Chen! Do you know what amazing 
                        thing your son did?!

           Chen raises her eyebrow. Chang shrinks. 

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Tell h--

           Klaus jumps up and squeezes Tom’s hand. 

                                 KLAUS
                        -- don’t take all of Chang’s glory 
                        now. I’m sure he wants to tell his 
                        mother on his own. Right Chang?

           They turn and look at Chang.

                                 CHEN
                        Tell me what?

                                 CHANG
                        I’ll tell you later.

           She gives Chang a look, a bit suspicious. 

                                 CHEN
                        Okay. 
                                 TOM
                        You’ll be very, very impressed.

                                 CHEN
                             (joking)
                        Tom you are too nice. Now he don’t 
                        want to go help other patients!

                                 CHANG
                        I guess that’s my signal. Bye guys.

           Chang walks out as Chen checks on Tom. Klaus follows Chang 
           out.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 CHANG
                        Thanks for that.

                                 KLAUS
                        Of course.

           Chang smiles and turns to leave.

                                 KLAUS (CONT'D)
                        Your mother does talk about you a 
                        lot. 

           Chang turns to look at Klaus, who smiles warmly. Chang nods.

           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Chang on Facetime with Kristy.  

                                 CHANG
                        ...their producer said I’d be on 
                        the Tuesday segment. Principal 
                        Elliot already gave me permission 
                        to skip! 

                                 KRISTY
                        Your Mom going to take you?

                                 CHANG
                        Nah, Devin. 

           Chang grins, extra cheeky.

                                 KRISTY
                        What? What are you geeking out 
                        about.
                                 CHANG
                        ...You wanna come?

                                 KRISTY
                             (smiles)
                        I don’t wanna get in the way of 
                        your big moment. 

                                 CHANG
                        How could you get in the way, I’m 
                        here partly because of you.

                                 KRISTY
                             (touched)
                        Oh is that so?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, you and Bo.

           Chang is an oblivious lad. Kristy smiles to herself. 

                                 KRISTY
                        I’ll ask my Mom.

                                 CHANG
                        Tell her Chang requested your 
                        presence.

                                 KRISTY
                        Oh you requested my presence? 
                        You’re the king now?

                                 CHANG
                        President. Kings summon.

           Kristy laughs and shakes her head. The front door opens.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Mom’s home. Talk to you later?

                                 KRISTY
                        Yeah. Bye.

           The two smile at each, a new tenderness between them. Chen 
           enters the kitchen.

                                 CHEN
                        You’re very smiley today. 

                                 CHANG
                        It was a good day. 
                                 CHEN
                        Something to do with what you want 
                        to tell me?

           Chen looks down at Chang, her lie-detector eyes bearing down 
           on him as usual. This time, he meets her gaze.

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah. Actually. I, uh, I got asked 
                        to...
                             (beat)
                        ...to represent the school at a 
                        conference in New York. For Math 
                        and Science.

                                 CHEN
                        Oh. Really?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah, it’s cool but it’s not that 
                        big of a deal. I don’t have to go.

                                 CHEN
                        No. I mean. You should go. Do you 
                        need me to take you?

                                 CHANG
                        Nah, one of the teachers will 
                        chaperone me. 

                                 CHEN
                        I see. Well have fun then.

           Chen stops and looks at her son, stroking his hair.

                                 CHEN (CONT'D)
                        Good job. I’m proud of you.

           Chang smiles, appreciative

           NEW YORK DRIVING MONTAGE

           - Devin, Bo, Kristy and Chang drive in Devin’s old sedan 
           through the Holland Tunnel.

           - They pass by MSG and then Times Square

           - They get Pretzels off the street. They take pictures.

           - They walk up to a large tower. Plastered on the side, the 
           logo of ESPN.
           INT. ESPN STUDIOS - LATER

           A PA leads the awestruck Chang, Bo, Devin and Kristy through 
           the fabled halls of the studio. She points out the different 
           sets as the crew geek over people they recognize. 

                                 PA
                        You guys can wait in here. 

           She leads to the group into a green room, complete with a 
           dressing mirror, snacks and some ESPN swag.

                                 PA (CONT'D)
                        We’ll have someone come and touch 
                        you up 30 minutes before and then a 
                        5 minute warning. Anything else, 
                        let me know.

                                 CHANG
                        Thanks. Oh! Actually.

           Chang points to the ESPN hoodie slung over his makeup chair.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Could my friends get a set

           The PA smiles.

                                 PA
                        Shouldn’t be a problem.

           Chang nods as she leaves.

                                 BO
                        “Shouldn’t be a problem.”

                        “Whatever you need Mr. Chang.”

           Chang smirks and pops a fizzy water.

                                 CHANG
                        What? I’m just trying to take care 
                        of my entourage.

                                 DEVIN, KRISTY, BO
                        Oooohhhhhh.

           A knock on the door. In enters, ESPN analyst JAY WILLIAMS 
           with a million dollar grin. Chang straightens up.

                                 JAY
                        Mr. Chang!
                                 CHANG
                        Hey, Mr. Williams.

                                 JAY
                        Please, call me Jay. I thought 
                        you’d be taller. But I guess that 
                        makes your story even more 
                        inspiring.

                                 CHANG
                        Thank you.

           Chang beams.

                                 JAY
                        Well, today is gonna be a lot fun. 
                        We’re gonna play the clip. Me and 
                        Richard might do a bit as if we 
                        were judging a dunk contest. 

                                 CHANG
                        That’s funny, I like that.

                                 JAY
                        Good!. So then, we’ll introduce 
                        you. I’ll ask you some basic 
                        questions. What was the 
                        inspiration, how’d you do it, 
                        what’s your message. Etc. Etc. 
                        Easy. Just like a conversation.  

                                 CHANG
                        Whatever you need. I gotchu!

                                 JAY
                        Cool man. Cool. One last thing, the 
                        producers like to keep things fresh 
                        so sometimes they’ll throw out a 
                        curveball. You’re okay with right?

                                 CHANG
                        Like I said. Whatever you need.

                                 JAY
                        My man.

           Jay and Chang dap.

                        If you and your friends aren’t 
                        doing anything after the taping. 
                        We’re actually having a bit of a 
                        party tonight if you’d like to 
                        come.
                                 CHANG
                        Cool! Yeah for sure. What’s it for?

           Jay searches his memory. He shrugs.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know. Tuesday?
                             (smiles)
                        See you later!

           Jay smiles and closes the door. Chang looks at his friends, 
           ecstatic.

           ESPN SHOW: “THE GET UP”

           Three panelists, former NBA players JAY WILLIAMS, RICHARD 
           JEFFERSON and anchor MIKE GREENBERG, are in a heated but good-
           natured debate on one of last night’s basketball games. 
           Playful barbs and exaggerated reactions abound.

                                 MIKE GREENBERG
                        ...And lastly, a really inspiring 
                        story, especially for us vertically 
                        and athletically challenged folk...

           INT. “THE GET UP” STAGE - SAME TIME

           The hosts play Chang’s clip and commentate. Behind the 
           cameras, Chang and the gang wait. Chang is nervous. Kristy 
           squeezes his hand reassuringly.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        ...Chang!

           Chang steps onto the stage. Williams stands to greet him.

                                 CHANG
                        Hey guys.

                                 GREENBERG
                        So tell us a little about yourself.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Who is Chang?

                                 CHANG
                        Uh, well...
           Chang is searching for words. Kristy, Bo and Devin are 
           feeling the cringe come on. But then...

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                             (confident)
                        I’m just a kid who got told he 
                        couldn’t do something...but I 
                        disagreed. Guess who was right.

           The hosts nod, vibin’ with Chang’s energy. 

                                 WILLIAMS
                        What was your training regimen. 
                        Because at the beginning of your 
                        videos...you made a big jump.

                                 JEFFERSON
                             (sarcastic)
                        Nice one Jay.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Man, be quiet.

                                 CHANG
                        You know in magic, they say the 
                        trick is only good if there’s 
                        mystery in how it’s done.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Wow. I like it.

                                 CHANG
                        What I will disclose is that it was 
                        a lot of hard work, a lot of 
                        dedication...  

           Devin puts his arms around Kristy and Bo.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        But I told myself early on that the 
                        only I was going to do this no 
                        matter what, even if no one was 
                        going to help me.

           Chang’s friends are a bit stung by this.

                                 GREENBERG
                        Well respect to you kid. I think we 
                        all see in you how far some 
                        commitment can get a person.
                             (beat)
                        Before you go. We have a request, 
                        something to inspire our viewers.
           Out of the darkness, the producers push a portable 10 foot 
           tall basketball hoop. Another producer tosses Williams a 
           basketball. Chang swallows the lump in his throat.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Chang. You know it was coming. Do 
                        you mind? 

                                 CHANG
                        Ha ha. You gonna throw me an alley-
                        oop?

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Hey, if that’s what you want.

           Williams hands Chang the ball. He looks out at the cameras 
           and the crew. His friends recording him on their phones. 
           Suddenly the lights feel hot. They’re all waiting.

           Chang rolls up his sleeves and backs up. The producers play a 
           snare drum roll. Chang sprints for the basket, takes two 
           steps and LEAPS...

           Chang gets high, high enough for part of the ball to rise 
           above the hoop. But it’s not enough. The ball bounces off the 
           edge of the rim. Rejected. 

                                 GET UP ANALYSTS
                        Oooooh!

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Is the shoes?

           The analysts and crew burst out into laughter. Chang panics 
           for a second.

                                 CHANG
                        I didn’t get to stretch!

           More laughter. 

                                 GREENBERG
                        Well, that’s all the time we got. 
                        Pardon the Interruption is next! 

           Chang is mortified. His cover is blown. The lights dim. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - LATER

           Kristy, Bo and Devin try to comfort Chang.

                                 DEVIN
                        Don’t trip man! It was funny!
                                 BO
                        You’re lucky dude, this is like 
                        your 2nd chance of becoming a meme 
                        in a week! That’s more than other 
                        kids in their entire lifetime!

                                 CHANG
                        I guess. But it’s gonna look like I 
                        can’t dunk.

                                 KRISTY
                        Yeah but you can.

           Kristy ties her arm in with Chang’s. Changs calms a bit.

           EXT. ROOFTOP BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Elevator doors open to reveal Chang and the Gang. Their eyes 
           widen in awe.

                                 BO
                        Whoa.

           Vibey hip-hop echoes out into the glittery Manhattan skyline 
           as sports royalty crack jokes and recall past stories. This 
           is the cool of the cool. A waiter immediately greets them.

                                 WAITER
                        Drink?

           Champagne, Wine, Beer. The three teens look at Devin.

                                 DEVIN
                        I ain’t yo momma.

           They help themselves. Bo lifts his glass to Chang.

                                 BO
                        You did it man, just like you said 
                        you would. From here.

           Gestures low with his hand.

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        To here.

           Gestures to everything around them. Chang is moved. 

                                 DEVIN
                        Man of his word. Cheers!

           They raise glasses. Chang downs it in one go.
                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        Whoa easy!

                                 WILLIAMS (O.S.)
                        My man Chang!

           Williams. Chang is a bit embarrassed.

                                 CHANG
                        Hey. I’m sorry for you know...

                                 WILLIAMS 
                        What? You were amazing!

                                 CHANG
                        Really?

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Yeah! You were funny. You were 
                        charming. We were all talking about 
                        how cool of a kid you are.

                                 CHANG
                        Oh. Thanks.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        You were on TV for the first time. 
                        Got a little nervous. We all miss 
                        sometimes.

                                 DEVIN
                        Like you did against Indiana?

           Jay gives Devin a look. Devin shrugs.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        C’mon. I’ll introduce you to some 
                        people. 

           Chang turns to his friends. They wave him to go on. 

           ESPN PARTY MONTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           - a beautiful, stylish crowd, mix and mingle.

           - Jay introduces Chang to some friends who recognize him. 
           He’s shy. He grabs another drink. 

           - Kristy and Bo comparing the different hor d’oeuvres they’ve 
           amassed.  

           - Chang tells a funny joke. His confidence and drunkness 
           grow.
           - Devin handing out AT&T business cards and pitching anyone 
           who will listen.

           - Chang gets challenged to a dance battle. He’s reluctant but 
           then he gets in there. The crowd goes nuts!

           - Kristy and Bo sit in the corner, bored. Bo yawns while 
           Kristy looks at the time.

           ON CHANG

           Chang kicks it with GILBERT ARENAS and his entourage.

                                 ARENAS
                        Look at this little dude. Thinks he 
                        can do anything. 

                                 CHANG
                        Cuz I can!

                                 ARENAS
                        Oh word? You should come with us to 
                        the strip club. I’ll introduce you 
                        to a woman who can do anything.

                                 CHANG
                        So down.

           Arenas and Co love it. 

                                 ARENAS
                        Ay yo, we taking Chang to the strip 
                        club! We out!

                                 CHANG
                        Wait, wait. Can my homies come?

                                 ARENAS
                        Yeah, whatever. 

           Chang pushes his way through the crowd. He finds Kristy and 
           Bo in the corner, talking close. A flashback to Matt’s party.

                                 CHANG
                        What’s going on here.

                                 KRISTY
                        Hey. Somebody’s sauced. 

                                 CHANG
                        Just enjoying myself. How about you 
                        guys.
                                 BO
                        We’re kind tired to be honest.

                                 CHANG
                        Really, cuz you like you’re having 
                        a good time. 

           Kristy crosses her arms.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        That came out wrong. I’m going out 
                        with Agent Zero. Ya’ll wanna come?

                                 KRISTY
                        I think I’m okay.

                                 CHANG
                        Bo?

                                 BO
                        Uhh. I dunno man. Don’t we gotta go 
                        back?

                                 CHANG
                        Really, ya’ll gonna turn down a 
                        night out with Gilbert Arenas? 
                        Agent Zero?! In the big city? What 
                        kind of small town attitude is 
                        that?

           Bo shuffles awkwardly. Kristy is mucho annoyed at this point.

                                 KRISTY
                        I guess we’re not cut out for the 
                        big city.

           Chang looks at the two and nods.

                                 CHANG
                        Okay. See ya.

           He turns and coldly marches back through the crowd. He passes 
           right by Devin, who excuses himself to follow.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Yo Hibachi! I got my permission 
                        slip. Lessgooo.

           Arenas, Chang in tow, jump in the elevator with his 
           entourage. As the doors close, Devin pushes through the crowd 
           towards them.

                                 DEVIN
                        Chang!
           Too late.

           MUSIC UP: Kid Cudi “Pursuit of Happiness”

           PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS MONTAGE

           - Chang in Arena’s SUV, as they speed through NYC

           - The entourage pull up to a strip club, back entrance. The 
           bouncer looks at Chang. Chang grins. The bouncer waves him 
           in, nonchalant.

           - Chang enters the neon, black light lit house of pleasures. 
           It’s a dream world. He’s absolutely enraptured. This is the 
           happiest night of his life.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DEVIN'S HOUSE - DAY

           Chang opens his eyes. He immediately recoils. His head is 
           pounding. There’s glitter all over his face. Devin enters.

                                 DEVIN
                        Well look who it is. 

                                 CHANG
                             (holds head)
                        Ah. What is this? 

                                 DEVIN
                        It’s a hangover. Here drink this.

           Devin hands Chang a gatorade. Suddenly Chang jolts up.

                                 CHANG
                        My mom!

                                 DEVIN
                        Bo called her. It’s cool. 

           Chang breathes a sigh of relief. Devin looks at the kid.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        You got good friends Chang.

           Chang suddenly feels guilty.

                                 CHANG
                        Where was I?
                                 DEVIN
                        The strip club. My ass had to come 
                        and get you. You owe me 50 dollar 
                        cover man.

                                 CHANG
                        Damn, really. Sorry.

                                 DEVIN
                        You’re not gonna ask me how I knew 
                        which one?

                                 CHANG
                             (concerned)
                        How.

           Devin takes out his phone. He opens IG to Chang’s stories. 
           It’s a stream of videos. Chang at the strip club. He somehow 
           documented everything. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHANG’S IG: CHANG’S STRIP CLUB ADVENTURE

           - Chang and Arenas making it rain.

           - Chang’s POV. Getting a lapdance.

           - Chang, completely obliterated. Arenas recording. 

                                 ARENAS
                        Ay yo Chang what you doing bro?

                                 CHANG
                        Dunkin’ on these hoes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DEVIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Chang watches in disbelief. Devin laughing.

                                 DEVIN
                        You were wilin’ bro. 
                             (shakes head)
                        I gotta get some coffee and your 
                        ass got school.

           He searches desperately for his phone. Somehow, he still has 
           it. His lockscreen is littered with IG DMs. You crazy bro! 
           AGENT ZERO!!! You can dunk on me anytime ;). 
           He goes to his post.  There’s thousands of views. He looks at 
           who has viewed. At the top. Kristy.

                                 CHANG
                        Shit!

           He looks at his watch. 8:00 am. Chang jumps up, rushing past 
           Devin who has coffee. 

                                 DEVIN
                        You just gonna -- You owe me 50 
                        dollars!

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - A BIT LATER

           Chang rushes through the hall looking for Kristy. Other 
           students give him props as he rushes by. 

                                 STUDENT
                        Chang you crazy bro!

           Chang’ too focused on finding Kristy to react. Finally, he 
           sees her. She’s with Bo and a few of her band friends.

                                 CHANG
                        Kristy!

           Kristy turns, a cold look on her face.   

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        I’m really sorry. I don’t know what 
                        happened last night. I guess I got 
                        a little excited. I mean Gilbert 
                        Arenas wanted to hang out with me!

                                 KRISTY
                        I know. That’s cool Chang. I’m glad 
                        you had a good time.

           Kristy pushes past Chang.

                                 CHANG
                        Kristy! I’m sorry!

           Kristy ignores him. Chang throws up his hands.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        It was GILBERT freaking ARENAS!

           An exasperated Chang turns to face Bo. 

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        Gilbert Arenas man.
                                 BO
                        I know.

                                 CHANG
                        Don’t tell me you’re mad at me too.

                                 BO
                        Well. You kinda ditched us.

                                 CHANG
                        What are you talking about? I 
                        wanted you to come!

                                 BO
                        Yeah I know but we didn’t really 
                        want to.

                                 CHANG
                        But I did! Yesterday was supposed 
                        to be my day! Why can’t you be less 
                        selfish and more supportive. 

           Bo is taken a back. Offended.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 BO
                             (scoffs)
                        Whatever man.

           Bo walks away. Chang waves him off.

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - LATER

           Chang sits on the bleachers surrounded by classmates as they 
           wait for class to start.  He recounts his experience last 
           night while simultaneously flirting with a girl on IG. I 
           think you’re cute too...especially your smile.

                                 CHANG
                             (cocky)
                        ...so Arenas was like “Yo Chang you 
                        wanna go to the strip club?” Like 
                        it was a joke. But I kept it cool. 
                        So I was like, “yeah let’s do it!” 
                        And they were all shocked, like 
                        who’s this kid! 

           Matt, Syd and Owen enter. They march towards Chang, 
           confrontational. Chang looks up unfazed.
                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        What?

           Matt seethes. Owen and Syd egg him on.

                                 OWEN & SYD
                        Go off Matt.

                                 MATT
                        I knew you couldn’t dunk.

           Chang stands. He gets in Matt’s face.

                                 CHANG
                        I know you’re a meathead but is 
                        your memory that short? I threw it 
                        down right over there. In your 
                        FACE.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah, but you cheated.

           Chang pauses. The class goes quiet. Matt takes out his phone. 
           He opens to a youtube video. The smoking gun. Titled “CHANG 
           CAN’T DUNK: EXPOSED”. The class pulls out their phones.

           ON PHONE SCREENS: A random youtuber, in the style of a 
           “breakdown” video, dissects Chang’s dunk attempts using the 
           failed ESPN footage, a picture from Matt breaking the rim and 
           finally a freeze framed image from the actual dunk. The 
           youtuber begins to drawing lines. He’s about to drop some 
           trigonometry.

                                 DUNK EXPOSER (O.S.)
                        ...If Chang’s reach is X and his 
                        vertical is Y, and Y is .29 of X, 
                        then X + Y = total height reached. 
                        Plugging in Chang’s standing reach 
                        of 7’4”, we get a total height 
                        reached of 9’10”! Well below 
                        regulation height. Ladies and 
                        Gentlemen, Chang can’t dunk! 

           The class gasps. Chang poorly tries to play it off.

                                 CHANG
                        Who even is this?!
                             (incredulous)
                        You’re gonna get in my face because 
                        some rando on the internet made a 
                        video? Do you also think the Earth 
                        is Flat??!!
           Owen tosses Matt a basketball. Matt fires the ball into 
           Chang’s chest.

                                 MATT
                        Do it again then.

           The class looks up at Chang, suspicious. 

                                 CHANG
                        I don’t have to prove anything. I 
                        already did it! 

                                 MATT
                        Yeah but you cheated! 

                                 CHANG
                        What is your problem man? Why can’t 
                        you accept that I can dunk?!

                                 MATT
                        Because you can’t!

                                 CHANG
                             (screaming)
                        Why not?! Cuz I’m shorter than 
                        you?! Cuz I’m not “cool”? Cuz I’m 
                        ASIAN?!

           Matt scoffs and shakes his head.

                                 MATT
                        Man, that’s weak!

                                 CHANG
                        Why can’t you just let me win for 
                        once?! Why do you always have to 
                        have it all! I know WHY. Because 
                        you’re an insecure, privileged, 
                        overrated jerk! You hate that 
                        someone like me can be cooler than 
                        you. You hate that I have more 
                        followers than you ever did. You 
                        think you’re all that? You’re not 
                        even that good at basketball. 
                        You’re not even RANKED!

           This one hits Matt different.

                                 MATT
                             (laughs)
                        You wish you were me. You’re so 
                        desperate to be me you had to trick 
                        everyone into even liking you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        You’ll never dunk you lying ass 
                        poser.

           Chang leaps up and spears Matt. They go flying onto the 
           court. They roll around, a mess of fists and limbs.  

                                 CHANG
                        I CAN DUNK!

                                 MATT
                        NO YOU CAN’T!

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

           Chen, worried, lost and still in scrubs, roams the school 
           hallway. She finally arrives. The Principal’s office.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Chen enters. The Principal sits behind her desk, a stern look 
           on her face. Across from her, separated on two sides are 
           Chang and Matt and his parents. Mr. and Mrs. O’Neil do not 
           look happy at all.. 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Mrs. Chang. Hi.

                                 CHEN
                        Hello. I’m sorry I am late.

           Chen looks at Chang, who has a black eye then at Matt, who is 
           similarly dinged up. She looks back at Chang.

                                 CHEN (CONT'D)
                             (in Chinese)
                        What did you do?!

                                 CHANG
                             (in Chinese)
                        What did I do?!

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Mrs. Chang. Please have a seat.

           Chen sits and glares at Chang.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        So your son got into a fight today 
                        with Matt during gym class. 
                        Apparently it was about social 
                        media, which is unfortunately very 
                        common.
                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        Common?! My son had his head shaved 
                        and was forced to strip! NAKED. In 
                        front of the whole school! 

                                 MR. O’NEIL
                        There’s even video. 

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        FROM EVERY ANGLE.

                                 MR. O’NEIL
                        This could affect his college 
                        recruitment.

                                 MRS. O’NEIL
                        He could have PTSD!

                                 MATT
                        Mom, that’s a bit -- 

                                 MR. O’NEIL
                        No one asked you! Now we don’t want 
                        to get the lawyers involved but we 
                        will if we need to.

           Chen whips around, her eyes piercing through Chang’s soul.

                                 CHEN
                        Is this true? 

                                 CHANG
                        It was a bet. If I lost, I would 
                        have had to do the same! 

                                 MATT
                        You did lose!

                                 CHANG
                        Says you!

           Chen leers at Chang with vengeful eyes.

                                 CHEN
                             (in Chinese)
                        How can you act like this? Tell 
                        them you are sorry right now!

                                 CHANG
                             (in Chinese)
                        Why are you automatically taking 
                        their side?!
           Mother and son bicker in Chinese. The O’Neils and the 
           Principal observe cluelessly for a beat. Chen faces the 
           O’Neils, her hands together as if she is praying for mercy.

                                 CHEN
                        Please. I am begging you. This is 
                        my fault. I don’t raise my son 
                        properly. We will do whatever you 
                        want.

                                 CHANG
                        Oh my god!

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Mrs. Chang. Look, we already 
                        discussed a solution okay? Matt and 
                        Chang are gonna be suspended for a 
                        week each. Chang has to take down 
                        his Vlog. In addition, Matt has 
                        asked that Chang make an apology 
                        video. If all that happens, we end 
                        this right there okay? 

                                 CHEN
                             (confused)
                        Vlog?

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Yes, about the dunking.

                                 CHEN
                        Dunking?

           Chen is utterly baffled. She has no idea.

           INT. CHANG'S MINIVAN - LATER

           The car pulls up to a strip mall parking lot. It parks in 
           front of Devin’s AT&T store. Chang pleads with his Mom.

                                 CHANG
                        Please, don’t do this! Mom!

           Chen ignores him and jumps out the car.

           INT. AT&T STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Devin is closing on yet another sale. Chen barges in, a 
           desperate Chang in tow.  

                                 CHEN
                        Are you Devin?
                                 DEVIN
                        Yes Ma’am, can I --?

                                 CHEN
                        Why you trick my son and get him in 
                        trouble?

                                 CHANG
                        Mom! That’s not what he did!

                                 DEVIN
                        I think you have the wrong 
                        impression. I was helping your son 
                        with something that he was 
                        passionate about. 

                                 CHEN
                        No! You use him for your youtube 
                        videos! Get himself in trouble! 
                        Fight other kids!

           Chang is on the verge of tears.

                                 CHANG
                        That’s not what he did! It was my 
                        choice! He just wants to help me!

                                 CHEN
                        If he help you then why he take 
                        your money? 

                                 CHANG
                        Mom! That’s --

                                 DEVIN
                             (to Chang)
                        It’s okay man. Listen to your Mom. 
                             (to Chen)
                        Ma’am I’m sorry. I was trying to 
                        help your son. He’s a good kid.

                                 CHEN
                        You make him a liar and a cheater!  

           Devin looks at Chang, unsure of what Chen means. Chang’s face 
           says it all. It clicks. Devin is disappointed.

                                 DEVIN
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 CHEN
                        You stay away from my son!
                                 DEVIN
                        I will.

           Chen drags a broken Chang out of the store. 

           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - LATER

           An exhausted Chen and Chang sit at the kitchen table. Chen 
           rubs her tired eyes. Chang stares off into space.

                                 CHEN
                             (in Chinese)
                        What did I do wrong for you to be 
                        like this?

                                 CHANG
                        Nothing Mom. I’m just a screw up.

                                 CHEN
                        I thought Matt is your friend? Why 
                        you fight him?

                                 CHANG
                        He’s not my friend. We haven’t been 
                        friends since elementary school

                                 CHEN
                        Why? What happen?

                                 CHANG
                        You wouldn’t understand. 

           Chen’s brow furrows into a familiar expression.

                                 CHEN
                        Why you treat me like this? You 
                        listen to a stranger but you don’t 
                        even want to talk to your own 
                        mother huh? Your Mom is so useless?

           Chang shakes his head quietly. 

                                 CHEN (CONT'D)
                        I want to understand. Help me.

           Chang takes a long beat. Finally...

                                 CHANG
                        You’re always upset about 
                        something. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        I can’t tell you anything because I 
                        don’t know if you’ll snap at me or 
                        tell me it’s stupid. I want to tell 
                        you stuff, ask you things, but I 
                        can’t.

                                 CHEN
                        Why?

           A flood of emotion crashes over Chang. The floodgates are 
           open.

                                 CHANG
                        Because I’m scared of you!

           Chang’s words smack Chen across the face, pushing her back 
           against her seat. She can see he’s being honest. Desperate to 
           fend off the pain of her son’s words, she leans back on her 
           primary method of defense. Anger.

                                 CHEN
                        You’re scared of me? You don’t know 
                        scared! My mother beat me! When I 
                        do something bad, she say I can’t 
                        eat! 
                             (furious)
                        You scared of me? I give everything 
                        to you! I spoil YOU! 

           Chang fights off tears. He stands to leave. Chen grabs his 
           arm. 

                                 CHEN (CONT'D)
                        Maybe you want another mother, but 
                        you can’t! I am your mother! 

           Chang yanks his arm free, too strong for her to control 
           anymore.

                                 CHANG
                        I wish you weren’t! You’re never 
                        happy. You’re always miserable! 
                        That’s probably why Dad left. 
                        That’s why you’re always alone! 

           Chang grabs the car keys and storms out.

           EXT. CHANG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Chang starts up the car and backs out. Chen runs out of the 
           house.
                                 CHEN
                             (in Chinese)
                        Lan Lan! Get back here now!

           Chang ignores her, tears running down his face.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Chang sits in his car, in the dark. His phone buzzes, another 
           call from his Mom. He ignores it. He looks in the mirror, 
           checking that his eyes are no longer red from crying.

           He takes a deep breath and gets out. 

           INT. LI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The chime of a doorbell interrupts the squeal of kids, a 
           barking dog and a computer blaring the catchy riff of the 
           latest dance craze.  

           MARY (7), Chinese-American with dimples and a pony tail runs 
           to the answer the front door. She opens it to reveal, a 
           reticent Chang.

                                 MARY
                        Who are you?

           Chang looks down her quizzically, surprised by her existence.

                                 CHANG
                        I...

           LI (50), Chinese-American, with a rough, macho aura, saunters 
           in wearing a wife-beater and Lakers shorts. Chang locks eyes 
           with his father. It takes Li a moment, but he recognizes his 
           son.

                                 LI
                             (in Chinese)
                        Lan Lan? What are you doing here?

           Li’s reaction is one of bemused surprise, one more befitting 
           of seeing a past coworker. Chang doesn’t know what to say.

                                 LI (CONT'D)
                        Come in. Come in. We are just about 
                        to have dinner. 

           Chang enters. He looks around the quaint unfamiliar house, 
           focusing on the photos hanging on the wall. Li with his new 
           wife, daughter Mary and a young son. His half-siblings.  
                                 MARY
                        Who is that Daddy?

                                 LI
                        This is your Uncle Lan Lan. Say 
                        hello. 

                                 MARY
                             (in Chinese)
                        Uncle Lan Lan, hello! I’m Mary.

           Chang smiles as best he can.

                                 CHANG
                        Hi. Mary.

           As they enter the kitchen, Li picks up JOHNNY (5), energetic 
           kid with a mischievous grin.  

                                 LI
                        Johnny, say hello to your cousin.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Hi.

           Chang waves. COCO (40), bubbly and a more recent immigrant, 
           finishes cooking dinner. 

                                 LI
                             (in Chinese)
                        Coco, we have a guest.
                             (to Chang)
                        This is my wife Coco.

                                 CHANG
                        Hi.

                                 COCO
                             (thick accent)
                        Hi, nice to meet you. 

           Coco smiles warmly. Chang smiles back, awkward. 

           INT. LI’S DINING ROOM - LATER

           The table is full of yummy Chinese dishes. With their 
           chopsticks, Johnny and Mary fight over their favorite dishes. 
           Chang chews his food quietly while Li pontificates to the 
           table.

                                 LI
                             (in Chinese)
                        ...I could if I wanted to! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LI (CONT'D)
                                 LI (CONT'D)
                        My boss is stupid. If I was him, 
                        the company would do much better. 
                        He knows this, that’s why he never 
                        promotes me. 

                                 COCO
                        Mmm. How can this idiot be the 
                        boss.

                                 LI
                        Exactly.

           Li turns his attention to Chang. 

                                 LI (CONT'D)
                        So, how’s school? You have a good 
                        GPA?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah.

                                 LI
                        That’s good!
                             (to Coco)
                        He was smart ever since he was a 
                        little kid. He could read when he 
                        was 2. He loved to read.

                                 COCO
                        Smart and handsome. He must have 
                        many girls who like him.

           Coco and Li chuckle. Li pats Chang on the back.

                                 LI
                        Of course he does. Mary and Johnny 
                        are very smart too. They even know 
                        some Chinese poems.
                             (to Mary, Johnny)
                        Mary, Johnny recite for Uncle the 
                        poem you learned.

           Johnny and Mary stop eating, eager to perform.

                                 MARY AND JOHNNY
                             (in Chinese, loudly)
                        Moonlight reflects off the front of  
                        my bed; Could it actually be the 
                        frost on the ground? I look up to 
                        view the bright moon; And look down 
                        to reminisce about my hometown!

           Coco and Li clap loudly, as Mary and Johnny beam. Chang can 
           only smile and nod.
           INT. LI’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Li and Chang sit and watch a basketball game on TV. Li 
           follows enthusiastically, a true fan. Chang is subdued.

                                 LI
                        Hey. Was the new section of the 
                        house ever finished? 

                                 CHANG
                        No. Why?

                                 LI
                        Oh, nothing. I was hoping you might 
                        know a good contractor. 

                                 CHANG
                        I don’t. 

           Li goes back to his game. 

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        I should go.

                                 LI
                        Huh?

                                 CHANG
                        Thanks for dinner.

           Chang gets up and walks out.

           INT. CHANG’S MINIVAN - LATER

           Chang drives in silence. It starts to lightly snow. He stops 
           at a traffic light. His eyes wander until they stop on 
           something in the distance. An empty park with a basketball 
           hoop.

           EXT. CHANG’S ROOM - LATER

           Chang enters in complete darkness. He opens his closet and 
           fumbles around. Finally he retrieves what he is looking for: 
           a basketball. He hustles quickly out as a light from Chen’s 
           room turns on. 

           EXT. PARK COURTS - LATER

           It’s still snowing. There’s a light coat of snow on the 
           grass, but the asphalt court is still warm, melting the snow 
           on impact.
           Chang approaches, a resolute look on his face. He bounces up 
           and down, warming himself up, his breath clouding the air 
           around him. He breathes deep to collect himself.

           He lines up at the elbow and takes off. With two big steps, 
           he leaps, using all of his muscle and technique. It’s a MISS.

           Chang lines up again. He recites Devin’s tips to himself. 
           Explode from the hips, jump through your core, grip tight but 
           not too tight...He runs, leaps and...another MISS.

           He lines up again. MISS. Again. MISS. He slams the ball onto 
           court, splashing slush everywhere. He wipes the ball and 
           lines up again. And...MISS. 

           Desperation begins to creep in. MISS again. Chang’s hands are 
           red from the cold, his sneakers wet. He takes off again. 
           Before he can jump, he slips on the wet pavement and falls 
           hard on his butt. He screams at the hoop, at the ball, at 
           Matt, at his Mom, at himself. Still, he stands back up.

           At the edge of the park, a hastily dressed Chen walks up. She 
           watches as her son desperately tries not to fail. It breaks 
           her heart.

           INT. CHANG'S HOUSE - LATER

           A shivering Chang, wrapped in a blanket, sips on a hot soup. 
           His eyes are blank and expressionless. Across from him is 
           Chen, her face full of helpless worry.

                                 CHANG
                        I’m sorry. I should have been 
                        honest with you.  

                                 CHEN
                        It’s okay. I know deep down you are 
                        a good boy.

           She caresses her son’s hair.

                                 CHANG
                        You were right. I should have 
                        listened to you from the beginning. 
                        Then I wouldn’t be in this 
                        situation. From now on, I’m going 
                        to do what you tell me, okay?  

           Chang looks up at Chen, a defeated, tired look on his face. 
           Emotions well up from deep within Chen. 

                                 CHEN
                        I love you okay?
                                 CHANG
                        I love you too.

           This is not what she wanted from her son. She has no words so 
           she pulls Chang close. They embrace.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHANG’S VLOG: THE APOLOGY

           It’s day. Chang sits remorsefully in front of his webcam in 
           typical “apology video” style. He looks like he’s had the air 
           sucked out of him.

                                 CHANG
                        This is going to be my last vlog. 
                        As a lot of you know, someone 
                        accused me of cheating on my dunk. 
                        I’m here to say...that’s it’s true. 
                        I trained really, really hard but I 
                        was still short so I lowered the 
                        rim by an inch or so.
                             (long shameful beat)
                        I should have just admitted to 
                        losing the bet and taken the L. But 
                        for some reason, I just couldn’t. 
                        Maybe I never really cared about 
                        dunking. Maybe what I really wanted 
                        was for people to think that I 
                        could. That’s not cool.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry I let down everyone who 
                        has been following me. I’m sorry to 
                        Matt for cheating the bet. 
                             (soul-crushing beat)
                        And I am especially sorry to all my 
                        friends who really believed in me. 
                        Chang out.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK: 1 WEEK LATER

           EXT. CHANG'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Chang lies in his bed, staring into space. By the wall at his 
           feet, the dusty outline of where Kobe’s poster used to be. A 
           knock at the door.
                                 CHEN (O.S.)
                        Lan Lan. I’m going to work. I made 
                        you some breakfast okay?

                                 CHANG
                        Thanks Mom. Have a good day.

           Chen takes a beat outside Chang’s door before moving on. He 
           rolls over to go back to sleep. It’s too late, he’s awake. 
           Frustrated, he rips off the sheets and jumps up.  

           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - A BIT LATER

           Chang eats breakfast and watches HGTV. He gets a text from 
           Bo.

           Look outside.

           Chang walks to the front door and opens it.  The sun blinds 
           him momentarily. Standing on the street are Bo and Kristy.

           EXT. CHANG’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Chang walks over, looking disheveled.

                                 CHANG
                        Hey.

                                 KRISTY
                        You look terrible.

                                 CHANG
                        It’s called depression.

           Chang, on max sulk. Kristy tries to push down a laugh. She 
           fails. Bo smiles. And then, Chang too.

                                 CHANG (CONT'D)
                        What do you guys want?

                                 KRISTY
                        You’re not suspended anymore, why 
                        aren’t you at school?

                                 CHANG
                        I’ve retired. My career as a teen 
                        is over. 

                                 KRISTY
                        Oh my god. So extra.
                                 BO
                        C’mon man, the band needs you. We 
                        need you. If you don’t come back, 
                        Matt wins. You can’t let that 
                        douche win. 

                                 CHANG
                        He did win. He always wins. 

                                 KRISTY
                        We miss you dude. Just come back.

           Chang is touched by his friends.

                                 CHANG
                        I miss you guys too. I’ll be back, 
                        I promise.

           Kristy nods and gives Chang a hug. Bo and Chang do their 
           secret handshake.

                                 KRISTY
                        See ya.

                                 CHANG
                        See you.

           Bo takes a USB drive out of his pocket. He hands it to Chang. 

                                 BO
                        See ya.

           Bo and Kristy walk away. Chang turns the USB stick over. On 
           the other side it reads: W.W.K.D.? Chang sticks it in his 
           pocket. Not yet ready to look at it.

           INT. TOM'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Tom lies quietly in bed, his eyes closed. He has passed. A 
           doctor notes the time. Before he’s taken away, Klaus leans 
           over and whispers in Tom’s ear before kissing him on his 
           forehead.  

           Chen observes solemnly from the foot of the bed.

           INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - LATER

           Klaus and Chen sit and have a quiet coffee together.
                                 KLAUS
                        We were stationed together near 
                        Seoul, I was a pilot in the navy 
                        and he was a communications 
                        specialist in the Army. Can you 
                        imagine? Tom, a soldier?

                                 CHEN
                             (chuckling)
                        No.

                                 KLAUS
                        We kept in touch afterwards. He was 
                        married for a while. 

                                 CHEN
                        How about you?

           Klaus shakes his head. 

                                 KLAUS
                        One day, Tom calls me and asks me 
                        where I am because he’s going to 
                        visit me.

                                 CHEN
                        And then he don’t leave.

                                 KLAUS
                             (smiles)
                        And then he didn’t leave.

                                 CHEN
                        That’s why you two are a match. You 
                        are tough but he is even more 
                        stubborn.

                                 KLAUS
                        He did always get what he wanted.

                                 CHEN
                        That’s why he so happy. No regrets.

           Klaus smiles in agreement. 

                                 CHEN (CONT'D)
                        I envy him.

           Chen’s thoughts drift. Klaus reads it.

                                 KLAUS
                        You know Tom used to say something 
                        to me all the time. “Klaus, you’re 
                        so grumpy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KLAUS (CONT'D)
                                 KLAUS (CONT'D)
                        You should smile more.” And I would 
                        say back, “what’s there to smile 
                        about?” And then he would say, 
                        “well you won’t know unless you’re 
                        smiling.”

           Klaus looks at Chen. She nods, understanding his message.

           INT. CHANG’S HOUSE - DAY

           Chang watches TV and eating snacks. The front door opens. 
           Chang springs up, trying to clean up his mess. Chen comes in. 

                                 CHANG
                        Hey. You’re home so...early.

                                 CHEN
                        I took the rest of the day off.

           Chen looks around.

                                 CHANG
                        Sorry, I know it’s a mess.

                                 CHEN
                        Don’t worry. Get dressed. I want to 
                        take you some place.

           Chang is a bit hesitant.

                                 CHEN (CONT'D)
                        C’mon hurry up!

           Chen grins excitedly. Chang loosens up, he runs up to his 
           room.

           EXT. PRIVATE AIRFIELD - LATER

           Chang and Chen approach the small landing field as small 
           propeller planes buzz overhead. Chang looks out the window in 
           excited wonder. 

           EXT. RUNWAY - A BIT LATER

           Klaus, dressed in his old pilot jacket and rocking classic 
           aviators, is completing final prep for his 4 person prop 
           plane. Chen and Chang approach. Chang, excited; Chen, 
           mortified. 
                                 KLAUS
                        Ah! My passengers have finally 
                        arrived.

                                 CHANG
                        This is yours!?

                                 KLAUS
                        Yeah. Name’s Ellie, after my 
                        mother.

                                 CHANG
                        She’s beautiful.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry about Tom.

           Klaus smiles warmly.

                                 KLAUS
                        He told me he’d haunt me if I 
                        didn’t take you and your mom up.

           Chris grins. Klaus looks up at Chen.

                                 KLAUS (CONT'D)
                        Ready?

                                 CHEN
                             (not ready)
                        No. Too small! How can fly?

                                                                CUT TO:

           FLYING WITH KLAUS MONTAGE

           - Chang and Klaus sit up front, Chen in the back. The plane 
           roars alive.

           - It taxis to the runway, where Klaus tells Chang to clear 
           them for takeoff

           - The plane takes off, bouncing off the runway. Chen holds on 
           for dear life. Chang is loving it.

           - They reach cruising altitude. Klaus points out points of 
           interest as Chang and Chen look out, enjoying the waves of 
           green forest, rolling over the round Appalachian mountains.  

           - The sun begins to set in the horizon, casting an amber glow 
           on all that they can see. It’s beautiful beyond words. 
           Chang looks over his shoulder and gives Chen a thumbs up. She 
           grabs his hand and gives it a squeeze.

           INT. DINER - LATER

           Chang, Chen and Klaus enjoy a meal. They recount their 
           flight, especially how nervous Chen was. They laugh happily 
           together.

                                 KLAUS
                        Excuse me for a second, I’ve 
                        laughed too hard.

           Klaus gets up and heads for the restroom. Chang looks up at 
           his Mom.

                                 CHANG
                        This was really fun Mom. 

                                 CHEN
                        For you maybe! Me, I’m so scared! 

                                 CHANG
                        I know.
                             (beat)
                        I appreciate it.

           Mother and son look at each other, a new connection and 
           understanding between them.

                                 CHEN
                        I’m trying.

           Chang nods.

           INT. CHANG’S ROOM - LATER

           Chang finishes cleaning his room. It feels like it’s almost a 
           clean slate. Sitting on his desk is Bo’s USB stick. It’s 
           contents still a mystery. Chang plugs it in. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHANG’S HIGHLIGHT REEL

           The video cuts into the first clips of the Can Chang Dunk 
           Vlog. Devin walking up to Chang’s house at 5am. Chang being 
           late. Chang giving his weak intro. 
                                 CHANG
                        Hi, I’m Chang. I’m 16. 5 foot 8 
                        inches. And I, uh, I’m trying to 
                        dunk a basketball. Hopefully.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHANG'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Chang cringes. The video continues, skipping through funny 
           moments and important milestones. Frustrations and victories. 
           Growth. Condensed in this quick montage, we truly see how far 
           Chang has come. His vertical, his muscles, his confidence. 
           His very being. As he watches, a new determination begins to 
           burn in his eyes. 

           INT. AT&T STORE - DAY

           Devin, now a manager, says goodbye to a satisfied customer 
           with his sales trainee (17), KEITH. 

                                 DEVIN
                        You saw how I hit that at the 
                        buzzer.

                                 SALES TRAINEE
                        Yeah cuz I set you up with that 
                        alley-oop.

                                 DEVIN
                        You right. You right.

           They gas each other up some more. The door opens and they 
           return to professional mode. Devin turns. It’s Chang.

                                 DEVIN (CONT'D)
                        Aw snap. 

                                 CHANG
                        Thanks for uploading the video. 
                        Hope all the controversy didn’t 
                        kill your channel. 

                                 DEVIN
                        Eh. You can’t make money on Youtube 
                        anyway. TikTok is where it’s at.

                                 CHANG
                        Still...My bad.
                                 DEVIN
                        You owned up to it. That’s the 
                        important thing. You good?

                                 CHANG
                        Yeah. 

                                 DEVIN
                        What’s up then? You got no money so 
                        I know you ain’t here for a new 
                        phone. 

           Chang stands tall, with a new assuredness. 

                                 CHANG
                        I’m not gonna stop. And I could use 
                        some help.

                                 DEVIN
                        Oh word?

           The two grin.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHANG’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Chang pulls a long cardboard tube from his closet. Rolled up 
           inside, aged and crusty is a familiar Kobe poster. He pulls 
           it taught and looks upon it, a hint of sadness in his eyes. 

                                 CHANG
                        I miss you man.

           Sadness gives way to a look of fierce determination. He puts 
           the poster back on the wall.

           CHANG TRAINS MONTAGE

           - Chang shaves his head in his bathroom. 

           - Devin and Chang at playground courts. Devin puts Chang 
           through some dribbling drills. Between the legs, behind the 
           back, one ball, two balls. Faster. Faster! FASTER!

           - Chang returns to school. People still leer at him, but he 
           ignores them. Bo and Kristy are happy he’s back. He sees Matt 
           and his friends in the hallway, but he doesn’t avoid them. He 
           walks past, chin up. 

           - Chang and Devin work on his shooting form. Bo shoots a Tik 
           Tok of them while they work.  
           - Chang shoots by himself. The court lights turn off, but he 
           keeps going.

           - The Marching Band celebrates on a bus, having just won a 
           competition. Bo, Kristy and Chang play drums in the back as 
           another member dances with a trophy. Chang and Kristy lock 
           eyes. The chemistry still intact.

           - Chang hitting weights. He screams as he hits a new personal 
           best on deadlift. 

           - Chang watches HGTV with his Mom. Both of them exhausted, 
           downing snacks.

           - A bulletin is tacked up outside the gym. It’s a try-out 
           sheet for the Boy’s Basketball Team. It’s already overfilled 
           with names. Chang reaches up and writes his name down. Chang.

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

           Sneakers squeak and balls pound on the hardwood. Scores of 
           hopeful boys run drills and scrimmages. Among them, a sweaty 
           Chang. 

           The coach calls everyone to sit. He sets up a shooting drill. 
           It’s a one v. one drill.

                                 COACH
                        Alright let’s do Matt and uh, you.

           He points at Chang. Chang lines up next to Matt as Coach 
           beings to explain the drill. The two avoid looking at each 
           other for a beat before Chang turns to Matt.

                                 CHANG
                        Bet you I hit more shots than you.

           A smile curls up on Matt’s face. A small gesture of respect.

                                 MATT
                        I’ll take that bet.

                                 COACH
                        Okay here we go.

           WHISTLE. Chang and Matt zoom off.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK: TWO MONTHS LATER
           EXT. CHANG’S HOUSE - DAY

           The area around the unfinished wing of the house has been 
           cleared up. Within it’s unlaid foundation, a thriving garden 
           has been planted with flowers and vegetables. 

           Chen, hacks at the soil, tending to her crop. Chang walks 
           over carrying a duffel bag. Chen looks at her watch 

                                 CHEN
                        Going already?

                                 CHANG
                        It doesn’t hurt to be early right?
                             (beat)
                        Okay maybe it’s too early.

           Chen laughs and shakes her head at her goofy son.

                                 CHEN
                        Come help me.

           Chang puts down his bag and hops over.

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - LATER

           It’s a home basketball game for the MOUNT DAVIS MOUNTAINEERS. 
           They’re destroying their opponent by 30 points. Matt is in 
           the game. He cuts through five defenders and slams it. The 
           home team bench erupts. At the end of the bench, still in 
           warmups, Chang. 

           ON BLEACHERS

           Chen sits with Bo, Kristy and Devin in the bleachers. Kristy 
           stands up.

                                 KRISTY
                        PUT IN CHANG!

           People turn and look. An embarrassed Chang looks and waves 
           her to stop. Bo jumps up. 

                                 BO
                        We want Chang! 

                                 DEVIN
                        We want Chang!

                                 BO, DEVIN, KRISTY
                        We want Chang! We want Chang! We 
                        want Chang! 
           Kristy tries to get a shy Chen to join them. They laugh as 
           Chang shakes his head. 

           ON BENCH

           The opposing team calls a timeout. Coach makes subs. He calls 
           down the bench

                                 COACH
                        Alright. Jimmy, Steve you’re in.

           Jimmy and Steve rip off their warmups and run on court.

                                 COACH (CONT'D)
                        ...and uh, Bernard you too.

           The team looks at each other. Bernard? Matt sits and elbows 
           an oblivious Chang.

                                 MATT
                        Yo Chang, coach says you’re in.

                                 COACH
                        Bernard! You wanna play or what?!

           Chang hops up and rips off his warmups. He rubs his clammy 
           palms on his shorts and runs on court.

           ON BLEACHERS

           The Chang gang jump up in exuberant celebration. The game 
           starts up. They start to chant. 

                                 CHANG GANG
                        Chang. Chang! CHANG! CHANG!

           The ball swings around. Finally Chang gets it. He makes a 
           move and immediately loses the ball. He fouls to stop play.

                                 CHANG GANG (CONT'D)
                        Ohhhhhhh.

           Chang shakes his head, angry at himself.

                                 DEVIN
                        Hey! Keep ya head up!

           Chang looks up and nods. His eyes drift to his Mom. She nods, 
           encouraging him. He nods back. Play resumes. Chang is 
           focused, sharp. He hounds his man on defense. Relentless. The 
           other team gets flustered and makes a bad pass. Chang steals 
           it at the top of the key.
           He sprints downcourt all alone. Bo, Kristy, Devin and finally 
           Chen all stand up. Matt and the home team get off the bench. 
           Chang streaks towards the hoop, full head of steam. He takes 
           two big steps and LEAPS, the ball at his fingertips, his arm 
           stretched high as can be. 

           He sails up, up towards that round circle of metal and mesh, 
           invented over a century ago. He flies through the air, 
           graceful, powerful and free... 

                                                                CUT TO:
