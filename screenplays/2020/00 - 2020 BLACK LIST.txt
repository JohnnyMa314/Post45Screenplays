                                                               The Black List
           The  Black  List  was  compiled  from  the  suggestions  of  more  than  375  film  executives,  each  of 
           whom contributed the names of up to ten favorite feature film screenplays that were written in, 
           or are somehow uniquely associated with, 2020 and will not have begun principal photography 
           during this calendar year.

           This year, scripts had to receive at least seven mentions to be included on the Black List.

           All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.

           The Black List apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation identification, 
           and questionable 2020 affiliations.

           It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating:

           The Black List is not a “best of” list. It is, at best, a “most liked” list.
           “But they who speak to the feelings, who enter the soul’s deepest meditations, holding the mirror 
           up to nature, revealing the profoundest mysteries of the heart by the magic power of action and 
           utterance to the eye and ear, will be sure of an audience.”

           When  a  very  fat  and  possibly  gay  boy  from  New  Orleans  is  visited  by  an  angel  called  Barbra

           obese person in America before his demons consume him - if only to make his daddy proud. It’s 
           the true gospel of Richard Simmons.

           whom everyone else sees as a disfigured boy, but whom Annalise sees entirely differently.
