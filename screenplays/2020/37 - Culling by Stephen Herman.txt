           FADE IN:

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - MORNING

           It's dark in here.

           All the windows have been boarded up with thick slats of
           wood. They're crooked. Overlapping. This was done in haste.

           Wind chimes. Softly CLANKING in a breeze. This sound will
           continue for the entire scene.

           There's a large jagged HOLE in the lower part of the FRONT
           DOOR. That hole is our only source of light in here. It's
           daytime outside.

           Snow flurries blow in through it. An inch of snow already
           covers most of the ash and pine floors.

           Speaking of which, some of the floorboards are missing.
           Broken off and splintered.

           Sheets of PAPER flutter on the floor in the breeze.

           CLOSE ON one of them. It's a page from the BIBLE...

           INT. THE CABIN / KITCHEN - MORNING

           Windows are boarded up in here too. This room's even darker.

           But there's a small glow in here. Could be from a cellphone.
           We can't see the source just yet...

           There's an old stove and fridge.

           A dead cellphone on a counter.

           All the cabinets are open. The drawers have been pulled out
           all the way. They're all empty. The silverware is missing.

           There's a small table in a corner...

           SOMEONE sits at this table in the darkness of the room.
           Their back to us. They wear a heavy coat and winter hat.

           A small HANDY-CAM sits in the center of the table. The
           display screen is open. A video plays on it. That's where
           that glow is coming from.

           A small MAHOGANY BOX sits next to the camera.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The box is open and empty. Red velvet compartments. Whatever
           was in here was valuable.

           HANDY CAM DISPLAY SCREEN: We're in the same kitchen looking
           at the same chair that the "Watcher" sits in now. Except on
           the tape, someone else is sitting in this very chair.

           A man (35). Wears a black long sleeved shirt. Disheveled.
           Unshaven. A pair of HANDCUFFS are locked onto his left
           wrist. The other side of the cuffs are still open.

           This is DARYL COLLINS. And he looks like he's been through
           hell. Still going through it in fact.

           Yet... there's resolve in his face - like a prisoner on
           death row who's come to terms with his fate.

           The closed MAHOGANY BOX is on the table in front of him.

           We can't tell if it's day or night but the lights appear to
           be working. When he talks we can see his breath. It's cold
           in here. He takes a while to speak. This is not easy to say.

                        If you've found this tape, it means
                        I'm already dead. For the record, let
                        it be clear that I did not take my
                        own life. It may look that way, but
                        there are reasons for my actions -
                        reasons that I will try to explain
                        now.

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - SAME

           The HEAD OF A DEER in the dark. It's mounted on the upper
           wall. Massive antlers rise above its head like a regal
           crown. It stares at us with black accusing eyes.

                        What you're about to hear may be hard
                        to believe but every word of it is
                        true. This is my story...

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAY  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: We're aiming at a SMALL DEER in the snow as
           it nibbles on some branches.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A WOMAN'S VOICE whispers close to our ear. 

                                 ERIN (O.S.)
                        The deer has tunnel vision. All it
                        sees is a meal. It's not paying
                        attention to what's happening around
                        it. Makes it an easy kill.

           Reveal DARYL (12), holding the hunting rifle. One eye in the 
           scope. Heavy concentration on his face. He lays on his
           stomach in the snowy grass in his hunting gear.

           Lying next to him is ERIN (40s), his mother. In hunting gear
           as well. She's tough. A woman of the woods. Intense eyes,
           and right now they're locked on Daryl.

                                 ERIN
                        What are you, Daryl? The hunter or
                        the deer?

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        The hunter.

                                 ERIN
                        Really? Then tell me what you see.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        The deer.

                                 ERIN
                        And what else?

           He stays quiet. Not sure sure where she's going with this.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        You have tunnel vision too. All you
                        see is the deer - your meal.

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: She's right. The deer is all we see in the
           scope. Nothing else beyond the circle of the cross-hairs.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        Pay attention to what's going on
                        around you.

           He lowers the rifle and sees Erin is staring behind him now.
           He turns to see what she's looking at...

           ANOTHER DEER

           This one is much, MUCH bigger. A good 30-feet away. Its head
           peeking out of the bushes, watching them with SOLID BLACK
           EYES. They shimmer through the THICK FOG of the woods.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The deer stands eerily still. ANTLERS rising high over its
           head like gnarled fingers. Its presence is threatening.

           Daryl stares back, uneasy. Erin slowly takes the rifle from
           his hands.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                               (
                                whispering
                                          )
                        The world is much bigger than what
                        you see in the scope.

           The BIG DEER remains as still as taxidermy. Erin carefully
           raises the rifle to her eye... readies the trigger --

                                                            CUT TO:

           --BAM-- Birds take off from the TREE TOPS at the sound of
           the gunshot. It echoes through the dense foggy woods.

                                                      CUT TO: LATER

           Erin and Daryl move stealthily through the woods, their eyes
           on the ground. They're following CLOVEN-HOOVED PRINTS - the
           tracks the BIG DEER left in the snow.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        I know I hit the damn thing. No way I
                        missed from that close.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        But where's the blood?

           He's right. There's no blood in the snow. Just those hooved
           prints. They follow the prints into a small CLEARING... all
           the way to the base of a tall tree.

           Erin, confused. Circles the tree. There are no prints
           anywhere else around it.

                                 DARYL
                        Where did it go, Mom?

           Erin doesn't have an answer. They both look up the tall tree
           to the dark branches above. Swaying in the cold wind.

                                                      CUT TO: LATER

           They walk home through the WOODS. Daryl leads the way, rifle
           on his shoulder. Erin lags behind, watching her son.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        I didn't know they could grow that
                        big.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Now we're FOLLOWING DARYL from behind as he walks ahead. We
           creep closer. 12-feet away. Our steps CRUNCHING in the snow.

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        What about you?

           6-feet away from him now... CRUNCHING closer...

                                 DARYL (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Have you ever seen one that size?

           3-feet away from his back now. A branch SNAPS on the ground
           behind Daryl. He turns at the sound...

           And sees Erin is no longer there. He's alone.

                                 DARYL
                        Mom?

                                                      MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl walks back, searching for his mother. He reaches the
           same clearing from earlier and sees...

           Erin at the base of that same tree. Her neck is craned all
           the way back. Just staring up at the branches above her. Her
           lips are moving. It looks like she's talking to someone.

           But there's nothing in the tree. Just dark branches above.

           Daryl stays quiet. Watches his mother, concern growing.

           TITLE CARD:            THE CULLING

           EXT. ST. ANGELA CHURCH - MORNING

           Winter. A light snow on the ground.

           A modest church in a low income New York neighborhood. A
           HEARSE is parked out front. Mourners in black enter the
           church.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (PRE-LAP)
                        Anyone who knew Father Liam knew he
                        had a way with words.

           INT. ST. ANGELA CHURCH - MORNING

           A FUNERAL SERVICE. The pews are pretty packed.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A CLOSED CASKET on the pulpit. Next to it is a large framed
           photo of a priest. The man we've all gathered here for
           today. FATHER LIAM (70s). His face is stern and studious.

           FATHER CURTIS (50s). A softer face, speaks from the pulpit.

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        He always had advice to give you,
                        whether you asked for it or not.
                               (
                                polite laughter from
                                the pews)
                        I recall once he told me that there
                        are only three times in your life
                        that the Lord picks up the phone to
                        personally call you. The first call
                        is to wake you up - the day you are
                        given the marvelous gift of life. The
                        third call is the call to come home
                        and join Him in His kingdom...
                               (
                                                  )
                                gestures to casket
                        ... A call that Father Liam has
                        recently received. But it is the
                        second call that is the most
                        important - the call to action. Our
                        vocation.

           The first pew is filled with PRIESTS. Everyone wears the
           signature WHITE CLERICAL COLLARS except for one man. He
           wears a suit. Clean shaven, solemn. This is DARYL (35), all
           grown up now.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (O.S.)
                        Out of the three it's the only call
                        we have the choice of whether or not
                        to answer. Do some of you in this
                        room hear it ringing? Are you afraid
                        to pick up?

           Father Curtis's words begin to trail off as WE STAY on
           Daryl. His eyes on the verge of tears.

           EXT. ST. ANGELA CHURCH - DAY

           PALLBEARERS push the casket into the back of the hearse and
           close the backdoor. The hearse drives away.

           A procession of cars follow. Mourners disperse.
           INT. ST. ANGELA CHURCH - DAY

           The church is empty and quiet now. Life-like statues of
           saints line the walls. They feel eerily similar to the
           taxidermy on the walls of the Cabin.

           WE PUSH in on the CONFESSIONAL BOOTHS at the back.

           INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Daryl sits in the darkness of one of the booths. His head
           low. The tears he was holding in are finally coming out.

           Someone knocks on the DIVIDER in the next booth. He sits up
           quick. Stays still.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Hello? Father, is that you?

           Daryl remains quiet.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        I heard you in here. I... I just need
                        to talk to someone. Are you a priest?

           Her voice is strained with emotion. He can clearly hear that
           she is going through something as well.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Hello?

           Daryl waits. Hoping the woman will leave.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                               (
                                emotional
                                         )
                        I don't hear Him anymore. His voice.
                        I used to hear it when I prayed but
                        now... nothing. It's quiet. I...

           She sobs to herself. Daryl listens to her crying. Wipes away
           his own tears, then slides open the divider. Now we can see
           the woman but her face is obscured by the MESH.

                                 DARYL
                        And not hearing His voice - has it
                        affected other aspects of your life?
                        How are those things at home?

                               (

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        I'm much better now. Still... I miss
                        hearing His voice. I don't know,
                        Father. Am I doing something wrong?

           Daryl takes a moment to consider his words.

                                 DARYL
                        When I first started coming to this
                        church, I didn't know this part of
                        the city well. I'd constantly get
                        lost. It was so bad I ended up
                        getting a GPS for the car. Five years
                        later, I still have it. Not that I
                        need it anymore, I know my way around
                        now. Still, I keep it on whenever I
                        drive.
                               (
                                making sense of it
                                all)
                        It's always nice to hear a familiar
                        voice steering you in the right
                        direction. But to me, it sounds like
                        you already know your way, sister.
                        Maybe not hearing Him means you're on
                        the right track. I'm sure you'll hear
                        Him if you ever get lost again.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        And if not, come back and I'll give
                        you my GPS.

           She laughs a little. The weight lifted from her voice. We
           can hear her smile.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        God bless you, father. Thank you.

           She leaves her booth. Daryl listens to her go.

                                 FEMALE GPS (PRE-LAP)
                        In 300 feet you will reach your
                        destination.

           EXT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER

           A modest two-story house on the outskirts of the city. It's
           a bit secluded. The neighbors are not that close.

           A black weather worn SUV parks on the grassy area in front.
           Daryl gets out. He's still wearing his suit.

           He joins the crowd of MOURNERS entering the house.
           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The post-funeral gathering. Boutiques and sympathy cards on
           tables. Mourners talk quietly among each other.

           Daryl quietly sneaks away. Heads down a hallway.

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / STUDY - DAY - LATER

           Daryl opens the door and steps into the room.

           On one wall is a massive bookshelf filled with old books.

           An old RECORD PLAYER sits on a shelf. Its cover is open.

           A writing desk littered with open books and papers.

           Daryl moves to the desk. There's a framed photo on the desk
           of Father Liam and a black and brown GERMAN SHEPARD.

           He picks up a book from the desk. Turns it over to see the
           cover. His face darkens.

           A pentagram symbol is on the cover.

           He turns all the other books over. They all deal with ANGELS
           and DEMONOLOGY. Sketches of odd symbols. All the papers are
           covered with handwritten notes and post-its. 

           Apparently some very dark research was going on here.

           Daryl's gaze moves back to the record player on the shelf.
           The open cover. Record on top. Just waiting to be played.

           He heads to it. An un-labeled LP sits on it. We get the
           sense that what's on it is important. He turns it on.

           The room seems to grow quieter as the LP starts to spin. The
           needle begins it's slow decent to the grooves...

           It's just about to connect when-- A KNOCK at the door.

           Startles Daryl. He stops the record. Turns to see...

           Father Curtis entering. He approaches Daryl with a somber
           smile. They shake hands.

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        Daryl. Just the man I wanted to see.

                        Father Curtis. Thank you for the
                        lovely service today. What a touching
                        message.

                        Will we be seeing you back in your
                        collar anytime soon?

           This is a sore topic for Daryl.

                                 DARYL
                        There's still some things I need to
                        figure out first...

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        I hear you moved back upstate?

                                 DARYL
                        Not far. Just a three hour drive. My
                        mother's old cabin. It's where I grew
                        up.

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        Ah, I see. Getting in touch with your
                        roots again. The beginning is always
                        a good place to start.

           Father Curtis squeezes Daryl's shoulder.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (cont'd)
                        You belong behind the pulpit, not the
                        pew. But take as long as you need.
                        I'll be praying for you.

           Daryl looks back to the photo of Liam and the dog.

                                 DARYL
                        What happened to Parker?

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        Who?

                        His dog.

                        They brought him to the shelter I
                        believe. A couple days ago.
                               (
                                shakes his head

                        Poor thing. A neighbor heard him
                        barking for three days straight. When
                        they came over to check on him they
                        found Father Liam instead...

           Father Curtis's gaze moves across the books on the desk. His
           face darkens as well.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (cont'd)
                        When was the last time you two spoke?

                                 DARYL
                        Over a year ago.

                        I turned my phone off for a bit. Just
                        needed to unplug.

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        I see.

                                 DARYL
                        He was trying to reach me.

                                a little too fast

                                                 )
                        Did he leave a message? Say anything?

                                 DARYL
                        I haven't been able to listen to them
                        yet.

                        I imagine it must be difficult
                        hearing his voice at this time.
                               (
                                but...
                                      )
                        Do give me a call once you listen.
                        I'd like to know if he said anything.

                               (

                        Anything like what?

           Father Curtis wonders if he should say anymore. Finally...

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        I want to show you something.
           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / BASEMENT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

           They descend a dark narrow STAIRCASE towards the basement
           door. Father Curtis leads the way. We can still hear the
           distant CHATTER of mourners upstairs.

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        The church will be launching its own
                        investigation into this matter.
                        Except for the police, no one else
                        has seen this.

           They reach the bottom. Father Curtis's hand pauses on the
           light switch. They stand there in the dark for a moment.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (cont'd)
                        I'm only showing you this because the
                        two of you were close. Maybe you can
                        help me to make sense of it all.

           Daryl nods. Not quite sure what this is all about.

           Father Curtis finally clicks the switch. A light comes on
           above them revealing the BASEMENT DOOR. It's blocked off
           with yellow police tape.

           One long vertical slit has been carved straight through the
           wood of the door. It's jagged and uneven - done in haste.
           You can see right through the slit into the dark room on the
           other side.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (cont'd)
                        Father Liam had a weak heart. He had
                        no business doing such strenuous work
                        by himself. They believe it's what
                        caused the heart attack.

           Daryl just stares at the slit in the wood.

                                 DARYL
                        What was he trying to do?

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        Who knows. He never got to finish.
                        This is where they found him. He was
                        still holding onto the saw...
                               (
                                grim
                                    )
                        He had a crucifix in the other hand.

           FLASH-CUT TO: A dead Father Liam sitting on the floor like a
           propped up rag doll. His back against the open door. One arm
           hanging limp over his head, his hand still clutching the
           handle of a HACKSAW lodged in the door. The other arm hangs

           CONTINUED:

           loose at his side, the hand holding a CRUCIFIX. Eyes wide.
           His mouth agape in a silent scream.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (cont'd)
                        There's more...

           Father Curtis lifts the police tape. Daryl ducks his head
           underneath it, pushes the door open further and enters the
           darkness of the room. Father Curtis follows.

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Father Curtis hits another light switch. A lone light bulb
           flickers on the ceiling. It'll keep doing that.

           Now we can see the room. The ceiling's ten feet high. The
           entire space is empty. No shelves. No boxes. No junk.

           But that's not the weird part...

           The entire room is covered in BIBLE PAGES. Or rather what's
           left of them...

           The ceiling. The floor. The back of the door. All four walls
           were once completely covered in scripture. But now most of
           it has been torn through. Shredded paper hangs off the walls
           like streamers. The pages are yellowing, beginning to fade.
           They were put up a very long time ago.

           The floor is littered with ribbons of torn pages.

           Daryl does a 360. Taking in the room. All those words 
           surrounding them. Pages flickering eerily in the light.

                                 FATHER CURTIS
                        We thought it might have been the dog
                        but...

           He looks up to the ceiling. Daryl follows his gaze.

           Long SCRATCH MARKS run across the ceiling in jagged
           patterns. They're eerily shaped like antlers.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (cont'd)
                        ...no dog could have done that.

           Both men stare up at the ceiling.

                                 FATHER CURTIS (cont'd)
                        Any idea what Father Liam could have
                        been doing in here?

           Daryl is quiet. But his face says he might have a clue.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICEMAIL (PRE-LAP)
                        Your voicemail box is full. You have
                        thirty new messages. < BEEP > 

           INT. SUV - DAY - LATER

           It's still parked in front of Father Liam's house. Daryl's
           behind the wheel. He's got his phone on speaker.

           Father Liam's voice is troubled.

                                 FATHER LIAM (VOICEMAIL)
                            < BEEP >
                        Daryl, where are you? We need to
                        speak. It's urgent.
                            < BEEP >
                        I keep thinking about that day I
                        found you in the woods. I just... I
                        had this-this feeling. That's why I
                        came back to the cabin.
                                    )
                               (
                                beat
                        I feel that feeling now. Like-like
                        you need help... Call me.

           Daryl listens. His jaw clinches slightly. The phone shakes
           in his hand. A low RUMBLING SOUND rises in his ears.

                                 FATHER LIAM (VOICEMAIL) (cont'd)
                               (
                                a dog BARKS in B.G.

                        -- Something's wrong. I can feel it.
                        Where are you? We need to speak.
                        There's something I need to tell--

           Daryl quickly hangs up. The RUMBLING stops. The car quiets.

           Daryl looks back to Father Liam's house outside the window.
           His face guilt ridden.

           INT. SUV / MOVING - DUSK

           The SUV parks in the PARKING LOT of a HIGH SCHOOL. Daryl
           turns the engine off. Sits behind the wheel, watching people
           enter the school doors.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL / GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           An ALCOHOLISM SUPPORT GROUP. About twenty people sit in a
           circle of folding chairs in the center of a basketball
           court. An EMOTIONAL MAN bears his soul to the group.

                                 EMOTIONAL MAN
                        ...she finally allowed me to see my
                        kids again. I mean, it's only once a
                        week, but it's a start. That's all I
                        can really ask for.

           He sits. The circle applauds him.

           OWEN (40s), a kind face and beard claps hardest. He's
           leading this thing.

                                 OWEN
                        Thank you for that, Calvin.
                                to the group
                               (
                                            )
                        Would any one else like to share with
                        us tonight?

           His eyes move around the circle and land on Daryl. He's
           still in his suit. Daryl averts Owen's gaze.

           A WOMAN (30s) slowly stands. She looks very troubled.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hi, My name is Susan and I'm an
                        alcoholic.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Hi, Susan.

                                 SUSAN
                        This is my first time here --
                        Actually no it isn't. I...
                                looks to Owen
                               (
                                             )
                        Can I start over?

                                 OWEN
                        Take your time, Susan.

           She takes a deep breath. Re-calibrates herself.

                                 SUSAN
                        What I'm trying to say is I've been
                        here before. I've reached this point.
                        It's just a different room with
                        different people. Same stories. The
                        meetings help... until they don't.

                        And then I don't come back...

           She tries to go on but can't. Owen is about to speak when--

                                 DARYL
                        But you're here now.

           Everyone turns to Daryl. He's looking at Susan.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                               (
                                calm, reassuring
                                                )
                        There's something inside you that
                        keeps bringing you back. It's that
                        voice, that noise. Whatever it is,
                        trust me, it won't go away. But every
                        time you're here, it gets a little
                        more quiet. The life you want out
                        there, starts in here. But it all
                        depends on this moment. On what you
                        do now. On what you want.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        What do you want, Susan?

           You could hear a pin drop.

                                 SUSAN
                        I want to come back.

           Everyone claps. Susan sits, wiping tears away. Daryl's words
           have really resonated with her. She looks lighter. Her
           burden a little less heavy.

           One woman, JANET (35), studies Daryl. Impressed.

                                                      CUT TO: LATER

           The meeting's over. The chairs are empty. Everyone mingles
           by the snack table. The cups of coffee are going fast.

           Daryl reaches for the last cup at the same time Janet does.
           Their fingers touch. They both pull their hands back.

                                 DARYL
                        I'm sorry.

                                 JANET
                        No, go for it. That's all you.

                                 DARYL
                        Please, I insist.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 JANET
                        OK. Here's how we settle this...

           She slides the cup in between the two of them.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        Whichever one of us had the worst day
                        today, gets the cup. You first.

           Daryl is awkward. Not sure what to say.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        That bad, huh?

           She puts a lid on the cup and hands it to him.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        Wanna talk about?

           He looks uneasy. Janet jumps in and saves him.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        It's OK. I get it, you're the strong
                        silent type. I like those.
                               (

                        We haven't formally met. Janet.

                                               )
                        Daryl.

           He glances toward the exit.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        It was nice to meet you.

                                 JANET
                        I was just heading out myself. I'll
                        walk with you.

           She grabs her coat from a nearby chair.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           They exit the doors. Janet wears her coat now. Daryl's still
           got the coffee.

                                 JANET
                        So what do you do, Daryl?

                                 DARYL
                        For work?

                        I don't do much now.

                        I used to teach.

                        It didn't feel right, being up there
                        in front of my students, knowing I
                        had a problem. I felt like a fraud,
                        like I was hiding a secret. It got
                        harder to believe in what I was
                        teaching. Couldn't do it anymore.

           It's the first time he's ever admitted that out loud. He
           sees the way she's studying him. He throws it back to her.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        What about you? What do you do?

                                 JANET
                        I'm going through a bit of a
                        transition myself. Kind of in between
                        jobs. I just got out of a long
                        relationship.

                                 DARYL
                        I'm sorry to hear that.

                                 JANET
                        Don't be. It's a good thing. He was
                        more the strong violent type - the
                        reason I ended up in these meetings.
                        But that part of my life is over.

                        Now I'm just dealing with this part.

           They reach the trunk of Janet's Volvo. This is good night.
           Janet gets a little more serious now.

                        Daryl. You've been coming here for
                        over a year and never said so much as
                        a hello to anyone. And then the one
                        time you open your mouth, you say
                        something like that.

           Daryl senses something. His gaze moves to THE TREES at the
           edge of the parking lot. Their dark twisted branches sway in
           the brisk wind. Something about them... gnawing at him.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        What you said tonight really
                        connected with Susan. Some of the
                        others too, I can tell. You're good
                        at this. Maybe next meeting, if you
                        tell your story, it might help--

                                 JANET
                        I highly doubt that.

                               (

                                smiles back
                        Good night, Daryl.

           He walks to his SUV. Janet looks over to THOSE TREES Daryl
           was just staring at. She sees nothing strange about them.

           When she turns back to her car she sees Daryl has left the
           cup of coffee on her trunk for her. She smiles.

                                                            CUT TO:

           SOMETHING watching from THOSE TREES...

           A STRANGE POV: There is NO color, although the "darks" are
           sightly darker. We're not looking through human eyes.

           We watch Daryl get into the SUV and drive away...

           MONTAGE of the SUV driving... down a highway of city
           traffic... On a more desolate highway in a more RURAL
           UPSTATE NEW YORK area... On to narrow winding roads that go
           through overgrown trees...

           We're a good ways from the city. It's snowing more up here.

           INT. SUV / MOVING - NIGHT

           Daryl drives, pensive.

                        In 300 feet, you will reach your
                        destination.

           The SUV lurches up the narrow path. Tall trees on either
           side of us. It's like we're driving through the legs of
           giants. We slow to a stop in a small clearing.

                                 FEMALE GPS (cont'd)
                        You have reached your destination.

           Outside the windshield, an old LOG CABIN looms ominously
           before us. It's big. Rustic. In need of some repairs.

           Daryl puts his coat and hat on before he gets out.

           EXT. BACK OF THE CABIN - NIGHT

           He unlocks a WOODEN SHED connected to the back of the Cabin.
           There's an ancient GENERATOR inside it.

           He grabs an oil can and pours some into the generator. He
           gives the ripcord a few tugs to get it going. It hums to
           life. And a few lights pop on in the windows of The Cabin.

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl enters. Locks the door behind him.

           The room is large. Taxidermy hangs on the upper walls -
           deer, foxes, raccoons, and rabbits.

           A NAVAJO RUG covers most of the floor.

           An old COUCH by the FIREPLACE with a CHIMNEY.

           A HUNTING RIFLE hangs above the fireplace.

           A filled bookshelf. The small MAHOGANY BOX on top of it.

           There are more rooms going towards the back of the Cabin
           down a long HALLWAY.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Daryl hangs his coat on a rack by the door. Moves to an old
           cast iron WOOD BURNING STOVE in the corner. He opens it and
           feeds some logs inside. Lights the fire.

           INT. CABIN / BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Daryl lies in bed in the dark room. He stares up at a lone
           CROSS that hangs on the wall above him. It's slightly
           crooked. Looks mighty small up on that wall all by itself.

           He gets up and straightens it. Lies back in bed. Pulls the
           covers over his head. Tries to get some much needed sleep.

           The room is eerily quiet now. After the longest beat...

           A loud C-R-E-A-K of bed springs. Like an added weight is
           slowly pressing down on the mattress.

           Daryl stirs. Slowly pulls the covers down from his face...

           INT. THE CABIN / BEDROOM - NIGHT  (DARYL'S MEMORY / DREAM)

           ...revealing that he is 12-years-old now. Young Daryl sits
           up in the dark. He's dressed in pajamas.

           SOMEONE is sitting statue-still on the foot of his bed.

           It's Erin. In her nightgown. Silhouetted by the dim light
           coming from the crack of the door. We can't see her face. 

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        Mom?

                                 ERIN
                        Shhh... Go back to bed.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        What are you doing?

                                 ERIN
                        I'm just watching you...

           It's hard to tell in the dark but something seems off about
           her face. It looks longer, swollen even...

           She rises from the bed. There's something off about her walk
           too. It feels forced. Unnatural. She slips through the crack
           of the door and she's gone.

           Young Daryl sits frozen on his bed. Alone in the dark now.
           Listening to Erin's footsteps move down the hall. They stop.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Daryl strains his ears. Hears WHISPERING coming from further
           down the hall. Erin is talking to someone...

           Daryl gets out of the bed. Creeps to the door. He peeps
           through the crack... expecting to see Erin further down the
           hallway. But instead sees--

           -- A HAND. On the floor.

           Someone's on all fours right outside of the door.

           Daryl gasps. Looks up to see A FACE IN THE CRACK OF THE
           DOOR... It's Erin's face... On top of ANOTHER FACE.

           Like someone's wearing a mask of his mother. SOLID BLACK
           EYES peer through the holes where Erin's eyes used to be.

           Daryl FREAKS OUT. Screaming, backing away...

           As Erin pushes the door open and CRAWLS into his room on all
           fours... And rises to her feet... Staggering forward...

           Growing as she comes... TALLER... EVEN TALLER... ANTLERS
           RIPPING THROUGH THE FLESH OF HER TEMPLES... SPROUTING UP
           FROM HER HEAD... GROWING TO THE CEILING LIKE WILD VINES...

           Daryl SCREAMS. Backing into a wall. The CROSS above his head
           falls--

                                                      MATCH-CUT TO:

           INT. THE CABIN / BEDROOM - NIGHT

           --BAM-- the cross hits the floor.

           Our Daryl jumps up in his bed, continuing the same scream.
           Breathing hard. Bed sheets soaked. Eyes searching the dark.

           Landing on the cross on the floor.

           That RUMBLING sound again. Low in his ears.

           KITCHEN

           He opens the freezer. Pulls out an empty bottle of VODKA.
           Rubs the cold bottle on his forehead and on the back of his
           neck. Trying to cool down.

           The RUMBLING gets lower and stops. The Cabin is quiet.

           Daryl drives through a busy city street.

                        You have reached your destination.

           He parks outside of an ANIMAL SHELTER.

           PRE-LAP the sound of dogs BARKING.

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DAY

           A FEMALE EMPLOYEE leads Daryl through a room of barking DOGS
           in cages. It's noisy. They have to talk loud at each other.

                                 DARYL
                        German Shepard. About two years old.
                        Brown. Black nose.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        Yeah, we got him three days ago.

           They reach a cage with the same dog we saw in the photo on
           Father Liam's desk. This is PARKER (2). He barks excitedly
           when he sees Daryl. Starts doing circles in his cage.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE (cont'd)
                        Good thing you came when you did.
                        They were gonna put him to sleep this
                        afternoon.

           The employee opens the cage and Parker flies out into
           Daryl's arms. Daryl playfully wrestles with him.

                                 DARYL
                        Hey, Parker. How you doing, huh? Long
                        time. You miss me? Huh?

           INT. SUV MOVING - DUSK

           Daryl drives. Parker is in the passenger seat wearing his
           seat belt. He's missing his dog collar.

                                 DARYL
                        Lost your collar, too? Welcome to the
                        club.
           EXT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The SUV parks in front. Daryl gets out. Opens Parker's door.
           The dog jumps out. Runs to the house, happy to be home.

           Daryl finds the KEY hidden underneath a garden gnome. He
           unlocks the door and follows Parker inside.

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / THE STUDY - NIGHT

           Daryl keeps the lights off. Don't want the neighbors to
           catch him snooping. Parker sniffs around the room.

           Daryl's at the desk, shining his phone over all the books
           and papers. He grabs some. Folds them up and puts them in
           his coat pocket.

           ROSARY BEADS are sticking out of one of the books. He picks
           it up. Opens it to the page marked by the beads. Sees...

           Old illustrations of doors with crosses cut through them.
           Some depict rays of light shining through the cross. Hmmmm.

           Daryl rips out the pages. Folds and pockets them too.

           And now the record player on the shelf.

           Daryl moves to it. Turns it on. The unmarked LP starts to
           spin. The needle slowly falls onto the groove and--

           --The voice of a PREACHER BLARES LOUDLY from the speakers.
           The volume is WAY UP. The voice, authoritative. Commanding.

                                 PREACHER (RECORD PLAYER)
                        --AND PUT ON THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD,
                        SO THAT YOU TAKE YOUR STAND AGAINST
                        THE DEVIL'S SCHEMES--

           Parker bolts out the room. Daryl almost has a heart attack.

           -ERRRR. He stops the record. The room quiets.

           Just Daryl trying to slow his heartbeat.

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / BASEMENT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl and Parker head down the dark steps. Daryl shines his
           phone ahead of them. Parker stops halfway. Doesn't want to
           go any further.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                        Come on, boy. What's wrong?

           But Parker won't go. He starts to whimper.

           Daryl shines the light down at the bottom of the steps.
           Realizes this is the spot Parker found Liam. Daryl frowns.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        It's OK, boy. Just stay here.

           Parker stays. Daryl continues down to the basement door.
           Shines the phone through the jagged slit, into the room
           behind it. He moves the police tape up and goes under...

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           He enters. Pockets his phone. Turns on the flickering light.
           He moves along the walls, pouring over the torn Bible pages.

           Behind the door has the most damage. The scratches here seem
           more violent. Like something was clawing to get out...

           He moves to another wall. Very slowly he reaches a hand out
           to it. His fingertips connect with a yellowing page--

                                                      MATCH-CUT TO:

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / BASEMENT (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           --Daryl's hand touching the very same page. Except it's a
           new page, not fading. And Daryl's hand is much younger now.

           REVEAL a 12-year-old Daryl smoothing out the page on the
           wall. The wall is empty. This is the very first page being
           glued on to it.

           A stack of BIBLES, a bucket of glue and a brush are close by
           his feet. A ladder is set up in the middle of the room.

           A priest stands near by. We recognize him from the picture
           at his funeral. This is a younger FATHER LIAM (50s). He
           wears his collar.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Good. Now, the next one.

           Young Daryl looks up to the rest of the wall, at all that
           empty space.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        I'm sorry, Daryl. I can't help you.
                        You must do this on your own.

           Daryl tears out another page from a Bible and glues it next
           to the first page on the wall. Liam watches him closely.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Remember, it is your faith in these
                        words that will protect you.

           ....CREEEEEEEAK...

           BACK TO SCENE

           The CREAKING of floorboards above snaps Daryl out of his
           memory. He pulls his hand back from the wall.

           Parker starts BARKING from somewhere upstairs.

           Daryl looks up at the ceiling. Stands there in the
           flickering light of the room. Listening. Realizing...

           Someone else is in the house.

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / BASEMENT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl comes out of the basement door. Parker is still
           barking upstairs.

           Daryl starts up the dark steps when suddenly the barks STOP.

           Daryl listens. Waits... The house is silent.

           He continues up the steps. Cautious now. He reaches the door
           at the top. Slowly opens it...

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           He moves out into the dark hall. No Parker. No sounds. He
           crosses into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           Finds a lamp on the table. Turns on the light. The room is
           empty. But now he notices...

           The front door is wide open. Did he leave it open?

           He starts for the door when he hears something that makes
           him STOP. The WHISTLE of a tea kettle. Slowly rising.

           There's something about that sound. It's bringing him back
           to a dark place.

           He slowly turns to the KITCHEN. It's dark in there. The blue
           flame on the stove causes shadows to flicker on the walls.

           That stove didn't turn itself on. So who's in the kitchen?

                                 DARYL
                        Hello?

           Only the kettle answers him back. The whistle rising. Daryl
           moves for the

           KITCHEN

           Turns on the light. There's no one in here. He goes straight
           to the stove. Turns the flame off. The kettle quiets.

           He turns from the stove, now noticing an ADJACENT ROOM. BEAD
           CURTAINS hang in its doorway.

           They sway softly, like someone has passed through them just
           moments ago. There's nothing but pitch blackness on the
           other side of the beads.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Is someone there?

           No response from the darkness. The beads are still now.

           He s-l-o-w-l-y moves towards the adjacent room. Passing the
           kitchen table. And that's when he sees it...

           Something has been carved into the top of the table.       
           A single long jagged letter. The letter... " B "

           Daryl, freezes. He's seen this before.

           The WHISTLE of the kettle starts up again. But there's no
           flame under it. The sound is not coming from the stove...

           It's coming from the other side of the beads. From the

           Daryl, shaking now. HE KNOWS what's in that room.

           He takes a step back and--

           --The whistle abruptly STOPS. Quiet.

           Daryl keeps backing way, eyes on the beads...

           When... CREAK...CREAK... The sound of something HEAVY.
           Moving on the floorboards. Coming from the darkness of that
           room. Getting closer... louder...

           THAT STRANGE POV AGAIN: We're in the dark room, Moving
           towards the kitchen. Watching Daryl through the beads...

           KITCHEN

           THE BEADS SLOWLY START TO PART... WIDER... AND LIFT FORWARD,
           UPWARDS... as SOMETHING UNSEEN comes through them...

           We glimpse the OUTLINE OF A VERY TALL SHAPE coming into the
           room. The beads at the top of the doorway start to clip off
           and CLATTER to the floor. Scattering in all directions.

           Daryl, shaking now. Backs away into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Keeps moving backwards. His eyes on the kitchen and--

           CREAK...CREAK... COMING OUT OF THE KITCHEN -- FOLLOWING HIM

           Daryl panics -- spins -- Goes for the first door he sees --
           pulls it open -- runs inside the --

           INT. THE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           The room is dark. Daryl slams the door shut just as --
           WHAM -- SOMETHING SLAMS on the other side of it.

           Daryl runs for the massive bookshelf. Crouches down on the
           side of it. Hiding. Holding his breath.

           The door slowly opens... SOMETHING steps inside the darkness
           with him. Floorboards CREAK... CREAK... CREAK...

           Daryl, crouched on the side of the shelf. Eyes darting
           around. No way out of here except for the way he came in.

           CREAK...CREAK... It stops in the middle of the room.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Daryl doesn't move. Neither does the thing. They both wait
           in the horrible silence of the dark room.

           Daryl shaking. Grips the side of the shelf. Slowly tries to
           crane his neck around the shelf for a look...

           --And accidentally knocks a book off. A big old heavy one--

           --and SMACK-- It hits the floor. Shit!

           CREAK...CREAK... Now it knows where he is. It's coming...

           And Daryl does the only thing he can do.

           He turns around and pushes the bookshelf forward...

           It tips over and CRASH. But the shelf doesn't hit the floor.

           It stops, tilted sideways in mid air. Its fall stopped by
           something unseen underneath it.

           Daryl makes a run for it... around the shelf... to the door.

           WE SEE BEHIND HIM, THE ENTIRE SHELF STARTS TO RISE UP OFF
           THE FLOOR, LIFTED BY INVISIBLE ARMS. BOOKS FALLING.

           But Daryl's out the door before it comes down--

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- He pulls the door shut. And we hear the THUNDEROUS CRASH
           of the shelf from inside.

           Parker starts BARKING from upstairs.

           Daryl, in full adrenaline mode. Pulls a large COUCH across
           the floor and slides it up against the door of the STUDY.

           He darts for the front door -- and he's out -- running for
           the SUV -- throws himself inside --

           INT. SUV - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           -- He's frantic -- finds the keys -- starts the car -- hits
           the gas -- Speeds off -- Shaking behind the wheel.

           He zooms down the road. Further away from the house.

           Keeps driving. And driving... Then slows to a stop.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He looks up at the rear view mirror. At Father Liam's house
           in the distance. His face, scared. Conflicted.

           Because he can still hear Parker barking in the distance.

                                 DARYL
                        Just go. Go now.

           But he doesn't.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Don't be stupid, Daryl. Leave.

           But he can't do it. He steels himself. Makes his decision.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Damn it!

           And reverses the SUV all the way back up the road. All the
           way back to the house. The front door is still wide open.

           He can hear Parker BARKING from upstairs.

           Daryl stares up at the bedroom window. Mind racing...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE / FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl cautiously enters the front door. He holds the door
           frame tight with one hand. Afraid to let go. Afraid to step
           further into the house...

           He eyes the STAIRCASE. A good 15-feet away.

           He looks down the HALLWAY. The couch is no longer blocking
           the door to the STUDY. It's been turned on its side.

           The door is wide open. Cracked and hanging off the hinges.

           IT'S OUT...

           Daryl's eyes scan the house.

           Where is it? Is it still here? It can be anywhere...

           But the house is still. Quiet. Only Parker barking upstairs.

           Daryl has to make his move. He pries his fingers from the
           door frame and steps into the house. Moves for the STAIRS...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He takes slow quiet steps... Careful not to make noise... 
           Straining his ears for any other sounds... His eyes dart
           around like pin-balls.

           Every step to the STAIRCASE feels like eternity. Finally he
           reaches the bottom step...

           Slowly raises his leg to step up--

           --when the COFFEE TABLE in the LIVING ROOM SUDDENLY FLIPS UP
           INTO THE AIR by itself. CRASHES up to the ceiling. SHATTERS.

           IT'S STILL HERE!

           Daryl shoots up the STAIRCASE. Taking them by twos...

           And IT FOLLOWS HIM!

           THE STEPS CRACK AND SPLINTER IN RAPID SUCCESSION AS IT
           STOMPS UP AFTER HIM. IT'S RIGHT ON DARYL'S HEELS --

           -- He makes it to the UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- Scrambles up the
           hall in the direction of Parker's barks.

           AND STOMP-STOMP-STOMP-STOMP -- Coming up behind him -- IT'S
           RUNNING after him! Behind Daryl --

           -- The CEILING BULBS SHATTER -- The hall darkens -- PICTURE
           FRAMES are knocked off the walls, breaking on the floor --

           -- Daryl just makes it into --

           INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- And slams the door shut. Locks it as --

           --WHAM -- SOMETHING SLAMS AGAINST THE CLOSED BEDROOM DOOR.

           Parker's under the bed. Scared. Barking like mad.

           Daryl gets on his knees, reaches under the bed for the dog.

                                 DARYL
                        Parker! Come on!

           --WHAM --WHAM --WHAM from the bedroom door...

           Daryl grabs Parker by the paws -- Pulls him out -- picks the
           barking dog up and carries him to the window --

           --WHAM --WHAM -- CRACK! The door starts to splinter...

           CONTINUED:

           Daryl slides the window open with his free hand and...

           Wait... Is he really about to drop the dog out the window?

           Yup. That's exactly what he does...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDE OF FATHER LIAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...But Parker lands safely onto the roof of the SUV.

           We now see Daryl has parked the car right under the bedroom
           window. Only a 5-foot drop to the roof of the car.

           Daryl climbs out the window next --  when CRASH! We hear the
           bedroom door come down inside...

           Daryl lands on the car roof next to Parker. Picks him up and
           slides down the windshield with the dog in his arms... Onto
           the hood... and onto the ground.

           He shoves Parker in the car and gets in behind the wheel.
           The SUV zooms out from the side of the house... onto the
           road and disappears in the distance.

           That RUMBLING SOUND starts up again. Low. Building...

           INT. SUV - NIGHT

           The SUV is parked across the street from a LIQUOR STORE.

           Parker sits quietly in the passenger seat watching Daryl.

           Daryl's at the wheel. Staring at the entrance of the store
           through the window. Its neon lights beckoning him to enter.

           His hands grip the wheel. Shaking. Sweating. Jaws clinching.

           The RUMBLING growing. It's so loud now it seems to be
           shaking the car.

           He grabs the door handle...

           Parker whimpers. But the sound is lost in the rumbling.

                                 DARYL
                        ...don't.

           But his hand isn't listening to him. It opens the door.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Light snow on the ground. We're in a wide CLEARING.

           A 12-year old Daryl is digging a DEEP HOLE into the snowy
           ground with a shovel. The hole's about 5-feet deep and 3-
           feet wide. He's up to his head in it, covered in dirt.

           Erin stands at the edge of the hole watching her son dig.

                                 ERIN
                        That's deep enough. You did good.

           She helps pull him up out of the hole.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        Get some of those sticks and branches
                        over there. Cover it up good.

           Daryl obeys. Starts covering the hole with big branches,
           hiding it from sight. Erin watches him as he does this.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        What's it for?

                                 ERIN
                        It's a trapping pit. The deer falls
                        in and gets stuck. Can't climb out.
                        You can kill it right here from the
                        top of the hole.
                               (
                                      )
                                points
                        Mark that tree over there so we can
                        remember where it is. Don't want any
                        accidents now.

           Daryl uses a SWISS ARMY KNIFE to carve a LONG CROSS into the
           trunk of the tree closest to the pit.

                                                      CUT TO: LATER

           EXT. THE CABIN - DUSK  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           CHOP -- An AX comes down on a log, splitting it in half.

           Young Daryl chops wood in the dying light of the day. He's
           right at the edge of the woods where the trees start.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He gathers the split logs and piles them into a WHEELBARROW
           along with the ax. Starts pushing the barrow back toward the
           Cabin. It's 100-feet away. The lights are on in its windows.

           A log falls from the barrow. Daryl stops to pick it up...

           ...and hears a CRUNCH behind him.

           He whirls around. There's nothing there but the dark trees.
           Their swaying branches beckoning him to come back.

           Daryl puts the log back in the barrow. Continues on. His
           boots crunching underneath him.

           And from behind him, a much louder, heavier CRUNCHING mimics
           his. It's like SOMETHING is trying to match his footsteps.

           Daryl stops. So does the crunching. He turns again... but
           sees nothing there.

           He turns back around, eyes the Cabin. He's halfway there
           now. He continues on. Picking up the pace this time...

           And so does the CRUNCHING behind him...

           Daryl pushes the barrow even faster. Logs falling off as he
           goes. Behind him the CRUNCHING picks up speed too. 

           Daryl panics. Throws the barrow over. Breaks into a full on
           run. Behind him, CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH - It's RUNNING too...

           Daryl doesn't dare look back. He darts up the porch...
           Swings the door open and --

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           -- WHAM -- runs right into Erin, who's standing near the
           door. Almost knocks her over. She drops the bottle of
           WHISKEY she was holding. It tumbles on the floor, spilling.

                                 ERIN
                        The-hell's the matter with you! Look
                        what you made me do!

           She's clearly already drunk. Picks the bottle back up.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        Where's the wood?

           Daryl, out of breath. Can't even begin to explain...

                        that wood! You want us to freeze to
                        death?!

           She stumbles into the kitchen with the bottle, mumbling
           under her breath. Daryl turns back to the open door...

           EXT. THE CABIN - MOMENTS LATER - DUSK  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Young Daryl cautiously approaches the overturned
           wheelbarrow. It's quiet. Only his boots crunching now.

           He reaches the barrow. Gets it upright. Quickly gathers the
           logs and throws them back in. His eyes dart around, watching
           the trees. He finishes packing up the logs...

           But he can't find the ax. It should be right here...

           He searches for it in the snow. Where the heck did it go?

           And then he spots it... At the edge of the woods. Right by
           the trees. Just laying there in the snow.

           How the hell did it get all the way over there??

           Daryl starts for it. Slow and cautious. He's almost at the
           ax when he stops. He's noticed something in the snow...

           The wheel marks from the barrow... the trail of boot prints
           he left... There are other tracks in the snow beside them.

           LARGE CLOVEN-HOOVED PRINTS...

           There WAS something out here with him. Following him...

           Daryl, spooked now. Just wants to get the heck out of there.
           He runs for the ax... but right as he's about to grab it--

           -- STOMP - the handle of the ax SUDDENLY SNAPS in half under
           an invisible weight. The splintered ends of the handle lie
           crooked in a large CLOVEN-HOOVED PRINT now left in the snow.

           He jolts up in the backseat. Parker starts to bark.

           A POLICE OFFICER (40s) is at his window. His muffled voice
           coming loud through the glass.

                        Move it! No sleeping here.

           The officer continues on to another car.

           Daryl, drunk and disoriented. Starts to get his bearings.
           Sees Parker. Sees it's daytime.

           Sees the LIQUOR STORE outside the window.

           Then he sees a HALF EMPTY BOTTLE OF WHISKEY on the floor by
           his boots. He stares at it as if it were a coiled snake.

           PRE-LAP the sound of APPLAUSE.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The ALCOHOLISM SUPPORT GROUP applauds the man who's just
           finished telling his story. SUSAN has kept her promise and
           returned. She looks better than the last time we saw her.

           Daryl is here. Head down. Disheveled. Shaken up. Still a bit
           drunk. His face is wrapped in sweaty guilt.

                                 OWEN
                        Would anyone else like to share
                        tonight?

           His eyes fall on Daryl. The whole room's been looking at
           him. Especially Janet. She watches him, concerned.

           The circle tries to encourage him.

                        Hi, Daryl... Hey, Daryl... Take your

           CONTINUED:

           Daryl finds Janet in the circle. They lock eyes. She gives
           him an encouraging nod - go on.

           He opens his mouth to try again when--

           --a LOUD CRASH comes from behind him.

           He jumps -- spins -- knocking his chair over. Ready to run.

           But it's only a JANITOR. He's noisily collapsing a folding
           table in the back of the gym.

           Daryl turns back around. He's backed himself into the middle
           of the circle. MURMURS go around the circle.

                               (

                        Is everything OK? Daryl?

           Daryl can't do this. Can't be here. He hurries for the door.
           The murmurs follow him out into the

           HALLWAY

           Janet comes out of the room. Hurrying after him.

                                 JANET
                        Daryl, hold on!

                        Are you in some kind of trouble?

           He keeps walking. Eyes darting around. Janet has to keep up.

                                 DARYL
                        I have to go.

                        Yeah, tomorrow.

           They both know he's lying.

                                 JANET
                        Give me your phone.

           Daryl stops and pulls out his phone. Hands it to her. She
           plugs her number into it.

                        Call me, day or night. Whenever
                        you're ready to talk.

           Daryl pockets the phone and hurries out of the exit doors.

           OFF JANET, concerned. Alone in the hall, holding her phone.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl hurries to the SUV. Parker's in the passenger seat,
           waiting. Daryl gets in and speeds out of the lot.

           INT. SUV / MOVING - NIGHT

           Daryl drives. Parker's in the passenger seat wearing his
           seat belt, eating from a can of dog food in the cup holder.

                                 FEMALE GPS

           EXT. THE CABIN - LATER - NIGHT

           The SUV parks in the middle of the clearing in front of the
           Cabin. Daryl hurries out. Parker follows.

           EXT. BACK OF THE CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl and Parker, in the SHED. The door is ajar. Moonlight
           slips in through the crack, giving us some visibility.

           Daryl pours oil into the generator. He's frantic. Moving
           fast. He yanks the rip cord a few times to get it going. The
           generator hums to life. He turns for the door when...

           Parker arches his back. Starts to GROWL at the door.

           Daryl goes still. Listens... Hears what Parker hears...

           A SLOW CRUNCHING outside. SOMETHING is moving around out
           there. Shuffling closer to the shed...

           Daryl quietly grabs a SHOVEL from a corner. He drops down
           low next to Parker, watching the door with him.

           Parker growls louder. Daryl holds the dog back.

           A SHADOW crosses the crack of the door, blocking off the
           moonlight. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE NOW...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Parker starts barking. Daryl scared, readies the shovel...

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Daryl?

           The door opens. Janet steps inside the shed. Daryl jumps up.

                                 DARYL
                        What are you doing here!

                                 JANET
                        I followed you. I just wanted to make
                        sure you were OK--

                                 DARYL
                        You can't be here!

           He grabs her arm and forcefully pulls her out of the SHED.
           Parker follows along, barking.

                               (
                                alarmed

                        Why? What's wrong?

           He's pulling her hard, forcing her to move. Her boots
           slipping in the snow underneath her.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        ...Daryl, you're hurting me...

           But he's not listening. He keeps looking around at the
           woods. At the trees. His paranoia is contagious. She's
           looking around too, searching for the threat.

           They reach the FRONT OF THE CABIN.

           Janet's Volvo is parked behind his SUV. Her headlights are
           still on. In the lights she can see the panic in Daryl's
           face. He looks crazed. Dangerous, even. It's bringing up bad
           memories... Triggering something... She's breathing hard
           now... holding her chest...

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                               (

                        Let go... Daryl... stop...

                        You have to go!

           She pulls free from his grasp and drops in the snow in front
           of the headlights. On her knees, shaking. Hyperventilating.

           Daryl, alarmed. Drops the shovel. Tries to help her up...

                        Hey, hey... I'm sorry--

           --She puts her arm up to keep him away - Don't touch me!

           He backs off. She kneels there in the snow, taking in slow
           deep breaths... Trying to steady herself. This isn't the
           first time this has happened. She knows what to do.

           Daryl just stands there, watching helplessly. Regret in his
           face. Even Parker is quiet, watching the scene.

           Finally she gets it under control. Climbs back on her feet.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        ...I'm sorry.

           She doesn't look at him. Just gets in her car. Slams her
           door. Daryl moves to her window.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Janet, wait!

           She reverses the car and turns. Speeds back up the path.
           Daryl watches the tail lights disappear into the trees. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           currently watching from the opening scene. We'll be coming
           back to this from time to time. Get used to it.

           Daryl continues his story. He sits in the same chair in the
           KITCHEN. The closed box in front of him. His head in his
           hands. The cuffs dangle off his wrist.

                        There are stages to demonic
                        possession. First, the demon will
                        reveal itself. After that, it'll try
                        to make physical contact.

           He stares off camera, considering this. Looks back.

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Daryl pulls the NAVAJO RUG back revealing a WOODEN HATCH in
           the center of the floor. He pulls it open. Quickly descends
           the narrow steps into the...

           CELLAR

           Parker at his side. Daryl turns on the lights.

           It's big. Cluttered. BOXES piled on the walls... SHELVES
           crowded with junk and OLD TOOLS... An old wooden SNOW SLED
           on the floor... An OLD TV. An old pair of SPEAKERS.

           Parker snoops around, sniffing through all the old junk.

           Daryl, frantic. Searches the shelves. Comes across the old
           HANDY CAM - the same one he's telling his story on now.

           He regards it for a moment. Goes back to his search.

           Finds a TOOL BOX and some SLATS OF WOOD.

           PRE-LAP the sound of loud, fast HAMMERING.

           MAIN ROOM

           Daryl boards up a window. Hammering with haste. Pounding
           nails into the wood. Swinging hard and fast. BANG-BANG-BANG

           The nails are already in but he keeps swinging. Taking his
           anger out on the wood. BANG-BANG-BANG-CRACK-

           The plank splits in half. He stops. Turns and sees...

           Parker standing behind him. Watching. He's scaring the dog.

                                 DARYL
                        I'm sorry boy.

           That RUMBLING starts low in Daryl's ears. He shakes his
           head. Tries to ignore it. Grabs another slat and starts to
           board up another window.

           - KITCHEN. He boards up the window in here too.

           - BATHROOM. Same story in here.

           - BEDROOM. He finishes boarding up the window and leaves.

           But WE LINGER on the empty spot of the wall where the cross
           used to hang. On the lonely nail.

           HALLWAY

           Daryl. Hammer in hand. Wood under his arms. Heads to the
           closed door at the end of the hall. This is Erin's old
           bedroom but we'll call it the LAST ROOM from here on.

           His hand pauses on the knob. This door hasn't been open in a
           long time. Finally...

           LAST ROOM

           He enters the darkness. Hits the light.

           Old dust covered furniture and picture frames on the walls.

           Daryl wipes dust off one of the frames with his sleeve
           revealing a yellowing NEWSPAPER ARTICLE inside it.

           The headline reads "Officer Charles Collins, Killed In the Line of Duty."
           Under the headline is a photo of a man with an honest face
           wearing a POLICE UNIFORM. One hand up to his cap in salute.

           Daryl moves to the next frame on the wall. Wipes the dust
           away, revealing a photo of Erin (30s) holding hands with the
           same man from the news article. This is Daryl's FATHER.

           Daryl stares at his parents.

           That rumbling growing in his ears. He goes back to his
           mission. Starts boarding up the windows in here. He hammers
           loudly. Trying to drown out the rumbling...

           BATHROOM

           The silhouette of an old claw foot tub behind the closed
           shower curtain.

           Daryl's at the sink, trying to uncap a bottle of Aspirin. 
           His hands shake too much. The pills spill out and clatter
           into the sink. He grabs a handful before they go down the
           drain and dry swallows them. The rumbling growing...

                                                            CUT TO:

           KITCHEN - LATER

           In the corner, Parker licks a plate of corned beef clean.

           Daryl paces the room, cellphone in hand. Just staring at the
           screen. He's sweaty. Jaws clinching. Talking low to himself.
           The RUMBLING'S gotten louder.

           CLOSE ON PHONE: A shaky thumb hovering over Janet's number.
           He can't bring himself to press it...

           He throws the phone on the counter. Runs his shaking hands
           through his hair. The rumbling follows us to...

                                                      CUT TO: LATER

           The phone lies still on the counter.

           Daryl sits at the table. Been here for some time now. He's
           got that old SWISS ARMY KNIFE in his hand. Slowly twisting
           the CORKSCREW part into the top of the table.

           Parker looks up from his empty plate. WHIMPERS at Daryl.

           We can HEAR the corkscrew TWISTING into the wood. The
           RUMBLING increasing. Parker WHIMPERING. All the sounds
           fusing together as one. Deafening...

           God, he needs that drink...

           He abruptly gets up and hurries out of the room. WE LINGER
           on the corkscrew, still sticking out of the table...

           MAIN ROOM

           Daryl hurriedly puts his hat and coat on. He takes off his
           BELT. Wraps it around Parker's neck - a makeshift leash.

           He kneels in front of the dog. Gets close to his face.

                        know if it's out there. OK boy?

           Parker just stares at him. Daryl stands. Grips the leash
           tight. He moves to the front door. Parker starts to whimper.

           EXT. THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS -  NIGHT

           It's snowing. A couple of inches cover the ground now. The
           woods look ominous in the moonlight.

           Daryl and Parker cautiously step out the front door. Daryl
           closes the door behind them. They stay on the porch.

           Daryl scans the area. It's quiet. The SUV is about thirty
           feet away. Daryl looks back at Parker.

                                 DARYL
                        Anything?

           Parker seems to be fine. He just stares ahead at the woods.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Let's go.

           The two hurry off the porch toward the SUV. Daryl holding
           the leash tight. His boots CRUNCHING in the snow. His eyes
           darting around, watching. Alert.

           They reach the SUV. Daryl opens the back door. Holds the
           leash with one hand. Searches for the HALF BOTTLE OF WHISKEY
           he left on the floor with the other. He can't find it.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Come on. Come on.

           Parker starts to GROWL. Sensing something. Daryl spins
           around, can't see anything. Parker starts to BARK.

           Daryl panics. Jumps into the back of the SUV and pulls the
           dog in with him. He slams the door shut.

           INT. SUV - CONTINUOUS

           It's dark in here. All the windows are covered in snow.

           Parker jumps over into the front passenger seat. He's
           BARKING at the WINDSHIELD - at something outside.

           Daryl climbs into the front seat and turns the car on. The
           lights come on inside the car. He hits the wipers.

           WHA-THUNK. They clear the snow off the windshield. But it's
           still too dark to see anything out there.

           Parker keeps barking at the glass. Something's definitely
           out there. Daryl turns on the HIGH-BEAMS.

           WINDSHIELD POV: The bright lights illuminate the dark woods
           up ahead. And at the edge of the WOODS, right where the
           trees start, stands...

           A SNOWMAN

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           But this is NOT the cute Christmas cartoon kind with the
           button eyes, scarf and carrot nose.

           This thing is tall. Frail and man-shaped. And it's been
           standing in the same spot for many hours - hence why it's
           covered in snow.

           Snow outlines the MASSIVE TWISTED ANTLERS that stand on the
           top of its head making this thing stand about 9-feet tall.

           DEMON POV: Because by now you should have guessed what this
           thing is. We're watching Daryl and Parker in the windshield.

           The snow man looms there about 40-feet away from the car,
           just beyond the reach of the headlights.

           Parker's BARKING louder now that he sees it.

           Daryl is too scared to move. Just stares at the thing when--

           --IT MOVES! IT SHIFTS FORWARD AND ALL THE SNOW SLIDES OFF OF
           IT. AND THEN... IT'S GONE. LEAVING TWO LARGE HOLES IN THE
           SNOW WHERE IT JUST STOOD.

           BUT WE KNOW THE DEMON IS STILL THERE, EXCEPT WE CAN'T SEE IT
           NOW THAT THERE'S NO SNOW COVERING IT.

           Parker goes wild. Daryl, eyes dart around. Searching for it
           when-- CRUNCH... CRUNCH...

           TWO NEW LARGE HOLES JUST APPEAR IN THE SNOW. THE DEMON HAS
           JUST TAKEN TWO STEPS CLOSER TO THE CAR.

           Time to go!

           Daryl wills himself to move. Finds the door handle to open
           it but... he stops. Has a better idea.

           He starts the car. Starts reversing the SUV back towards
           Cabin.

           And in the WINDSHIELD... CRUNCH... CRUNCH... TWO NEW HOLES
           APPEAR IN THE SNOW. IT'S JUST STEPPED CLOSER...

           Daryl keeps reversing. In the WINDSHIELD...

           CRUNCH... CRUNCH... ANOTHER TWO HOLES APPEAR. CRUNCH...
           CRUNCH...AND ANOTHER TWO. IT'S FOLLOWING THE CAR...

           Fuck that!

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Daryl SLAMS the gas. The SUV zooms backwards... Snow
           shooting from the spinning tires -- until -- BAM-- the
           bumper hits the porch. Parker's goes berserk.

           And in the WINDSHIELD... CRUNCH--CRUNCH--CRUNCH--CRUNCH--
           HOLES POPPING UP IN THE SNOW -- IT'S COMING CLOSER -- FAST!

           Daryl pops the trunk and makes a mad dash for the back...
           crawling over the seats... pulling Parker with him.

           On the way  -- he spots the WHISKEY BOTTLE on the floor --
           Snatches it up -- keeps going -- crawls out the back --

           EXT. THE CABIN / PORCH STEPS - CONTINUOUS

           -- onto the steps of the porch... scrambles up them on his
           hands and knees... AND BEHIND HIM--

           CRUNCH--CRUNCH--CRUNCH--CRUNCH-- THE HOLES ARE COMING
           CLOSER, FAST... THEY REACH THE STEPS OF THE PORCH...

           ...Daryl gets up -- pulling Parker with him and they
           scramble through the front door -- inside the --

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           --Daryl KICKS the door shut behind them. Frantically locks
           it just as WHAM-- something SLAMS on the other side of it.
           Shaking the door in its frame.

           Parker's barking at the door now. Daryl clutches the leash,
           pulling him back from it. Parker fights to get free.

           Daryl lets him go. Parker doesn't go for the door. He starts
           moving around the room. Growling at the walls as he goes.

           The demon is moving along the walls outside the Cabin now.

           Parker follows it along the wall to a boarded up window. He
           growls at it when CRASH -- the sound of glass breaking on
           the other side of the wood. It's broken the window.

           BANG - BANG - it slams against the wood, trying to get in.

           Daryl's frozen. Eyes on the wood. Hoping it holds.

           The banging stops. Parker stops barking too. The Cabin goes
           still. The silence is awful.

           Parker moves around the room, from wall to wall, trying to
           find the scent again. Looks like he's lost it.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                 DARYL
                        Is it gone--

           --THUMP. Something HEAVY lands on the roof of the Cabin.
           Dust sprinkles down from the high ceiling above.

           Parker's BARKING up at the ceiling now.

           THUMP... THUMP...THUMP... It's walking across the roof.

           Daryl tracks the sound with his eyes. THUMP...THUMP...THUMP
           It moves to other side of the roof and WHOOSH--

           --A thick cloud of SOOT AND SNOW crashes down into the
           fireplace and sprays into the room. Parker goes wild.

           FRANTIC SCURRYING noises are coming from the fireplace now.
           MOVEMENT in the wall. It's coming down the chimney.

           WE HEAR it crawling down the inside of the wall... Almost at
           the bottom of the fireplace now... Almost in the room...

           Daryl can't get his legs to move.

           Parker suddenly darts into the fireplace. Snarling up into
           the chimney. Barking at it.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Parker, no!

           And Parker's LEASH rises all by itself. The dog YELPS AS
           IT'S PULLED UP INTO THE CHIMNEY BY THE LEASH. He's gone.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        NO!

           Daryl snaps out of his paralysis. Slides across the floor in
           a wild panic and crashes into the fireplace head first.

           Reaches his arm up into the chimney grabbing for Parker.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Parker! Parker!

           Stretching his whole arm up in the wall. Soot falling all
           over his face. Blinding him. The cloud of dust spreading.

           BARKING, SNARLING. Wild movement on the inside of the wall.

           Daryl gets a hold of a paw... pulling... but the demon won't
           let go of the leash. Parker's YELPING. WHIMPERING. BARKING.

           And Daryl pulls Parker's paw down with all his might... and
           drags the dog out from the fireplace and back into the room.

           His leash is gone, slipped off over his head in the chaos.
           Parker whimpers and limps into the corner.

           Daryl pushes the couch against the fireplace. Blocking it.

           We can still hear FRANTIC MOVEMENT inside the wall.

                               (
                                prayers to himself

                        will uphold you with my righteous
                        right hand.

           It's still moving about inside the wall. Daryl prays louder
           this time.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Fear not, for I am with you; be not

                        strengthen you--

           And the noises suddenly cease in the wall. The room quiets.

           It's gone.

           Daryl collapses on the floor on his back. Out of breath.
           Trying to slow his heart. His face black with soot.

           Parker limps over, covered in soot too. Daryl grabs the
           dog's face, emotional. Close to tears.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Don't you ever do that again! You
                        understand me?

           He hugs Parker tight.

                                                            CUT TO:

           MAIN ROOM  - LATER

           Daryl has put up a BARRICADE. The couch, the coffee table,
           the armchair, and a bunch of wood is now piled up against
           the fireplace.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           It's quiet. The room is empty. That's because Daryl's in the

           KITCHEN

           Slouched at the table. Still covered in soot. Holding the
           almost empty WHISKEY BOTTLE.

           Parker sits in the corner, watching Daryl. Soot covered too.

           The Swiss army knife is still sticking out of the top of the
           table. The corkscrew twisted deep into the wood.

           Daryl stares at it with drunken eyes. Takes the last swig of
           whiskey. Holds the bottle up, getting every last drop.

           He puts the bottle down on the table. Slides it away from
           him. The glass moves across the table making a SLIDING
           sound. The bottle comes to a stop.

           He grabs the bottle with an unsteady hand. Starts to slowly
           SLIDE it back and forth on the table.

           That sound. It's taking him somewhere...

           INT. CABIN / HALLWAY - NIGHT    (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           The hallway is dark. 12-year old Daryl emerges from his
           bedroom and stops in the hall.

           A strange SLIDING SOUND is coming from somewhere in the
           Cabin. Like glass moving across wood.

           Daryl follows the sound into the

           MAIN ROOM

           It's even darker in here. The ANIMAL HEADS on the walls
           watch Daryl as he creeps into the room.

           The sound is coming from the kitchen. A flickering light
           glows from inside. Daryl slowly heads into the

           KITCHEN

           The lights are off in here too. The flickering glow is
           coming from the stove. No pots on the burners but all four
           of them are on high. Casting moving shadows on the walls.

           Erin sits at the table in the dark. A nearly empty BOTTLE OF
           WHISKEY next to her. She's deeply concentrated on the
           WHISKEY GLASS in her hand. It's upside down. She's moving it
           across the surface of the table - the source of that sound.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She seems to be in some kind of drunken trance. The flames
           from the stove flicker on her face. It's eerie.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        Mom?

           Erin snaps out of it. Sees Daryl. Smiles. Speaks with a
           slight slur. Obviously she's had a bit too much to drink.

                                 ERIN
                        Hey, baby. What you doing up?
                        Come here and look at this.

           Daryl moves closer. And now he can see...

           Erin has drawn LETTERS and NUMBERS onto the middle of the
           table with a black marker. It's a makeshift Ouija Board.

           Around the inner edges of the table she's drawn odd symbols.
           Triangles with eyes in them. Strange arrows and stars.

           Erin looks up at her son. Her gaze is intense.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        I went to that old bookshop in town
                        last week. There's a woman there who
                        knows about these things. She showed
                        me how to communicate.

                                 YOUNG DARYL

                                confused
                        With who?

           She takes hold of his hand.

                                 ERIN
                        Your father.

           Daryl looks back to the letters on the table... looks back
           to the flames on the stove. Realizes... this is a seance.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        I didn't want to say anything. Didn't
                        want to scare you but... that day in
                        the woods. I saw him. Up in the tree.
                        On the branches.

           Daryl stares numbly at his mother. Not sure if she's joking.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        I've been seeing him a lot more.
                        Walking outside at night. His mouth
                        is moving but I can't... I can't hear

                        He's been talking back.

           She lets go of his hand and grabs the glass to show Daryl.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        He's been leaving messages for me.
                        Letters. I see them everywhere. In
                        the snow. On the trees. He's trying
                        to tell me something. Look...

           She starts to move and slide the glass on the table.

           As she does this We see THE MAGNIFIED LETTERS through the
           bottom of the glass.

                        Please. Stop...

           Slides the glass in a circle. Comes back to the same letter

                                 ERIN
                        A...

           Slides to the last letter.

                        --Mom, stop!

           Daryl slaps the glass off of the table and it rolls onto the
           floor. Erin looks up, emotional. Tears brimming.

                                 ERIN
                        I know you're scared baby but I need
                        to know what he's trying to tell me--

           --Erin tries to stand. Her legs wobbly. Almost pushes the
           table over. Daryl has to hold her to keep her steady.

                                                            CUT TO:

           ERIN'S BEDROOM

           It's dark. Daryl helps his mother into the bed. Pulls the
           cover over her. Straightens her pillow.

                               (
                                                  )
                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                                drunk / dozing off
                        He said he'll come and see you too.
                        S, O, ... O... N....

           And she's asleep. Daryl stares at his mother, concerned. His
           gaze moves to the photo on the wall of Erin and his father.

                                                            CUT TO:

           KITCHEN

           - Daryl picks up the whiskey glass from the floor and puts
           it in the cupboard.

           - He empties the rest of the whiskey bottle into the sink.

           - He cleans the table top with a wet rag. The black ink from
           the symbols and letters are all dripping into each other.

           - He finally gets it all off. The table is completely clean.

           - He's got an OLD CASSETTE TAPE RECORDER. He hides it inside
           the cabinet under the sink. Closes the cabinet doors.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. THE CABIN / KITCHEN - UNKNOWN

           Daryl passed out. His head on the table. His soot covered
           face in a pool of drool. The empty bottle still in his grip.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           After a long beat, he stirs. Sits up with a thick hangover.

           He sees where he is... Sees boarded up windows... Sees
           Parker asleep in the corner.

           He slowly gets his bearings. It's all coming back to him.

           He wobbles over to the kitchen sink. Puts his mouth under
           the faucet and drinks.

           He washes the soot from his face. Some stubble growing in.

           He wets a dishtowel. Starts to clean the soot off of Parker.

           MAIN ROOM

           Daryl uses the claw of the hammer to pry one of the boards
           off of the window. Harsh sunlight comes in and smacks him in
           the face. It's day time.

           He squints, trying to adjust his eyes. Sees something that
           alarms him.

           He moves to the fireplace and pulls down the RIFLE. Goes
           back to a window with it.

           He aims out through the space he removed the wood from.
           Looks through the scope.

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: He can see outside the Cabin through the
           window. There are HOLES all over the snow - the footprints
           the demon left from the night before.

           But we can see them much closer via the scope. The prints
           look like very LARGE CLOVEN HOOVES - like you'd find on a
           cow or deer. And there's a lot of them.

           It's been circling the Cabin all night.

           We track the prints with the scope. They lead away from the
           Cabin, back to the trees at the edge of the WOODS.

           We track the prints to a tall tree. We move up its massive
           trunk... higher up the bark and stop on something...

           Another jagged letter has been scratched into the bark of
           the tree. The letter " A "

           Daryl lowers the rifle. His face, pale. He leans the gun
           against the wall. Starts to board the window back up. Fast.

           KITCHEN

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Daryl sits at the table with a sheet of paper. He writes the
           letter "A" on it.

           FLASH-CUT TO:  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           In Father Liam's KITCHEN. The jagged letter "B " carved into
           the surface of the table.

           Daryl writes the letter "B" in front of the letter "A".

           FLASH-CUT TO:  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Of Erin sliding the whiskey cup across the table, stopping
           on letters. They're magnified on the bottom of the glass.

           He writes the letters from memory. All together they
           spell... B A L A A M

           He crosses out the B  and the A. Circles the remaining
           letters. His face, grave.

           PRE-LAP the solemn voice of Father Liam.

                                 FATHER LIAM (VOICEMAIL)
                           < BEEP >
                        I lied to you. I told you it was
                        gone. The truth is, it never left.

           BEDROOM

           Daryl sits on the bed. The phone in his hand is on speaker.
           Parker lays on the bed next to him. The dog lifts his head
           and whimpers at the sound of Liam's voice.

                                 FATHER LIAM (VOICEMAIL) (cont'd)
                        When it couldn't have your mother, it
                        latched on to you instead. I had no
                        choice but to contain it.

           Daryl is visibly stunned by this news.

                                 FATHER LIAM (VOICEMAIL) (cont'd)
                        A demon cannot move past the Word of
                        God. It was your belief in those
                        words that kept it trapped inside all
                        this time.

           FLASH-CUT TO: Father Liam's BASEMENT. We remember this.
           Young Daryl gluing Bible pages to the wall.

           FLASH-CUT TO: Father Liam's BASEMENT again. Entirely covered
           in Bible pages. The room looks empty. That is until...

           Sudden VIOLENT SCRATCHES rip into the Bible pages. Jagged
           angry lines start to run from the floor... up a wall...
           across the ceiling... back down another wall...

                        knows you're weak--< BEEP >

           In the next messages, there's more panic in Liam's voice.
           Loud angry BANGING noises coming from the B.G. of the call.

                                 FATHER LIAM (VOICEMAIL) (cont'd)
                        Strengthen your walls, Daryl! You
                        mustn't let it out! You mustn't--
                                    < BEEP >
                        I think I found something. A way to
                        end this. I need to see you. < BEEP >

           Daryl hits a button. Replays the last message.

           Off Daryl's face, remembering something.

           MAIN ROOM

           He heads straight to his coat on the rack. Digs in the
           pocket. Pulls out The PAPERS he found on Father Liam's desk.

                                                            CUT TO:

           KITCHEN

           Daryl stands over the table this time. All of the papers
           from Liam's desk are scattered all across it now. He shifts
           them around like pieces to a puzzle. Trying to make sense of
           it all. Still hungover. Fighting to focus.

           He finds a paper with notes. There's some sections circled
           on it. He runs his finger across some of words:

            Sacred Scripture...    Through the Cross...   The Light of Christ...

                        light of Christ.

           He remembers something else... Finds the pages he tore out
           of that book. The sketches of doors with CROSSES cut through
           them. Rays of light shining through the crosses.

           He looks up from the page. Starting to understand it now.

                                                            CUT TO:

           HANDY CAM DISPLAY SCREEN: Daryl continues his tale. The

                        couldn't finish it.

           He picks his head up. Wipes his face. Looks right at us.
           Determination in his eyes now.

           INT. THE CABIN / LAST ROOM - UNKNOWN

           There's a new surge of energy in Daryl now.

           - He takes the bed apart... Removes the headboard... Takes
           the mattress off of the bed frame.

           - He carries all the parts out of the room.

           - One by one he takes all of the furniture out of the room
           until it is completely bare.

           HALLWAY

           He unscrews the hinges from door of the LAST ROOM. Takes the
           entire door off of the frame.

           PRE-LAP the sound of WOOD being sawed into.

           CELLAR

           Parker sniffs around in a corner piled with OLD BOXES.

           All the old furniture Daryl took out from his mother's
           bedroom is down here now.

           The door of the last room is propped up between two shelves.
           Daryl saws through the upper part of it with a HAND SAW.

           He finishes. Puts the saw on a shelf and picks up the door.
           He's carved a LONG CROSS through the upper part of it.

           He angles the door to the light bulb above. The light shines
           through the cross onto Daryl's face.

           He smiles for the first time in a long time. His face bathed
           in the holy light. He closes his eyes. Soaking in this
           moment. It feels like we're witnessing something divine.

           But the moment is interrupted by a loud CRASH--

           --Parker's knocked the pile of boxes down. Some of them have
           fallen in front of him, blocking his path.

           Daryl leans the door against the wall and goes to help him.
           He moves the boxes blocking Parker's way. The dog escapes.

                                 DARYL
                        See? That's what you get for snooping
                        around where you shouldn't be--

           He STOPS. The box he's holding...

           It's full with BOTTLES OF ALCOHOL. Dusty rums and Bourbon.

           He shuts the box as if there were a bomb inside it. He
           heaves it against a wall. Bottles BREAK inside as it lands
           on the floor.

           Parker runs up the steps, startled by the noise.

           Daryl kicks another box, livid. He storms back to the cross-
           door. Glares at it.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Is this another one of your damn
                        tests?! Huh? I'm really trying here,
                        damn it! I'm trying and you're...

           The cross stares back at him.

           He stops. Realizes he's arguing with a door.

           He turns back to the crushed box by the wall. The bottom of
           it is soaked now. Alcohol slowly pooling underneath it.

           It's taking him back to another dark memory...

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           The room is dark except for the glow from the fireplace. The
           light dances in the eyes of the animal heads on the walls.
           Making them feel alive.

           CLOSE ON a RECORD spinning on an old record player on a
           shelf. It's an old song. "Earth Angel" by THE PENGUINS.

           Erin drunkenly dances in the dark with something in her
           hands. It looks like a broom. She's bumping into stuff.
           Knocking shit over. It's sad to watch.

                                 ERIN
                               (

                                singing / slurring
                        Earth angel, earth angel. Will you be
                        mine?

           She's woken up Young Daryl. He comes into the room, still in
           his pajamas. He sees the EMPTY RUM BOTTLE on the floor.

           Erin dances, her dress twirling at her feet. Her hair is
           wild. She sings into the broom like it's a microphone.

           It's too dark to see her face. We catch glimpses of it in
           the light of the fire.

                                 ERIN

                        time.

           Daryl steps closer...

                        ...Mom?

           ...and Erin turns into the light of the fire. Singing into
           the top of the broom...

           Except that's not a broom she's holding. It's the RIFLE.
           She's got the barrel up to her mouth.

                        MOM!

           He tries to pull the gun away from her face but she holds on
           to it. They struggle for it. But all the while she keeps
           dancing, pulling him into her eerie waltz with her.

           YOUNG DARYL'S POV: Spinning with his mother. Her hair
           obscuring her face. Round and round they go.

           And every time she passes the fire, we catch a glimpse of
           her face in the light.

           It's changing...

           Elongating. Her chin and cheek bones, protruding. Her lips
           widening into a smile that would make the Joker cringe. 

                                 YOUNG DARYL (cont'd)
                        Mom! Let go! Mom, stop! Please!

                               (
                                 ERIN
                                       )
                                singing
                        I'm just a fool. A fool in love with
                        you.

           Daryl manages to pull the gun from her grasp. She twirls 
           and lands on the couch. Daryl backs away with the rifle.

           EERRRRRR -- He stops the record. The room quiets. Just the
           CRACKLING of the fire.

           Erin doesn't get up from the couch. The fire plays tricks on
           our eyes. Her face keeps changing shape. Extending...

           Daryl runs to a light switch. Turns it on.

           Erin's face is normal again. Her eyes drunk and heavy.

                                 ERIN
                               (

                        Earth angel, earth angel. Please be
                        mine.

           She nods off. Passes out on the couch.

                                                            CUT TO:

           KITCHEN

           Young Daryl standing on a chair. Takes all the bottles of
           alcohol from the cupboards and packs them into a box.
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                                            CUT TO:

           CELLAR

           Young Daryl carries this heavy box down the steps and hides
           it way in the back, deep within a pile of the other boxes.

           INT. THE CABIN / CELLAR - UNKNOWN

           And now our Daryl stands here. Staring at the crushed box he
           hid down here so many years ago.

                                                      CUT TO: LATER

           HALLWAY

           Daryl screws the cross-door back on the hinges. He closes
           it. Steps back and admires his work. He can see right
           through the cross and into the empty room behind it.

           MAIN ROOM

           Daryl's at the book shelf. Takes down all the BIBLES he can
           find on it. He pauses on that MAHOGANY BOX, stares at it for
           a beat. Then turns away from it.

           Grabs another bible and carries an armful down the HALLWAY.

           EXT. CABIN - DUSK

           The sun's ending its shift. The bare branches of trees cast
           long twisted shadows in the snow. Like crooked arms.
           Stretching toward The Cabin...

           PRE-LAP the TWHACK-TWHACK of a staple gun in use.

           INT. THE CABIN / LAST ROOM - SAME

           TWHACK. Daryl steps down from a ladder. He's holding the
           staple gun. We follow his gaze up to the ceiling and see...

           The entire ceiling has been covered with BIBLE PAGES.

           One of the Bibles lies open on the floor. Half empty.

           He picks it up. Tears a page out, careful not to lose any of
           the words. CLOSE ON a page he tears out.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 FATHER LIAM (V.O.)
                        You do know that defacing a Bible is
                        sacrilegious, right?

           INT. AN OLD CHURCH - DAY   (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           12-year-old Daryl sits in a pew wearing a white ALTER BOY
           ROBE. A backpack by his side. He's writing in a Bible.

           A younger FATHER LIAM (50s) stops at the pew. He wears his
           priest collar. The church is empty except for them.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        I'm just making some notes.

           Liam enters the pew and sits next to Daryl.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Anything I can help with?

           Daryl closes the Bible. Looks up at Liam.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        Father Liam, do you know anything
                        about exorcisms?

           Liam's face sours.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Why the fascination with such a
                        morbid topic?

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        I'm just curious.

           Liam eyes the boy. Sensing there's something more to this.

                                 YOUNG DARYL (cont'd)
                        How do you perform an exorcism on
                        someone?

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Well, that depends on what stage of
                        the possession the person is in.
                               (
                                                )
                                off Daryl's look
                        If the demon gets inside you, it's
                        extremely difficult to remove. It's
                        safer to perform an exorcism before
                        it invades the host - to undo the
                        latching. This is when the demon is
                        most vulnerable to the Word of God,
                        when it's outside the body.

           CONTINUED:

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        But how do you perform one?

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        The church requires an exorbitant
                        amount of proof before it can confirm
                        that there is actual demonic
                        possession. And if given permission
                        to move forward, the rite can only be
                        performed by an ordained priest...

           He eyes Daryl sternly.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        ...Not a twelve year old alter boy.

           Daryl's clutching the backpack now. Liam notices.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        What's really going on here, Daryl?

           Daryl takes a long time to answer.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        I think my mother is being possessed.

           Liam frowns. Daryl unzips the backpack and pulls out the
           TAPE RECORDER.

                                 YOUNG DARYL (cont'd)
                        I hid this in the kitchen. She sits
                        in there all night... talking to
                        something.

           CLICK. He hits play. We slowly PUSH IN on the SPINNING
           SPOOLS of the tape. It's very poor audio. Mostly just
           HISSING. But somewhere inside it we can just barely make out
           Erin's voice. It's faint. Hard to hear what she's saying.

           PUSH IN closer on the spools until they are all we see.

           Somewhere deeper in the hiss is another voice. It sounds
           deeper. Manly. Responding to her. We can't make out what
           it's saying. But it's not any language we ever heard.

           CLICK. Daryl stops the tape.

                                 YOUNG DARYL (cont'd)
                        Does that count as exorbitant proof?

           Liam stares down at the recorder. Pity on his face. He
           considers his next words.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Daryl, it's no secret your mother has
                        been dealing with her own demons for
                        some time, but I assure you, hers
                        don't come from the fiery pits of
                        hell.

           Daryl looks away. Liam sees he needs more.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        Have you prayed for her?

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        I don't think a prayer is going to
                        help, father.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        You came here asking about an
                        exorcism, right? Well, what do you
                        think an exorcism is?

           Daryl takes this in. Never thought of it quite like that.

           Liam takes the recorder. Brings it to his lips. Hits record.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        Fear not, for I am with you; be not
                        dismayed, for I am your God; I will
                        strengthen you, I will help you, I
                        will uphold you with my righteous
                        right hand.

           He hits stop and hands the recorder back to Daryl.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        Is that for her?

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        That's for you. Just a little
                        reminder for the times you forget.
                               (
                                    )
                                then
                        Go on. I'll stop by tomorrow and see
                        how she's doing.

           Daryl zips the recorder back up in his backpack. He actually
           manages a smile. Hope in his face.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. THE CABIN / LAST ROOM - NIGHT

           THWACK -- Daryl staples the last empty spot on the back
           wall. It's completely covered with Bible pages.

           Only three more walls to go. Oh, and the floor.

           He tears out another page. Gets ready to start on the next
           wall when--

           --The light starts to flicker above. Daryl looks up to it.

                                 DARYL
                        No... Please No-no-no-no-no--

           ...and it goes out, putting the room in total darkness.

           IN THE DARKNESS. We hear the sound of the cellar hatch
           opening. Daryl comes down the steps using the light from his
           phone to guide his way. We're no longer in the Last Room.

           We're in the CELLAR

           He shines the phone along the shelves of tools and junk,
           searching for something. The light comes to stop on an an
           old FLASHLIGHT. He snatches it up.

           MAIN ROOM

           It's pitch black in here. The only light we have now is from
           that flashlight. Daryl paces back and forth with it in his
           hand. The beam moves erratically around the dark room.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Shit! Shit! Shit!

           He stops pacing. Coming to terms with his situation. There's
           no way around it.

           He takes his coat from the rack. Roughly puts it on. He
           shines the light around, looking for Parker.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Parker. Here boy. Parker.

           Parker steps into the light. Daryl kneels. Holds the dog's
           face close to his.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Stay close to me. Don't wander off. I
                        need you OK. I need you.

           Parker licks Daryl's face. Good boy.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Daryl moves to the door. He watches the dog closely, waiting
           for some kind of sign but Parker seems fine.

           Daryl slowly unlocks the door. Holds the knob. Looks back to
           Parker again. Nothing from the dog. It must be safe. Right?

           He opens the door...

           EXT. THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           They come on to the porch. Daryl shuts the door behind them.

           The SUV is right where he left it. Its bumper parked right
           up to the porch steps. The trunk is still open. The backseat
           is filled with snow now.

           Daryl shines the light in front of him. Scanning the snow.
           No footprints. The coast looks clear.

                                 DARYL
                        Come on, boy. Stay close.

           Daryl hurries off the porch. Parker follows him to the

           BACK OF THE CABIN

           Daryl, moving fast. Boots CRUNCHING in the snow. The light
           guiding the way. He makes it to the shed and STOPS.

           What is that?

           He brings the light up to the door of the shed...

           Another crude letter has been scratched in the middle of the
           door. The letter  " L "

           Daryl, frozen. Just stares at the door.

           But Parker's GROWL snaps him back to the moment. He turns
           and sees Parker's shoulders arched. Growling at the dark
           WOODS behind the Cabin. The dog senses something.

           Got to move fast.

           Daryl pulls the keys out... Tries to open the lock... His
           hands shaking... He drops the keys in the snow... Shit!

           Can't see where they went... He drops to his knees...
           Frantically searches for them in the snow with the light

           Shit! Where are they?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Parker's growling is getting louder.

           Daryl, pushes snow around... Searching wildly... Finally
           finds the keys... And he's back on his feet... back at the
           lock... gets the door open... Hurries into the...

           SHED

           Hands shaking... He finds the oil can... Pours oil in the
           generator... Spilling some... Empties the whole can in it.

           Parker's BARKING now. Shit!

           Daryl pulls the ripcord... But of course... Nothing's
           happening. The generator's not coming on.

                        No-no-no. Not now. Not now! Please!

           He keeps pulling. Yanks harder. A little too hard--

           --The cord rips in half! Fuck!!

           Parker's outside BARKING like mad now.

           Daryl, frantic. Digs a key into the hole, trying to get the
           other half of the cord... digging...digging... He's got it!

           He wraps the cord around his finger... yanks... and yanks...
           and the generator finally comes to life. Thank God!

           And Daryl's out of the shed. Slams the door shut. Locks it.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Parker! Parker!

           But Parker's too busy BARKING at the dark woods. At whatever
           he sees coming. Daryl runs over to the dog. He shines the
           light up at the dark woods. But of course, he can't see it.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Come on, boy! Inside! Inside!

           Parker turns and follows. They run back together.

           WE CHASE AFTER THEM... Parker in the lead...

           Daryl running behind him... Slipping in the snow...

           Shining the light back AT US, trying to keep us at bay.

           WE FOLLOW THEM... To the front of the Cabin...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Up the porch steps... closing in on them....

           We're so close... Daryl pushes the front door open....

           They stumble inside...

           WE TRY TO FOLLOW but the door SLAMS in our face.

           WE STAY on this door as night turns into day.

           A hand KNOCKS on the door. PULL BACK TO REVEAL this hand
           belongs to a younger Father Liam. He's in his coat and hat.

           We're back in Daryl's memory...

           EXT. THE CABIN - MORNING    (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Erin answers the door with the warmest smile. She's still in
           her night gown. Just woken up.

                                 ERIN
                        Father Liam? What a nice surprise.

           INT. THE CABIN / DARYL'S BEDROOM - DAY  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Not your typical 12-year-old boy's bedroom. No posters on
           the wall. No toys. It's mostly bare. A small book case in
           the corner. A few books in it.

           The same CROSS hangs above his bed. It's newer. Not crooked.

           Daryl sits on the bed, vigorously cleaning the RIFLE.

           Father Liam stops at the door. Watches how well Daryl
           handles the weapon. Liam senses the maturity of this boy.
           Hardened by circumstances. Forced to grow up too fast.

           He knocks at the door. Daryl looks up from the gun.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        May I?

           Daryl moves over some. Liam sits next to him on the bed.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        I spoke to your mother...

           Daryl waits, anxious to hear what Liam will say.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        She told me about the night in the
                        kitchen. Sounds like she just had a
                        little too much to drink. She gave
                        you quite a scare but that's all it
                        was. We had a nice long chat about
                        it. She's going to get help.

           Daryl, deflated. Goes back to cleaning the gun.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                               (
                                       )
                                fishing
                        Did your father teach you how to do
                        that?

           Daryl doesn't answer his question. He's got some of his own.

                               (
                                 YOUNG DARYL
                                               )
                                doesn't look up
                        What do demons look like?

           Daryl's obviously not letting this go. Liam goes along with
           it for now.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Demons? Well, they walk among us
                        everyday but we can't see them with
                        our eyes. They can however, take on
                        the forms of others to trick us.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        So it can look like me? Or you?

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Not living people. They can only
                        mimic the dead. People that have
                        passed on. Empty vessels without
                        souls.

           Daryl aims the gun at the window. Puts his eye to the scope.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        When it comes back I'm going to kill
                        it.

           Liam's tone gets serious. He's entertained this long enough.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Daryl, look at me.

           Daryl lowers the gun.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        There is no demon here. I can assure
                        you of that. And even if there was,
                        it can't be killed by the weapons of
                        man. Here...

           Liam carefully takes the rifle from Daryl's hands and rests
           it in a corner. He takes the CROSS off the wall. Takes a
           BIBLE from a shelf and puts them in Daryl's palms.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                               (
                                         )
                                re: cross
                        This is your rifle.
                               (
                                         )
                                re: Bible
                        These are the bullets.

           Daryl stares down at the items in his hands.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        The Word is the only weapon against
                        the adversary.
                               (
                                    )
                                then
                        But first, we must defeat our demons
                        on the inside before we battle the
                        ones on the outside.

           Off Daryl's face, taking these words in.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. CABIN / BATHROOM - DAY (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Young Daryl sits in the tub, angry. Father Liam sits on a
           chair on the outside of the tub. The closed shower curtain
           separates them. This is their makeshift CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Whatever it is that's weighing you
                        down, this is the time to let go of
                        it. Let the Lord carry your burden so
                        that you can be free.

           Daryl is mute. Stares down into the tub. The silence is
           awkward. Father Liam's SILHOUETTE is on the other side of
           the shower curtain. He's nodding, encouraging Daryl on.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (cont'd)
                        Cast your burden up to the Lord and
                        He shall sustain you--

           --RIP-- Daryl tears the curtain aside. Jumps out of the tub
           and storms out the room. Liam just shakes his head.
           INT. CABIN / MAIN ROOM - DAY (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Daryl stands at the window. Peeking through the blinds.

           WINDOW POV: Erin and Father Liam are in front of the Cabin,
           saying their goodbyes. The priest gets in his car and drives
           off. Erin waves after it. The car disappears down the path.

           But Erin remains out in the cold long after it's gone. Her
           lips are moving. It looks like she's talking to someone.

           And then she turns and looks back at the window. Right at
           Daryl. At us. Daryl quickly snaps the blinds shut.

           PRE-LAP the sound of a staple gun in use. THWACK-- THWACK--

           INT. THE CABIN / LAST ROOM - NIGHT

           THWACK... THWACK. Daryl's hard at work stapling pages to the
           walls. He's covered up all four of them including the
           ceiling. The only thing left to do is the floor.

           He's sweaty. Exhausted. But he can't stop. He starts to tear
           pages from another Bible when he hears...

           Parker WHIMPERING. Uh oh...

           Daryl stops. Puts the pages down. Heads out the room.

           HALLWAY

           Daryl hurries up the hall into the...

           MAIN ROOM

           Parker's moving around, frantic. Something's got him upset.

                                 DARYL
                        What is it?

           Parker's whining at the BARRICADE in front of the fireplace.

           Daryl stares at the piled up furniture.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        What? In there?

           Parker's circling him now, whimpering.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Shh! Quiet!

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Daryl strains his ears. Hears nothing. It's quiet.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        There's nothing there.

           But Parker keeps whining. Daryl studies the dog. Parker
           doesn't look scared or on alert. There is no threat. He
           keeps pawing at the barricade. Trying to tell him something.

           Daryl frowns. Parker hasn't been wrong yet.

           Very slowly, Daryl starts to take apart the barricade until
           it's only the couch that's left. He looks back to Parker.

           Parker's pawing at the couch. Whimpering.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        OK, OK.

           Daryl slowly pulls the couch away from the fireplace.

           He grabs the old flashlight from the shelf. Shines it into
           the fire place...

           But there's nothing in the hearth but wood. The wood is
           noticeably darker and wet. What is that?

           Parker moves closer to the fireplace. Daryl blocks his path.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Wait! Stay! Stay!

           Parker obeys. Daryl slowly moves to the fireplace. Kneels
           inside it. Shines the light up into the chimney.

           DARYL'S POV: The light bounces around the dark walls,
           searching... And then it lands on something. It looks like a
           WET BLACK BAG wedged into the space above. There's a ROPE
           dangling down from it. It's reachable.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        What is that?

           Only one way to find out. Daryl stretches his free arm up...
           reaching for the rope.

           Parker watches from a distance, whimpering.

           Daryl's got his whole shoulder up in the wall now.
           Stretching... grunting... almost got it... almost...

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        I think I got it...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           He pulls the rope hard and --THUMP-- the BAG comes down and
           lands in the hearth in a cloud of dirt and soot.

           Daryl, COUGHS. Waves the cloud from his face. He's got a
           hold of the rope still. Keeps pulling. Gets the bag out of
           the hearth and drags it into the room. It's covered in soot.

           And that's when he sees that he's not holding a rope...

           It's a BELT. A make-shift leash.

           And that's not a bag he just dragged out.

           It's PARKER. A very dead Parker.

           And Daryl's holding the "leash" that's wrapped around the
           dead Parker's neck.

           A gaping hole in the dog's throat. Looks like something big
           took a huge chunk out of it.

           And there's something else...

           A single jagged letter has been craved into the dog's side.
           Ripped right into the fur. A twisted letter  "A "

           Daryl stares at the dead dog. His mind fighting to process
           what he's seeing. But he already knows...

           The room falls silent. Like the air's been sucked out of it.

           Daryl slowly rises to his feet. Slowly turns around...

           The OTHER PARKER is sitting by the door. Statue still.

           It's eyes are different now. No pupils. SOLID BLACK.

           It stares at Daryl. Doesn't blink. Doesn't breathe. Nothing.
           Like the taxidermy on the walls above.

           Daryl's blood runs cold because he knows...

           This is the Demon.

           It's been here with him all this time.

           The demon doesn't move. Just watches Daryl.

           DEMON POV: We're watching a very petrified Daryl staring at
           us. He takes a cautious step backwards...

           Daryl slowly backs away towards the hall.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                             )
                        Fear not, for I am with you; be not

                        strengthen you, I will--

           --and he bolts down the HALLWAY.

           The dog bolts after him. Faster than Parker could ever move.

           It's right on Daryl's heels as he dives and slides into the

           LAST ROOM

           Daryl rolls inside. Scrambles up on his knees. And sees...

           The dog has stopped right at the threshold of the door. It
           won't enter the room. It just sits there. Statue still.

           DEMON POV: Daryl on his knees. Behind him, the words on the
           walls are glowing slightly.

           Upon seeing the walls, the dog turns and runs away.

           WE FOLLOW IT as it runs back up the HALLWAY... into the MAIN
           ROOM and -- CRACK -- Goes headfirst into the bottom half of
           the door. Leaving a massive hole in it.

           THROUGH THE HOLE we watch the dog run into the snow and
           disappear into the dark woods beyond.

           LAST ROOM

           Daryl, shaking on his knees. Adrenaline coursing through
           him. He collapses on the floor on his back.

                                                      MATCH-CUT TO:

           INT. THE CABIN / DARYL'S BEDROOM - MORNING (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           Young Daryl laying on his back, asleep in bed. We can see
           his breath. It's cold in here.

           The WHISTLE OF A TEA KETTLE, rising from outside his door.

           Daryl wakes. Sits up, half asleep. Shivers from the cold.

           He gets out of bed. Gets dressed in a hat, sweater and
           jeans. He steps into his boots.
           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Young Daryl enters the room.

           The front door is wide open. A trail of wet snow comes in
           from the doorway leading to the Cabin.

           VOICES coming from the KITCHEN. Erin is talking to someone.

           But a wall blocks Daryl from seeing into the room. He slowly
           moves along the wall, creeping to the edge of it. He peers
           around it into the KITCHEN. From here he can see...

           The fire is high on the stove. The kettle is SHRIEKING now.

           Daryl inches closer past the wall...

           Now he can see Erin sitting at the table. Giggling. Very
           drunk. Still in her nightgown. Disheveled. An empty BOTTLE
           OF WHISKEY on the table next to her.

           Her arm is outstretched over the table like she's holding
           someone's hand.

           The wall still blocks our view of whoever it is. Daryl
           finally comes around the wall and enters the...

           KITCHEN

           And now he can see the other side of the table.

           There is no one there. Erin is alone.

           She doesn't seem to notice Daryl is here. Nor does she
           notice the screaming kettle on the stove.

           Daryl turns the flame off. The kettle dies down. Quiet.

           Erin finally turns to her son. Delighted to see him. When
           she talks we can see her breath. It's really cold in here.

                                 ERIN
                        Daryl, you're up!

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        You didn't hear the kettle?

                                 ERIN
                        I was just making some tea for your
                        father.

           Daryl looks at the EMPTY CHAIR on the other side. It's two
           feet away from the table. Slightly turned toward us.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Erin stares at Daryl, expectantly.

                                 ERIN (cont'd)
                        Well, aren't you gonna come give your
                        daddy a hug? He's been waiting up all
                        night to see you.

           WE PUSH IN on the empty chair. It sits still. Ominous.

                               (
                                 ERIN (cont'd)

                                stern
                        Daryl, don't be rude to your father.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        Mom... there's no one there.

                                 ERIN
                        Young man, stop being silly. Come
                        over and give him a hug, right now.

           WE KEEP PUSHING IN on the empty chair. It sits there, askew.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        Mom! Dad's not here. Dad's dead--

           --SCRAAAAAAPE! THE CHAIR S-L-O-W-L-Y TURNS ON THE FLOOR. ALL
           ON ITS OWN. NOW IT'S TURNED, FACING DARYL.

           Daryl GASPS. Erin glares at her son.

                                 ERIN
                        Why would you say something horrible
                        like that, Daryl? Now you've got him
                        all upset. You know how he gets when
                        you upset him.

           Daryl can't move. Eyes glued to the chair.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        ...Mom. Let go of it.

                                 ERIN
                        What?

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        Get away from it! Don't touch it!

           The urgency in his voice makes Erin snatch her hand back.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                alarmed

                        Charles, please. He didn't mean it.

           THE CHAIR LEANS BACK SLIGHTLY ON ITS BACK LEGS AND COMES
           BACK DOWN. WHATEVER IS IN IT HAS JUST STOOD UP.

           FLOORBOARDS CREAK. IT'S MOVING. COMING TOWARDS DARYL.

           Daryl backs away into the cupboard behind him.

           Remembers...

           He turns and flings open the cupboard. Pulls out the TAPE
           RECORDER he keeps hidden there.

           CREAK... CREAK... CREAK... It's coming...

           Daryl spins around with the recorder. He hits play - CLICK -

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (TAPE RECORDER)
                        Fear not, for I am with you; be not
                        dismayed, for I am your God; I will
                        strengthen you, I will help you--

           --AND THE FLOORBOARDS ABRUPTLY CREAK BACKWARDS THIS TIME. IT
           MOVES AWAY FROM DARYL. AWAY FROM THE RECORDER.

           BACK TO THE TABLE. AND THE EMPTY CHAIR SUDDENLY FLIES UP
           FROM THE FLOOR AND CRASHES UP TO THE CEILING AND BREAKS INTO
           PIECES. THEY CLATTER BACK ONTO THE FLOOR.

                                 ERIN
                        Charles! Stop it!

           She gets up and runs to her son. Pushes him out into the

           MAIN ROOM

           In the chaos, Daryl drops the recorder. It hits the floor
           and stops. He tries to go back for it but Erin keeps pushing
           him along.

           HEAVY STOMPING BEHIND THEM. IT'S FOLLOWING THEM.

           They almost make it to the front door when -- WHAM -- ERIN
           IS SLAMMED ON THE FLOOR BY AN INVISIBLE FORCE.

           Daryl grabs her hand to pull her up. She gets back on her
           feet and --WHAM-- SHE'S SLAMMED BACK DOWN TO THE FLOOR.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           We can see the impression of something on her nightgown and
           her skin. SOMETHING HEAVY is pressing down on her back. Her
           eyes are bugling. She can't breathe.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        MOM!!

           Daryl's still got her hand. Pulling. But he can't move her.
           She's been pinned to the floor.

           HER PUPILS BEGIN TO DILATE. TWICE THEIR SIZE. TAKING OVER
           BOTH HER EYES, TURNING THEM SOLID BLACK.

           She screams. Her mouth WIDENING.

           AND HER SCREAM IS CUT SHORT AS A LARGE LUMP BULGES DOWN HER
           THROAT AND MOVES DOWN INTO HER CHEST. 

           And it's Daryl's turn to scream now.

           He lets go of his mother's hand and runs out the FRONT DOOR.

           Leaving her behind...

                                                            CUT TO:

           HANDY CAM DISPLAY SCREEN: We're back to the tape. Daryl and
           the box. He's shaken up. Can barely look up at us.

                                 DARYL (VIDEO)
                        My mother used to tell me about this
                        thing called culling. It's a hunting
                        technique - when you separate an
                        animal from their herd. You isolate
                        it from its pack so the kill will be
                        easier.
                               (
                                coming to terms with
                                this)
                        I thought I was the one trapping it
                        but maybe it's the other way around.

           Looks up at the camera. His face, the gravest we've seen it.

                                 DARYL (VIDEO) (cont'd)
                        It's made physical contact. It... It
                        touched me. Which means it's ready to
                        move to the next stage. It's ready to
                        get inside.

           That RUMBLING begins to rise from somewhere...
           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Daryl SLAMS a slat of WOOD against the front door.  
           Frantically boards up the HOLE at the bottom of it.

           He's sweaty. Feverish. Losing it. The hammer's moving way
           too fast in his hands. The RUMBLING rising in his head...

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           CELLAR

           The RUMBLING follows Daryl down the steps. He's wrapped
           Parker in some old blankets. Carries the dog in his arms.

           He gently lays him on an old wooden SNOW SLED. Keeps his
           hand on the body for a long moment. Saying his goodbyes.

           Anger welling up in his eyes. His face hardening. Jaw
           clinching.

           His only friend.

           Gone.

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           The box he threw at the wall earlier. The bottom is soaked
           through. He opens the top. Most of the bottles are broken
           now. He finds TWO that are still intact. Snatches them up.

           The rumbling growing in his ears...

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           BATHROOM

           And now those bottles are in the tub. Two dusty WHISKEYS.
           Daryl cleans them off with a towel.

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           He's twisting the cork out of one the bottles with the Swiss
           army knife. His hands, shaking way too much. He can't get
           the cork out.

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           He tears it out with his teeth instead... Spits the cork
           out... Throws his head back... And guzzles the bottle down.

           He can't drink it fast enough.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The RUMBLING, deafening now. Shaking the walls of the room.

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           MAIN ROOM

           The RUMBLING continues. Everything's shaking, disorienting.
           Dizzying. Nauseating.

           Daryl staggers. Drunk as fuck. Looking to hurt something.

           He finds a victim. The old record player. Pulls it off the
           shelf... brings it high over his head and... SMASHES it on
           the floor. 

           He spins. Almost loses his balance. Searching for his next
           victim - the coffee table. He flips it over.

           What else? The bookshelf. He brings it down, CRASHING to the
           floor. The MAHOGANY BOX coming down with it.

           The ANIMAL HEADS watch from above. It almost looks like
           they're grinning. Like they're enjoying the show.

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           HALLWAY

           The RUMBLING shaking the walls of the hall.

           Daryl in front of the cross-door. Bottle in hand. Almost
           empty. Slurring at the door. Pacing back and forth.

                                 DARYL
                        Look at me. This is your fault. You
                        made me this way!. 
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        "Just say the words and I shall be
                        healed", right?

           He gets right up on the door. Face to face with the cross.

                        THEN FIX ME!

           The cross just stares back at him.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Even after everything that happened,
                        I still came to you. I was always
                        there. But you... You...

                                this really hits him
                        Are you even here now?! Were you
                        ever?! Huh?!

           He waits for an answer.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        SAY! SOMETHING!

           But the door is silent. Daryl finishes the bottle. Drops it
           on the floor.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Fine. Guess I'll just have to do this
                        myself.

           He storms off. Back up the hall.

           CROSS-DOOR POV: We're in the LAST ROOM now, watching Daryl
           through the cross. Watching him walk away from us...

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           MAIN ROOM

           Daryl ransacking the drawers of a desk. Pulls some out.
           Throwing them on the floor. Searching for something...

           BULLETS. He's found some. A few boxes in fact.

                                                       HARD-CUT TO:

           KITCHEN

           The rumbling stops abruptly. The Cabin is quiet. The walls
           are no longer shaking. 

           A very drunk Daryl is slouched on the chair. Completely
           disheveled. Tears flowing. His coat and and hat are on.

           Bullets all over the table, scattered on top of Liam's
           papers. He's loading the RIFLE. Dropping more bullets on the
           floor than he's loading into the gun.

                                  DARYL

                        It touched me... I felt it... which
                        means I can touch it back. It can
                        feel... It can hurt...

           He cocks the rifle. A casing flies out past his face.

           He gets up. Grabs a handful of bullets and stuffs them in
           his coat pocket. Grabs more. Stuffs them. He staggers out.

           EXT. THE CABIN - NIGHT

           It's snowing.

           The front door swings open. Daryl comes out with the rifle.

           He storms off the porch -- past the SUV and -- BANG -- lets
           a shot off into the sky. Lighting up the night.

                                 DARYL
                        Come on!

           BANG! BANG! He shoots at the dark WOODS. The flash of the
           shot illuminating the rage in his face. Casings flying out.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Where are you?! Come on!

           He stops right at the edge of the trees.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        I know you're in there!

           BANG! BANG! FLASHES of light. Daryl, SCREAMING. Snot and
           tears. Years of rage all coming out now. The noise echoing
           into the night. He keeps shooting at everything and nothing.
           BANG! BANG! BANG! Cocks it. Casings flip out onto the snow.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Come on! I'm right here!

           He runs back to the SUV... Pulling bullets out his pocket...
           Dropping some in the snow... Reloading as he goes...

           He reaches the SUV and STOPS in his tracks...

           On one side of the car, the fifth jagged letter has been
           scratched into it. From door to door. Another " A "

           Daryl's eyes flare up, fuming now. He flings the driver door
           open. Jumps behind the wheel. Starts it...

           INT. SUV / MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           He SLAMS the gas. The SUV shoots forward. Skidding. Snow
           shooting from the tires. Speeding for the WOODS... Straight
           for the trees. Going too fast. About to crash into them--

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           --But he BRAKES just in time. Comes to a hard stop right at
           the edge of the woods. He turns on the HIGH BEAMS.

           Lighting up the trees ahead. An ominous army of twisted
           giant trunks standing before him in the WINDSHIELD.

           He presses the horn hard. Keeps his hand on it. It
           BLAAAAAAAAAARES LOUD, echoing into the night.

                                 DARYL
                        COME ON!

           He stops. The last remnants of the horn echo in the woods.
           And then they die out. Leaving only the wind in the trees.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Daryl steps out of the car with the rifle. Leaves the door
           open. He stands before the trees. His fast breaths steaming
           up the cold air.

                               (
                                 DARYL
                                weaker / lower
                                              )
                        Come on... come on...

           But there's no sign of the dog. Just the trees.

           Let's try this another way.

           Daryl climbs up on the hood of the SUV. Up to the roof. Legs
           wobbling. Almost falls. Finds his balance. Stands on the
           roof of the SUV. 

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Our Father who art in heaven!

           His shouts echo into the night.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Hallowed be thy name!

           The wind seems to be picking up some. He hears it.

           It's working...

           He holds the rifle up. Eye in the scope. Turning. Searching.

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: We're doing a three sixty turn with him,
           searching for the dog. But all we see are dark trees.

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        Thy kingdom come!

           CONTINUED:

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: We complete the 3-60 turn. Still nothing.

                                 DARYL (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Thy will be done!

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: We're doing another 360 turn. Searching...

                                 DARYL (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        On earth as it is in heaven!

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: And when we come back around we catch a
           quick glimpse of--

           --FATHER LIAM CLIMBING DOWN A TREE. HEAD FIRST.

           Daryl does a double take. Swings the rifle back--

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: Father Liam is in his priest collar. He
           sits in the snow on all fours like a dog. Legs out on the
           sides. Statue still. Just beyond the reach of the lights.

           Daryl pulls his eye away from the scope. Shaken at the sight
           of his dead friend. Shakes his head side to side.

                                 DARYL
                        No... it's not you. Not you. Not you.

           He brings the rifle back up to his eye. Swaying. Tries to
           keep still and lock on his target.

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: His aim is drunken, unsteady. Double
           vision. Struggles to get Liam in the cross-hairs. Almost got
           it. Almost...

           He pulls the trigger -- BANG!

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: He hits the tree next to Liam. Wood
           splinters in the bark. Liam doesn't budge.

           Daryl tries again -- BANG!

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: Misses again. A burst of white explodes
           where the bullet struck. Leaving a hole in the snow.

           Daryl roars. Aims again and BANG! BANG! BANG!

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: He keeps missing. Snow and tree bark
           explode all around Liam. The crouched priest never moves.

           Daryl aims again. CLICK - CLICK. He's empty.

           He pulls out more bullets. Loads as fast as he can. Dropping
           most of them on the roof. Swings the rifle up to his eye--

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: Liam is gone.

           Daryl climbs down to the hood. Jumps down to the snow. Runs
           into THE WOODS.

           The glow of the high beams cast an eerie light through the
           trees. Long twisted shadows of branches move about in the
           snow. It feels like the woods are alive.

           The sounds of FAST CRUNCHING coming from all around him,
           echoing through the trees. Liam is moving. FAST.

           Daryl, rifle up. Follows the sounds deeper in to the dark
           woods. Trying to lock on Liam with the scope.

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: We're darting around chaotically, 
           following the crunching. Liam is FAST. We catch QUICK
           GLIMPSES of him running on all fours, ducking behind trees.

           BANG! BANG! BANG! Daryl shoots. The woods light up. Tree
           trunks splinter. Snow explodes. But Liam is way too fast.

           Daryl stops. Stays still, swaying a bit. The crunching stops
           too. The woods are quiet. Daryl does a 360 with the scope.

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: And finds Liam on all fours. Eerily still.
           BLACK EYES staring right through the scope. Glinting in the
           headlights. His smile is way too wide. Way too many teeth...

           Daryl's got him. He pulls the trigger and -- CLICK.

           SHIT! He's empty.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        No! NOOOOOO!

           He reloads fast. Hands shaking in the cold. Bullets falling
           through his fingers. He swings the rifle back up--

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: It's ALL BLACK now. We can't see a thing.

           He brings the gun down and sees what's blocking the scope--

           --IT'S LIAM! STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF DARYL NOW!!

           Daryl yells in surprise.

           LIAM SUDDENLY THRUSTS DARYL BACKWARDS -- DARYL GOES FLYING
           OFF OF HIS FEET -- SLAMS HIS BACK HARD AGAINST A TREE.

           He falls back in the snow, gasping. The wind knocked out of
           him. He climbs to his feet and runs in a wild panic...
           hunched over... in pain... still clutching the rifle...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Hurting bad... Can't breathe... Hard to run... He plunges
           himself forward... falling face first in the snow... Snow
           all over his face... All in his mouth...

           He gets back up... gasping... crawling now... He makes it
           out of THE WOODS... dragging himself to the headlights... 
           Loses the rifle... Collapses by the car... Can't go on...

           He lies there on his back in the snow. Out of breath. Out of
           fight.

           AND FROM THE WOODS...

           DEMON POV: We're moving through the trees approaching Daryl.
           He's a good fifty feet away. WE HEAR the demon's steps
           CRUNCHING in the snow.

           ON DARYL. He doesn't move. Just lies there. Defeated.
           Exhausted. His eyes wet, staring up at the dark sky.

           DEMON POV: Coming closer. We're forty five feet away now.
           CRUNCHING closer.

           ON THE SNOW. It's leaving CLOVEN FOOTPRINTS in its wake.

           ON DARYL. Drunk. Hurt. Crying. Can barely get the words out.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        please...

           DEMON POV: CRUNCH... CRUNCH... CRUNCH... Thirty feet away...

           ON DARYL.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Lord please... I need you...  I need you...

           And in the background BEHIND HIM. VIA THE HIGH BEAMS, WE SEE
           HOLES POPPING UP IN THE SNOW. THE DEMON CRUNCHING CLOSER...

           Twenty feet away...

           ON DARYL. Hears the CRUNCHING coming.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I

                        I will strengthen you...

           CRUNCH CRUNCH. Fifteen feet away...

           ON DARYL. Eyes closed. Crying hard. Praying to the sky.

                        with my righteous right hand...

           A beat. Only the wind. And the CRUNCHING. Getting closer.

           And then...

           From the open door of the SUV comes that familiar voice...

                                 FEMALE GPS
                        In one hundred feet, you will reach
                        your destination.

           And Daryl's eyes open... Did he just hear that?

                                                 (cont'd)

                        In one hundred feet, you will reach
                        your destination.

           Daryl turns his head in the snow. Blinks. Squints.

           DARYL'S POV: His double vision coming into focus. The Cabin
           looms ahead of him. It's about a hundred feet away.

                                                 (cont'd)

                        your destination.

           Daryl struggles to sit up. In pain.

           And from behind him... CRUNCH... CRUNCH --

           --CRACK. The rifle snaps in half under the demon's hoof.

           THE SHADOW OF LONG CROOKED ANTLERS stretch over Daryl's
           back. Eclipsing him in the snow.

           Daryl crawls onto his feet... Staggers back to the Cabin.

           The CRUNCHING. Following him.

           But he doesn't turn around... Just keeps going... Across the
           clearing... up the porch... Fast as he can.

           He scrambles through the doorway... rolls inside... kicks
           the door shut behind him - SLAM.

           WE STAY on the closed door for a beat.

           And from far away we hear it...

           WE STAY on the closed door as night turns into day. And
           we're back in the final memory...

           EXT. THE CABIN - MORNING (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           12-year-old Daryl stands in front of the Cabin. Trembling.
           Snow has collected on his hat and sweater. His nose is
           running. Frozen tears on his cheeks. He's been out here for
           some time.

           The front door is slightly ajar.

           He finally musters up the courage to take the first step up
           on to the porch. And the next step. And the next.

           Until he's at the door. He slowly opens it...

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS  (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           He takes a cautious step inside...

           The Cabin is quiet. Still.

           Erin is right where he left her. Lying still on the floor on
           her stomach. It doesn't look like she's breathing.

           Daryl steps closer. Tears welling. Imagining the worse.

                                 YOUNG DARYL
                        ...Mom?

           Erin doesn't move. Daryl steps even closer. Panic rising.

                                 YOUNG DARYL (cont'd)
                        Mom? Can you hear me?

           Nothing. Daryl bends down and turns his mother over on her
           back. And now he sees she's holding the RIFLE.

           And her eyes are SOLID BLACK like the deer. She stares up at
           her son with a look that could melt the ice caps.

           Daryl runs. Erin sits up fast. Brings the scope to her eye.

           RIFLE SCOPE POV: Daryl disappears out the front door just
           as -- BANG -- she lets off a shot. Missing him.

           She cocks the rifle. A casing flies to the floor.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           And she is up on her feet in the blink of an eye. She moves
           to the door. Rifle up on her shoulder. Ready for the hunt.

           EXT. THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS    (DARYL'S MEMORY)

           She comes out to the porch. Rifle up. Bare-footed. Nightgown
           flapping in the wind. No sign of Daryl.

           She lowers the gun, surveys the fresh snow. Sees his boot
           prints leading to the woods. She runs off the porch with
           frightening speed. Follows his tracks into

           THE WOODS

           ON DARYL. The Deer. Running through the trees. Branches
           slapping his face as he goes.

           ON ERIN. The Hunter. Following his tracks like a bloodhound.
           She keeps the rifle up. One eye in the scope.

           ERIN'S POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: There is NO color. She has the
           eyes of the demon now.

           ON DARYL, stumbling into a CLEARING.

           Gasping. Shivering. He gets on his knees and starts pushing
           snow around, covering up tracks. He does this as he moves
           backward, making his way to a tree.

           ON ERIN. Still coming. She enters the same CLEARING.

           And STOPS. Sees his tracks have come to an end. She lowers
           the rifle and waits. Listening...

           ON DARYL, hiding behind a tree. Shivering. Trying to keep
           still. Waiting. Listening...

           And then comes the SHRILL WHISTLE of the tea kettle. He
           tenses at the sound.

           ON ERIN, Statue-still. The whistle coming from her lips. A
           horrible constant sound that goes on way longer than normal
           lips could whistle it.

           It echos through the woods. Bouncing off the trees. Coming
           from all directions. Getting louder... Eardrum splitting.

           ON DARYL, covering his ears in pain. Trying not to scream.

           ON ERIN. The Statue. Whistling. Eyes darting side to side,
           searching...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A RUSTLING in the bushes catches her attention. She stops
           the whistle. Raises the rifle and heads in that direction.

           Eye in the scope. Not watching where she's going. She steps
           over small blanket of snow and branches and SHOOM--

           --Falls right into THE TRAPPING PIT!

           The very same one they dug together.

           She disappears from our sight. Hits the bottom and BANG!

           The gun goes off. The shot echos through the woods. And then
           it's quiet.

           Daryl emerges from the tree he was hiding behind. And now we
           see the tree has the CROSS that he marked into it.

           He cautiously approaches the hole. Looks in...

           Erin is lying face down in the dirt. She manages to turn on
           her back. She's shot herself in the chest. Blood sprays.
           Reddening her gown and the snow.

           Daryl stands at the edge of the hole. Watching her bleed out
           until she's gone. Her SOLID BLACK EYES remain wide. Staring.

           Daryl drops to his knees. Head low. In tears. Sobbing hard.

           Until he hears MOVEMENT in the hole. He looks up.

           His mother remains still. Dead. Those black eyes, staring.

           But then... she starts to move...

           A LUMP starts to grow in her stomach... It moves up her
           chest... up her throat... Her mouth widens and whatever
           comes out, we don't see it.

           The blackness dissipates from her eyes and they return to
           normal. She lies there, still. Mouth agape. Staring.

           And DIRT crumbles down one side of the hole. Like something
           is trying to climb out of it.

           Daryl backs away from the hole just as --

           CRUNCH CRUNCH ... TWO LARGE HOLES appear in the snow at the
           edge of the hole. The demon has climbed out.

           Daryl, paralyzed. Watches as... CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH. MORE
           HOLES pop up in the snow. It's walking toward him.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Almost upon him when...

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM (O.S.)
                        I drive you from us! Whatever you may
                        be!

           Young Father Liam hurries into the clearing. A CROSS up in
           is hand. His coat open revealing his priest collar.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                        Unclean spirits! All infernal
                        invaders! All wicked legions!

           AND CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH- THE HOLES MOVE AWAY FROM DARYL AND
           RETREAT BACK AND OUT OF THE CLEARING. We hear something
           climbing up a tree. Something big. Heavy. Fast.

           Liam reaches Daryl. The boy falls into his arms, crying.
           Liam holds on to him but keeps the cross up to the trees.

           WE SEE the branches SHAKING from tree to tree as the demon
           climbs through them, retreating further into the woods. 

           And the branches calm. It's gone.

                               (
                                tearing up
                                 FATHER LIAM
                                          )
                        I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

           But Daryl is numb with shock. He can't hear Liam. He just
           stares over Liam's shoulder. Tears streaming.

           Watching the branches above, swaying in the cold wind.

           PRE-LAP the sound of APPLAUSE.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DUSK

           The ALCOHOLISM SUPPORT GROUP again. The circle applauds a
           woman (30s), who's just concluded her story. She sits.

                                 OWEN
                        Thank you for sharing, Joan. We have
                        time for one more if anyone else
                        would like to share?

           He scans the circle looking for a volunteer.

           Janet is here. Her eyes are on Daryl's empty seat.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                        Guess that's it for the night. Great
                        work everyone. As usual there's
                        coffee and bagels at the back. Stay,
                        talk. Meet someone new.

           Everyone gets up and heads for the tables. The room erupts
           in CHATTER. Janet is about to get up when--

           Her cellphone VIBRATES in her pocket. She checks it, sees
           who's calling. She immediately answers. We can't hear what
           she hears but her face grows serious. She listens. Then...

                                 JANET

                        Everybody! Everybody, please!

           The room quiets. All eyes on Janet. She holds the phone up.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        We've got one more for tonight!

           INT. THE CABIN / BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Daryl sits in the TUB. The shower curtain is closed. This is
           his makeshift CONFESSIONAL BOOTH he and Father Liam used
           before. He's got his phone on his ear. Still in his coat.
           Still pretty drunk. Stubble growing in hard.

           The last remaining BOTTLE OF WHISKEY is in the tub with him.
           It stands between his legs.

                                 DARYL
                        I can't...

           INTER-CUT:

           GYMNASIUM. Janet holds the phone closer to her mouth.

                                 JANET
                        Daryl, don't. Don't hang up. You
                        called me, OK. You're here now. Stay.

           He's breathing heavy over the line. This isn't easy for him.

                                 JANET (cont'd)

                        I know you're tired. Some days that
                        cross can get so heavy, you feel like
                        you can barely stand. Believe me I
                        know, I've been there. But that's
                        what we're here for - to help you

                        Daryl. We're all listening.

           THE TUB. And he's listening to her. Taking in her words.
           Taking in deep breaths. Here goes nothing.

                               (
                                long beat

                        My name is Daryl and I'm... I'm an
                        alcoholic.

                                 THE CIRCLE (PHONE)
                        Hi, Daryl.

           GYMNASIUM. REVEAL, everyone's back in their seats now.
           Janet's got her phone on speaker, holding it up for all to
           hear. WE MOVE around the circle on their faces as they
           listen to Daryl's confession.

                                 DARYL (SPEAKER PHONE)
                        My mother had the disease first.
                        After my father died, she went some
                        place dark. And this... This
                        darkness, I watched it eat away at
                        her.

           THE TUB. Daryl's eyes never leave the bottle. The RUMBLING
           starts low. The bottle is calling him...

                                 DARYL
                        In the end, she wasn't my mother
                        anymore. She's gone now... but the
                        darkness, it stayed. It followed me.

           GYMNASIUM. The circle listens.

                                 DARYL (SPEAKER PHONE)

                        Anyone who ever tried to help,
                        everyone I care about, it just rips
                        them away from me.

           On Janet, holding the phone up. Listening close. Knows he's
           talking to her now.

                                 DARYL (SPEAKER PHONE) (cont'd)
                        That's why I push them away. I can't
                        let it take anyone else.

           THE TUB. Daryl, fighting tears. Phone shaking more.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           NEXT TO HIM, There's a SILHOUETTE of Father Liam on the
           other side of the shower curtain. Liam sits in the chair,
           listening. Nodding. Encouraging Daryl on, like he did all
           those years ago.

                                 DARYL
                        It's surrounding me now, trying to
                        get inside and I've been fighting. I
                        want to beat this thing... for what
                        it did to them. For what it did to
                        her. I just... I don't know how.
                               (
                                tears come hard
                                               )
                        I ran. I couldn't save her... I
                        couldn't save her...

           He breaks down in shoulder shaking sobs. Unable to go on.

           GYMNASIUM. There is no rumbling here. The circle listens to
           him breaking down on the speaker. Some of them are in tears,
           thinking about the darkness in their own lives.

           Janet, emotional. Brings the phone close to her mouth now.

                                 JANET
                               (
                                whispers
                                        )
                        You did it. That's it. Let it out
                        now. Let it out. You did good.

           She locks eyes with Owen. He nods - You did good.

           She hands Owen the phone, passing the baton over to him now.
           Owen brings the phone close to his lips.

                                 OWEN
                        Daryl. You may not have been able to
                        save your mother then but you can
                        save yourself now. Millions of people
                        are going through that same darkness.
                        When you're in the dark, it's easy to
                        lose sight of who you are. 

           FLASH-CUT TO: A CHURCH. Daryl in full priest attire, giving
           a sermon from the pulpit. The pews are packed. We can't hear
           him but Daryl looks confident up there. In his element. This
           is where he belongs.

                                 OWEN (V.O.)
                        The trick is you have to look beyond
                        the dark and see who you were.
                        Remember who you were before it came.
                        Focus on that. Use it to get through
                        this. You can be that person again.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           THE TUB. Daryl picks his head up. Affected by Owen's words.
           Something is building in his face.

           The RUMBLING is as loud as it's ever been.

           But Daryl ignores it. He uncorks the bottle. Slowly leans it
           over and spills it out into the drain of the tub. The
           emptier it gets, the lower the rumbling gets. And when the
           bottle is empty, the rumbling stops.

           The SILHOUETTE of Liam is gone now. The room is quiet.

           Daryl puts the bottle down. This is the most quiet it's ever
           been for him. He sits there, eyes closed. Taking in the
           silence... until Janet's voice brings him back.

                                 JANET (PHONE)
                        Hey...

           GYMNASIUM

           Janet's got the phone back. She's off to the side of the
           room, away from everyone else.

           He hangs up. She lowers the phone from her ear.

           Off Janet's face. She knows he's lying.

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Daryl staggers in. Surveys the scene from the night before.
           The mess he made.

           - He finds the MAHOGANY BOX on the floor. Picks it up.

           - He starts to clean up. Lifts the bookshelf back up.

           LAST ROOM. THWACK. THWACK. Daryl on his knees. Stapling
           pages to the floor.

           - He stands. The entire room is covered with Bible pages.

           - He drills a METAL C-PIPE into the middle of the floor.

           CELLAR. He searches through boxes. Finds an old sewing kit.
           Takes all the rolls of YARN.

           - Grabs random items from boxes. SCISSORS, PENS, KEYS, a
           roll of DUCT TAPE.

           - He removes WIRES from the back of some OLD SPEAKERS.

           - He finds some THICK ROPE.

           - Grabs the HANDSAW from the shelf.

           KITCHEN. Daryl eats some canned soup at the table. Trying to
           get some of his strength back. He's going to need it.

           - He opens the drawers on the counter. Grabs handfuls of
           silverware - FORKS, KNIVES, SPOONS.

           - He takes the BROOM. Snaps off the bristles. Now he's got a
           long STICK.

           HALLWAY. TWHACK. He's on the ladder. Staple-guns strands of
           yarn to the ceiling. Cuts them to a length that they hang
           halfway to the floor.

           - The entire hall is full of strands of yarn. He's tied all
           the SILVERWARE, SCISSORS, PENS and KEYS to the ends of them.

           - He walks up the hall through the strings and all the metal
           items swing about, CLANKING together. It's an alarm system.

           BEDROOM. He opens a drawer. Pulls out his old CASSETTE TAPE
           RECORDER. Sits on the bed with it. Stares at it in his hand.

                                END MONTAGE SEQUENCE

           BATHROOM Daryl enters with the HANDSAW. He's covered in
           sweat and SAW DUST, exhausted. He drops the saw in the sink.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Removes his clothes. His body is frail and bruised. He steps
           into the tub and bathes for the first time in days.

           BEDROOM Daryl changes into a black long-sleeved shirt and
           pants - the same outfit he wears on the video tape.

           FLASH-CUT TO: Young Father Liam, putting the cross and Bible
           into young Daryl's palms.

                                 YOUNG FATHER LIAM
                               (
                                         )
                                re: cross
                        This is your rifle.
                               (
                                         )
                                re: Bible
                        These are the bullets.

           BACK TO SCENE. Daryl finds the CROSS on the floor. Puts it
           back on its nail. Straightens it.

           CELLAR

           Daryl opens a box with his father's OLD POLICE UNIFORM. He
           runs his thumb across the badge, wiping the dust off.

           There's a pair of HANDCUFFS in the box. He picks them up.

           A moment of truth. A decision is made in Daryl's face.

           CLICK. Daryl cuffs one side to his left wrist. Leaves the
           other side open. He puts the KEY in his shirt pocket.

           He turns to another shelf. Takes the HANDY CAM and tripod.

           KITCHEN

           The handy cam is set up on the tripod, aimed at the chair.
           The mahogany box is on the table. Daryl sits in the chair.
           Handcuffs on his wrist. He takes a moment to find his words.

           He hits record. Looks straight into the camera and begins
           his story. We remember this from the opening scene.

                                 DARYL
                        If you've found this... No matter how
                        bad it looks... I want you to know
                        there are reasons for my actions -
                        reasons I'll try to explain now.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. THE CABIN / KITCHEN - DAY   (THE PRESENT)

           And we're right back where we started. The unseen WATCHER.
           Their back to us, watching the tape on the handy cam.

           HANDY CAM DISPLAY SCREEN: Daryl at the table with the
           unopened box. The cuffs on his wrist. Resolve in his face.

                                 DARYL (CAMERA)
                        Once the demon invades the body it's
                        virtually impossible to remove. I
                        need to detach it now while it's on
                        the outside - when it's most
                        vulnerable to the Word.

           And finally Daryl opens that damn mahogany box. Takes out a
           GOLD ORNATE CROSS. Lays it on the table.

           Next he takes out the WHITE CLERICAL COLLAR and fastens it
           to the neck of his shirt. He cracks his neck.

           And lastly he takes out a small LEATHER BOUND BOOK. Places
           it on the table. On the cover - The Rite of Exorcism.

                                 DARYL (VIDEO)
                        November 18th, 2019. The time is just
                        after midnight. This is the video
                        record of the attempted exorcism of 
                        Daryl Collins.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        I am Father Daryl Collins. And I will
                        be performing the exorcism.

           Boom. Let that sink in for a moment.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CABIN - NIGHT 

           Daryl comes out the front door without a coat. He's wearing
           his priest collar. Has the book with him.

           He walks off the porch into the snow. Stops midway between
           the WOODS and the Cabin. Stands there facing the trees.

           Makes the sign of the cross. Opens the book and begins
           reading in a loud authoritative voice. Right at the trees.

                                 DARYL
                        I command you, unclean spirit, now
                        attacking this servant of God!

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           THE WOODS

           DEMON POV: We're far away, high up a tree. We can't see
           Daryl from here but we can hear him reading.

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        By the mysteries of the incarnation,
                        passion, resurrection, and ascension
                        of our Lord Jesus Christ!

           DEMON POV: We begin to climb down the tree.

           ON DARYL. The wind starts to pick up... The handcuff starts
           to sway in the breeze... The pages start to flutter.

           It's working.

           He holds the page down. Reads with more conviction now.

                                 DARYL
                        I command you to obey me to the
                        letter! For I am a minister of God
                        despite my unworthiness!

           THE WOODS

           DEMON POV: We're on the ground now. CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH-ING
           through the snow. Moving towards Daryl.

           ON DARYL. Wind picking up more. He hears the CRUNCHING in
           the distance but he keeps reading.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        When time began, the Word was there!
                        And the Word was face to face with
                        God, and the Word was God!

           DEMON POV: We're out of the woods now. About fifty feet away
           from Daryl. Picking up speed. CRUNCH... CRUNCH....

           ON DARYL, hears the CRUNCHING getting closer.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        All things came into being through
                        Him, and without Him there came to be
                        not one thing that has come to be!

           DEMON POV: We're about thirty feet from Daryl now. There is
           no color except for the book he's holding. It glows in his
           hands.

           Daryl looks up from the page. Sees the HOLES APPEARING in
           the snow. Getting closer. They pass the SUV. Keep coming.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           He starts to back up towards Cabin. Reading as he goes. 

           Wind whipping harder. He holds the fluttering pages down.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        In Him was life, and the life was the
                        light of men!

           CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH - coming faster.

           Daryl's backing up with the book. Moving faster too.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        The light shines in the darkness, and
                        the darkness did not lay hold of it!

           He backs up to the porch. Walks up backwards. Still reading.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Almighty Lord, Word of God the
                        Father, Jesus Christ, God and Lord of
                        all creation!

           And the holes are picking up speed. CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Who gave to your holy apostles the
                        power to tramp underfoot serpents and
                        scorpions!

           The holes come faster. Angrier. EXPLODING in the snow now.
           They reach the foot of the porch...

           Daryl backs into the door with the book.

           INT. THE CABIN / MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He closes the door. Backs away from it.

           OUTSIDE

           DEMON POV: We're STOMPING up the porch steps...

           MAIN ROOM

           Daryl backs away to the far wall with the book.

           KITCHEN

           The HANDY-CAM is on a tripod in the doorway, pointing into
           the MAIN ROOM now. It's recording the exorcism.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           OUTSIDE

           DEMON POV: WE'RE RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR. AND LIKE
           MAGIC, THE FINAL LETTER IS VIOLENTLY CARVED INTO THE WOOD BY
           INVISIBLE CLAWS. A JAGGED "M"

           MAIN ROOM

           Daryl hears the SCRATCHING on the other side of the door but
           he keeps reading aloud.

                                 DARYL
                        God and Father of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ, I appeal to your holy name,
                        humbly begging your kindness!

           WE HOLD on door for the longest agonizing beat. Waiting for
           it to open. Waiting... waiting...

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        That you graciously grant me help
                        against this and every unclean
                        spirit--

           --AND BANG -- the slat of wood covering up the hole SHOOTS
           off and flies into the room.

           AND SOMETHING STARTS TO CRAWL IN THROUGH THE HOLE ON ALL
           FOURS.

           Daryl sees it. Lowers the book. His face slacks in shock.

           IT'S ERIN.

           ON ALL FOURS. HER SKIN IS AS WHITE AS SNOW. SHE'S STILL IN
           THAT NIGHTGOWN. DRIED DARK BLOOD STAINS ON THE FRONT OF HER
           GOWN FROM THE BULLET HOLE THAT WENT IN HER CHEST.

           HER FACE IS SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN IT SHOULD BE. SHE STARES UP
           AT DARYL WITH THOSE SOLID BLACK EYES. SLOWLY RISING ON HER
           BARE FEET. AND AS SHE STANDS, SHE GROWS TALL... EVEN
           Taller...  WAAAAY TALLER than Erin ever stood. 

           Her joints make SICKENING CRACKING SOUNDS as she grows. Like
           something frozen moving after a long time.

           Daryl stares, horrified.

           As Erin steps forward... Joints CRACKING... STRETCHING OUT
           THOSE BONE WHITE ARMS FOR HIM...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Her bare feet stepping onto the NAVAJO RUG on the floor
           between them...

           It's not until she reaches the middle of it that we see...

           ...the LONG SLIT that's been cut down the middle of the rug.

           Erin falls through it and CRASHES into the cellar below!

           Daryl hurries and lifts the rug up and now we see...

           He's sawed off the wooden hatch to the cellar and widened
           the hole. A huge section of the floor is missing now.

           A homemade TRAPPING PIT.

           Daryl steps to the edge of the hole with the book. Continues
           to read.

                                 DARYL
                        God, by your name save me!
                        And by your might defend my cause!

           The demon has gone invisible again. It's moving around
           frantically below. Boxes rip apart... tools fly about...
           shelves topple over. It's angry.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Because from all distress you have
                        rescued me! And my eyes look down
                        upon my enemies--

           --CRACK - a floorboard shoots up near Daryl's foot. It flies
           up past his face and hits the ceiling. Comes back down.

           CRACK- CRACK -CRACK. More boards fly up from the floor. 

           Daryl backs away from the hole. Dodging the shooting
           floorboards. He hurries to the

           HALLWAY

           Ducks down and crawls on his stomach underneath all the
           hanging SILVERWARE.

           MAIN ROOM

           WE HEAR the demon climbing out of the hole. WE HEAR it STOMP
           onto the floor. It's in the room now.

           HALLWAY

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Daryl keeps crawling. Book in hand. Fast as he can for the
           LAST ROOM when... BEHIND HIM...

           The makeshift alarm system goes off as--

           THE DEMON CHARGES. HOOVES STOMPING ON THE FLOORBOARDS.
           SILVERWARE PARTS LIKE THE RED SEA AS IT COMES DOWN THE HALL,
           CAUSING A RIPPLE EFFECT OF SWINGING METAL THINGS CLANKING
           NOISELESSLY TOGETHER.

           STRINGS AND SILVERWARE GETTING CAUGHT IN ITS INVISIBLE
           ANTLERS. SWINGING ON NOTHING.

           But Daryl makes it to the room just in time...

           And the demon STOPS in the middle of the hall.

           The silverware behind it, CLANKING loudly.

           The silverware in front of it is still. Untouched.

           DEMON POV: Watching Daryl on his knees inside the Last Room.
           And BEHIND DARYL, the letters are glowing on the walls -
           even more than before.

           The silverware starts to part in the opposite direction. The
           demon is moving backwards, away from the Last Room.

           But Daryl's prepared for this. He reaches behind the door
           and pulls out the STICK that used to be the broom.

           He steps back into the

           HALLWAY

           WE FOLLOW his hand, the handcuff dangling. As he raises the
           stick over his head towards the ceiling...

           FLASH-CUT TO: (DARYL'S MEMORY) We remember this. The opening
           scene. Erin and Daryl in the woods. She's showing him how to
           hunt. The small deer in the cross hairs of the scope.

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        The deer has tunnel vision. All it
                        sees is a meal. It's not paying
                        attention to what's happening around
                        it. Makes it an easy kill.

           BACK TO SCENE. The stick rising up. And now we see why...

           Daryl's duct taped the TAPE RECORDER to the ceiling.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           WE FOLLOW the SPEAKER WIRING that runs from the back of the
           tape recorder... all the way down to other end of the
           hall... to those TWO OLD SPEAKERS.

           He's hung them above in the edge of the hallway. Facing
           towards the Last Room.

                                 ERIN (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        What are you, Daryl? The hunter or
                        the deer?

                                 YOUNG DARYL (V.O.)
                        The hunter.

           The demon's almost out of the hall. Silverware swinging in
           its wake...

           When the end of the stick reaches the tape recorder above
           and hits the play button.

           CLICK. The spools of the tape spin.

           And from the SPEAKERS on the other end of the hall come
           Daryl's pre-recorded reading of the Rite.

           Oh, and the volume is ALL THE WAY UP!!!

                                 DARYL'S VOICE (SPEAKERS)
                        I COMMAND YOU, UNCLEAN SPIRIT, NOW
                        ATTACKING THIS SERVANT OF GOD!

           AND THE DEMON ABRUPTLY REVERSES AWAY FROM THE SPEAKERS.
           COMING BACK DOWN THE HALL. RUNNING AWAY FROM THE WORD OF
           GOD. SILVERWARE FLYING EVERYWHERE.

                                 DARYL'S VOICE (SPEAKERS) (cont'd)
                         I COMMAND YOU TO OBEY TO THE LETTER!

           With the speakers blocking its path out, the demon goes in
           the only direction it can now... IT BARRELS TOWARD DARYL...

           And Daryl sees the silverware parting in his direction.
           Knows it's coming.

           He drops the stick, turns for the door. But the Demon is
           faster and --  WHAM -- AN INVISIBLE FORCE SLAMS AGAINST HIM.

           The book flies out of his hand.

           Daryl lands HARD on his stomach.

           The upper half of his body is inside the Last Room. From the
           waist down he's in the Hallway.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

           He's GASPING. The wind knocked out of him. Arms flailing
           about, stretching for something in the room...

           THE ROPE.

           He gets a hold of the end... wraps it around his forearm...

           WE FOLLOW the rope and see that it's been tied to the metal
           C-PIPE he drilled to the floor.

           Daryl PULLS on the rope with all he's got. Pulls himself
           (with the demon on top of him) into the

           LAST ROOM

           His legs kicking wildly. One good KICK shuts the door.

           Outside the door, Daryl's voice still BLARES on the
           speakers. This will continue for the rest of the scene.

           And Daryl keeps pulling himself across the floor...

           Closer to the C-PIPE...

           The unseen Demon PRESSING DOWN on him. The back of his shirt
           rips open. HOOVES imprinted on the skin on his back.

           Daryl, fighting through the pain. Doesn't stop pulling.

           The temperature must have dropped substantially because now
           we can see his breaths.

           He's still saying the rite. Repeating it along with his own
           voice outside on the speakers.

                               (
                                 DARYL

                        When time began, the Word was there!
                        And the Word was face to face with
                        God!

           HIS PUPILS START TO DILATE. TURNING SOLID BLACK.

           Still Daryl pulls... pulls... fighting against it...

           ...He reaches the C-PIPE. And SNAPS the open side of the
           HANDCUFFS shut on the pipe. Locking himself and the demon in
           the room together.

           He fights to get his hand in his pants pocket... Pulls out
           the GOLD CROSS... Holds the cross up high.

           --HIS MOUTH STARTS TO WIDEN... WIDER.... WIDER... The
           demon's trying to get inside him.

           We can see the intense struggle in his face. Daryl fighting
           to stay present. A tug of war over his body and soul.

           But Daryl is stronger. He bites down. Fighting to shut his
           jaw. His face, shaking. And his mouth starts to close...

           More... more... until it's back to normal.

           And he continues "rite" where he left off.

                        being... through him...

           And he holds the cross up even higher.

                        Depart... then! Depart Balaam! Depart

                        that man... be His temple!

           And the blackness starts to dissipate from his eyes.

                                 DARYL (cont'd)
                        Depart! I cast you out, Balaam! Out
                        from me! Out from the Lord's temple!

           DEMON POV: WE RISE out of Daryl's mouth and into the room.

                                 DARYL
                        I cast you out, unclean spirit! OUT!
                        OUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!

           DEMON POV: The words on the walls are glowing bright. We can
           see EVERY LETTER, EVERY SENTENCE. It's blinding us.

           We move around in a frenzy, trying to avoid the light from
           the walls but there is no escape. It surrounds us.

           Daryl yelling from the floor. Holding the CROSS up. It's
           shining in his hand. Like looking into the sun.

           The walls grow brighter. Blinding. Unbearable. We're
           bouncing around the room like a ping pong ball.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (7)

           THE CROSS on the door. It's the only way out.

           So we move for the door and go through the cross.

           And as we do a BLINDING PURE WHITE LIGHT CONSUMES US.

           HALLWAY

           The other side of the door. RAYS OF LIGHT shining through
           the cross. Like the sun is rising inside the room.

           And that PURE WHITE LIGHT spills into the hall. Until it's
           all we see. We're consumed by it too...

                                                      MATCH-CUT TO:

           Fresh white snow on the ground. Untouched. Freshly fallen.

           We're not inside the Cabin anymore. We're...

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Trees sway in the cold wind.

           The SUV sits in the snow.

           The Cabin sits still. Quiet.

           The hole in the front door. The jagged letter "M"  above it.

           INT. CABIN / MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Snow on the floor. Blowing in from the hole in the door.

           The room is still. Just the soft CLANKING of silverware.

           The animal heads on the walls stare down at us.

           Remnants of the night before...

           The Navajo rug lies twisted on one side of the room. The
           long slit in the middle of it is visible.

           The hole sawed into the floor.

           The trashed cellar below.

           Missing and cracked floorboards all over.

           Hell of a night.

           KITCHEN

           Miraculously the HANDY CAM is still standing in the doorway.
           Aimed into the room. It's not recording anymore.

           HALLWAY

           The surviving silverware still hangs. Softly CLANKING in the
           breeze. Guess those weren't wind chimes after all.

           The rest of the silverware is bent and flattened on the
           floor.

           The SPEAKERS hang above. Silent.

           The TAPE RECORDER. Duct-taped to the ceiling. The spools are
           still. The tape at it's end.

           WE MOVE to the closed cross-door.

           The wood on the edges of the cross have been singed.

           WE MOVE through the cross and into the

           LAST ROOM

           Where Daryl remains still on the floor. On his back. Cuffed
           to the pipe. The cross still in his other hand.

           He wakes. Slowly rises his head. It hurts to do so.

           More stubble. His lips are blue. He's pale. Weak. Shivering.

           He pats his breast pocket. Can't feel the handcuff key. He
           reaches inside. Comes up empty-handed.

           HALLWAY

           REVEAL where the handcuff KEY has fallen - just outside of
           the door. Might as well be a million miles away.

           LAST ROOM

           Daryl shakes his head. He's stuck there now.

           But he's won. He's defeated the demon.

           His chapped lips break into a smile. The smile turns into a
           laugh. His breaths visible in the brisk air.

           He starts to cry. Relieved. Exhausted. Shivering. Content.
           So many emotions coursing through him at once.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           A bitter sweet victory.

           He lowers his head again. No where to go now.

           THE SHED

           With no one to man it, the generator shuts off.

           All the lights go off in the Cabin windows.

           The wind howls. Snow falls.

           The Cabin is silent. Windows dark.

           INT. CABIN / LAST ROOM - NIGHT

           Daryl, weak and haggard. Sitting in the dark. Trying to pick
           the handcuff lock with the SWISS ARMY KNIFE. No luck.

                                                            CUT TO:

           Daryl trying to break the handcuff with the cross.

           Nope. Not happening.

           He lies back down. Closes his eyes. Prays in the dark room.

           The sun's just starting its shift. It's snowing.

           INT. THE CABIN / LAST ROOM - MORNING

           Daryl paler. A small beard growing in now. Hunched over on
           the floor. Could be dead.

           The sound of a CAR pulling up outside. A car door SLAMS.

           MAIN ROOM

           THROUGH THE HOLE of the front door we see Janet slowly walk
           up the steps of the porch. She knocks at the door.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Daryl!

           The house is quiet. Only the soft clanking of silverware.
           She knocks harder. More urgent.

                                 JANET (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Daryl! You in there!

           Nothing. She tries the doorknob. It's locked. She bends down
           and peers through the hole. Alarm fills her face.

           She crawls into the hole. Slowly rising to her feet,
           surveying the condition of the place. Concern mounting.

           She sees at the massive hole in the floor... The wrecked
           cellar below. She looks down the hall... past the hanging 
           silverware... to the cross-door. What the heck IS that?

                                 JANET
                                really worried now

           And then she spots the CAMERA on the tripod.

           HANDY-CAM DISPLAY SCREEN: The exorcism. Daryl backing up
           into the room reading the book... We're right at the part
           where Erin comes in through the door... Right before she
           does, the video warps. WHITE NOISE fills the screen. We
           can't see anything. All the sounds slow down and distort.

           KITCHEN

           Janet "the Watcher" sits in a chair, staring at the snow on
           the handy-cam screen. Deeply troubled by what she just saw.
           She gets up and hurries out.

           LAST ROOM

           Daryl lies still on the floor.

           Janet's FOOTSTEPS. Coming fast up the hall. Silverware
           CLANKING as they do. She reaches the door. Stares in at
           Daryl through the cross. Daryl doesn't wake.

           BATHROOM - LATER

           When he finally does, he's lying naked in a bathtub of
           steaming hot water. He's got a little color back.

           His eyes open and sees Janet sitting on the edge of the tub,
           pouring in some more hot water from a boiling pot. Her face,
           wrapped with concern. She can see all his bruises and cuts.

           The handcuffs are gone. His wrist is raw and swollen.

           Daryl sits up. Tries to say something.

                                 JANET (cont'd)
                        Shh. Shh. Let's get your temperature
                        first.

           Daryl shivering. Teeth chattering. Tries to explain...

                                 DARYL
                        That room...

                        I'm gonna fix you up something to
                        eat. Then we get you to a doctor.

           She goes for the door.

                                 DARYL
                               (

                        Why'd you come back?

           She stops. Turns around. He locks eyes with her - Tell me.

           It takes her a moment...

                                 JANET
                        When you spoke to Susan that day in
                        AA, I recognized your voice.

           FLASH CUT TO: ST. ANGELA CHURCH. We remember this. Daryl in
           the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH. Giving advice to the crying woman in
           the next booth. Only now we can see the distraught woman
           through the mesh is Janet.

                                 JANET (V.O.)
                        It was the same voice that helped me.

           BACK TO SCENE. They hold each others' gaze for a long
           emotional beat. She turns and leaves, closes the door behind
           her. Daryl curls up in the steam of the tub. Eyes brimming.
           EXT. THE CABIN - DUSK - LATER

           A piece of wood covers the hole in the front door now.

           Daryl and Janet come out in their coats. Daryl has Parker in
           his arms. He's still wrapped in blankets.

           They walk off the porch to Janet's VOLVO parked out front.
           She opens the trunk. Daryl gently lays Parker inside.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. JANET'S VOLVO - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl's in the passenger seat. The MAHOGANY BOX in his lap.
           He suctions the GPS to the dash. Plugs in the directions.

           There are two cups of coffee in the cup holder.

           Janet starts the car. Drives away.

           Daryl opens the box in his lap. The cross, the collar and
           the book is back inside it. And something else now...

           The photo of Erin and his father holding hands. He's removed
           it from the frame and taped it under the lid of the box.

           REAR VIEW WINDOW: WE STAY on the Cabin as they drive away.
           It shrinks in the distance. Getting swallowed up into the
