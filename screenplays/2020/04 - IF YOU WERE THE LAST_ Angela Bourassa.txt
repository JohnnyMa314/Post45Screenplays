                               IF YOU WERE THE LAST...

           INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

           A typical, dimly lit family room - BOOKSHELVES, END TABLES,
           LAMPS. That sort of thing.

           JANE and ADAM (30s) sit facing each other, cross-legged, at
           either end of a red corduroy COUCH.

           They're fit, normal-looking people in plain white t-shirts
           and sweat pants. Both have a few TATTOOS on their arms.

           They play chess on a TRAVEL CHESSBOARD set between them on
           the couch.

           We join them mid-debate...

                                 JANE
                        It was irresponsible.

                                 ADAM
                        Irresponsible??

                                 JANE
                        Absolutely! They spent, what, a
                        trillion dollars and countless man
                        hours - not to mention political
                        capital - trying to get one dude back
                        from Mars?

                                 ADAM
                        Political capital? It united the
                        world!

                                 JANE
                        Yeah for a hot minute. But what if
                        they failed? Then everyone woulda
                        been like, "Um, excuse me? You know
                        there are people dying here, right?"

           Throughout this, Jane and Adam keep playing chess, making
           moves with very little thought.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, but there are always people dying
                        and we can't save everyone, so when
                        we have the chance to come together
                        and save Matt Damon--

                                 JANE
                        No, screw Matt Damon.

                                 ADAM
                        Harsh.
                                 JANE
                        Dude. It costs an average of twelve
                        hundred dollars to save a life--

                                 ADAM
                        Twelve hun-- what?

                                 JANE
                        When you give money to charity, the
                        ones that are actually going to save
                        lives are the ones that clean water
                        and give out medicine and stuff,
                        right?

                                 ADAM
                        Matt Damon's charity cleans water...

                                 JANE
                               (
                                ignoring him
                                            )
                        So when you factor in administrative
                        costs and how many people would have
                        actually died without help, it works
                        out to about twelve hundred bucks per
                        life.

                                 ADAM
                        So divide a trillion dollars to save
                        one guy on Mars by twelve hundred and
                        you could save 833 million people on
                        Earth?

                                 JANE
                        ...Did you just do that math right
                        now?

                                 ADAM
                        I'm very smart.

                                 JANE
                        I know. You just look so dumb.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, so - Avengers: Infinity War. You
                        would kill Vision preemptively to
                        ensure that Thanos doesn't get his
                        stone?

                                 JANE
                        Oh, hundred percent.

                                 ADAM
                        Really. Wow. Cold.
                                 JANE
                        I'm cold? I thinking letting half the
                        fricken universe die is pretty cold.
                        Besides, how is Vision choosing to
                        die for the cause - which he wanted
                        to do, I'll have you remember - any
                        different than Black Widow
                        sacrificing herself in Endgame?

                                 ADAM
                        ...Yeah, ok.

           Adam moves a pawn. He peers at the board.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Oh. That's checkmate.

           Jane studies the board.

                                 JANE
                        Oh yeah. Dang.

           Adam offers a hand, and Jane shakes it - good game.

           They both lean back on their respective armrests.

                                 ADAM
                        ...So you really don't think they'll
                        send anyone to save us?

           We flip around and see the other side of the room for the
           first time.

           WE'RE IN A SPACE SHUTTLE.

           The walls on the far side of the room are lined in TIN FOIL.

           A floor-to-ceiling window looks out over thousands of GOLD
           PAPER STARS hanging from visible STRING.

           (Be warned. This is no big-budget sci-fi epic. You are
           reading a fairy tale.)

           Jane takes a moment before responding. Her tone softens.

                                 JANE
                        I mean. I'm sure they're doing what
                        they can. Within reason.
                                    )
                               (
                                beat
                        Benson'd probably take your side...
           They both turn to look at a SKELETON dressed in an orange
           SPACE SUIT sitting in an ARM CHAIR across from them. The
           space suit is embroidered with the name BENSON.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah. But Benson went crazy.

           They sit quietly for a moment, taking in their dead
           companion...

                                 JANE
                        Did I ever thank you for cleaning the
                        bones? That was... above and beyond.

                                 ADAM
                        Any time.

                                 JANE
                                unenthusiastic
                                              )
                               (
                        ...Play again?

                                 ADAM
                        Mmm...
                               (
                                better idea
                                           )
                        Wanna see who can make a taller
                        tower?

                                 JANE
                        Yes.

           They start strategically stacking their chess pieces.

           As they work...

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        I just don't think we should wait
                        around to be saved, ya know? We gotta
                        save ourselves.

                               (
                                resigned
                                 ADAM
                                        )
                        ...Or accept the inevitability of our
                        fate.

           A pair of CHICKENS wander through the room, clucking and
           pecking. Adam and Jane pay them no mind.

                                 JANE
                        One of the two.

                                                            CUT TO:

           TITLE CARD: IF YOU WERE THE LAST...
           ESTABLISHING: OUR PLACE IN SPACE

           We get a beautiful shot of a ROCKET covered in tin foil
           drifting somewhere between Jupiter and Saturn in a paper and
           wire model of the SOLAR SYSTEM.

           We push into the rocket and find Jane and Adam going about
           their days, finding ways to pass the time...

           INT. GYM - NIGHT (IT'S SPACE - IT'S ALWAYS NIGHT)

           In a small gym area with tin foil walls and a nice IKEA RUG
           on the floor, Jane and Adam do HEADSTANDS against opposite
           walls. They stare each other down, upside down.

           Their voices are strained from the physical exertion -
           they've been at this awhile...

                                 ADAM
                        You should just give up now. I'm
                        clearly dominating.

                                 JANE
                        I'll dominate your face.

           INT. GREENHOUSE

           Adam works in a lush, steamy greenhouse filled with all
           sorts of CROPS and lined with tin foil walls.

           A CHICKEN COOP occupied by half a dozen gently clucking HENS
           resides next to a small PEN where a GOAT hangs out.

           Jupiter (in big, beautifully painted paper ball form) drifts
           through the floor-to-ceiling window.

           But Adam has seen this epic view a thousand times. He's 
           focused instead on carefully pruning a MARIJUANA PLANT.

           INT. KITCHEN

           Somewhere in the interior of the ship - no windows - Jane
           cracks a few EGGS over wilted SPINACH in a frying pan. She
           tosses the egg shells into a COMPOST BIN that has 50 MORE
           EGG SHELLS in it.

           The kitchen feels like a nice, homey IKEA kitchen - wood
           cabinets, a FRUIT BOWL - not spacey at all, except for those
           tin foil walls.
           Jane pours TWO glasses of GOAT'S MILK as Adam saunters in
           holding a pack of POP-TARTS.

           He gratefully accepts his glass, taking a sip before opening
           the pack of Pop-Tarts and putting both into the toaster.

                                 JANE
                        Two?? Don't you only have like ten
                        left?

                                 ADAM
                        I know. It's just, my marijuana
                        raspberry hybrid still won't fruit. I
                        need to let off some steam...

           Jane gets it. She pats him on the back.

                                 JANE
                        Mm. Go nuts, kid.
                                beat
                               (
                                    )
                        Don't Pop and drive.

           INT. GYM

           Back to that headstand competition...

                                 JANE
                        Your momma called. She said she
                        doesn't miss you, and you're gonna
                        lose.

                                 ADAM
                        Your momma actually called, too. She
                        said she's actually your sister, and
                        you smell like butts. And you're
                        gonna lose.

           INT. TV ROOM

           Jane and Adam lounge on the couch watching The Office (the
           American version) on a projector SCREEN. The GOAT lounges on
           the couch between them.

           Jane and Adam share a bowl of POPCORN. Jane playfully BATS
           Adam's hand when he takes an absurdly large handful.

           He retaliates by THROWING popcorn at her, and it becomes a
           POPCORN BATTLE - which the goat loves.
           INT. COCKPIT

           The large cockpit of the shuttle is all tin foil, giant
           panels of BUTTONS and SWITCHES, and a big window looking
           ahead into space.

           Jane sits on the floor in front of an open wall panel with
           about a hundred horizontally-running GRAY WIRES pouring out
           of it.

           The wires have been BLASTED IN HALF by something that left a
           large black SCORCH MARK around and behind them.

           GLOVES on, Jane diligently works on trying to find which
           gray wire on the left connects with which gray wire on the
           right.

           The paper stars swirl past the front window as Jane works
           for hours connecting all the wires.

           Finally all connected, she peels herself off the floor and
           moves to a large SWITCH next to a MICROPHONE.

           Deep breath.

           She flips the switch. Nothing happens.

           She knows it won't work, but she has to try anyway...

                                 JANE
                                into the mic
                                            )
                               (
                        Hello? Earth?

           She waits. Nothing.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                               (
                                singing
                                       )
                        I need a hero. I'm holding out for a
                        hero til the end of the night...

           Still nothing.

           She flips a SECOND LARGE SWITCH on the opposite side of the
           microphone.

           Nothing.

           With a sigh, she moves to the opposite wall and adds a TALLY
           MARK to a running count of 300 OTHERS.
           INT. HALLWAY

           Adam uses homemade plant-based PAINTS to add to an ongoing
           MURAL of all sorts of random things in a long corridor.

           The mural has flowers, clouds, boobs, Pop-Tarts, a lake, a
           muscle car - all his favorite things.

           INT. GYM

           Once more to the headstand competition.

                                 JANE
                        I don't want to emasculate you,
                        except that that's exactly what I
                        want to do.

           Adam isn't looking so good...

                                 ADAM
                        Well I...

           He FAINTS and collapses in a heap on the ground.

                                 JANE
                        ...That's not good.

           INT. JANE'S ROOM

           Jane lays on her BED in her tiny, mostly empty room with
           HEADPHONES on, rocking out to some upbeat solid gold oldie.

           She croons along with a melancholy look in her eye.

           Adam pops into her doorway.

                                 ADAM
                        Ready?

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. TV ROOM

           Jane and Adam work together to push the red corduroy couch
           back against the bookshelves and move the COFFEE TABLE
           aside - they're clearing the floor.

                                 JANE
                        Have you tried the blueberries or
                        maybe the blackberry?
                                 ADAM
                        No... I mean, yes - I've tried
                        everything. But the raspberry is the
                        one that's most genetically in line
                        with the marijuana plant. It should
                        work.

                                 JANE
                        You'll get there.

           The floor is cleared. They stand at either end of the room,
           facing each other.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Alright. What's the verdict?

           Adam turns to a BOOMBOX built into the tin foil wall and
           presses PLAY.

           An awful country pop song by some awful country pop singer
           fills the room.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        No! No, no, no. No.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, judgey, I didn't complain when
                        you picked Enya. It's my turn, and I
                        say we're two-steppin'.

                                 JANE
                        We can two-step, that's fine. But can
                        we please do it to something less
                        soul-suckingly awful?

                                 ADAM
                        ... No.

                                 JANE
                        Please. Please? Come on, you must
                        have some... I don't know. Willie
                        Nelson?

           Adam thinks about it.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, yeah...

           He turns back to the boombox in the wall, presses a few
           buttons, and a Willie Nelson song like "Uncloudy Day" pours
           into the room.

           With a big smile, Adam two-steps across the room to Jane...
                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Better?

           Jane represses a grin.

                                 JANE
                        Eh.

           Adam grabs her hand and SPINS her onto their makeshift dance
           floor.

           THEY DANCE.

           Adam's clearly got a lot of practice with this style of
           dance. Jane isn't quite as good - she looks at her feet a
           lot - but Adam is a strong partner and leads her well.

                                 WILLIE NELSON
                        Oh, they tell me of a home far beyond
                        the skies
                        Oh, they tell me of a home far away
                        Oh, they tell me of a home where no
                        storm clouds rise
                        Oh, they tell me of an unclouded day

           Jane sinks into the song, and they have a great time
           spinning around the room, the glitter stars floating past in
           the windows behind them.

           Benson's skeleton sits in his armchair, arranged so that he
           leans to one side with legs crossed - a happy observer.

           As they dance...

                                 ADAM
                        Wow, you are not good at this.

                                 JANE
                        Excuse me for not taking two-step
                        while getting my minor in dance.

                                 ADAM
                        How minorly impressive. You know I
                        almost went to Juilliard.

                                 JANE
                        You did not!

                                 ADAM
                        No, but I totally rocked my mom's
                        after-school hip-hop class.

           Jane laughs.
           They break into an electric slide...

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Uh oh, here we go!

           They laugh and have a great time.

           INT. TV ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Both sweaty and tired - they've clearly been dancing for a
           while - Jane and Adam sit in the middle of the room sipping
           WATER BOTTLES.

                                 JANE
                        So. I need to call you out on
                        something.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Ok.

                                 JANE
                        I was walking through the greenhouse
                        this morning and I stepped in some...
                        milky... goop...?

           Jane keeps her eyes locked on Adam's, but he's not giving up
           anything.

           After an awkwardly long stare...

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, yeah. My bad.

                                 JANE
                        Dude!

                                 ADAM
                        I'm sorry! I thought I got it all.

           Jane is grossed out.

                                 JANE
                        That's where our food grows.

           She gestures to a nearby CHICKEN...

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        That's where the girls sleep. I
                        mean...
                               (
                                                )
                                beat, whispering
                        Were they watching you?
                                 ADAM
                        No!
                                beat
                                    )
                               (
                        I don't know.

           Jane does a repulsed shiver.

                                 JANE
                        Ew.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, that's enough with the slut
                        shaming.

                                 JANE
                        I'm not shaming you. Just, keep it in
                        your room, man.

                                 ADAM
                        Is that where you do it?

                                 JANE
                        In your room? No.

           He asks, not creepily, just genuinely curious...

                                 ADAM
                        How often?

                                 JANE
                        Dude.

                                 ADAM
                        Multiple times a day, huh.

                                 JANE
                        I'm not answering that.

           Jane begins STRETCHING. Adam follows suit.

                                 ADAM
                        Maybe we should do it.

                                 JANE
                        What.

           Adam gives her a knowing look - you know what "it" is...

           Jane LAUGHS a little too hard.

                                 ADAM
                        What! I'm serious.
           That makes her laugh even harder.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        We are doomed to drift in this little
                        rocket for the rest of our short
                        lives. Honestly, it'd be kind of
                        crazy for us not to bang.

                                 JANE
                        Well when you put it that way.

                                 ADAM
                        So you're in?

                                 JANE
                        No!

                                 ADAM
                        Why not?

           They progress from individual stretching to partner
           stretching - no need to discuss, they know the routine.

           This leads to some compromising positions, but they keep it
           professional.

                                 JANE
                        Ok, first of all, I don't need a
                        reason not to sleep with you. I'd
                        need a reason to sleep with you.

           He interrupts with a list of good reasons...

                                 ADAM
                        Drifting through space, the boredom,
                        the fact that without Benson we have
                        literally no other viable options...

           She disregards him and carries on.

                                 JANE
                        That said, I can think of three
                        excellent reasons right off the top
                        why we shouldn't, as you so
                        romantically put it, "bang."

           Jane lays on her back so Adam can stretch her hamstrings.
           She throws one leg up on his shoulder, and he pushes.
           Again - compromising, but professional.
                                 ADAM
                        Ok, well now I need to clarify. I'm
                        not talking about any sort of
                        "romance" whatsoever. This would be
                        completely detached from emotion.
                        Just, you know... stress relief.

                                 JANE
                        No, right. I get it. I hereby approve
                        "banging" as the appropriate
                        terminology.

           Adam starts stretching Jane's other leg.

                                 ADAM
                        Cool.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        So what are these excellent reasons?

                                 JANE
                        OW!

           Adam releases Jane from the stretch. With a grimace, her
           hands fly to her CALF, where Adam was holding her leg.

                                 ADAM
                        Whoa.

           Jane tries her hardest to act like she's not in pain.

                                 JANE
                        No, sorry. It's nothing.

                                 ADAM
                        That's not nothing.

           With a few deep breaths, Jane has her composure again.

                                 JANE
                        No really, it's just a little
                        scratch.

           Adam scowls at Jane.

           She relents and allows him to push up the leg of her
           sweatpants, revealing a 3x3" BANDAGE on the side of her
           calf.

           Adam peels back the bandage to reveal a bright red GASH - it
           doesn't look awful, but it's definitely infected.

           Adam fumes silently.
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        See! This is why I didn't tell you.
                        You get so mad at me when I get hurt.

                                 ADAM
                        I'm not mad.

                                 JANE
                        Yes you are! You get pissed at
                        whatever thing hurts me, and I am
                        usually that thing.

                                 ADAM
                        You need antibiotics.

                                 JANE
                        No. We only have one course left. I
                        am not using that on a little cut.

                                 ADAM
                        If this infection spreads--

                                 JANE
                        People don't die from little cuts.

                                 ADAM
                        You know why? Cuz they take
                        antibiotics.

                                 JANE
                        It's. fine.

           Adam sighs. He hates this.

                                 ADAM
                        Well I'm gonna clean it from now on,
                        because you did a crappy job.

                                 JANE
                        I did not!

                                 ADAM
                        Just awful.

                                 JANE
                        Your face is awful!

           They keep arguing, but we cut to...
           INT. MEDICAL

           One of the only purely spacey rooms on the ship (along with
           the cockpit). Tin foil, a HOSPITAL BED, medical CARTS and
           TRAYS...

           Jane sits on the bed, leaned back with gritted teeth as Adam
           cleans her cut with HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.

           Adam really does hate seeing her in pain, so he tries to
           distract her.

                                 ADAM
                        So you were saying.

                                 JANE
                        What?

                                 ADAM
                        Your reasons why we shouldn't... do
                        sex on each other.

                                 JANE
                        Oh. Um. Well, number one... I'm not
                        attracted to you.

           A pause. Adam's expression is indecipherable.

                                 ADAM
                        That's not a reason against! That's a
                        reason for!

                                 JANE
                        What?

                                 ADAM
                        If we were attracted to each other,
                        there would be the risk of "banging"
                        turning into something, and that
                        could get super messy.

                                 JANE
                        Super messy.

           He picks up a pair of TWEEZERS.

                                 ADAM
                        So the fact that we're not attracted
                        is a benefit. It means we're that
                        much safer from things getting messy.
                        Quick pinch.
                                 JANE
                        Ow. ...So you're not attracted to me
                        either?

                                 ADAM
                        No. Not at all.

                                 JANE
                        Ok.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Do you want me to be attracted to
                        you?

                                 JANE
                        No. Obviously not. I'm just... You
                        know I'm a hot piece, right?

                                 ADAM
                        Gaping wounds aside?

                                 JANE
                        Alright...

           Adam puts a fresh BANDAGE on Jane's leg with great care.
           Jane takes note.

                                 ADAM
                        There. You'll keep it dry and clean?

           Jane nods.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        And if it gets worse, you'll tell me
                        right away?

           Jane hesitates.

                                 JANE
                        ...Yep.

           Adam scowls. He begins cleaning up his supplies, and Jane
           watches him.

           She realizes something...

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        So are we just having a debate, or
                        are you making a serious proposal?

                                 ADAM
                        I don't know. Debate, I guess.
           Adam thinks it through as he speaks...

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        But if I persuade you... It seems
                        like we should probably do it...

           Jane gives Adam an amused/annoyed look.

                                 JANE
                        Anyway, my point still stands.

                                 ADAM
                        How do you figure?

                                 JANE
                        Well, we're not attracted now, but if
                        we started having sex, even if we
                        said it was just "banging," our
                        hormones would eventually start to
                        take over and we would emotionally
                        attach.

                                 ADAM
                        Maybe you would...

                                 JANE
                        No, no, no. Don't pull that guy-girl
                        crap. Men emotionally attach just as
                        much during sex, they're just more
                        repressed and sad.

                                 ADAM
                        So you don't think friends with
                        benefits can work?

                                 JANE
                        I mean, maybe with serious limits and
                        for short durations, but after enough
                        time, the chemicals in your head take
                        over and you attach.

                                 ADAM
                        When you say "attach" you mean "fall
                        in love"?

           She doesn't want to use that word, but...

                                 JANE
                        ...Sure.
           INT. KITCHEN

           Showered and dressed in clean clothes, Jane and Adam
           continue their conversation over EGG SALAD.

                                 JANE
                        It's the whole reason why arranged
                        marriages work. Maybe you think the
                        person's gross when you meet them,
                        but your brain knows you're stuck,
                        and after several sessions in the
                        sack, working out the kinks and such,
                        getting used to each other's scents,
                        biology takes over.

                                 ADAM
                        Wow. You're such a romantic.

                                 JANE
                        Dude, it's science. You are a
                        scientist.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, and as a scientist I can point
                        to all sorts of evolutionary benefits
                        of emotional connection, but that
                        doesn't mean I think love is just
                        some chemical reaction. There's
                        also... I don't know, finding someone
                        who shares your sense of humor and
                        doesn't judge you for farting.
                        Someone who makes you more yourself.

           He points a forkful of egg salad at Jane to underscore his
           point.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Some people are meant to be together,
                        and it's not because of scents or
                        primal instincts or unavoidable
                        circumstances. They're just... meant
                        to be.

           Jane considers.

                                 JANE
                        ...Lame. We're all robots.

           Adam sighs.

                                 ADAM
                        By your logic it doesn't matter
                        whether we have sex or not.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Since we're the only two people here,
                        we'll "emotionally attach" anyway
                        'cuz our monkey brains will tell us
                        we have a better chance of survival
                        together.

                                 JANE
                        ...Or one of us will kill the other
                        to gain full control of our limited
                        resources.

           Adam stares at Jane for a quiet moment.

                                 ADAM
                        What's reason number two?

                                 JANE
                        Reason number two: we're both
                        married.

           INT. COCKPIT

           Jane again works on connecting all of the blasted wires,
           while Adam sits in the pilot's CHAIR, spinning around like a
           bored child in his parent's office.

           They listen to something amazing - like the Dirty Dancing
           soundtrack - on a WALKMAN-like device resting on the floor
           next to Jane.

                                 ADAM
                        Again, I have to say... I don't see
                        the problem.

                                 JANE
                        You don't think the fact that we're
                        both married should have an impact on
                        whether we sleep together?

                                 ADAM
                        Honestly, no. Granted, I haven't read
                        my marriage license lately, but I'm
                        pretty sure being adrift in space
                        with no hope of rescue means we get a
                        hall pass.

           Jane keeps working on the wires as they talk.

                                 JANE
                        First of all, there's not no hope of
                        a rescue.
                                 ADAM
                        What were we just talking about,
                        like, yesterday?

                                 JANE
                        ...That was two weeks ago.

                                 ADAM
                        Seriously?
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Time is effed out here...

                                 JANE
                        And what I said was it would be
                        irresponsible to spend trillions of
                        dollars to save us. But that doesn't
                        mean they can't scan the sky or maybe
                        have another already planned mission
                        drop by and pick us up... And who
                        knows? Maybe we are global heroes
                        that they'll waste trillions of
                        dollars on...

                                 ADAM
                        Unlikely. I have unpaid parking
                        tickets.

                                 JANE
                        Plus, we might not get saved, but I
                        for one still think we can fix this.

           Adam glances over at Jane's running tally of failed attempts
           to fix the ship...

                                 ADAM
                        How's that working out for you?

                                 JANE
                        It'd be better if someone got off
                        their ass and helped...

                                 ADAM
                        ...Yeah, no.

           Jane huffs.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        There are over a hundred wires there!
                        That's literally billions of possible
                        combinations.
                                 JANE
                        Not if you match up blast marks and
                        entry and exit points! There are,
                        like, eight combinations that I feel
                        pretty darn certain about...

           Adam stares at Jane.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Shut up. What else am I supposed to
                        do?

           Adam raises an eyebrow suggestively.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Nope. You may have a hall pass. I
                        don't want one.

                                 ADAM
                        Because your brain chemically reacts
                        to Todd and not me?

                                 JANE
                        Tom and I have been together since
                        college. That's a real-ass chunk of
                        time.

                                 ADAM
                        Uh huh. And how many of those years
                        did you spend deployed or in space?

           Jane's brow furrows.

                                 JANE
                        ...What's that got to do with
                        anything? I had a job to do.

           Adam has hit a nerve. He chooses not to push it.

                                 ADAM
                        Nothing. Sorry.

           But Jane is still annoyed.

                                 JANE
                        Are you seriously going to claim to
                        love Atlanta--

                                 ADAM
                        Savannah.
                                 JANE
                        --more than I love Tom while begging
                        me to cheat with you?

                                 ADAM
                        There is no begging! This is a
                        friendly debate to pass the time,
                        sir.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        And I wasn't trying to make a
                        comparison.
                                beat
                               (
                                    )
                        Also, it's not cheating.

                                 JANE
                        Of course it is!

                                 ADAM
                        No. Again, no relationship. No
                        emotions. Just banging.

                                 JANE
                        Banging is cheating.

                                 ADAM
                        Beg to differ.

                                 JANE
                        ...So if you - with no emotion,
                        purely for stress-relief - "banged" a
                        prostitute, that wouldn't count as
                        cheating?

                                 ADAM
                        Not if we were lost in space!

           Jane fights a smirk. She finishes attaching the last wires.

           She presses PAUSE on the Walkman.

                                 JANE
                        Ok. Flip 'um.

                                 ADAM
                        Both?

                                 JANE
                        Yep.

                                 ADAM
                        Testing navigation...
           Adam flips one of the big SWITCHES that Jane tried before.
           Nothing happens.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Test failed. Testing comms...

           He flips the switch by the MICROPHONE and speaks into the
           mic...

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Hello, Earth? We have the 49 veggie
                        pizzas you ordered?

           Nothing. He turns to Jane, a note of sympathy in his voice.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Test failed.

           The mood in the room is suddenly somber.

           Jane gets up, crosses the room, and adds another TALLY to
           her running list.

           Adam watches her as she stares at her list of failures.

                                 JANE
                        Why didn't they label the goddamn
                        wires...

                                 ADAM
                        Or color code them.

                                 JANE
                        Or number them. So many bad
                        choices...

           A silent moment.

                                 ADAM
                        ...How's the cut doing?

                                 JANE
                               (
                                without looking at
                                him)
                        It's fine.

           Another quiet moment.

                                 ADAM
                        What do you want to watch tonight?
           INT. TV ROOM

           In PAJAMAS, Jane and Adam walk into the TV room and slump
           onto the couch. The lights are dimmed.

                                 JANE
                        I don't know. Something upbeat.

                                 ADAM
                        Princess Bride?

                                 JANE
                        Ehh.

                                 ADAM
                        "Ehh"??

                                 JANE
                        We've watched it like a billion
                        times.

                                 ADAM
                        So let's go for a billion and one.

                                 JANE
                        Plus, you always spend the whole next
                        day all--

                                                          FLASH TO:

           INT. KITCHEN

           Adam points a piece of PIPE at a meandering hen and SHOUTS
           in his best Inigo voice...

                                 ADAM
                        HELLO! My name is Inigo Montoya. You
                        killed my father. Prepare to DIE!

           Behind him at the small DINING TABLE, Jane sits with
           Benson's skeleton, shaking her head.

           BACK IN THE TV ROOM...

                                 ADAM
                        I'm not seeing the problem.

           Jane shakes her head again.
                                 JANE
                        Can we please just try something
                        different? I have like ten more
                        movies we haven't watched at all yet.

           With a sigh, Adam picks up a TABLET and hands it to Jane.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Thank you.

           She navigates to her list of movies.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Ok... How about... Alien?

                                 ADAM
                        Never seen it.

                                 JANE
                        You've never seen Alien??

                                 ADAM
                        Nope.

                                 JANE
                        Dude! You are in for a serious
                        treat...

           She presses a button on the tablet, and the movie gets
           PROJECTED onto a drop-down SCREEN in front of the couch.

           Adam and Jane nestle down into their seats as the movie
           begins.

           SUPER: 117 MINUTES LATER...

           Jane looks pleased as the end credits of Alien roll.

           Adam, on the other hand, is glued to the back of the couch
           with his knees tucked up to his chest, wrapped in a BLANKET
           up to his neck. He looks horrified.

                                 ADAM
                        WHY THE FUCK DID WE WATCH THAT?

           Jane is taken aback as Adam stands - wrapping himself
           tighter in his blanket, and storms out of the room.

           But he's back in an instant, still yelling...

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Please walk me to the bathroom!
           Jane leaps up, wraps an arm around Adam's back, and walks
           him out of the room.

           INT. JANE'S ROOM

           Lights out. Jane is fast asleep in her quarters. She's NOT a
           cute sleeper - drool forms a puddle on her pillow.

           A KNOCK at the door fails to wake Jane.

           Adam opens the door anyway. He stands in the doorway wearing
           sweat pants, no shirt, wrapped in his BLANKET, and holding a
           HEN.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Jane? ...JANE!

           Jane startles awake.

                                 JANE
                        What??

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, were you asleep?

           Jane is still half-asleep and very confused.

                                 JANE
                        What is what?

                                 ADAM
                        I am very scared,
                               (
                                gesturing to the hen
                                                    )
                        and I don't think Bertha can protect
                        me.

           Jane's almost asleep again.

                                 JANE
                        Sorry 'bout your problems...

           Adam isn't having it.

                                 ADAM
                        Hey!

           Jane doesn't respond.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Can I sleep in here?
                                 JANE
                               (
                                without opening her
                                eyes)
                        Yes. Just, please, stop talking.

           Adam sets down the hen, who scurries down the hall.

           He jumps into Jane's bed and tucks himself tightly into the
           blankets. He leaves a respectful gap between himself and
           Jane.

           Jane is fast asleep. She begins to SNORE.

           Adam grins at the sound. He sneaks a glance at the back of
           Jane's head. Not in a creepy way - just grateful to have an
           understanding friend.

           He closes his eyes, visibly relieved.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. JANE'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           A large WALL PANEL SOLAR LIGHT gradually brightens, filling
           Jane's room with morning light.

           It causes Jane to awaken with a smile.

           She realizes she has rolled over to Adam's side of the bed
           and snuggled on his chest with one of her legs thrown over
           one of his.

           Oops.

           She tries to stealthily retreat back to her side of the bed.

           But Adam wakes up and sees her cuddled on him.

           They're both a bit embarrassed but also amused...

                                 ADAM
                        Hi there.

                                 JANE
                        Hi.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Those squishy round things pressed
                        against my side... Would those happen
                        to be--
                                 JANE
                        My boobs. Yep. Sorry, dude.

           They exchange an amused grin as Jane retreats to her side of
           the bed, making sure to keep herself decent.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        When you came in, I may have
                        forgotten about my... general lack of
                        clothing.

                                 ADAM
                        No worries.

           A quiet, awkward moment.

                                 JANE
                        Feeling better? After...

           She MIMES the alien popping out of the chest moment. Even
           that scares Adam...

                                 ADAM
                        Nope. Nope. Please. Nope.

           She grins.

           A quiet moment.

                                 JANE
                        Scram.

                                 ADAM
                        Right!

           Adam pops out of bed and leaves the room. Jane watches him
           go with a grin.

           INT. TV ROOM

           Jane and Adam are back in the TV room in their dancing
           clothes, clearing the floor for another routine...

           Adam pauses.

                                 ADAM
                        Wait.

           He walks over to Jane and bends down at her feet.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Before we do anything else...
           Adam peels back Jane's BANDAGE and checks her cut - it looks
           a little better than it did before.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Hey, look at that...

                                 JANE
                        I told you.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, well, only cuz I got mad
                        hydrogen peroxide skills.

           Jane grins.

           They go back to pushing the furniture. Jane sneaks a glance
           over at Adam...

                                 JANE
                        ...So I've been thinking about this
                        morning.

                                 ADAM
                        ...You mean the part where you
                        squished your boobs on me?

                                 JANE
                        Yep, that.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        It was kind of great, right?

           Before Adam can respond, Jane qualifies...

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        I mean, from a mental health
                        perspective, skin-to-skin contact is,
                        like, super healthy. So it was
                        probably psychologically beneficial
                        for both of us.

                                 ADAM
                        Is that your excessively clinical way
                        of saying "let's naked cuddle more"?

                                 JANE
                        Well, I mean... What are your
                        thoughts?

           Adam considers. He likes this idea, but he also feels the
           need to tease Jane...
                                 ADAM
                        Honestly, I'm surprised you're
                        suddenly so willing to cede the moral
                        high ground.

                                 JANE
                        How do you figure?

                                 ADAM
                        Now you're asking me to cheat.

                                 JANE
                        Whoa! I am not asking anything, and
                        even if I was, it's a mental health
                        thing.

                                 ADAM
                        And mine is a stress relief thing. So
                        if we're going to naked cuddle...

           Long pause. It's awkward.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        ...why not bang?

           Jane rolls her eyes. They both grin their way through this
           playful fight...

                                 JANE
                        Oh my god...

                                 ADAM
                               (
                                Am I wrong?
                                           )
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        This is starting to verge on sexual
                        harassment...

                                 ADAM
                        Haras--?? You were the one all up on
                        me this morning. Honestly, I'm
                        feeling a bit used.

                                 JANE
                        Used!?

                                 ADAM
                        I'm just a skin blanket to you.

           Jane laughs.
                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Seriously, though. You see how naked
                        cuddling is on the same sliding scale
                        as banging. They go hand in hand...

           Jane stops and considers.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah. Ok. You're right.

                                 ADAM
                        Thank you.

           Adam takes a meaningful step closer to Jane.

                                 JANE
                        So, we shouldn't do either.

           Adam stops in his tracks.

                                 ADAM
                        ...That is the opposite of what I was
                        hoping for.

           Jane pats him a bit too hard on the cheek.

                                 JANE
                        Sorry, kid.

           Jane walks over to the boombox in the wall and turns on some
           sexy Latin music.

           Adam watches her. His mood shifts - he's suddenly serious.

           Jane rejoins Adam in the middle of the room. She sees the
           shift and gives him a questioning look.

                                 ADAM
                        About your sexual harassment
                        comment...

                                 JANE
                               (
                                reassuring
                                          )
                        I didn't--

                                 ADAM
                        No, I know. But I don't want the
                        playful banter to slip into toxic,
                        creepy territory. So I'll just...
                        drop it.

                                 JANE
                        ...Ok. Good.
           Adam extends his hand.

                                 ADAM
                        Shall we?

           Jane takes his hand, and they begin a tango.

           It begins innocently enough. Their moves are precise and
           practiced.

           But as the music intensifies, so do their movements.

           Adam's hand runs up Jane's thigh.

           Jane's leg slips between Adam's legs.

           Their lips and bodies are so close...

           Seriously, this is getting HOT.

           The dance comes to a dramatic finish with Jane dipped low
           and Adam bent over her, the golden stars twirling behind
           them.

           They're both sweaty and breathing hard.

           Their eyes are LOCKED on each other...

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        So... I know I just said I would drop
                        it. But can you remind me one more
                        time why we shouldn't...

                                 JANE
                        ...Well. There's still reason number
                        three.

                                 ADAM
                        Which is?

                                 JANE
                        You might knock me up.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           Adam and Jane have moved to the observation deck - a small,
           circular room covered by a glass dome.

           There's only enough room for them to sit on the floor above
           a HATCH that leads down to the rest of the ship.
           It's as though they're SITTING OUTSIDE IN SPACE with
           Saturn's shimmering rings twirling by.

           In this little dome, Jane gives Adam a TATTOO of Saturn on
           his shoulder blade using a homemade TATTOO GUN.

           With his shirt off, we notice Adam has several other black-
           ink tattoos in the same style as the one Jane's giving him.

                                 ADAM
                        You don't have birth control?

           Jane talks as she tattoos...

                                 JANE
                        I had an IUD--

                                 ADAM
                        You have a bomb?

                                 JANE
                        ...Not I-E-D. I-U-D.

                                 ADAM
                        Right. Got it.

                                 JANE
                        --But it was giving me weird cramps
                        so Benson took it out. Before, you
                        know, the crazy.

                                 ADAM
                        ...And there aren't, like, condoms or
                        Plan B in medical?

                                 JANE
                        Amazingly, our government did not
                        send three married astronauts into
                        space with a supply of condoms...

                                 ADAM
                        Well that's just bad planning.

                                 JANE
                               (
                                dry
                                   )
                        It's basically the gray wires
                        situation all over again.

                                 ADAM
                        Totally.

           A quiet moment as Jane keeps working on the tattoo.
           Jane sneaks a glance at Adam.

           Adam sneaks a glance at Jane.

           They both sneak a glance at the same time and are
           embarrassed when their eyes accidentally meet.

           There's a nervousness, an energy between them.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        ...So. For argument's sake. Say you
                        did get knocked up...
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Would that be so bad?

           Jane stops tattooing.

           That nervous energy is officially GONE.

           She STARES at Adam.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        I said "for argument's sake."

                                 JANE
                        You wanna raise a baby? Adrift? In
                        space?

           Adam shrugs his shoulders.

                                 ADAM
                        I mean... It's pretty. Our food and
                        life support are self-sustaining...
                        We have movies...
                                beat
                               (
                                    )
                        What kid doesn't love space?

                                 JANE
                        You're losing your mind.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Also, I don't want to say this,
                        but I think it's worth mentioning...
                        that all the radiation in space has
                        probably made you sterile.

           Jane is blown away. She stares at Adam.

           He shrugs his shoulders - it's true.

           Jane descends down the hatch in the floor.

           Adam drops his head through the hatch...
           INT. HALLWAY

           The hatch is above the hallway that Adam has painted.

           Jane stomps down the hallway away from Adam, whose head
           dangles down through the ceiling...

                                 ADAM
                        I said I didn't want to say it!
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        I also want it on the record that I'm
                        really good at pulling out.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. TV ROOM

           Jane vents at Benson's skeleton, who is set up on the couch
           with her as though he's listening attentively.

                                 JANE
                        Can you believe him? All the man can
                        think about is sex! And before you
                        say anything, yes, obviously I'm
                        thinking about it, too. I've turned
                        four different electric drills into
                        vibrators...

           Benson doesn't respond.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        But someone's gotta be rational,
                        right? I mean, do we really want to
                        mess with the very delicate balance
                        we've managed to create? He's like my
                        big brother! And my little sister.
                        And sort of my dog...

           Off of Benson.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        You were obviously the parent. Until
                        you went nuts and tried to kill us.
                        Not cool, by the way...

           Jane's mind drifts back to the topic at hand...
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                               (
                                gesturing to her
                                body)
                        And does he really expect me to
                        believe that he's not attracted to
                        this? Really?? Come on...

           INT. KITCHEN

           Benson's skeleton is now set up attentively at the counter
           in the kitchen as Adam makes himself a POP-TART.

                                 ADAM
                        These quote-unquote reasons she's
                        throwing out are all bull, ya know.
                        No contraception?? We're fricken
                        astronauts. I think we can figure
                        something out.

           Benson doesn't respond.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        And even if we did make it home -
                        which we won't, by the way - there's
                        just no way Savannah wouldn't
                        understand.

           Benson stares at Adam.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        ...Yeah, of course I miss her. I miss
                        her every day. I wonder what she's
                        doing... If she's found someone
                        new...
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Honestly, I'd be devastated if she
                        was waiting for me. She deserves more
                        than that.

           INT. TV ROOM

           Jane has moved onto the floor, drawing lines on the corduroy
           couch with her finger. Benson's skeleton is stretched out on
           the couch, watching her.

                                 JANE
                        ...I'm starting to forget what Tom
                        looks like. He didn't want me to
                        come.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        He's such a good guy. You've never
                        met a better man. And we have so much
                        history...

           INT. KITCHEN

           Adam stares at his Pop-Tart.

                                 ADAM
                        This is my very last one.

           Adam looks at the Pop-Tart with a broken heart.

           He picks it up and takes a careful bite. Benson watches him.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Add that to the list of things I'll
                        never do again...

           INT. TV ROOM

           Jane is still doodling with her finger on the couch, but
           she's stopped talking. She's lost in thought.

           She realizes that the shape she's drawn bears a strong
           resemblance to a PENIS...

           Jane looks up at Benson, who stares back at her.

                                 JANE
                        Shut up.

           Jane gets up.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        We need some music.

           She stomps over to the boombox built into the wall. She
           searches for a good song to play.

           She presses the play button and turns back to the couch.

           But no music comes on.

           Jane realizes and turns back to the boombox.

           A small SCREEN on the boombox reads:

           FILE CORRUPTED.
           Jane's brow furrows. She tries to play another song...

           FILE CORRUPTED.

           And another...

           FILE CORRUPTED.

           Her breathing quickens.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Oh my god... Oh my god...

           She tries different folders, different types of media...

           They're all CORRUPTED.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        No! NO!!

           She SCREAMS it.

           Adam comes dashing into the room looking panicked.

                                 ADAM
                        What?? What's wrong? Are you hurt?

           Jane is having a full-on PANIC ATTACK. She does her best to
           gesture to the boombox...

                                 JANE
                        My music... My music...

           Adam hurries over and sees what's happening. He takes the
           situation very seriously.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok. Ok. You sit down. Let me see...

           Jane drops onto her knees in the middle of the room,
           struggling for breath.

           Adam grabs the TABLET that they used to start the movie
           before and hustles to join Jane on the floor.

           He swipes and types.

                               (
                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                                reading the device
                                                  )
                        Oh, god...

                                 JANE
                        What?
                                 ADAM
                        It looks like the root file for all
                        of your media got corrupted
                        somehow...

           Jane BURSTS INTO TEARS - this is absolutely devastating
           news. She collapses onto the floor.

           Adam rubs her back and tries his best to comfort her.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        I'm so sorry. This is--

           He doesn't even know what to say. He lays down next to her.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        But hey! The good news is all my
                        files still work! You can listen to
                        my music!

                                 JANE
                               (
                                through her sobs
                                                )
                        Country music!?

                                 ADAM
                        And some Eminem...?

           Jane sobs even harder.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        No, no, no! I swear I've got some
                        good stuff. Remember that Willie
                        Nelson song? I've got, uh... You like
                        Sinatra?

           Jane is crying too hard to respond. She's a wreck. Adam is
           desperate to help her feel better - seeing her like this is
           destroying him.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Who's your favorite singer?

           Jane is barely able to get it out...

                                 JANE
                        W-W-Whitney Houston...

           Adam nestles himself a bit closer to Jane and HOLDS HER HAND
           in his. He starts SINGING...

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
                        I wanna feel the heat with somebody
           Adam's voice is BEAUTIFUL.

           Jane stares at him - she's never heard him sing before. Her
           sobs begin to soften.

           Adam sees that his song is working, and he smiles.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
                        With somebody who loves me
                        Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
                        I wanna feel the heat with somebody
                        Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
                        With somebody who loves me

           Jane stops crying. She's still devastated, but for this
           moment, she feels relief.

           Adam wipes her tear-stained cheeks and brushes her hair off
           of her face as he continues to sing...

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        I've been in love and lost my senses
                        Spinning through the town
                        Sooner or later, the fever ends
                        And I wind up feeling down
                        I need a man who'll take a chance
                        On a love that burns hot enough to
                        last
                        So when the night falls
                        My lonely heart calls

           Jane joins in. Her voice is raspy and nasally thanks to her
           tears.

           But Adam doesn't mind.

                                 ADAM & JANE
                        Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
                        I wanna feel the heat with somebody
                        Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
                        With somebody who loves me

           They lie there in comfortable silence for a moment.

           Benson's skeleton watches them from the couch - it's almost
           as if he's smiling.

           Whitney Houston's classic (or a similar sort of song) plays
           over the next few scenes...
           INT. KITCHEN

           Her cheeks dusted with FLOUR, Jane stands in front of the
           oven with Adam next to her. He has his arms crossed,
           waiting.

           Jane cracks the oven open and peeks in while yelling at
           Adam...

                                 JANE
                        Don't look, don't look, don't look!

           Adam averts his eyes.

                                 ADAM
                        What did you do??

                                 JANE
                        Dude. I think it's gonna work.

                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        Are you ready for this?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.

           Jane opens the oven and pulls out a COOKIE SHEET carrying
           her home-made version of a POP-TART.

           Adam covers his mouth as TEARS instantly come to his eyes.

                                 JANE

                               (
                                    )
                        Now it's a little thicker than the
                        real thing, and probably not quite as
                        dry or crumbly...
                                beat
                        What do you think?

           Adam can't speak. It's adorable.

           He gives Jane a big HUG.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           Jane cleans the TATTOO GUN as Adam looks at his now finished
           tattoo with a HAND MIRROR.

                                 ADAM
                        This might be your best yet.
                                 JANE
                        Thank you.

           All clean, Jane hands him the TATTOO GUN.

                                 ADAM
                        Know what you want?

                                 JANE
                        I dunno... Just something nice right
                        here.

           She points to the side of her thigh.

                                 ADAM
                        So... hearts and dolphins?

                                 JANE
                        ...Yup. Lisa Frank the crap out of
                        me.

                                 ADAM
                        Thought you'd never ask.

           INT. COCKPIT

           Jane sits in her usual spot in the cockpit, working on those
           damn gray wires again.

           Adam saunters in and watches her work. He just wants to be
           near her.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Need a hand?

           Genuinely touched, Jane nods for him to come join her.

           INT. GREENHOUSE

           Jane and Adam both sit at a table covered in PLANTS in the
           greenhouse. The hens cluck and the goat munches behind them.

           They have their heads in their hands, watching Adam's
           MARIJUANA PLANT.

           They watch...

                                 ADAM
                        ...It's going to fruit any day now. I
                        can feel it.
                                 JANE
                        ...I believe you.

           Quiet.

           Jane steals a glance at Adam - it's cute how much he cares
           about this plant.

                                 ADAM
                        And then we'll get an amazing high
                        from these sweet, raw berries... And
                        if we make it back to Earth, I'll be
                        a billionaire.

                                 JANE
                        ...Well. You'll still have to cook
                        them.

                                 ADAM
                        Why?

                                 JANE
                        ...The THC or whatever in weed only
                        activates when it's heated. You have
                        to, ya know, smoke it or bake it. I
                        mean, you can't just eat one of these
                        leaves right now and get stoned.

           As she speaks, Adam's heart breaks. She sees it.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        But maybe I'm wrong! Maybe you'll
                        make the very first raw plant that
                        can get you high...

           There's no recovering. Adam BANGS HIS HEAD on the table.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        They'll still be great! ...We'll make
                        weed berry Pop-Tarts!

           Adam stops banging his head. He slowly resumes his plant-
           watching position with Jane.

                                 ADAM
                        ...That would be amazing.

           Jane smiles.

                                 JANE
                        Totally.
           INT. JANE'S ROOM

           Jane sleeps in her darkened room, but she's restless.

           She wakes up with a GASP of pain.

           The song that's been playing over the last few scenes comes
           to an abrupt end.

           Jane is sweaty. She knows what's wrong, but she doesn't want
           to look...

           After a moment fighting with herself, she tosses aside her
           blanket and reaches for the BANDAGE on her calf.

           She slowly peels it back to reveal that her cut has filled
           with PUSS.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. MEDICAL

           Both in pajamas, Adam finishes putting a fresh bandage on
           Jane's calf as she sits on the exam table with her arms
           folded.

           She's furious and sad at the same time. Adam knows better
           than to say anything to her.

           Instead he walks over to a supply shelf and grabs a lone
           PILL BOTTLE labeled PENICILLIN.

           He takes a PILL out and holds it out to Jane.

           Jane doesn't move. A tear rolls down her cheek.

                                 JANE
                        So no more tattoos. The risk...

                                 ADAM
                        ...Yeah.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Add that to the list.

                                 JANE
                        What?

                                 ADAM
                        ...Nothing.

                                 JANE
                        I'm sorry--
                                 ADAM
                        Don't. It was an accident.

                                 JANE
                        ...What happens when you have an
                        accident?

                                 ADAM
                        I won't. You're the klutz.

           Jane smirks. She reluctantly takes the pill from Adam and
           swallows it.

           Their eyes meet.

                                 JANE
                        Thanks.

                                 ADAM
                        Any time.

           INT. TV ROOM

           The lights dimmed, Jane and Adam sit on opposite ends of the
           couch watching The Princess Bride on the drop-down screen.

           INT. TV ROOM

           The room cleared and the lights up, Jane and Adam dance a
           HIP-HOP DANCE together.

           It isn't a particularly sexy routine, but they have so much
           fun with it.

           Their bodies and rhythms are perfectly in sync. They LAUGH
           and have a wonderful time.

           INTERCUT this dance with their viewing of The Princess
           Bride.

           As the movie goes on, their bodies shift closer and closer
           to each other on the couch until they're CUDDLING.

           It happens without words. It's just... natural.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. JANE'S ROOM

           Jane sits on her bed reading a TABLET and listening to a
           country album.

           Adam appears in her open door. Jane doesn't look up...

                                 JANE
                        Hey, I don't know if you know this,
                        but Garth Brooks is actually really
                        good...

           She looks up and sees the SOMBER look on Adam's face.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        What?

           INT. GREENHOUSE

           Jane and Adam both look devastated.

           They're standing over the goat, lying DEAD in his pen.

           After a quiet moment...

                                 JANE
                        We gotta move him out of here.

           Adam gives her a questioning look.

                               (
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                                nodding toward the
                                hens)
                        ...I don't want the girls to see.

           Adam offers up a sad, understanding smile.

           He picks up the goat in both arms, like a sleeping child.

           Jane strokes the goat's back. She embraces the goat and
           Adam.

           They share a tender, mournful moment.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN

           We're confronted by a PLATE of steamy, mouth-watering MEAT.
           Jane and Adam, still looking stricken, stare down at their
           dinners as they sit at the kitchen table.

           Neither one can find the will to pick up their UTENSILS...

                                 ADAM
                        ...Do we have to.

                                 JANE
                        ...It would be crazy not to. Right?

                                 ADAM
                        We didn't eat Benson...

                                 JANE
                        Sure. But Benson was a person. This
                        was a goat that was on the ship for
                        food purposes.

                                 ADAM
                        For milk purposes.
                                beat
                               (
                                    )
                        How much do we have left?

                                 JANE
                        I think there's like 12 pints in the
                        freezer...
                               (
                                silver lining
                                             )
                        But now there's also like 50 meals-
                        worth of meat...

           A quiet moment. Jane and Adam's eyes meet.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Together?

           Adam nods. They both pick up their utensils and cut small
           pieces of meat.

           Their eyes meet again.

                                 ADAM
                        One.

                                 JANE
                        Two.

                                 ADAM
                        Three.

           They both stuff their respective bites in their mouths and
           slowly chew.
           The tension in their shoulders melts away.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Holy Christ that's good.

                               (
                                nodding
                                 JANE
                                       )
                        Mm...

           Their eyes meet again, and they both LAUGH softly.

           Through their soft, sad laughter...

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Shit...

                                 ADAM
                        I know.

           A quiet moment as they both chew. Jane and Adam both steal
           glances at one another.

           But the glances aren't flirty. Rather, they're the glances
           of two people who have been through war together and managed
           to keep their smiles.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. TV ROOM

           The lights dimmed, wearing their pajamas, Jane and Adam lie
           face up on the couch in opposite directions so that their
           heads meet in the middle.

           Ear to ear, they gaze up at the ceiling.

           The room is quiet.

           Jane's cheeks redden slightly as she steels her nerves...

                                 JANE
                        You haven't asked to bang in a while.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Technically I never asked. It was
                        a debate.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, ok.

           Back to silence. Adam puzzles - why did she bring that up?
           He opens his mouth to ask, but she beats him to the punch...

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        So for the sake of debate... What
                        would your theoretical stance be
                        on... everything but?

           Adam's eyes go wide, but he tries to play it cool. They're
           still both looking at the ceiling.

                                 ADAM
                        ...So, like, hand stuff?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah.

                                 ADAM
                        And... mouth stuff?

                                 JANE
                        Everything but... that you can
                        hypothetically imagine.

           Now Adam's cheeks are red.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Well. Hypothetically. I'd want to
                        make sure you were sure.

           Jane hesitates.

                                 JANE
                        I'm... pretty sure.

           That's not the answer Adam was hoping for, but he covers.

                                 ADAM
                        ...So like, 97 percent?

                                 JANE
                        I still have a husband. But he's
                        still a billion miles away. And it's
                        just a matter of time before
                        something vital on this ship breaks
                        that we can't fix...

           Adam's brow furrows. He knows she's right.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Plus, you are hot.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        And I've seen the outline of your
                        penis when you wear gym shorts, and
                        it seems like it wouldn't disappoint.

                                 ADAM
                        Wow. Full-on honesty time...

                                 JANE
                        It's not just me, right? You're
                        attracted to me, too.

                                 ADAM
                        Theoretically--

                                 JANE
                        No. Are you attracted to me.

           Eyes still on the ceiling.

           Adam hesitates, but he answers sincerely...

                                 ADAM
                        Yes. Very.

                                 JANE
                        ...Ok.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah. Ok.

                                 ADAM
                        Wait. Did you just go from "pretty
                        sure" to "sure"?

                                 JANE
                        ...There is one other thing.

                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        ...Ok, I'm not saying this
                        romantically, so don't get the wrong
                        idea... but you are literally my
                        entire world.

                                 ADAM
                        Ahhh--
                                 JANE
                        Shut up. You're my only friend.
                        You're my only co-worker. You're the
                        only person who can check that weird
                        mole for me.
                                    )
                               (
                                beat
                        What if... you're bad at sex?

           Adam chuckles.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        I'm serious! What if we do it, and
                        you can't find my clit or you're one

                        and things get weird and this awesome
                        thing we have going right now gets...
                        ruined?

                                 ADAM
                        ...Ok. First of all. I love the clit.
                        Big fan. It's always my first and
                        last stop.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Second. We're still in agreement that
                        this would just be banging, right?

           Jane hesitates for half a second, then hurries to concur.

                                 JANE
                        Right.

                                 ADAM
                        ...So if one of us wants to stop, we
                        just stop. No hard feelings. No
                        explanation needed, or even asked
                        for.

                                 JANE
                        ...Yeah?

                                 ADAM
                        Totally.

                                 JANE
                        You promise?

                                 ADAM
                        I swear on our dead, delicious goat.

                                 JANE
                        ...Ok.
           Silence.

                                 ADAM
                        ...What'd we just decide?

                                 JANE
                        I think we decided to try everything
                        but.

                                 ADAM
                        Wow. Ok.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Right now?

                                 JANE
                        ...I guess?

           They both hesitate, so awkward and unsure. They're like
           teenagers.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Actually. I, um, haven't done any
                        personal maintenance in, like, a long
                        time...

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, me either.

                                 JANE
                        So, maybe... tomorrow night?

                                 ADAM
                        Sure. Tomorrow.

                                 JANE
                        Ok, then.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok.

           They both try to contain their nervous, excited energy as
           they keep their eyes firmly locked on the ceiling.

                                                            CUT TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS: THE NEXT DAY

           In SPLIT-SCREEN, we see...

           - Jane and Adam waking up in their respective rooms with big
           smiles on their faces. They both slip a hand under their
           covers...
           - Jane and Adam each stand in front of a BATHROOM MIRROR
           shaving, plucking, trimming - managing all the hair
           situations.

           - In the kitchen, the split screens line up for a minute as
           Jane and Adam sit down to breakfast with each other, each
           with coy grins.

                                 JANE
                        Lieutenant...

                                 ADAM
                        Captain...

           Benson's skeleton sits at the counter with his head on his
           hand in a position that seems to say, oh brother...

           - Back to split screen. Jane runs on the treadmill in the
           gym, singing along to some country song. Adam dances as he
           tends to the crops in the greenhouse.

           - Adam adds a portrait of Jane to his hallway painting. Jane
           works on the gray wires in the cockpit.

           She finishes attaching the last pair of wires and strides
           over to the big switches.

           She flips the first - nothing. She jokes into the mic...

                                 JANE
                        Yo, Earth. We miss you, bro.

           She flips the second switch and A MONITOR TURNS ON.

           The split screen ENDS as we focus on this monitor.

           It's a screen that had been black this whole time. And now,
           it's ILLUMINATED with a MAP OF SPACE.

           Jane is caught completely off guard. Her jaw drops.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Oh, fuck...

           INT. COCKPIT

           Jane has brought Adam into the cockpit. They both stare,
           utterly shocked, at the illuminated screen.

                                 ADAM
                        We have navigation...?
                                 JANE
                        Yep.

                                 ADAM
                        No comms, though.

                                 JANE
                        No. But we don't need comms to get
                        home.

                                 ADAM
                        So this is it. You can fly us home.

                                 JANE
                        Yep.

                                 ADAM
                        ...How long will it take?

                                 JANE
                        Three weeks.

           An

           awkwardly

           long

           silence.

           Eventually, Adam turns to Jane with a weak shoulder shrug...

                                 ADAM
                        So I guess...

           Their eyes connect.

           Jane JUMPS on Adam and THEY START MAKING OUT.

           All of their pent up sexual tension goes into this kiss.

           INT. JANE'S ROOM

           Jane and Adam DO IT in her bed.

           Their sex is passionate and fun - not somber and slow. These
           guys are getting it on, and they're having a great time.

           Adam notices something on Jane's NIGHT STAND...
                                 ADAM
                        Why do you have so many drills in
                        your room?

           He's discovered Jane's modified-drill VIBRATORS.

                                 JANE
                        Oo! Let me show you...

           She reaches over to grab the BIGGEST ONE.

           INT. KITCHEN

           Jane and Adam do it on the kitchen table.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           Jane and Adam try to do it in the little glass dome
           observation deck, but they keep bumping into the dome.

           INT. COCKPIT

           Jane sits in the captain's chair, checking their flight
           path.

           The MONITOR indicates they have 14 DAYS, 6 HOURS TO ARRIVAL.

           Jane's expression is an indecipherable mix of emotions.

           INT. BATHROOM

           Jane and Adam do it in the shower.

           INT. TV ROOM

           Jane and Adam do it on the couch.

           Benson's skeleton is set up in the armchair across from
           them, covering his eyes.

           INT. GREENHOUSE

           Jane and Adam do it on the floor of the greenhouse.

           They fend off curious hens.
           INT. COCKPIT

           Adam tiptoes into the cockpit to check on their arrival
           time. The screen indicates 6 DAYS, 8 HOURS TO ARRIVAL.

           Adam's emotions are just as mixed up as Jane's.

           INT. ADAM'S ROOM

           Jane and Adam climax in Adam's bed (his room is a mirror
           version of Jane's). They both lay back, exhausted.

           Adam instinctively raises his arm for Jane to nestle into
           his nook.

           Jane pauses and notices the intimacy of the gesture before
           cuddling with Adam.

           They both close their eyes.

                                 JANE
                        I'm gonna need to get up and pee in
                        like thirty seconds.

                                 ADAM
                        Shhh...

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           Adam gives Jane a tattoo on her BUTT of two stars.

                                 JANE
                        If this gets infected and I die
                        before we get home, I'm gonna haunt
                        you so hard.

                                 ADAM
                        Understood.

           He jokes...

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        This is gonna be a tricky one to
                        explain to the husband...

           As soon as he says the words, he regrets them.

           Jane avoids his eye. She tries to keep the tone light.
                                 JANE
                        Well, we'll cross that bridge when we
                        get to it.

           Adam doesn't know what else to say, and Jane clearly doesn't
           want to talk about it. So he goes back to tattooing.

           INT. COCKPIT

           Jane and Adam both sit in the captain's chairs looking out
           the front window. The golden stars glitter and twirl.

           They both watch the stars, slumped in their chairs.

           The screen reads 2 DAYS, 11 HOURS TO ARRIVAL.

                                 JANE
                        It's weird, right?

           He responds even before she finishes the question.

                                 ADAM
                        Totally.

           A quiet moment.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        You think there'll be, like, flying
                        cars and stuff?

                                 JANE
                        ...We've been gone three years.

                                 ADAM
                        Still.

           Jane grins, but her smile quickly fades.

                                 JANE
                        I think it'll be exactly the same.
                        And completely different.

           Adam mulls that over...

                                 ADAM
                        What are you most looking forward to?

                                 JANE
                        ...Swimming in the ocean. Having my
                        music back. Never eating another egg
                        for the rest of my goddamn life...
                                 ADAM
                        Preach.

                                 JANE
                        ...You?

           Adam thinks it over, then decides to answer honestly.

                                 ADAM
                        I'm looking forward to hugging
                        Savannah.
                               (
                                    )
                                beat
                        Is that ok to say?

           Jane holds all of her emotions inside as tightly as she can.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah. Of course. She's your wife for
                        goodness sake.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, but--

                                 JANE
                        I can't wait to see Tom.
                                    )
                               (
                                beat
                        I mean, he probably waited a
                        dignified three months before
                        marrying some nice mid-Western girl
                        and filling her full of babies...

                                 ADAM
                        You think?

                                 JANE
                        ...I don't know.

           Quiet.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        It'll just be nice to get off this
                        piece-of-crap rocket and get back to
                        reality.

           Adam's brow furrows. Does she really mean that?

           Another quiet moment.

                                 ADAM
                        Can we, uh... Can we still be best
                        friends when we get back?
                                beat
                                    )
                               (
                        Please?
           Jane looks over at Adam.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        You've been literally my entire
                        world, after all.

           Jane fights to keep her emotions tucked inside. She offers
           Adam a small smile.

                                 JANE
                        Your world's about to get a lot
                        bigger.

           She gets up and walks out of the cockpit, leaving Adam
           looking lost and alone.

           He gazes out the front window with a furrowed brow as a
           tiny, distant PLANET EARTH rises into view.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. TV ROOM

           The furniture is pushed back, and Jane and Adam are dressed
           for one last dance.

           They meet in the center of the floor.

           A soft, romantic song like James Arthur's "Falling from the
           Stars" begins.

           Jane and Adam fall into a slow dance, a mix of ballet and
           modern.

           Neither one tries to hide their emotions - their eyes are
           locked on one another. There's no looking away.

           INTERCUT this dance with...

           INT. COCKPIT

           Wearing SPACE SUITS and HELMETS for the first time, Jane and
           Adam clip into their seats in the cockpit.

           The screen reads 26 MINUTES TO ARRIVAL.

           A beautiful paper model of Earth looms large in the window.
           They're almost home.
           BACK TO THE DANCE...

           Jane and Adam spin around the room as the golden stars twirl
           around them.

           IN THE COCKPIT...

           Adam grips the arms of his chair and steals a glance over at
           Jane as she flies them into the atmosphere.

           THE DANCE...

           Adam lifts Jane high above his head as...

           IN THE COCKPIT...

           The rocket shakes violently as they hurtle toward the
           ground.

           A TEAR rolls down Jane's stern, focused face...

           THE DANCE...

           Adam slowly lowers Jane down into his arms.

           They breath hard, staring into each other's eyes, as the
           song comes to a quiet end.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY

           The colors and overall feel down here on Earth are
           noticeably DULLER than they were up in space. Everything is
           a bit gray and painfully real - no more magic.

           The front wheel of Jane and Adam's rocket rolls to a
           delicate STOP on a TARMAC outside of a large HANGAR with the
           NASA emblem painted on its closed doors.

           INSIDE THE COCKPIT...

           Jane and Adam both stare out the window, eyes straight
           ahead.

           They're frozen in place.
           OUT ON THE TARMAC...

           A NASA EMPLOYEE carrying a cup of COFFEE, a CLIPBOARD, and
           putting on his AVIATORS emerges from the hangar door,
           whistling a care-free tune.

           He's confronted by the rocket, and instantly DROPS
           everything.

                                 NASA EMPLOYEE
                        Son of a what the holy!

                        What!?

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

           A CACOPHONY of questions and camera snaps rise from 100
           REPORTERS crammed into a gray conference room built to hold
           40 people.

           At the front of the room, Jane and Adam - dressed in flight
           uniforms - sit at a long, narrow TABLE on an elevated stage
           with a nervous NASA SPOKESPERSON between them. All three
           have MICS in front of them.

           The spokesperson - dressed in a suit - tries desperately to
           control the unruly crowd.

                                 SPOKESPERSON
                        People! Please! If everyone could--
                        Please!

           The reporters won't stop yelling, so the spokesperson starts
           yelling a WRITTEN STATEMENT over them, which quickly quiets
           them down.

                                 SPOKESPERSON (cont'd)
                        When we lost contact with Jupiter 6
                        three years, one month, and seven
                        days ago, we had every reason to
                        suspect the worst. Today, we are
                        thrilled to discover that - in true
                        NASA form - we were gloriously wrong.

           The reporters offer up a good-natured chuckle.
                                 SPOKESPERSON (cont'd)
                        The successful return of Captain Jane
                        Williams and Lead Science Officer
                        Adam Gherrity is cause for
                        celebration the world over, and
                        perhaps none will be more elated than
                        their spouses, Tom Wright and
                        Governor Savannah Gherrity, who are
                        en route as we speak.

           Both Adam and Jane raise their eyebrows at the word
           "governor." Jane leans ever so slightly forward and
           mouths...

                                 JANE
                        "Governor"?

           Adam responds with a tiny baffled shrug.

                                 SPOKESPERSON
                        At the same time, we are deeply
                        saddened to learn of the passing of
                        Lead Medical Officer Megan Benson...

           An official NASA portrait of Benson - who turns out to be
           some amazing woman like MERYL STREEP - projects on the white
           wall behind the conference table.

                                 SPOKESPERSON (cont'd)
                        ...who passed away early in the
                        mission from as-yet unknown causes.

           A brazen reporter jumps in with a shouted question...

                                 REPORTER
                        What do you think happened?

           Jane and Adam exchange a look...

                                                          FLASH TO:

           INT. COCKPIT

           In a three-second flurry, we see the cockpit filled with
           SMOKE and blaring ALARMS. The panel of gray wires GLOWS with
           molten heat, having just been BLASTED apart.

           And in the middle of that, a crazed Megan Benson stands in
           her space suit - helmet on - SCREAMING at Adam with a SHOT
           GUN pointed at his head.

           Adam is holding up his hands...
                                 ADAM
                        Benson. Listen to me...

           That's when Jane sneaks up behind Benson and SWINGS AN AX at
           her back.

           As the ax is about to connect we cut...

           BACK TO THE CONFERENCE...

           Jane steps up to field the question.

                                 JANE
                        She passed in her sleep. As far as we
                        can tell, it was either cardiac
                        arrest or an aneurysm.

           The reporters jot down notes.

           Another bold reporter jumps in.

                                 REPORTER 2
                        How does it feel to be back home?

           They both hesitate again. This time Adam steps up.

                                 ADAM
                        It'll be better once we can get out
                        of small rooms like this one.

           The reporters laugh.

                                 SPOKESPERSON
                        I'm sure you all have endless
                        questions, but Ms. Williams and Mr.
                        Gherrity need to get to medical for
                        full evaluations, so--

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Darling!

           A beautiful woman (35) in a modern, elegant pant suit (think
           AOC), rushes into the meeting room followed by a stream of
           PHOTOGRAPHERS. This is SAVANNAH.

                                 ADAM
                        Savvy?

           The reporters split like the sea as Savannah runs to Adam,
           who hurries down from the stage to meet her.

           Jane watches it all with a tight lump in her throat.
           Adam goes to HUG his wife, but she THROWS HERSELF into a
           ROMANTIC DIP and pulls his face in for an awkward KISS.

           Adam is caught off guard. But boy does it look good for
           those cameras.

           Everyone in the room APPLAUDS. Including Jane.

           After the kiss, Savannah gives a small wave off to the
           cameras - you guys, give us some space - and she pulls Adam
           out of the meeting room.

           He tries to get a look back at Jane, but she makes her way
           out another door.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. JANE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           This room, like the rest of Earth so far, is gray and dull.

           It's a small, private room with a hospital BED, a COUCH, and
           a TV. Nothing fancy.

           Jane sits on the couch in sweats, listening to soft ELEVATOR
           MUSIC funneling into the room through a SPEAKER above the
           door.

           Jane glares at that speaker.

           A cheery NURSE pops into the room...

                                 NURSE
                        How we doin'?

                                 JANE
                        ...Is there any way to change the
                        music?

                                 NURSE
                        Ooo, I'm sorry. That's building wide.
                        We can't change it for individual
                        rooms.

                                 JANE
                        Ok. I don't want to play this card
                        for something that, I'm sure, will
                        seem trivial. But I'm kind of an
                        international space hero.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        At least for the next month or so
                        until I'm forgotten and then probably
                        for another month when the Lifetime
                        movie inevitably comes out. And I
                        would really appreciate it if you
                        could find a way to turn this shit
                        off and get me some Queen or classic
                        Madonna. Hell, I'd even take some
                        goddamn Britney Spears. Ok?

           The nurse hesitates.

                                 NURSE
                        ...I'll see what I can do.

           The nurse backs out of the room.

           Jane drops her head into her hands.

           The door opens again.

           With an exasperated sigh, Jane looks up.

           But it isn't the nurse this time. It's a tall, mid-western
           guy with a twinkle in his eye.

                                 JANE
                        ...Tom?

           TOM (30s) is breathing heavily. He's clearly gotten here as
           fast as he possibly could.

                                 TOM
                        There's my girl...

           Jane BURSTS INTO TEARS.

           Tom rushes over and holds her tightly as Jane sobs into his
           chest.

           Tears come to Tom's eyes, too, as he smells her hair and
           kisses the top of her head.

                                 TOM (cont'd)
                        God, I've missed you.

           Jane pulls herself out of Tom's arms and wipes her eyes.

                                 JANE
                        Wait. Wait. If you're gonna pull a
                        Castaway on me and tell me you've
                        married someone else then please do
                        it now because I don't think--
                                 TOM
                        No!

                                 JANE
                        ...No?

                                 TOM
                        No. Sweetie. I'm all yours.

                                 JANE
                        But-- Didn't you think I was dead?

           He brushes her hair out of her face...

                                 TOM
                        Everyone kept saying that. My
                        parents, your parents, my therapist,
                        our friends, multiple psychics... But
                        I knew in my heart that you'd find
                        your way back to me. I could feel it.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Our love crossed the stars.

           Jane is simultaneously touched and a little nauseated by
           that comment. But she keeps her cynical side locked up.

           She leans back into Tom's chest, and they hold each other
           tightly.

           INT. ADAM'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MEANWHILE

           Adam's hospital room is just like Jane's but flipped. That
           same elevator music plays in the background.

           He sits on his little couch with Savannah. They're both
           turned sideways, facing each other.

           There's an awkwardness between them. They both seem
           conflicted about whether they should touch.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...I'm sorry about the whole dip
                        thing.

           Adam smirks.

                                 SAVANNAH (cont'd)
                        I had my team in my head telling me
                        what an important moment this was and
                        how we had to get it just right and,
                        inside... God, I was terrified.

                        I really didn't think I'd see you

                                 ADAM
                        ...I know. Me, too.

                        Yeah. That.

           Adam offers Savannah a kind smile.

                                 ADAM
                        Savvy, it's ok.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        No, but-- I feel like I need to
                        explain. Because when you
                        disappeared, there was suddenly this
                        spotlight on me, and I couldn't go
                        out and have death-rebound sex like a
                        normal person, and I was just...
                        stuck, playing this part to meet
                        expectations. So all I had was my
                        work, and suddenly I had this weird,
                        twisted opportunity to run, and it
                        all just...

                                 ADAM
                        Savannah. I'm really proud of you.

           Savannah is touched. These two really get each other. They
           share a warm HUG.
           As they hug, the elevator music in the background CUTS OFF.
           It's quickly replaced by a Queen song.

           Adam notices. His brow furrows.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

           Jane and Tom stand in the middle of a large, gray hospital
           lobby with over-sized glass doors that look out over the
           parking lot.

           Said parking lot is TEEMING WITH REPORTERS, all trying to
           get a shot of Jane and Adam on their way out.

           A frazzled ADMINISTRATOR hurries over to Jane and Tom.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I'm so sorry. We just need a few more
                        security guards out there to help
                        keep the wolves at bay.

           Jane and Tom smile politely.

                                 JANE
                        No worries.

                                 TOM
                        Not a problem.

           The grateful administrator hurries back to work.

           Tom and Jane sigh together as they wait.

                                 TOM (cont'd)
                        Excited to get home?

                                 JANE
                        Excited to get out of here.

           Adam and Savannah emerge from a hallway. Adam and Jane lock
           eyes on each other. Savannah and Tom are all smiles.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Oh! I'm so glad we didn't miss you.
                        Jane, it's so good to meet you.

           Without asking, Savannah HUGS Jane. Jane awkwardly hugs her
           back.
                                 JANE
                        You, too. Adam talked about you
                        constantly.

           Savannah shakes Tom's hand.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Savannah.

                                 TOM
                        Tom.
                               (
                                turning to Adam
                                               )
                        Good to meet you.

           Tom and Adam shake.

                                 TOM (cont'd)
                        Thanks for looking after my girl.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, believe me, it was the other way
                        around.

           With introductions out of the way, the two couples have no
           idea what to talk about.

           Outside, photographers snap endless PHOTOS of them through
           the glass.

           Jane steps up to end the awkward silence.

                                 JANE
                        So. Any good movies come out lately?

           Tom and Savannah can't tell if it's a serious question.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Um, there was one really good one
                        with Matt Damon...

                                 ADAM & JANE
                        Screw Matt Damon.

           Jane and Adam both smirk. Savannah and Tom are lost.

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry. Inside joke.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Oh gosh. I'll bet you two have a lot
                        of those.

           Awkward silence.
           Adam turns to Jane.

                                 ADAM
                        I, uh, asked to keep the girls.

                                 JANE
                        Oh.

                                 TOM
                        ...The girls?

                                 JANE
                        That's what we call the hens.

                                 TOM
                        Oh! You're keeping all six?

                                 ADAM
                        Uh, yeah, they said we could.

           The "we" is Adam and Savannah. Savannah gives Adam a
           supportive side hug - she doesn't seem like a person to have
           pet chickens, but she's doing this nice thing for her man.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        But if you want to take a few, you
                        can.

                                 JANE
                        Oh... um...

                                 TOM
                        You should, sweetie. We've got space.

                                 JANE
                        I don't know. They make such a
                        mess...

                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...How much of a mess?

                                 JANE
                               (
                                reassuring
                                          )
                        No, they're great. And I'm so glad
                        you're taking them.
                                beat
                               (
                                    )
                        I asked to take home Benson, and they
                        said no.

           Adam grins. Savannah and Tom don't know what to make of that
           comment.
                                 ADAM
                        You're sure?
                                    )
                               (
                                beat
                        I mean, I know I never expected to
                        care about a chicken, but over enough
                        time, damned if biology didn't make
                        me... emotionally attach.

           He looks into Jane's eyes as he says it.

           But Jane quickly looks away.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, biology's a bitch.

           Savannah and Tom laugh.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        Anyway, I'm just happy they'll be
                        with someone who loves them.

           Tom tilts his head - how sweet.

           But Savannah furrows her brow. She can sense a weird energy
           between Adam and Jane.

           The administrator hurries back over.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Ok, we're just about ready. We just
                        need you two to sign a few discharge
                        papers.

           Savannah steps up.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Tom and I can handle that. You two
                        take a minute to say goodbye.

           Savannah and Tom walk across the lobby to the
           administrator's DESK, leaving Adam and Jane alone.

           They don't know what to say.

                                 ADAM
                        I had my first Pop-Tart this morning.

                                 JANE
                        ...How was it?

                                 ADAM
                        Honestly, your home-made version kind
                        of ruined them for me.
           Jane smirks.

                                 JANE
                        I'll send you the recipe. You'll just
                        need a steady supply of fresh,
                        unpasteurized goat's milk.

                                 ADAM
                        ...So I'll hear from you?

           Jane hesitates.

                                 JANE
                        I mean, I'm sure we'll see each
                        other. We've got interviews--

                                 ADAM
                        But after all that. Are you still
                        going to be in my life?

           Jane tenses up. She glances over to Tom and Savannah, who
           are both watching her and Adam - not in a suspicious way.
           Just curious.

                                 JANE
                        No.

           Adam furrows his brow.

                                 ADAM
                        I don't mean-- A phone call every few
                        weeks. Old friends catching up...

           It takes all of Jane's strength to get this out...

                                 JANE
                        We were two people trapped in a box.
                        It messed with our heads. But now
                        we're out of the box.
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Up there... that wasn't real. This is
                        real.

           Adam is hurt, but he refuses to show it.

           Savannah and Tom walk back over, and Jane and Adam plaster
           on smiles.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Ready?

                                 ADAM
                        Yep.
           Adam turns to Jane.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        So... Bye.

                                 JANE
                        Bye.

           Adam HUGS Jane. It's awkward.

           Adam puts a hand on Savannah's back and leads her toward the
           door.

           Jane takes Tom's hand and follows a few steps behind.

           With every emotion buried deep down inside, the two couples
           make their way out into the frenzy...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. TV STUDIO

           Adam and Savannah, both looking handsome, give an exclusive
           TV interview to some TOP ANCHOR.

           INT. MID-WESTERN HOUSE - DAY

           With Tom sitting at the counter behind her, playing on his
           phone, Jane searches the inside of the fridge for something
           to eat.

           It's filled with every kind of delicious food imaginable -
           meats, cheeses, fresh fruits...

           But after a hard look, Jane picks the CARTON OF EGGS.

           INT. ELEGANT HOUSE - NIGHT

           Adam and Savannah attend a loud, crowded party in a large
           gray house.

           Savannah chats effortlessly with everyone in their circle,
           but Adam has to force his smile.

           An OLD WHITE DUDE turns the conversation to Adam.

                                 OLD WHITE DUDE
                        And how are you getting on now that
                        you're home?
                                 ADAM
                        Very well, thank you.

                                 OLD WHITE DUDE
                        I'd imagine the boredom must have
                        been the worst bit...

                                 ADAM
                        Uh, actually we were never really
                        that bored. There were always things
                        to do.

                                 OLD WHITE DUDE
                        For instance?

                                 ADAM
                        Well, uh... we bet on chicken races,
                        attempted to write the next great pop
                        song, gave each other tattoos... Oh,
                        and I did spend quite a bit of time
                        trying to cross-breed a marijuana
                        raspberry plant. Still working on
                        that, actually.

           The old white dude and all the other STUFFY PEOPLE stare
           blankly at Adam.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Oh crap, marijuana's still legal,
                        right?

           Savannah puts on a manufactured LAUGH, and it works.
           Everyone laughs along. Except Adam.

           EXT. MID-WESTERN SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Tom and Jane stroll down a drab, gray street together.

                                 TOM
                        So your parents arrive tomorrow, and
                        then my parents will be here on
                        Sunday, but they're gonna stay in a
                        hotel. And then next week Sarah and
                        Doug want to visit - well, really the
                        whole Duke gang want to come up, but
                        I figured that might be a bit
                        overwhelming.

           Jane is indeed looking overwhelmed.

                                 JANE
                        Good call.
           INT. BEAUTIFUL (BUT GRAY) COLORADO HOUSE - NIGHT

           Adam watches The Princess Bride in BED.

           He glances over at Savannah, who sleeps soundly next to him.
           No snore, no drool.

           INT. HALLOWEEN STORE - DAY

           Jane wanders down an aisle in one of those year-round
           Halloween stores.

           She finds what she was looking for - the life-size plastic
           SKELETONS.

           She finds the most realistic one, pulls it into her arms as
           though it were a damsel in distress, and carries it toward
           the register...

           INT. COLORADO HOUSE - DAY

           Adam sits in front of a large CHICKEN COOP that's been set
           up inside an otherwise tasteful guest bedroom.

           He plays with the hens, whom he's let out of the coop.

                                 SAVANNAH (O.S.)
                        Agh!

           Savannah stomps into the room carrying a HIGH-HEELED SHOE.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        One of them pooped in my shoe.

                                 ADAM
                        ...Are you sure it was them?

           Savannah isn't having it.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        Poop is a sign of love?

           Savannah sighs.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Maybe we should talk about moving the
                        coop outside... Or at least keeping
                        the chickens in the coop...?

           Adam's shoulders sink.
           INT. MID-WESTERN HOUSE - DAY

           Jane sits on the floor of her and Tom's apartment hunched
           over her LAPTOP.

           She has GUIDEBOOKS and MAPS laid out on the floor around
           her.

           Tom tiptoes into the room...

                                 TOM
                        Hey, crazy... Planning a jail break?

           Jane looks up with the first real smile we've seen on her in
           quite a while.

                                 JANE
                        Let's take a trip.

                                 TOM
                        A trip?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah! Let's go somewhere we've never
                        been, somewhere just you and me.

                                 TOM
                        ...Like Paris?

           Jane hesitates.

                                 JANE
                        I was thinking somewhere a little
                        more remote? ...Maybe Iceland?

                                 TOM
                        Iceland??

                                 JANE
                        To see the Northern Lights! It would
                        be so romantic, and, ya know, it'd
                        give us a chance to really reconnect.

           Tom sits down on the floor with Jane.

                                 TOM
                        Sweetie. This is our home. This is
                        our life. This is where we need to
                        connect.

           Jane has no response.
                                 TOM (cont'd)
                        Look. I know you can't stand being in
                        one place for too long - I honestly
                        don't know how you kept your sanity
                        on that rocket.

           Jane looks down at the floor.

                                 TOM (cont'd)
                        But I think it's finally time for us
                        to lay down some roots, you know?
                        Just be in one place, together, for
                        the long haul. No more deployments.
                        No more... putting our life on pause.

           That last comment digs into Jane.

                                 JANE
                        ...I'm sorry I put your life on
                        pause.

                                 TOM
                        No! That's not-- I have a great life,
                        I do. And you've had these crazy
                        adventures. But now it's time for us.

           His smile fades as he feels the need to ask...

                                 TOM (cont'd)
                        Right?

           Jane stares into Tom's eyes.

                                 JANE
                        Tom. I need to tell you something...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. LIMO - DAY

           Dressed in business attire, Adam and Savannah ride in the
           back of a limousine. Savannah is typing away on her phone.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        So we just have fifteen minutes for
                        this photo-op and then we'll head
                        straight to the event.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok.
           Adam looks out the window. Savannah notices that he's not
           fully there. She sets down her phone.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Hey. Everything alright?

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah.

           Savannah waits, and Adam relents.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        ...We've just been so booked since I
                        got back.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...I know.

                                 ADAM
                        Can we - I don't know - pull back a
                        bit? I feel like we haven't had any
                        time to talk.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...We have time right now.

           Adam sighs. He turns back to the window.

                                 SAVANNAH (cont'd)
                        Baby, I'm the governor.

                                 ADAM
                        I know.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        I have a lot of responsibilities, I
                        can't just--

                                 ADAM
                        Half your schedule is photo-ops.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        That's the job!

           Adam shakes his head.

                                 SAVANNAH (cont'd)
                        What. What is it you want to tell me
                        that there's no time for?

           Adam snaps.
                                 ADAM
                        How about the time that Benson tried
                        to kill me, but Jane saved me by
                        axing her in the back!

           Savannah's SHOCK is quickly interrupted by the LIMO DRIVER
           RAISING THE PARTITION.

           Adam and Savannah both watch the partition slowly go up -
           whoops.

           They take a moment to reset.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...Is that what you want to talk
                        about?

                                 ADAM
                        ...No.

           Savannah nods. She's a smart woman...

                                 SAVANNAH
                        See. I think I know what you want to
                        talk about... but I really don't want
                        to talk about it.
                                beat
                               (
                                    )
                        So if you could just tell me that the
                        thing you want to talk about is over,
                        maybe that would be enough.

           A silent moment.

                                 ADAM
                        It is.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Good.
                                beat
                                    )
                               (
                        Are we good?

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah.

           Savannah takes Adam's hand. They look into each other's
           eyes.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        I'll see what I can cancel over the
                        next few weeks.

                                 ADAM
                        Thank you.
                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...There is one thing, though, that
                        we really can't avoid.

                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Like everything else on Earth, the facade of the White House
           looks a bit drab and gray as Adam and Savannah arrive in
           formal attire.

           Adam takes the building in with a wary look as he and
           Savannah are ushered inside.

           INT. STATE DINING ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           We enter the state dining room with Adam and Savannah and
           are met with VIBRANT COLORS for the first time since space.

           The room has the magical glow of CANDLELIGHT and the entire
           ceiling is decorated with GLITTERY GOLD STARS, very much
           like the ones we saw in space.

           And directly in the center of the room, talking to some
           group of DIGNITARIES, stands Jane.

           Her dress is an emerald green that's perfectly complimented
           by the stars.

           Adam's eyes are immediately drawn to her - she's the jewel
           in the center of the crown.

           Of course, Savannah sees Jane, too.

           She links her arm in Adam's and offers him a reassuring
           smile as they walk into the room, meeting Jane in the
           middle.

           Jane excuses herself from her conversation and turns to Adam
           and Savannah with immense composure - especially for someone
           who is pushing down every feeling she has.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Jane, you look lovely.

                                 JANE
                        Thank you, so do you.
                                 ADAM
                        ...Long time.

                                 JANE
                        ...It's been four days.

                                 ADAM
                               (
                                                   )
                                genuinely surprised
                        Seriously? Man, time is effed down
                        here, too.

           Savannah steams ahead, eager to get past the pleasantries so
           they can talk to someone - anyone - else.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Where's your charming husband?

                                 JANE
                        Oh, um. Well, the story for tonight
                        is that he has the flu, but um, we're
                        actually splitting up.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        You're what?

           Jane is careful to keep her eyes focused on Savannah as she
           explains...

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, I know, it probably seems...
                        And Tom really is the most wonderful
                        man. I think, maybe, when we got
                        married, I thought that was enough -
                        you know, the fact that we made sense
                        for each other, or something? But it
                        never quite worked. As much as I
                        wanted it to. It just wasn't... meant
                        to be.

           Adam has no idea what to say. He looks both relieved and
           devastated.

           Savannah, on the other hand, is a bit annoyed with Jane's
           rather inappropriate level of honesty in this social
           situation.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Wow. Poor Tom.

                                 JANE
                        Oh, he's better off, I promise.
                                 SAVANNAH
                        I'm sure.

           Jane raises an eyebrow, but let's it slide.

                                 SAVANNAH (cont'd)
                        So! Don't let us keep you from
                        mingling.

           Jane gets the message.

                                 JANE
                        Oh. Yep. Ok.

           Savannah leads Adam away. He resists the urge to look back
           at Jane.

           INT. STATE DINING ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATER

           Everyone eats DINNER at round TABLES.

           Jane and Adam sit at separate but adjacent tables.

           They're BACK TO BACK - each very aware of the other's
           presence behind them, but trying their best to entertain
           their tables of distinguished GUESTS.

           An elegant woman in her sixties comes up between Adam and
           Jane. They both turn to her.

                                 JANE
                        Madame President.

           The PRESIDENT has a coy smile.

                                 PRESIDENT
                        Captain, Lieutenant... I hear that
                        you are both excellent dancers.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, uh...

                                 PRESIDENT
                        Please. Won't you honor us with a
                        dance?

           The guests at their two tables all coo their excited
           agreement.

           Jane and Adam both demure.
                                 JANE
                        Oh, no...

                                 ADAM
                        I don't think--

                                 PRESIDENT
                        I insist.

           Adam looks to Savannah. Every muscle in her neck is tensed,
           but with a flick of her head, she gestures for him to go
           dance - the President is asking you to dance, you dance!

           Adam looks to Jane, who looks squarely into his eyes. He
           extends a hand, and she takes it.

           They stand to gentle APPLAUSE from the whole room and make
           their way onto the dance floor.

           The six-piece ORCHESTRA plays a dreamy WALTZ.

           Adam and Jane arrive in the center of the room under those
           golden, glittery stars.

           They hold there for a moment, looking into each other's eyes
           with a mix of longing, sadness, and distance.

           Without a word, they sink into a perfect Viennese waltz.

           It's as if their feet don't touch the ground.

           They completely forget about the rest of the world. It's
           just the two of them again, twirling through the stars.

           Savannah watches them carefully, not angry or jealous, but
           stunned.

           Indeed, everyone looks a bit stunned. This is not what
           anyone expected from a pair of astronauts...

           Adam and Jane keep their eyes locked on one another
           throughout the dance.

           They don't want it to end, but it does.

           The song finishes, and a few seconds later, their magical
           world is shattered by APPLAUSE.

           Their eyes finally break apart as they awkwardly acknowledge
           their audience and return to their seats.

           So close to each other, and yet apart once again.
                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. STATE DINING ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATER

           The evening is coming to an end. Everyone is saying their
           goodbyes and making their way to the exit.

           Adam and Savannah offer their thanks to the President -
           Savannah in particular is rather effusive.

           As they small talk, Adam glances over at Jane, who sits
           alone at her table in no rush to leave.

           She's STARING back at him.

           The President offers her hand to Adam, pulling him back into
           the conversation. They shake, and the goodbyes are done.

           Savannah takes Adam's hand and directs him toward the door.

           He steals one more look back at Jane as they make their way
           out of the room.

           Jane watches them go with a look of solemn resignation.

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Savannah and Adam walk out of the White House toward their
           waiting LIMO, but Adam stops a few steps short.

           Savannah turns to him with a questioning look.

           But when she sees his face, she knows exactly what's about
           to happen.

           Even so, they stand in silence for a moment.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Just say it.

                                 ADAM
                        ...You're Victor Laslo.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...What?

                                 ADAM
                        You're the one I loved first. You're
                        the right choice.

           Savannah gets it now.
                                 SAVANNAH
                        Casablanca? ...So that makes you
                        Ilsa?

           Adam nods.

                                 SAVANNAH (cont'd)
                        ...But you're not getting on the
                        plane with me.

           Slowly, Adam shakes his head.

           Savannah takes a deep breath.

                                 SAVANNAH (cont'd)
                        Is it because "Rick" is a selfish
                        dick and asked you not to?

                                 ADAM
                        No! No. She wouldn't do that.
                               (
                                    )
                                beat
                        This is all on me.

           A quiet moment.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        ...It's not a perfect metaphor, is
                        it. Ilsa didn't really choose - she
                        just did what Rick said.

           Adam considers.

                                 ADAM
                        I am an empowered, feminist Ilsa.

           Through her heartbreak, Savannah smirks.

                                 ADAM (cont'd)
                        ...I do love you.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        I know.

           Savannah steps over to Adam and gives him a tender KISS on
           the lips, which he returns.

           She turns and gets into the limo. Adam watches her go.

           INT. STATE DINING ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Just a few stragglers remain inside the State Room. Jane is
           still alone at her table.
           With a sigh, she drinks the last swig of her WATER and
           stands.

           She saunters across the center of the room toward the exit.

           That's when Adam appears in the doorway. Their eyes lock.

           Adam steps over to Jane. He meets her in the middle of the
           dance floor under those glittering stars...

                                 JANE
                        Hi.

                                 ADAM
                        Hi.

                                 JANE
                        ...Where's Savannah?

                                 ADAM
                        I'm not getting on the plane.

           A heavy pause.

                                 JANE
                        ...What?

                                 ADAM
                        Casablanca.

                                 JANE
                        Oh!
                                beat
                                    )
                               (
                        Never seen it.

                                 ADAM
                        You've never seen Casablanca??

                                 JANE
                        No, is it good?

           Adam knows Jane is teasing him, but it still makes his brain
           hurt.

                                 ADAM
                        It's only, like, the best movie of
                        all time.

                                 JANE
                        ...Then why did we watch The Princess
                        Bride so much?
                                 ADAM
                        There are guilty pleasure movies and
                        then there are actual cinematic
                        classics--

                                 JANE
                        Hang on. Let's get back to the plane
                        you're not getting on? What's that
                        mean?

           Adam KISSES Jane.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        ...Oh.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah.

           They both smile from ear to ear.

                                 JANE
                        So, um, ok then.

           A quiet, happy moment.

                                 ADAM
                        You wanna go... get a drink?

           Jane's hands fall to her stomach...

                                 JANE
                        Um, we probably shouldn't--

                                 ADAM
                        Oh my god, are you pregnant??

                                 JANE
                        What? No!

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, sorry! You touched your stomach--

                                 JANE
                        So??

                                 ADAM
                        I don't know! We also had all that
                        unprotected sex...

                                 JANE
                        Is that why you're picking me?
                                 ADAM
                        No!

                                 JANE
                        Dude. If this is just your biological
                        urge to procreate--

                                 ADAM
                        No, god! I choose you. Not because I
                        chemically attached - which I did -
                        or because I want to have your
                        babies - which I do - but because...
                        we're meant to be.

           Jane grins.

                                 JANE
                        ...Lame. We're all robots.

           They share a smile. Adam leans in to kiss her, but Jane
           stops him.

                                 JANE (cont'd)
                        What I was going to say... was that
                        we should probably keep this on the
                        down low for a while.

           Adam steps a bit closer to Jane anyway.

                                 ADAM
                        Right. That makes sense.

           Their faces are inches apart.

                                 JANE
                        We don't want to... cause a stir.

                                 ADAM
                        Absolutely. No stirring...

           They KISS.

           SNAP.

           Jane and Adam turn to see a White House PHOTOGRAPHER taking
           a picture of their kiss.

           Jane and Adam both scowl - well, shit.

           But then Jane has a thought...

                                 JANE
                        ...You wanna take a trip?
                                                            CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. A BEAUTIFUL BED - NIGHT

           In vibrant, magical color, Jane and Adam lie tangled
           together in a luxurious KING-SIZE BED with just the light of
           the moon illuminating their faces.

                                 ADAM
                        What should we do tomorrow?

                                 JANE
                        ...Ok, I know this might sound crazy,
                        but what do you think of renting
                        Aliens?

                                 ADAM
                        You want to watch Alien again??

                                 JANE
                        No, Aliensss - the second one.

           As they argue, we slowly pull back to reveal that this
           beautiful bed is in a clear, glamorous YURT in the middle of
           the woods.

                                 ADAM
                        No. No, no, no. Never.

                                 JANE
                        Oh, come on! It's like our movie.

                                 ADAM
                        What about Casablanca?

                                 JANE
                        ...We can watch that, too! Make it a
                        double feature.

           We drift away from Jane and Adam and up to the night sky
           where we see the surreal, magical NORTHERN LIGHTS.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Then how 'bout Casablanca and The
                        Princess Bride?

                                 JANE (O.S.)
                        How about all three?

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        You know we're in Iceland, right?
                                 JANE (O.S.)
                        You're the one who keeps adding more
                        movies...

           We hear Adam sigh...

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        ...Ok. We can watch it. But only in
                        broad daylight, and we have to be
                        allowed to talk through it. And you
                        gotta squish your boobs on me after.

                                 JANE (O.S.)
                        Deal.

           The sound of a KISS.

           The End.
