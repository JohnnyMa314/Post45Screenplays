           “The shadow is a living part of the personality and therefore 
           wants to live with it in some form. It cannot be argued out 
           of existence or rationalized into harmlessness. This problem 
           is exceedingly difficult, because it not only challenges the 
           whole man, but reminds him at the same time of his 
           helplessness and ineffectuality.” 

           - Carl Jung
           EXT. ROCK FACE - EVENING

           The entire frame is flooded with granite. The final rays of 
           sun slowly peel off the menacing rock as the cold night 
           rushes in. 

           The light sounds of wildlife and insects are overtaken by a 
           screaming wind that attacks the sleeping wall.

           The wind grows deafening as the FALLING BODY of a man enters 
           the frame. 

           We move down the wall with him, a silhouette in the night. 
           His long, mangled hair dances in the wind, and his limbs are 
           powerless to the gravitational force accelerating his body 
           towards the forest floor at 9.8 m/s.

           As he free falls to his death, all we can hear is the wind 
           and air rushing past him.

           Just as we are bracing for him to collide with the earth at 
           terminal velocity, sending bones and blood right out of 
           him...

           ...Rage Against the Machine’s BULLS ON PARADE blasts and 
           we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           SLOANE (24) speeds down a one lane highway that snakes 
           through a forest. She drives an old, beat up FORD F-250 
           PICKUP with the windows down while the music blasts, each 
           chord shaking her rearview mirror.

           She fearlessly speeds into the bends, calmly holding onto the 
           steering wheel with one hand while her truck hugs the edge of 
           the road, inches away from a steep drop off.

           Despite her relaxed demeanor, her eyes absorb everything at 
           lightning speed and her muscular frame indicates discipline 
           and intensity.

           Up ahead is a green sign with white lettering that reads: 
           FAIRVIEW PSYCHIATRIC CENTER. Sloane turns towards the 
           entrance and drives in.
           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane parks and turns off the car. The music stops. She 
           moves to open the door when she remembers something. She 
           opens the glove compartment and grabs a bag of Peanut M&Ms.

           INT. FAIRVIEW PSYCHIATRIC CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane waves at the security officer, TONY (50), who sits 
           behind protective glass. 

           Tony presses a button, which is followed by a loud BUZZ. The 
           sound harshly collides with the steel, concrete, and tile of 
           the interior. Sloane opens the heavy door.

                                 TONY
                        Miss Sloane!

                                 SLOANE
                        Hi Tony. How’s he doing?

                                 TONY
                        Still thinks I’m a Russian spy...

                                 SLOANE
                        Well are you?

           Sloane smiles.

           The steel door closes behind Sloane, there’s another loud 
           BUZZ, then the next set of doors unlock. Sloane enters.

                                 TONY
                        Have a good visit Miss Sloane.

                                 SLOANE
                        Thanks.

           Sloane walks down the sterile hallway, the florescent lights 
           beat down on her.

           INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane enters an empty cafeteria. Titanium and steel tables 
           are bolted into the floor, their muted colors compose a 
           lifeless portrait.

           In the corner of the room is Sloane’s father, RICHARD (60). 
           He is dressed in white sweatpants and a stained white t-
           shirt. He stares out the window and gently sways back and 
           forth in his seat.
           As Sloane gets closer, it becomes clear his hygiene has not 
           been attended to for a long time - his hair messy, his beard 
           long, his teeth yellow, and his face shiny from layers of 
           sweat that have accumulated over the course of a few days.

                                 SLOANE
                        Hey Dad.

           Richard exits his trance and turns towards Sloane. His 
           sedated blank stare persists for a moment until it’s broken 
           by a smile.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hi Sloaney.

           Sloane kisses him on the head and throws the bag of Peanut 
           M&Ms in front of him.

                                 SLOANE
                        Got your favorite.

           Sloane sits down across from Richard. He tears the bag open 
           and starts eating. Whenever he pulls out a red M&M, he puts 
           it down on the table.

                                 RICHARD
                             (Through bites,)
                        These are quite the delicacy now.

           As Richard chews, his focus drifts back towards the window.

                                 SLOANE
                        Remember how we used to eat those 
                        at the end of our climbs?

           Richard turns back to Sloane.

                                 RICHARD
                        Every Sunday. Man, you were only 
                        this big...

           Richard lifts his palm 4 feet off the ground.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...but you were fearless.

           Sloane smiles.

                                 SLOANE
                        Still am.

           There are about 8 red M&Ms on the table in front of Richard.
                                 SLOANE
                        You don’t like the red ones?

           Sloane reaches for one. Richard blocks her hand gently.

                                 RICHARD
                        They got synthetic dye on ‘em 
                        called Amaranth. Reason the red 
                        ones disappeared in 1976. That 
                        dye...
                             (Trailing,)
                        Dye, die, dye, die, dye...

                                 SLOANE
                        Good to know.

           Richard looks at Sloane, back in her reality for a moment.

                                 RICHARD
                        You’re a doctor. You should know 
                        that.

                                 SLOANE
                        Not yet. Still training.

                                 RICHARD
                        So how long ‘til you become a big, 
                        bad surgeon?

                                 SLOANE
                        Four long years.

                                 RICHARD
                        They ever let you sit in on a 
                        surgery?

                                 SLOANE
                        All the time.

                                 RICHARD
                        I bet. I bet. So tell me something: 
                        you ever seen an operation where 
                        they open a person up and 
                        there’s...there’s someone else 
                        inside of ‘em, hiding there?

                                 SLOANE
                        If they’re pregnant?

                                 RICHARD
                        No, no. Sloaney, you’re not 
                        following me. I’m saying another 
                        living thing...
                                 SLOANE
                        I guess the closest thing to that 
                        would be a tape worm maybe, or a 
                        parasite, or certain forms of 
                        bacteria.

           Richard smiles.

                                 RICHARD
                        Kinda like in Alien?

                                 SLOANE
                        No, not like that. But Dad, I’m 
                        training to be a neurosurgeon--

                                 RICHARD
                        --You know they don’t let us watch 
                        movies in here? They think we’ll 
                        put ourselves in the story, like 
                        we’re the protagonist. They’re 
                        worried that’ll get us too excited, 
                        kinda like coffee. They don’t like 
                        that either.

                                 SLOANE
                        You don’t need coffee. You need 
                        sleep. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Can’t sleep in my room.

                                 SLOANE
                        Why not? 

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t like it.

                                 SLOANE
                        Why don’t you like it?

                                 RICHARD
                        Gets so dark...

           Beat, as Sloane contemplates how to respond.

                                 SLOANE
                        I’ll figure out how to move you to 
                        a different room, ok? And I’ll go 
                        pick up a night light for you in 
                        the meantime. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Yeah, ok Sloaney.
           Beat, Sloane holds Richard’s hand. Richard turns to the 
           window.

                                 RICHARD
                        The worst part of the room is its 
                        view of Lytta’s Peak...

           Sloane knows she’s losing him. He closes his eyes and puts 
           his head down on the table. 

           OVER BLACK

                                 SLOANE (O.S.)
                        That mountain is all the way out 
                        there, right? So you’re safe in 
                        here with me. Dad, open your 
                        eyes... 

           FADE IN

           We look at Sloane through Richard’s POV as he opens his eyes.

           The noises of the empty room become deafening. The vent in 
           the corner, the buzzing fluorescent lights above, the wind 
           against the windows, and Sloane’s voice create a cacophony of 
           sound, where we can only decipher bits and pieces of what 
           Sloane says.

                                 SLOANE
                        Nothing...going...to happen...I’m 
                        here...

           The red M&Ms on the table shine brightly...

                                 SLOANE
                        Die, dye, die...

           ...along with the lights overhead, giving the entire room a 
           fuzzy quality.

           Then we hear a BANG. BANG. BANG. from the window, as if 
           someone is slamming it over and over again with their fist.

           We turn towards the window, and for the first time, we get a 
           clear look at Lytta’s Peak in the distance. As we stare at 
           the majestic peak, the noises of the room become even louder.

           The peak now seems to be slowly moving towards us, the noises 
           of the room reach their loudest point, and we hear it again 
           right outside the window: BANG. BANG. BANG...

                                                                CUT TO:
           OVER BLACK

           SUPER: FOUR YEARS LATER

           We hear the sound of a motorcycle. Its thunderous engine 
           revs, and we can nearly smell the burning rubber wake it 
           leaves behind in the asphalt.

           We hear a car honk followed by the nauseating sound of 
           crunched metal and shattered glass.

           We hear a body slam onto the asphalt.

           FADE IN

           INT. BREAK ROOM - UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Sloane, now 28, wears blue scrubs and stands at a locker. The 
           wear and tear of her medical training has taken a toll. 
           Seemingly permanent bags have formed under her eyes and 
           stress has besieged her once calm demeanor.

           KEVIN (30), a fellow medical resident, shuts his locker and 
           walks towards the door.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’ll see you tomorrow.

                                 SLOANE
                        See you.

                                 KEVIN
                        God these 24 hour shifts are 
                        killing me.

           Kevin exits, shoulders slouched, defeated. 

           Sloane throws a few things in her backpack and turns to exit 
           when her chief, DR. HART (37), enters.

                                 DR. HART
                        Not so fast there, intern.

           Sloane looks at him through tired eyes. So close to escaping.

                                 DR. HART
                        We’re going to need you for another 

           Sloane sighs, shakes her head, moments away from speaking up.

                                 DR. HART
                        What? You tired?
           Sloane swallows her pride.

                                 SLOANE
                        No. I‘m good.

                                 DR. HART
                        That’s what I like to hear. 

           Dr. Hart walks towards the exit.

                                 DR. HART
                        Any ladder you’ve climbed in your 
                        life is a step stool compared to 
                        this program...

           Dr. Hart exits and yells from the hallway.

                                 DR. HART (O.S.)
                        ...Time to step it up!

           Sloane slams her locker shut in anger. 

           She pulls out her iPhone and texts STEPHEN.

                                 SLOANE
                        Dinner’s cancelled. Need to be here 
                        for another 12 hours. Fuck this.

           She walks over to the coffee machine. She stares down at the 
           stale brown liquid and pours herself a cup.

           She lifts the mug to her mouth, but decides against it. She 
           throws the mug into the sink in frustration. The ceramic mug 
           cracks in half and coffee spills all over the counter.

           Sloane takes two blue pills of Adderall from her pocket and 
           raises them towards her mouth. Just as she is about to throw 
           them in her mouth, she puts them down on the counter.

           She pulls her hospital ID from her waist and places it over 
           the pills. She uses her iPhone to hammer down on the ID and 
           crush the pills.

           She lifts the ID, revealing blue powder. She leans over the 
           powder and snorts it all up. She wipes the residue from her 
           nose and exhales deeply.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           A PATIENT (20) lies motionless on a spinal board wearing 
           remnants of a motorcycle jacket. He has a cervical collar 
           around his neck, and pads on both sides of his head.

           Two EMTs tend to the patient. They put a face mask over his 
           mouth and deliver him oxygen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Sloane stares at herself in the mirror, her fatigue is 
           spreading throughout her face.

           She takes a few deep breaths and then holds her chest in 
           pain. She feels for her pulse. Too fast. 

                                 SLOANE
                        Fuck...

           Sloane looks down at her hands. They SHAKE violently as the 
           amphetamine rushes through her bloodstream.

                                 SLOANE
                        Fuck!

           Sloane tries to steady her hands. It makes it worse. Then, 
           from outside the door...

                                 DR. HART (O.S.)
                        Sloane! Get the fuck out here!

           In a panic, Sloane sticks her hand down her throat and vomits 
           in the sink. Blue liquid splashes onto the stainless steel 
           and slowly crawls towards the drain.

           She runs water over it, then splashes some water on her 
           already moist face. She rushes out of the bathroom.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Two orderlies and a nurse push a stretcher carrying the 
           patient from the ambulance. 

           Everyone in the hallway clears the path for them. A few look 
           down at the patient’s gruesome face and neck wounds.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. NEUROSURGERY OPERATING ROOM - UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - 
           NIGHT

           Sloane washes her hands carefully and efficiently next to Dr. 
           Hart. She wears a surgical mask and a black bandana. 

           Dr. Hart walks over to a speaker pill in the corner and turns 
           on loud rock music. He pops snuff tobacco into his mouth and 
           then raises his surgical mask over his face.

           Sloane sniffs a few times and uses her forearm to itch her 
           burning nose.

           Sloane struggles to put latex gloves on her shaking hands. 
           Dr. Hart notices.

                                 DR. HART
                        Hey intern, what’s going on with 
                        your hands?

                                 SLOANE
                        I’m good.

                                 DR. HART
                        There’s still time to become a 
                        radiologist if this is too high 
                        pressure for you.

           A Nurse and an Orderly barrel through the doors of the 
           operating room pushing the patient we have been following.

                                 SLOANE
                        How about we focus on the patient?

                                 DR. HART
                        ‘Focus on the patient’! Guys, we’ve 
                        got a living embodiment of the 
                        Hippocratic Oath on our hands!

           The Nurse and Orderly lift the patient to the operating 
           table. He lands face down with a slight thud. 

                                 SLOANE
                             (To the Nurse and 
                              Orderly,)
                        Careful with the neck!

           An opaque breathing tube is in the Patient’s mouth and 
           stretches down his throat. IV lines and catheters are 
           attached to him. 

           An ANESTHESIOLOGIST (45) enters and quickly administers the 
           general anesthesia.
           Sloane examines the patient and looks down at a chart.

                                 SLOANE
                        High cervical spinal cord injury. 
                        Respiratory failure. Phrenic nerve 
                        damage.

           Sloane anxiously watches the chart shake in her hands. She 
           calls to the Nurse.

                                 SLOANE
                        Scalpel!

                                 DR. HART
                        Maybe start with an Ativan...

           The Nurse hands Sloane a scalpel. Dr. Hart smiles in 
           amusement.

           Sloane grabs the scalpel and takes a deep breath. Her hands 
           stop shaking momentarily. 

           She cuts a four inch incision vertically along the Patient’s 
           upper spine.

           Sloane uses a periosteal elevator to lift the muscle from the 
           bone, exposing the spine.

           The Nurse hands Sloane a rongeur.

           Sloane uses the surgical tool to remove the damaged tissue, 
           nerves, and fragmented bone piece by piece. Sloane operates 
           with precision.

                                 DR. HART
                        There we go Sloane. Good work.

           Beads of sweat begin to hatch on Sloane’s forehead and run 
           down her face. We can see the carotid artery in her neck 
           explode with every pounding heartbeat. 

           The music feels like it’s getting even louder.

           As Sloane removes a piece of bone, we notice a small drop of 
           blood on her white surgical mask.

           Within seconds, the small drop spreads across the white 
           material of her mask...BLOOD is dripping from her nose.

           The Nurse looks at Dr. Hart to relieve Sloane, but he 
           continues to watch and smile.

                                 DR. HART
                        Keep going! Do not stop!
           The Anesthesiologist shoots the nurse a concerned look.

                                 ANESTHESIOLOGIST
                        Dr. Hart--

                                 DR. HART
                        --Shut the fuck up! This is my OR!

           Sloane’s shaking rongeur just misses an artery as she removes 
           another piece of fragmented bone.

           Sloane readjusts her grip and goes back in. 

           The blood from her surgical mask is about to drip into the 
           patient’s open wound.

           Sloane blinks a few times trying to steady her focus. Her 
           breaths are short, panicked. She looks up at the patient’s 
           face, and for a split second, his youthful face transforms 
           into Richard’s. 

           Sloane gasps and her right hand violently shakes again.

           Sloane reaches for another piece of bone when her shaking 
           hand misses the mark...the surgical tool slices through a 
           spinal artery.

           Nothing happens for a moment, and then, the floodgates 
           open...

           Blood pours through the spinal column like running water, 
           splashing everywhere and depriving the spinal cord of blood 
           and oxygen.

           The sounds of the OR drown out completely.

                                 SLOANE (V.O.)
                        I saw him again. The visions keep 
                        happening.

           Dr. Hart shoves Sloane to the side and tries to stop the 
           bleeding. Blood spills onto the floor of the OR.

                                 THERAPIST (V.O.)
                        Do they scare you?

           The patient lies beneath Sloane, motionless, moments away 
           from PARALYSIS.
           INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - BATHROOM - DAY

           Sloane rips open a stall door and vomits again. She catches 
           her breath, spits in the toilet a few more times, and 
           flushes.

                                 SLOANE (V.O.)
                        They’re threatening my fucking 
                        career! I can’t live like this 
                        anymore. I can’t sleep. I can’t 
                        eat. I can’t think straight. Is 
                        this...is this how it starts? 

                                 THERAPIST (V.O.)
                        I believe something else is 
                        happening...

           Sloane walks to the sink. She stares at her distorted 
           reflection in the metal paper towel dispenser.

                                 THERAPIST (V.O.)
                        ...Are you familiar with the 
                        concept of the shadow?

           She punches the dispenser. Hard.

           It feels good.

           She pulls back her hand, her hand that is so vital to 
           performing surgery, and punches it again. And again. And 
           again. And again...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           The THERAPIST (60) is across from Sloane. She sits 
           comfortably and wears round tortoise eyeglasses.

                                 THERAPIST
                        We all carry a shadow. A darker 
                        side of ourselves. But we reject it 
                        by repressing it. It may disappear 
                        into our subconscious, but it’ll 
                        always find its way back to the 
                        surface. The further down we push 
                        it, the blacker and denser it 
                        becomes. You’ve tried so hard to 
                        repress these memories of your Dad, 
                        of becoming like him, through your 
                        achievements.

                        But the harder you push it under 
                        the surface, the stronger you make 
                        it. Eventually, there will be a 
                        fight for control. 

                                 SLOANE

                        How do I stay in control? 

                                 THERAPIST (V.O.)
                        You need to face your shadow. 

                                 SLOANE
                        This abstract psychotherapist 
                        bullshit is not helping me. I need 
                        a solution. 

                                 THERAPIST
                        Relax, Sloane. Relax. Let’s think 
                        about it. Let’s think about your 
                        Dad. What is it that scares you the 
                        most?

                                 SLOANE
                        Probably that he went to that 
                        fucking mountain completely fine 
                        one morning at 55, and came back 
                        three days later like...like that? 
                        That one morning, I could wake up 
                        and be like him? 

                                 THERAPIST
                        Whatever happened to your father’s 
                        mind on that climb, whatever he 
                        claims to have seen, scares you.

                                 SLOANE
                        Not understanding what happened 
                        scares me. I’m a doctor. I think 
                        like a doctor. I see a problem, I 
                        look for a solution. But this, this 
                        mountain, my Dad, melts my mind. I 
                        don’t know what to do anymore...

           Sloane contemplatively stares out the window. She holds back 
           tears.

                                 SLOANE
                        ...I need to prove to myself that 
                        I’m different. That I’m not him. 
                        That whatever happened to him will 
                        never happen to me. That I am 
                        stronger...
           The Therapist smiles.

                                 THERAPIST
                        How you go about doing that is up 
                        to you.

                                 SLOANE
                        What am I paying you for then?

                                 THERAPIST
                        I’m here to guide you, but the 
                        answers lie within you.

           Sloane looks at the clock.

                                 SLOANE
                        Guess time’s up.

                                 THERAPIST
                        Call my cell this weekend if you 
                        need to talk.

           Sloane thinks for a moment.

                                 SLOANE
                        Don’t think I’ll have service where 
                        I’m going...

                                 THERAPIST
                        Well just know I’m here if you need 
                        me.

           THE PEAK

           FADE IN

           INT. SLOANE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           ECU: Sloane’s blank stare. Eyes red and lashes wet from 
           recent tears.

           Sloane lies on the couch and rests her head on her boyfriend 
           STEPHEN’s (28) thigh. Stephen’s youthful glow, easy self 
           confidence, and relaxed demeanor hint at a pampered and 
           protected life, harshly contrasting Sloane’s spartan 
           lifestyle. Stephen rubs Sloane’s back as they watch Netflix 
           silently.

                                 SLOANE
                        Do you think they’ll kick me out?
                                 STEPHEN
                        Are you crazy? You’re the best 
                        candidate out there.

           Beat, as they stare at the TV. Sloane examines her bruised 
           fist.

                                 SLOANE
                             (Trailing,)
                        I...my hands...ruined his life...

           Sloane starts to cry again.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey! Don’t say that. You’re doing 
                        something special. Something 
                        important. But that also means the 
                        mistakes will hurt a little more.

                                 SLOANE
                        That piece of shit Dr. Hart told me 
                        to not come in tomorrow. To take 
                        the weekend off.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Fuck that guy and good! You need to 
                        rest and relax. Want to get brunch 
                        or something tomorrow? Or maybe 
                        hike?

                                 SLOANE
                        Actually...I was thinking maybe we 
                        could go climbing?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah, let’s go to the climbing gym 
                        then get brunch?

                                 SLOANE
                        What, no? What’s with you and 
                        brunch? I want to go on a climbing 
                        trip.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Really?

                                 SLOANE
                        What? You don’t want to?

                                 STEPHEN
                        No. I’d love to. Just...you never 
                        want to come on my climbing 
                        trips...
           Stephen looks down sadly.

                                 SLOANE
                        That’s cause I’m working baby.

           Stephen lights up with an idea.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh! Two of my friends from the 
                        climbing gym are going to Yosemite 
                        this weekend. Should we just tag 
                        along? I’ll text them--

                                 SLOANE
                        --Wait...

           Stephen looks up from his iPhone.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What?

                                 SLOANE
                        ...I want to go to Lytta’s peak.

           A pregnant beat, as Stephen processes this and tries to make 
           sense of it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sorry...you...you want to go...to 
                        Lytta’s Peak?

                                 SLOANE
                        Yeah. I want to finally go.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You sure?

           Sloane throws a pillow at Stephen.

                                 SLOANE
                        Yes Stephen!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ok, ok. Let me see if they’d be 
                        down for that instead.

           Stephen stares down at his phone and texts. He glances at 
           Sloane, concerned.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Are you sure--
                                 SLOANE
                             (Yells,)
                        --Yes! 

           Stephen flinches.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ok, ok. Sorry.

                                 SLOANE
                        Which friends?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Mia and Luna. You’ll like them. 
                        Luna has a sleeve and Mia grew up 
                        in Boise. They’re cool.

                                 SLOANE
                             (Sarcastically,)
                        Sold!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Really?

                                 SLOANE
                        No. 

           Stephen sighs.

                                 STEPHEN
                        We either go with them or we don’t 
                        go.

                                 SLOANE
                        Fine. 

           Sloane hesitates, then,

                                 SLOANE
                        Is this the Mia you always talk 
                        about?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I don’t ‘always’ talk about her? 
                        She’s my friend.

                                 SLOANE
                        You guys just seem close.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No closer than you are with Kevin.

           Beat, as they both look down at their iPhones.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Ok...
                             (Takes a deep breath,)
                        This is the last time I’m going to 
                        ask: are you sure you want to go?--

                                 SLOANE
                        --It’s something I need to do.

           Stephen nods, still confused and worried. He gets up and 
           walks towards the kitchen.

           Sloane pulls out her iPhone and opens up her Instagram app.

           She searches “MIA ROBERTS” and then clicks her profile. She 
           looks at her most recent photo: Mia and Stephen posing at 
           brunch with the caption: ‘post-climb eattttts’.

           She zooms in on Mia’s face, shakes her head, and then exits 
           the app.

           INT. SLOANE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           Sloane lies in bed and stares up at the ceiling. She uses her 
           t-shirt to wipe the remaining tears off her face. 

           Stephen jumps onto the bed.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I have good news...

           Stephen takes out his phone.

                                 STEPHEN
                             (Reads text,)
                        ...‘Fuck Yosemite tourists, that 
                        peak sounds dope. We’re in. See you 
                        in the morning. Excited to meet 
                        Sloane.’ 

           Stephen looks at Sloane and smiles.

                                 STEPHEN
                        They’re in! Pack up baby.

           It’s happening. Sloane takes a deep breath.

                                 STEPHEN
                        We finally get a weekend together.

           Sloane smiles slightly.
                                 SLOANE
                        Thanks for setting that up baby.

           He kisses her cheek.

                                 STEPHEN 
                        You remember after college when I 
                        launched that shitty app? The 
                        coffee delivery service? You 
                        remember what you did for me the 
                        day I shut it down?

                                 SLOANE
                        Took you to Big Bear.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I was in such a bad place, but that 
                        weekend made me feel so much 
                        better. 

           Sloane smiles at the memory.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s my turn to do that for you. By 
                        the end of this weekend you’ll feel 
                        renewed...

           Sloane pulls Stephen in and kisses him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - EARLY MORNING

           Stephen drives with Sloane in the passenger seat. Music plays 
           loudly...the new stuff that everyone likes but Sloane.

           MIA (30) and LUNA (24) sit in the back area, which has been 
           converted into a small room. A couch, a bed, a stove top, and 
           a sink. Climbing gear is hung up on the walls.

           Mia’s grungy appearance is well curated and Luna’s wardrobe 
           seems to be a compilation of impulse buys from the latest 
           influencer-endorsed brands.

           Stephen puts his hand on Sloane’s leg.

                                 STEPHEN
                             (Softly,)
                        You good?

           Stephen notices Sloane’s bruised hand.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Your hand ok?

           Sloane, annoyed, looks at Stephen.

                                 SLOANE
                        Can you please just focus on the 
                        road?!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ok, ok, ok. Sorry.

           Stephen looks ahead. 

           Sloane stares out the window away from Stephen.

                                 MIA
                        Thanks for driving Stephen.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Least I could do! Where’d you guys 
                        get this van? It’s dope. 

                                 MIA
                        You know Chris at the climbing gym? 
                        The one who works the front desk?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah...

                                 MIA
                        It’s his cousin’s van.

                                 SLOANE
                             (Confused,)
                        He just gave it to you guys for the 
                        weekend?

                                 MIA
                        I mean we paid him. But that’s what 
                        I love about the climbing 
                        community. It’s tight knit. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        You want us to Venmo you for it?

                                 MIA
                        Nah, just pay for gas.

                                 LUNA
                        We should really be driving an 
                        electric van. 
                                 MIA
                        You didn’t do shit for this trip. 
                        Don’t complain.

                                 LUNA
                        Sorry that I respect the earth.

                                 MIA
                        You drive a jeep. Shut up.

                                 LUNA
                        I’m a vegan. Makes up for it.

                                 MIA
                        You ate a burger last weekend!

                                 LUNA
                        I take Sundays off. Need that B12 
                        shit, you know?

           Mia shakes her head. Luna looks down at her iPhone and takes 
           a hit of her Juul.

                                 LUNA
                        I heard this peak is at an energy 
                        vortex.

           Sloane turns around.

                                 SLOANE
                        A what?

                                 LUNA
                        A geomagnetic vortex. 

           Sloane laughs dismissively.

                                 LUNA
                        What? They exist. Ojai has one too. 
                        When you’re in one, it feels like 
                        you can see multiple versions 
                        of...you. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Luna, be honest...how much acid did 
                        you have for breakfast?

                                 LUNA
                        I’m serious guys. I mean I took 
                        acid in Ojai, but that’s not the 
                        point.
                                 SLOANE
                        No, no. I think we got the point. 
                        Thanks.

           Mia reads from her iPhone.

                                 MIA
                        It says in this thread that twelve 
                        people die per year in this park. 

           Stephen glances over at Sloane to see if she’s upset.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Don’t read that stuff. More people 
                        probably die in Yosemite every 
                        year. It’s going to be a great 
                        climb--

                                 SLOANE
                        --Not proportionally. Millions go 
                        to Yosemite a year.

           Stephen looks at Sloane, wants to argue, but knows she’ll 
           win. 

           Mia continues to read from her phone.

                                 MIA
                        It says that there’s been reports 
                        of climbers returning from the 
                        mountain catatonic--

                                 SLOANE
                        --Where’d you read that?--

           Stephen jumps in. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        --Alright. Alright. Enough of this 
                        bullshit. 

                                 MIA
                        Reddit.

           Stephen glances at Sloane again. She’s supremely annoyed.

                                 LUNA
                        That makes sense.

           Sloane turns around to Luna, angry.

                                 SLOANE
                        How does that ‘make sense’?
                                 LUNA
                        A geomagnetic vortex is a powerful 
                        force. Some people can’t handle it.

                                 SLOANE
                        Maybe you can take a UFO home after 
                        we leave this vortex of yours. 

                                 LUNA
                        Have you read about Area 51 lately?

           Sloane sighs. Stephen tries to diffuse the tension.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Luna, how long have you been 
                        climbing?

                                 LUNA
                        Three years. But I do it five times 
                        a week.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Wow. That’s a lot.

                                 LUNA
                        My job allows for it. Not boarded 
                        up in an office, man.

           Luna takes another hit of her Juul. Hands it to Sloane.

                                 SLOANE
                        No, I’m good.

                                 LUNA
                        Right. You’re a doctor. I get it. I 
                        get it.

           Sloane takes a deep breath and tries to engage.

                                 SLOANE
                        What about you, Mia?

                                 MIA
                        Cashed out a couple years ago and 
                        didn’t know what to do with myself, 
                        so I took it up. Passes the time 
                        while I search for my next thing.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Mia’s start-up sold a couple years 
                        ago. She’s been helping me with my 
                        new app.
                                 MIA
                        Nothing too crazy. But it gave me a 
                        couple years to live modestly and 
                        embrace my freedom. 

           Mia takes a hit of the Juul.

                                 MIA 
                        What about you? Stephen was telling 
                        us you’re an incredible climber.

                                 SLOANE
                        Grew up with my Dad taking me to 
                        the mountains. He was obsessed.

                                 MIA
                        But you stopped?

                                 SLOANE
                        He stopped...so then I kind of 
                        stopped too. 

                                 MIA
                        Why’d he stop?

                                 SLOANE
                        It’s a long story.

           Awkward beat, as Stephen rubs Sloane’s leg gently. Mia 
           notices.

                                 MIA
                        College sweethearts. So cute.

                                 LUNA
                        Monogamous since college? Insane.

                                 MIA
                        It’s cute!

                                 LUNA
                        I’ve never been in a closed 
                        relationship. It’s unnatural.

           Mia playfully punches Stephen.

                                 MIA
                        Almost time to, you know, maybe ask 
                        Sloane...

           Stephen laughs uncomfortably.

           Sloane sees something lying on the side of the highway in the 
           distance. 
           As they get closer, she sees it’s a dead deer, its neck 
           twisted and limp.

           QUICK FLASH: the Patient’s chest and neck covered in bruises.

           Sloane looks away from the deer and takes a deep breath. 

           Stephen looks at the dashboard.

                                 STEPHEN 
                        Oh shit! We need gas.

           EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

           Mia and Luna walk to the bathroom.

           Sloane stands next to the van, pumping gas.

           Stephen has the van’s sliding door open, and hangs from 
           finger holds above.

                                 SLOANE
                        Do you really need to do that right 
                        now? You’re not Alex Honnold. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Train every moment I can!

           Sloane laughs.

                                 SLOANE
                        You look ridiculous. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        You don’t like them. I can tell.

                                 SLOANE
                        They’re fine.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Which means you hate them.

                                 SLOANE
                        Surprised I’ve never met them. You 
                        guys seem close.

                                 STEPHEN
                        With your hours, it’s not 
                        surprising.

           Stephen starts to breathe more heavily as he hangs.
                                 STEPHEN
                             (Through breaths,)
                        How’re you feeling? Good to be out 
                        of town?

           Sloane nods, somberly. 

           Stephen swings his legs down and jumps off the van.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 SLOANE
                        Yeah...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Why Lytta’s peak? Why now?

                                 SLOANE
                        Sunday will be 3 years since he 
                        passed.

           Stephen, mad at himself for not remembering, hugs Sloane.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I didn’t realize. Fuck. I’m so 
                        sorry.

           Sloane hugs him tightly.

                                 SLOANE
                        It’s ok...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well this is a way to honor him, 
                        right? He’d be so proud of who 
                        you’ve become, Sloane.

           Sloane looks into the distance at the mountains.

                                 SLOANE
                        It’s more of a way to deal with 
                        some personal stuff. Just work 
                        through some things I’ve been 
                        dealing with lately.

           Stephen hesitates to ask for more, then decides to...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Like what kind of...things?

           Bad idea.
                                 SLOANE
                             (Snaps,)
                        It’s personal! Ok?

           Stephen throws up his hands in surrender...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Of course. Just...I just...I’m here 
                        for you. If you ever want to talk 
                        more about it. I’m here.

           Stephen kisses Sloane’s head. They walk towards the gas 
           station food mart. 

           We hold on the food mart for a moment...

           EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Sloane walks out of the food mart alone. We hold on her face 
           as she stares ahead towards the van.

           IN FLASHBACK:

           In the van’s place is the FORD F-250 PICKUP, but it looks 
           less beat up than when we first saw it. The bed of the truck 
           is filled with climbing gear.

           Richard leans against the truck and smiles at Sloane. He 
           looks younger, healthier with flowing hair down to his neck 
           and he wears a first edition pair of Oakley’s.

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Sloane, you ready?

           END FLASHBACK.

           Sloane continues to stare at the van and doesn’t respond to 
           Stephen. Stephen reaches out his hand.

                                 STEPHEN
                        C’mon. Let’s go.

           INT. VAN - LATER

           Stephen feels around the floor of the van, holding onto the 
           steering wheel with one hand.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Did you guys see where my satellite 
                        phone went? I swear it was up here 
                        in the cup holder.
                                 MIA
                        You probably forgot to pack it.

           Sloane shakes her head, frustrated.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No. I remember putting it here. 
                        Fuck! We need it. 

                                 MIA
                        We’ll just have to use our cell 
                        phones.

           Luna holds up her iPhone.

                                 LUNA
                        There’s zero service out here.

                                 SLOANE
                        Well that’s not good.

           Stephen sighs, frustrated. Mia gently holds Stephen’s 
           shoulder.

                                 MIA
                        Hey. It’s fine. We don’t need it.

           Mia slides her hand down Stephen’s arm and lets go. Sloane 
           clocks it.

                                 SLOANE
                        I don’t think it’s ‘fine’. We’re 
                        going to be out there alone.

                                 MIA
                        At least we have each other.

           Sloane looks at Stephen, angry.

                                 SLOANE
                        That was the one thing you had to 
                        remember.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I fucked up, ok? Jesus.

                                 SLOANE
                        I just don’t understand how you 
                        forgot it.

           The music continues to blast.

                                 SLOANE
                        Also can you turn this shit down?
           Stephen, upset, slams the power button. The music stops.

                                 STEPHEN
                             (Under his breath,)
                        So fucking critical.

                                 SLOANE
                        What?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Nothing.

           They drive in tense silence. The winding single lane highway 
           looks familiar. Then we see it. The sign for the Fairview 
           Psychiatric Center. 

           They pass the entrance unbeknownst to Stephen, Mia, and Luna. 
           Sloane stares at the sign and turns her neck to stare back at 
           it as they pass.

           INT. VAN - LATE AFTERNOON - LATER

           Stephen points excitedly to the side of the road. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        There it is!

           A small rusted sign reads LYTTA’S PEAK, with an arrow under 
           it, which points towards a dirt road.

           EXT. PARK ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Stephen and Sloane pull gear out of the van and organize it 
           on the ground. Ropes, cams, portaledges, haul bags, food, and 
           helmets. 

           Mia and Luna stretch on the pavement and smoke their Juul.

           Stephen tosses Sloane webbing. Sloane grabs a hunting knife 
           that hangs from one of the haul bags and starts to cut the 
           webbing.

           Sloane stops for a moment and massages her temple, winces in 
           pain. Stephen notices.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You ok?

                                 SLOANE
                        My head is killing me.
                                 STEPHEN
                        You want Advil?

           Sloane holds her head as the pain intensifies.

                                 SLOANE
                        Yeah. Thanks.

           Stephen pulls out a bottle of water and Advil from his haul 
           bag. He hands them to Sloane.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Here baby.

           Stephen gently runs his hand along Sloane’s hair as she takes 
           down the two Advil. The golden hour sets in, casting a soft 
           glow over Sloane’s face. Stephen stares at her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        How did I get so lucky?

           Sloane doesn’t reciprocate.

                                 SLOANE
                        I need to pee. I’ll be back in a 
                        second.

           Stephen, slightly offended, watches her walk towards the 
           forest, still holding her head in pain.

           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane walks 20 feet off the trail.

           She pulls down her pants and squats. Her pee moistens the dry 
           leaves on the forest floor.

           As she pulls up her pants, she notices something white in the 
           distance. She squints her eyes and adjusts her focus.

           Deep in the forest she sees a person dressed in all white 
           walking slowly through the heavy brush. The person takes 
           mindless, robotic steps forward. Trailing twenty feet behind 
           is another person, also dressed in white.

           Sloane pulls out her iPhone, opens up the camera app, and 
           zooms in on the two people. 

           Just as she snaps the photo, the two people stop walking and 
           turn towards Sloane. 
           She looks down at the photo. The people are not in it. She 
           looks up again. The people are gone. She shakes her head in 
           confusion and fear.

                                 SLOANE
                        You’re ok. You’re ok. You’re ok...

           Sloane slips her iPhone in her pocket and runs back onto the 
           trail towards the park entrance.

           EXT. FOREST - EVENING - LATER

           Stephen, Sloane, Mia, and Luna walk through the forest, each 
           carrying a haul bag and additional supplies for their base 
           camp.

           The final rays of sun cut through the trees, as the forest 
           quickly darkens.

           A FIFTH PAIR of footsteps approaches them from behind.

           A PARK RANGER (40) walks briskly towards them. They turn 
           around.

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Howdy! Saw your van parked out in 
                        the lot. Figured I’d find you here. 
                        Hell of a van, you live out of it?

                                 MIA
                        No, just a friend’s. Have it for 
                        the weekend.

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Lucky you. Beautiful van. Spent 
                        most my twenties living out of one. 
                        That was the time! You guys have 
                        your camping permits?

           Mia pulls the permits out of her haul bag and hands them to 
           the Park Ranger.

                                 MIA
                        Here you go.

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Thank you kindly.

           The Park Ranger studies the permits. He hands them back to 
           Mia.
                                 PARK RANGER
                        So listen. You folks are out here 
                        all alone tonight. 

           The Park Ranger inspects their gear.

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Now it looks like you’re well 
                        prepared for a climb, but this time 
                        of year you need to be careful. 
                        Sharp weather changes, rotten 
                        granite that’ll fall right off, 
                        rusted bolts, vagrants roaming the 
                        park, all of it. I’m simply asking 
                        that you be careful and take your 
                        time.

                                 SLOANE
                        Understood. Appreciate it. Do we 
                        just keep walking on this path to 
                        get to the peak?

                                 PARK RANGER
                        Yes ma’am. You’re ‘bout a half mile 
                        away. You’ll see an abandoned 
                        mountain house on the right side of 
                        the trail. That’s when you’ll know 
                        you’re almost there.

                                 SLOANE
                        Got it.

                                 PARK RANGER
                        But don’t go into the mountain 
                        house. That’s private property and 
                        I’ll have to write you up for 
                        trespassing.

                                 SLOANE
                        We’ll stay out of it. Thanks. Have 
                        a good night.

                                 PARK RANGER
                        You too. Remember: it’s optional to 
                        go up. It’s mandatory to come down. 
                        You have the choice now. You won’t 
                        once you’re up there.

                                 SLOANE
                        We’ve made our choice. Night.

           The four of them turn around and continue to walk.

           The Park Ranger whistles as he walks away from them.
           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - LATER

           Sloane, alone, stares off the trail into the woods. She sees 
           it: The abandoned mountain house.

           Stephen, Luna and Mia up ahead inspect the outside of the 
           house. We can hear them laugh from a distance.

           The house is set about 100 feet back from the trail, with 
           vines and dead leaves covering it. It’s narrow with a 
           triangular roof, no windows, and a front door that sits about 
           four feet off the ground. The staircase that leads to the 
           door is missing. An old, rusted fence surrounds the property.

           Sloane remains on the trail alone. She hears something move 
           nearby, probably a small animal. She looks around at the 
           increasingly dark forest.

                                 SLOANE
                        Fuck this...

           Sloane runs through the brush to the mountain house.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane reaches the mountain house. Stephen, Mia, and Luna are 
           already inside.

           Sloane walks up to the front door, grabs the concrete beneath 
           it, and hoists herself up. She enters.

           INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane walks in and looks around.

                                 SLOANE
                        Wow.

           No one addresses Sloane.

           Mia, Luna, and Stephen have their iPhone flashlights out. 
           Through the flashlights, we can see that the interior is one, 
           large, windowless room, with a tall gable ceiling lined by 
           cobwebs and bird nests. 

           There’s hardly any furniture inside, with the exception of 
           three rows of built in pews, which face the far wall.

           Luna is at the far wall, running her hand down a carving on 
           it.
           Sloane walks up behind Luna and examines the carving, which 
           stretches from the floor to the ceiling.

           The carving is vertical series of circles, the outline of 
           each circle seemingly perfect. But the interior of each 
           perfect circle is filled with hundreds of chaotic, jagged, 
           and erratic carved lines. Sloane runs her hand along one of 
           the circles.

                                 LUNA
                        I need to take a picture of this 
                        shit...

           Luna takes a couple steps back and starts taking photos, the 
           flash going off each time.

           Sloane turns around.

                                 SLOANE
                        Do you want me to move?

           Luna does not acknowledge Sloane.

           Sloane walks away from the carving and heads towards the 
           back, where Stephen and Mia stand, looking up at the ceiling. 

                                 STEPHEN
                             (To Mia,)
                        Look at the ceiling. There’s tiny 
                        little crosses carved all over it.

           Sloane notices Stephen gently put his hand on the small of 
           Mia’s back. 

           Luna picks up a slice of bread, nibbled on by some sort of 
           rodent.

                                 LUNA
                        Guys, look at this. It seems fresh.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well I’m sure vagrants live in this 
                        place. It’s starting to smell like 
                        dead animals. Let’s go back 
                        outside.

           Sloane notices the carving again and walks over to it. She 
           runs her hand down it, mesmerized. 

           One of the pews behind her CREAKS, as if someone just sat 
           down.

           IN FLASHBACK:
           Sloane spins around, now in an EMPTY CHURCH.

           Sloane stares ahead at the rows of empty pews. Only one 
           person sits in the church: Richard.

           Richard’s appearance has changed. His hair is more unkept, 
           his beard is thick, and he looks noticeably more thin.

           Richard stares down at a bible in his lap and mutters. Barely 
           audible.

                                 RICHARD
                        Offer me salvation from these 
                        depths to which I am a prisoner. 
                        Allow me an escape from this 
                        sinister shadow that steals light 
                        from my life. Extend a ladder down 
                        to me God, and let me climb up to 
                        you. Heal me. Please 
                        God...Please...Please...

           Richard has a small pencil and writes something in the bible 
           while he mutters to himself.

           He is drawing the exact same carving we just saw in the 
           mountain house: perfect circles filled with chaotic, jagged, 
           and erratic lines.

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Let’s get out of here.

           END FLASHBACK.

           There is a rustling in the corner of the ceiling.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m fucking leaving.

           Mia laughs and grabs Stephen’s hips. Sloane watches.

                                 MIA
                        Aw, you’re scared of the mountain 
                        house?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yes! Let’s go.

                                 MIA
                        Fine.

           Mia leans in and KISSES Stephen for a few seconds then grabs 
           his hand and leads him out. Luna follows.

           Sloane watches, shocked.
                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen! What the fuck was that?!

           No one reacts to Sloane. Sloane is now in the mountain house 
           alone. She starts to cry.

                                 SLOANE
                        What the fuck is happening? What 
                        the fuck!

           Sloane runs to the exit, opens the door, and jumps to the 
           ground.

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Sloane! There you are!

           The door shuts on its own behind Sloane.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Stephen stands with Mia and Luna.

           Sloane glares at Stephen and points back to the mountain 
           house.

                                 SLOANE
                        What the fuck was that in there?

           Sloane looks at Mia, eyes wild.

                                 SLOANE
                        Huh, Mia?!

           Stephen notices Sloane’s fresh tears. Mia looks confused.

           The wind picks up, creating mini tornados of leaves and twigs 
           around them.

           Sloane hears the trees creak around her and she looks up. The 
           trees bend slowly towards her, their leaves darkening the 
           forest.

           For the first time, the rock face in the distance is 
           revealed. Its crevices start to vibrate and some of the rock 
           melts down like liquid.

           The sounds of the vibrating rock and the wind become 
           deafening. As the sound reaches its peak, we think we hear 
           from the mountain itself...

                                 MOUNTAIN
                        Kill her! Kill her! 
           Sloane grabs the hunting knife from the side of her haul bag.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Woah, woah! Sloane! Hey! Calm down!

           Sloane charges at Mia and STABS her in the stomach.

           We watch the knife pierce through Mia’s clothes right through 
           her skin, blood quickly floods her torso.

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Sloane! Sloane!

           Stephen’s voice now seems to be coming from behind us.

           Sloane turns around. Stephen, Mia, and Luna walk towards her.

           She turns back to where she just stabbed Mia. No one is 
           there.

           The trees are back to normal, the wind has stopped, and we 
           cannot see the rock face.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I can’t believe you went in there! 

                                 MIA
                        Badass...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Don’t walk off on your own like 
                        that again. That’s always when 
                        people get hurt.

           Stephen walks up to Sloane and notices she’s gripping her 
           hunting knife tightly. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Good thing you had that to protect 
                        you.

           Sloane looks down at the knife. She attaches it back to the 
           side of her haul bag with shaking hands.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You scared me.

           Stephen hugs her. Sloane pushes him away.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What’s wrong? You ok?

           Sloane glares at Mia, then back at Stephen.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane? What’s wrong?

           Sloane calms down.

                                 SLOANE
                        Nothing. Nothing. I’m fine. My head 
                        just hurts. Sorry.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Still? Here. Take some more Advil.

                                 SLOANE
                        No. It’s fine.

           Stephen attempts to hug Sloane again. She lets him. He holds 
           her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re shaking. Let’s go to the 
                        campsite and warm up. Ok?

           Sloane nods and stares towards the empty spot where she 
           stabbed Mia. Stephen grabs Sloane’s hand and leads her 
           through the brush.

           EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

           The two tents are set up at the base. Everyone wears a jacket 
           and a beanie.

           It is too dark to see the massive granite wall that towers 
           over them.

                                 MIA
                        Is it about time to call it? 

                                 LUNA
                        Shot of whiskey before bed?

           Luna pulls a bottle of whiskey out of her tent. She unscrews 
           the top and takes a big swig. She passes it to Stephen.

           Sloane watches the brown fluid move down the bottle into 
           Stephen’s mouth.

           QUICK FLASH: The breathing tube sticks out of the Patient’s 
           mouth.

           Stephen wipes his mouth and hands the bottle to Mia. Mia 
           takes a swig and hands it to Sloane.
                                 SLOANE
                        No thanks. 

                                 LUNA
                        Can you guys feel the ghosts of all 
                        those dead climbers?

           Sloane looks down at the ground, upset. Stephen notices and 
           scolds Luna.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey Luna! Enough with the bullshit, 
                        ok? It’s not funny.

                                 LUNA
                        Whatever man.

           Mia stands up.

                                 MIA
                        Alright guys. Big day tomorrow. 
                        Let’s go to sleep.

           Stephen reaches down and helps Sloane stand up.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT - LATER

           Sloane and Stephen lie in separate sleeping bags, the light 
           from Sloane’s iPhone illuminates the tent.

           We see Sloane zooming in on the photo she took earlier of the 
           two people in white. There is no one in the photo.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Feeling better?

           Sloane turns off her iPhone. We can hardly see them inside 
           the dark tent.

                                 SLOANE
                        A little. But this place feels 
                        strange to me.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Of course it does. You have a lot 
                        of history here.

                                 SLOANE
                        I know, but before at the mountain 
                        house. I don’t know. It’s like you 
                        guys were in there with me.
                                 STEPHEN
                        We weren’t...

                                 SLOANE
                        No. I know you weren’t. That shit 
                        Luna was saying I think just 
                        freaked me out.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Please don’t take her hippie 
                        bullshit seriously.

           Beat, as Sloane searches for the right words.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah baby?

                                 SLOANE
                        I don’t want this to sound weird, 
                        but...but in the past month I’ve 
                        been having some visions of my Dad. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 SLOANE
                        Like brief...hallucinations. It’s 
                        actually common to have them when 
                        you lose someone. A bereavement 
                        hallucination is what some people 
                        call it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh, ok. So it’s normal then?

                                 SLOANE
                        I guess...I guess mine’s just 
                        delayed. But maybe it’s because I 
                        never dealt with the stuff I 
                        should’ve dealt with when it 
                        happened.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well you can always deal with it 
                        now, right?

                                 SLOANE
                        Yeah, so, that’s why I’m here. To 
                        deal with it. I just wanted you to 
                        know that. 
           Stephen hugs Sloane tightly. He kisses her forehead.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Thank you for telling me that. I 
                        love you.

                                 SLOANE
                        Love you too.

           Beat, as Sloane moves to her side. Stephen searches for 
           something to lighten the mood.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You know what this tent reminds me 
                        of?

                                 SLOANE
                        What?

                                 STEPHEN
                        That time in Yosemite when that 
                        mountain beaver crawled into our 
                        tent. And it grabbed your backpack 
                        and ran away with it!

           Stephen starts to laugh.

                                 SLOANE
                        That wasn’t funny! Those things are 
                        like giant rats. Disgusting.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Watching you chase it in your 
                        underwear is one of the highlights 
                        of my life.

           Sloane joins Stephen’s laughter.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Night baby.

           The sound of Stephen kissing Sloane.

                                 SLOANE
                        Night.

           Stephen rustles around in his sleeping bag to get 
           comfortable. Moments later, he starts to snore. Passed out.

           The wind pushes against the tent. Some air gets through a 
           slight opening, creating a whistling sound. Sloane sits up 
           and zips the tent shut. 

           The whistling stops. The wind stops. 
           Silence.

           Then, Sloane’s phone buzzes. She looks at it curiously. 

           Sloane sees the caller ID: Dad.

           Sloane answers in a hushed voice.

                                 SLOANE
                        Hello?

           There’s no one on the other line.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane! Who are you talking to?

           Sloane looks down at her phone. No service. She throws her 
           phone in shock.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Let’s go to sleep baby.

           After a moment, Stephen starts to snore again.

           Sloane lies back down and stares up at the ceiling of the 
           tent, frightened. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TENT - EARLY MORNING - FOLLOWING DAY

           Sloane steps out of the tent into a thick blanket of morning 
           fog.

           She turns on their canister camp stove and fills the cooking 
           pot with water. Sloane turns towards the tent.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen! I put water on the stove. 
                        Can you make us coffee?

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Yeah!

           She walks away from their campsite towards the wall. 

           EXT. BASE OF MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane reaches the wall and looks up.

                                 SLOANE
                        Holy shit.
           Above her stands 1400 vertical feet of white granite, the 
           first light of the morning bathing in the rock.

           Sloane puts her hand on the wall and closes her eyes. 

           IN FLASHBACK:

           A young, healthy Richard reaches his hand towards YOUNGER 
           SLOANE (10). He invites her onto the wall.

                                 RICHARD
                        I know it’s scary. That feeling in 
                        your stomach? That’s fear. But 
                        that’s only temporary if you make 
                        the right choice: to ignore your 
                        stomach and to look your obstacle 
                        right in the eyes. Before you know 
                        it, all that fear will disappear. 

           Younger Sloane looks up at the wall, still terrified.

                                 RICHARD
                        Ok, Sloaney. I want you to think of 
                        your biggest fear. Close your eyes. 
                        Do you have it? 

           Younger Sloane closes her eyes.

                                 RICHARD
                        Is it a spider maybe? 

           Younger Sloane nods.

                                 RICHARD
                        Ok. Now picture that spider. It’s 
                        crawling up your arm. You’re 
                        scared. You want to smack it off 
                        and run, right? That’ll only make 
                        it worse. 

           We watch Richard pick up a spider off the forest floor and 
           place it on Younger Sloane’s arm.

                                 RICHARD
                        Now open your eyes.

           Younger Sloane opens her eyes and looks down at her arm. Her 
           impulses start to take over as she watches the spider crawl 
           up her arm, but Richard calms her...

                                 RICHARD
                        Look it in the eyes. 

           Younger Sloane is shaking in fear.
           The spider jumps off Younger Sloane’s arm onto the forest 
           floor. Younger Sloane lets out a relieved sigh.

                                 RICHARD
                        See?

           Younger Sloane smiles and nods.

                                 YOUNGER SLOANE
                        It wasn’t that scary!

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s right! Because you let your 
                        fear in. And soon enough, this rock 
                        wall won’t be scary either.

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Are you kidding me?!

           END FLASHBACK.

           Sloane flinches, pulled out of her trance. 

           Stephen walks up from behind, unable to contain his 
           excitement.

                                 STEPHEN
                        This is the most beautiful thing 
                        I’ve ever seen. Lyttas’s Peak! Wow!

           EXT. BASE OF MOUNTAIN - EARLY MORNING - LATER

           Stephen, Sloane, Mia, and Luna stand beneath the towering 
           wall in their climbing gear. Sloane is lost in thought.

           Two anchors have been set up. Each climber wears a harness 
           with carabiners, cams, and ropes attached. 

           Stephen looks at his iPhone and reads from it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        This says that we should follow 
                        this diagonal crack system for the 
                        first 400 feet. That’s two pitches. 
                        At the end of the crack system is a 
                        ledge where we can set up camp for 
                        the first night. 

           Luna has stopped paying attention.

                                 STEPHEN
                        The next day we’ll climb two more 
                        pitches. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                        On these pitches the cracks widen, 
                        so we’ll have more opportunity to 
                        rest. We’ll set up our portaledges 
                        at the end of that day and sleep on 
                        the wall that night. 

           Sloane looks up at the wall in awe, its beauty hypnotic.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Day three, we’ll climb the final 
                        three pitches, and finish as the 
                        sun is setting. That day is going 
                        to be brutal, so conserve your 
                        energy as much as you can. 

           They’re all amped. Sloane does little jumps to warm up, Mia 
           stretches, and Luna takes a hit of her Juul.

                                 LUNA
                        Yaaaaoooo! Let’s fucking go!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Mia and I will lead. Luna and 
                        Sloane, you guys will follow. You 
                        ready?

           EXT. ROCK FACE - DAY - LATER

           Stephen and Mia are about 100 feet up the rock face. 

           Mia is slightly ahead of Stephen. He breathes heavily, 
           struggling to keep up.

           Stephen CLIPS a carabiner into a rusted bolt. He inspects the 
           bolt, TUGS on the carabiner, and the bolt RIPS right off the 
           granite.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Fuck!

                                 MIA
                        You good?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah, just don’t use these bolts. 
                        They’re pieces of shit. 

           Stephen turns down to Luna and Sloane below, who look like 
           specks beneath him.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Don’t use the bolts!
                                 SLOANE
                        Copy!

           Stephen takes out a cam, pulls down the trigger, slots it 
           into the crack, and releases it. The lobes spring open and it 
           locks in.

           Stephen clips into the cam and continues to climb.

                                 MIA
                        So what was that with Sloane 
                        yesterday?

                                 STEPHEN
                        She’s had a rough couple weeks...

                                 MIA
                        She seemed really angry when we 
                        found her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah, I know. I wouldn’t worry. 
                        She’s just wound up.

                                 MIA
                             (Unconvinced,)
                        Alright.

           Mia climbs ahead.

           Stephen reaches up for a hold, but it’s too far. He manages 
           to GRAB the hold, but his feet SLIP out beneath him. His body 
           SWINGS, and the momentum pulls him off the holds.

           Stephen FALLS. There’s a loud PING sound as the cam RIPS out 
           of the crack. 

           Stephen falls an additional 15 feet when the next set of 
           protection CATCHES him.

           ON SLOANE / LUNA:

           The rope RUSHES through Sloane’s belay device. She uses her 
           braking hand to PULL BACK on the rope at an angle of 90 
           degrees. The rope STOPS moving.

           The force of Stephen PULLS Sloane slightly off her feet.

           Stephen up above SWINGS towards the wall, and SLAPS it as he 
           makes contact.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Motherfucker!
           Sloane regains her footing. 

                                 SLOANE
                        Keep going baby! Make sure you’re 
                        using big enough cams.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I know! Fuck!

           Sloane watches Luna take a drag of her Juul with her braking 
           hand.

                                 SLOANE
                        Hey! Keep your hand on the rope. 

                                 LUNA
                        She’s not gonna fall. 

           Sloane shakes her head.

                                 SLOANE
                        Until she does.

                                 LUNA
                        You gotta relax, man. We do this 
                        all the time.

           Luna takes another hit of her Juul and blows out the smoke.

                                 SLOANE
                        Right. You’re the expert.

           EXT. ROCK FACE - DAY - LATER

           Sloane and Luna now climb, the afternoon sun beating down on 
           them. They’re about 150 feet up. Luna is slightly ahead of 
           Sloane.

           Stephen and Mia are clipped into anchors, belaying them from 
           the ledge above. 

           Sloane stops and studies the crack system ahead. Luna looks 
           down.

                                 LUNA
                        Tired?

           Sloane ignores her and continues to study the path.

           Sloane swings back to the rock face. She carefully places her 
           hands into the cracks and moves up...fast.
           Sloane SPRINTS ahead of Luna, not stopping to put in 
           protection.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane! Use a cam!

           Sloane finally puts in a new piece of protection, and 
           continues up effortlessly.

           ON MIA / STEPHEN:

           Mia looks at Stephen.

                                 MIA
                        You didn’t say she was this good...

           BACK ON SLOANE / LUNA:

           Sloane breaks further away.

           Luna picks up her pace, climbing up through labored breaths.  
           The climbing rope goes BEHIND Luna’s leg.

           Mia yells from above.

                                 MIA
                        Keep the rope in front of your leg!

           Luna ignores Mia. She stretches her leg to the left, and 
           SLIPS.

           Luna FALLS.

           The rope behind her leg FLIPS her upside down, and her helmet 
           SLAMS against the wall. Luna yells in fear. She turns herself 
           upright again.

                                 MIA
                        Are you ok?!

           Luna, disoriented and embarrassed, gives the thumbs up. She 
           rests against the wall for a moment. 

           Sloane looks down, smiles.

                                 SLOANE
                        Tired?

           Sloane turns back around and continues up.

           We follow Sloane as she carefully and calmly moves up the 
           crack.
           She pauses, turns around, and looks towards the sky, taking 
           it in. A rare moment of calm for Sloane...

           ...Until she spots something in the forest.

           Through the thick ceiling of trees, she can make out a WHITE 
           SPECK that moves through the forest.

           She follows the speck until it emerges into the meadow below, 
           revealing...

           A person in all WHITE with messy hair and a thick beard, 
           seemingly no hiking gear. The same person Sloane saw 
           yesterday...

           She can hardly make out his face from this distance, but sees 
           him wave in her direction.

           Sloane points down to him and turns to Luna.

                                 SLOANE
                        You see that?

           Luna looks down.

                                 LUNA
                        See what?

                                 SLOANE
                        That guy. Down there.

           Luna scans the meadow, confused.

                                 LUNA
                        No?

           EXT. MEADOW - CONTINUOUS

           We look up at Sloane and Luna on the wall from the PERSON’s 
           POV as he waves at them. Stephen and Mia look even smaller 
           from this angle, belaying from the ledge above.

           The Person turns around and runs back into the forest. We 
           have not seen his face yet...

           We FOLLOW him from behind.

           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           The Person moves down the trail, looking downwards and 
           muttering to himself. 
           He walks in the direction of the mountain house.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He reaches the entrance of the mountain house. We finally get 
           a good look at his face.

           Through his thick beard and long hair we see this Person is 
           RICHARD, or some version of him. His white outfit is stained 
           and torn and he looks even older. The whites of his eyes have 
           turned black and his skin hangs off his emaciated frame. 
           We’ll refer to him as RICHARD’S SHADOW.

           He hoists himself up and enters.

           INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Richard’s Shadow enters the pitch black, windowless room. We 
           are in there with him for a few moments in total darkness 
           until...

           He LIGHTS a match. The orange light illuminates the interior 
           of rotting wood and religious carvings.

           He then lights a few CANDLES around the room. As he does 
           this, more and more of the room becomes visible to us.

           As he lights the final candle, we see the SHAPE OF A PERSON 
           in the corner.

           The Person sits, hugging her knees and rocking back and forth 
           in the shadows. The Person wears all white and we cannot see 
           her face.

           Richard bends down next to the Person and pulls two slices of 
           bread out of his pocket.

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        Here. Take some. 

           The Person doesn’t look up. We now see the Person’s forearms 
           are littered with red scratches and scabs from fingernails 
           digging into them.

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        You need to eat. 

           Richard’s Shadow sits down on the floor next to her.
                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        She’s finally here...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROCK LEGDE - CONTINUOUS

           Luna sweats heavily and GRUNTS with every movement. 

                                 MIA
                        C’mon Luna! Three more feet. Use 
                        the hold to your left!

           Luna grabs the hold and lifts herself up with all her 
           strength.

           Luna rolls onto the ledge and lies on her back, catching her 
           breath. 

                                 MIA
                        Woo!!

           Mia bends down and kisses Luna.

                                 MIA
                        You did it!!

           Luna looks at her fingers. They are swollen, bloody, and 
           chapped.

           Sloane grabs a bottle of water, pours some electrolyte powder 
           into it, and hands it to Luna.

                                 SLOANE
                        Here. Drink this.

           Luna gulps down the electrolyte solution. Her energy is 
           renewed. 

                                 LUNA
                        Woo!!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Day one finished!

           EXT. ROCK LEDGE - EARLY EVENING - LATER

           The rock ledge is 20 feet wide, and stretches 100 feet long. 
           The group has pitched their two tents. 

           They all sit on the ledge with their feet dangling off, 
           waiting for the water to boil on the stove top behind them. 
           In the meantime, they eat various snacks out of Ziploc bags. 
           Nuts, trail-mix, kale, and pretzels. 

           They watch the sun set, casting beams of pink and orange 
           across the sky. They each sport a sun burn, Luna and Mia’s 
           fingers are tied in tape, and they all wear jackets, 
           protecting them from the rapidly dropping temperatures and 
           strong winds.

           Luna inspects her fingers.

                                 LUNA
                        Hope I’ll be good for tomorrow. 
                        They’re killing me.

                                 SLOANE
                        Just keep applying moisturizing 
                        ointment and re-tape them every 
                        hour. Swelling will go down by 
                        morning.

                                 LUNA
                        Thanks doc.

           Sloane smiles. 

                                 MIA
                        Whiskey? Music?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yes!

                                 LUNA
                        Woo!

           Mia pulls out a bottle of whiskey, a speaker pill, and a 
           joint from her haul bag. She turns on the music and lights up 
           the joint.

                                 MIA
                        I’m so happy to be up here with you 
                        guys. Away from it all. And Sloane! 
                        You’re a badass climber.

                                 SLOANE
                        Ha, thanks.

           Stephen looks down...never the center of attention. 

           Sloane notices.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen, you looked good out there 
                        too. All that training paying off.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Thanks. Felt amazing. Had to be my 
                        best run yet.

           Mia passes the joint to Stephen who takes a few hits, then 
           passes it to Luna who does the same. Luna hands it to Sloane. 

                                 SLOANE
                        I’m good. Thanks.

           Stephen, Mia, and Luna lean back comfortably and sip whiskey, 
           while singing along to the music and laughing.

           Sloane sits next to them, stiff. She stares out into the 
           distance silently. 

                                 LUNA
                        Ahh it does not get better than 
                        this. 

           Luna turns and looks down the length of the ledge.

                                 LUNA
                        You guys wanna see what’s around 
                        that bend?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Let’s do it!

           Stephen, Luna, and Mia stand up. Sloane continues to sit. Mia 
           notices.

                                 MIA
                        You guys go. I’ll hang back here 
                        with Sloane.

           Sloane looks up at Mia.

                                 SLOANE
                        No, go. You should go with them.

                                 MIA
                        I’m beat from today. Would rather 
                        just hang out here.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Alright, cool. See you guys in a 
                        bit.

           Stephen and Luna walk down the ledge.

           Mia sits next to Sloane and points the bottle of whiskey in 
           her direction.
                                 MIA
                        You sure you don’t want some?

                                 SLOANE
                        I’m good. 

           Mia takes another pull. Sloane hesitates, then...

                                 SLOANE
                        Have you felt weird at all since 
                        getting here?

                                 MIA
                        Not really. Why? What’s up?

                                 SLOANE
                        I just...it just felt like...I 
                        don’t know. It’s stupid...

                                 MIA
                        No it’s not. Talk to me...

                                 SLOANE
                        It’s hard to explain...I’m probably 
                        just tired, stressed. 

           Mia, unsure how to respond, takes another pull of whiskey.

                                 MIA
                        Guessing your program doesn’t care 
                        much about your stress, huh? 
                        Stephen tells me about your hours.

                                 SLOANE
                        They keep us in the hospital ‘til 
                        our legs give out. You’d think 
                        they’d be concerned for our minds, 
                        but you’d be surprised.

                                 MIA
                        I know the feeling.

                                 SLOANE
                        It was like that at the start-up?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah...put everything into it. It 
                        eventually took over my mind.

                                 SLOANE
                        This residency is starting to feel 
                        that way too. 
                                 MIA
                        People burn out. Have breakdowns. 
                        You gotta do more stuff like 
                        climbing.

                                 SLOANE
                        Nothing used to relax me more than 
                        climbing with my Dad. Miss that 
                        feeling.

                                 MIA
                        We all do. We’re all just driving 
                        ourselves crazy to keep moving up. 
                        It sometimes feels like the further 
                        we ascend, the further we descend 
                        mentally. You sometimes think how 
                        much less dangerous it would be if 
                        we didn’t strive for things beyond 
                        our capacities.

                                 SLOANE
                        Such an un-American thing to say!

                                 MIA
                        So I guess climbing runs in your 
                        family then?

                                 SLOANE
                        Guess so.

                                 MIA
                        I could think of worse things. It’s 
                        weird, I’m 30 now and feel like I’m 
                        morphing into my parents more and 
                        more every day. How old are you?

                                 SLOANE

                                 MIA
                        You’ll feel it soon too.

                                 SLOANE
                        Hopefully not...

                                 MIA
                        What? Your Dad sounds cool.

                                 SLOANE
                        Yeah. It’s tough to explain. 

                                 MIA
                        We’ve got time...
           Sloane hesitates, then...

                                 SLOANE
                        I...it’s personal.

                                 MIA
                        All good.

           Beat, as Sloane stares towards the sky.

           Mia hands Sloane the bottle of Whiskey.

                                 MIA
                        Well, cheers to saving lives. Hell 
                        of a lot more impressive than what 
                        I do. 

           Sloane stares at the bottle for a moment then takes a swig.

                                 MIA
                        There she is!

           Mia then hands Sloane the joint. Sloane takes a hit and 
           starts to cough.

                                 SLOANE
                        Haven’t done that in a while!

                                 MIA
                        Enjoy yourself. You deserve it.

           Sloane coughs some more.

                                 MIA
                        How are things with Stephen?

           Sloane pauses, thinks.

                                 SLOANE
                        They’re ok...

                                 MIA
                        But...?

           Sloane takes another sip of whiskey.

                                 SLOANE
                        It doesn’t help that I told him I 
                        wasn’t ready for...you know, 
                        marriage...

           An uncomfortable beat.
                                 MIA
                        Did he ask you?

           Sloane nods.

                                 MIA
                        Fuck, I’m such an idiot for 
                        bringing that up yesterday!

                                 SLOANE
                        Don’t worry about it. It happens.

                                 MIA
                        Well sometimes climbing is the best 
                        way to answer this stuff...

           Mia stands up.

                                 MIA
                        ...Wanna go see what your boyfriend 
                        and Luna are up to?

                                 SLOANE
                        Yeah. Let’s go.

           Sloane takes one more sip. She stands up and follows Mia down 
           the ledge.

           EXT. END OF LEDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane and Mia reach the end of the visible ledge, and turn 
           around the bend. As they turn the corner they see a cave 
           ahead. They can hear the echoes of Stephen and Luna inside.

                                 MIA
                        What’re the odds there’s a mountain 
                        lion living in there?

                                 SLOANE
                        Just remember: If we see one, throw 
                        shit at it and poke it in the eye 
                        with a stick.

                                 MIA
                        That makes me feel better.

                                 SLOANE
                        Don’t tell Luna though. She might 
                        call PETA...

           Mia laughs. They enter the cave.
           INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           They each shine their iPhone flashlights. The cave extends a 
           considerable distance. Stephen and Luna are deeper in. They 
           turn around and walk towards Mia and Sloane.

                                 STEPHEN
                        How cool is this?

                                 MIA
                        I wouldn’t go too far in. 

           Something small rustles past their feet. Mia screams.

                                 LUNA
                        Relax. It’s just a mouse. 

           Stephen approaches a spot on the wall and raises his iPhone 
           flashlight up to it.

           He reveals the exact same carving they saw in the mountain 
           house. A vertical series of perfect circles, the interior of 
           each filled with hundreds of chaotic, jagged, and erratic 
           carved lines.

                                 MIA
                        What do you think it means?

                                 LUNA
                        I don’t know, but that would be a 
                        dope design for a tattoo.

           Luna takes a photo of the carving with her iPhone.

           Mia stares at the circles, drawn to their hypnotic quality. 
           She puts her back against the wall right under the carving, 
           and slowly sits down on the cave floor. She stretches her 
           arms wide and presses her whole body against the wall.

                                 MIA
                        Do you guys feel that? 

           Stephen looks at Mia, confused.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No?

                                 MIA
                        This wall is so warm and soft. 
                        Feels magnetic...

           Mia closes her eyes.
                                 MIA
                        Can we sleep in here?

           Stephen laughs.

                                 STEPHEN
                        How much did you drink?

           Mia opens her eyes and stares at Stephen. She grins at him, 
           and reaches out her arms.

                                 MIA
                        Come sit.

           Sloane watches Stephen sit next to Mia, but she is quickly 
           distracted by something shining in the ground 30 feet deeper 
           into the cave.

           Sloane walks towards it. It glimmers in the light from her 
           iPhone flashlight. She reaches the object and bends down to 
           inspect it.

           As Sloane focuses her iPhone flashlight downwards, the cave 
           walls around her darken.

           We might be able to make out the SHAPE OF A PERSON ever so 
           faintly, standing against the wall near Sloane.

           Sloane’s iPhone flashlight moves for a moment, and we think 
           we see TWO EYES reflect off the light.

           Stephen, Luna, and Mia’s voices can hardly be heard now.

           Sloane looks down at the ground and sees...

           ECU: a bloody STEEL SCALPEL.

           QUICK FLASH: Sloane makes the incision along the patient’s 
           spine. Blood pours out.

           Sloane jumps backwards in fear and BUMPS into something...

           Not the wall...

           Softer...

           A person...

           Sloane slowly turns around to reveal...

           SLOANE.

           This Sloane is covered in cuts, blood, and dirt, with hair 
           covering most of her face. 
           An incision runs down her entire back and blood pours out of 
           the wound and down the backside of her legs.

           Bloody Sloane opens her mouth wide to SCREAM when...

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Sloane! Are you ok?

           Sloane stares down at the scalpel...

           ...she is gripping a twig.

           She drops it. Stunned.

           She looks ahead and no one is standing there.

           Sloane turns and runs back towards the group. She reaches the 
           group, out of breath.

                                 SLOANE
                             (Panicked,)
                        C’mon, let’s go!

           Mia is still pressed against the wall, eyes closed.

           Luna grabs Mia’s hands and pulls her up. The group walks out 
           of the cave.

           Sloane trails them. She looks back once more at the twig. She 
           rubs her eyes...Still a twig. 

           EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane exits last. Stephen is waiting for her. Mia and Luna 
           have already made their way back.

           The sun has set and the stars begin to dot the sky. Stephen 
           notes Sloane’s shocked expression.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You good?

                                 SLOANE
                        Just remembered why I don’t smoke 
                        weed.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You smoked?!

                                 SLOANE
                        I shouldn’t have. Makes me 
                        paranoid. Especially at night.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Look at you loosening up!

           Beat, as Sloane stares down at her hands.

                                 SLOANE
                        I can’t believe my hands paralyzed 
                        someone...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane! Don’t think about that! 
                        Positive thoughts. C’mon.

           Stephen puts his arm around Sloane and kisses her on the 
           head.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Let’s have some dinner. It’ll 
                        balance you out.

           Sloane ignores him and turns back to look at the cave 
           entrance once more. She holds her head in pain and starts to 
           cry.

                                 SLOANE
                             (Through tears,)
                        This was such a bad idea to come 
                        here!

           Stephen holds both of Sloane’s hands.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey, look at me. No it wasn’t. We 
                        had a great day, right? You’re 
                        completely fine. I promise. You’re 
                        just a little high. 

           Stephen hugs Sloane as she cries into his chest.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Do you need more Advil? Water?

                                 SLOANE
                             (Through tears,)
                        It’s not helping.

           Stephen kisses the top of Sloane’s head.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah baby?
           Sloane stares back towards the cave, eyes wide.

                                 SLOANE
                        What do you think my Dad saw?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Don’t think about that right now. 
                        Let’s just try and relax.

           Stephen takes Sloane’s hand and leads her towards the tents.

                                 STEPHEN
                        C’mon, let’s go. I’ll make you 
                        dinner. I’ll give you one of my 
                        famous massages. Whatever you need.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT - LATER

           Sloane and Stephen lie side by side in their sleeping bags.

           They can hear Mia and Luna having sex nearby.

           Stephen rolls over to Sloane and kisses her neck and cheek a 
           few times. Sloane doesn’t reciprocate. Stephen reaches into 
           her sleeping bag.

                                 SLOANE
                        No Stephen. I’m tired. My head 
                        still hurts.

           Stephen retreats to his side, puts his arm behind his head,  
           and looks up at the ceiling of the tent. He sighs 
           dramatically.

                                 SLOANE
                        What?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Enough rejections can really wear a 
                        person down after a while...

                                 SLOANE
                        Don’t use that against me right 
                        now. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I don’t understand why--

                                 SLOANE
                        --Stephen! I’m not having this 
                        conversation.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Fine. Night.

                                 SLOANE
                        Love you.

           Silence. 

           Mia orgasms nearby.

           Stephen turns on his side and closes his eyes.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen?

                                 STEPHEN
                        What?

                                 SLOANE
                        Can we talk for a second?

                                 STEPHEN
                             (Annoyed,)
                        I thought you were too tired?

           Sloane takes a deep breath, tries not to cry.

                                 SLOANE
                        The operation I fucked up--

                                 STEPHEN
                        --It’s not your fault. Go to sleep.

                                 SLOANE
                        I was so tired before it...and 
                        I...I snorted Adderall.

           Stephen sits up and faces Sloane.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You what?

                                 SLOANE
                        I accidentally did too much--

                                 STEPHEN
                        --You snorted Adderall? That’s 
                        basically cocaine! Sloane, what? 
                        That’s not you.

           Sloane cries.
                                 SLOANE
                             (Through tears,)
                        I had been in the hospital for so 
                        long...I didn’t know what else to 
                        do...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Does your chief know?

                                 SLOANE
                        No...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane! They could pull your 
                        license.

                                 SLOANE
                        I know...I feel like...I feel like 
                        such a bad person...

           Sloane cries more. Stephen hugs her.

                                 SLOANE
                        I hadn’t slept in days...I don’t 
                        know what I was thinking...and now 
                        his life is ruined...

           Sloane breaks down completely.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey...hey...it’s ok. It’s ok. Shhh.

           Stephen kisses her head a few times.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re human. It’s ok...let’s lie 
                        down and try to get some 
                        sleep...let’s lie down...c’mon...

           Stephen guides Sloane back down and hugs her.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT - LATER

           Silence other than Stephen’s snoring. Sloane is still wide 
           awake.

           She hears something...close to them, VERY close...

           FOOTSTEPS on the ledge. 

           Her body freezes.
                                 SLOANE
                             (Softly,)
                        Stephen. Stephen.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What?

                                 SLOANE
                             (Softly,)
                        There’s someone outside our tent.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No one’s up here. Go to sleep.

           The sound of the ropes dropping on the ledge.

           Sloane starts to breathe quickly, panicked.

                                 SLOANE
                             (Softly,)
                        Stephen. Someone’s out there!

           Stephen, frustrated, sits up and pulls down the zipper of the 
           tent.

           He shines his iPhone flashlight on the ledge.

           Nothing.

                                 STEPHEN
                        See! Go to sleep.

           Sloane notices one of the ropes has been moved slightly away 
           from the rest of the gear.

           Stephen turns off his iPhone flashlight, zips the tent shut, 
           and lies back down. After a few moments, Stephen snores 
           again.

           Sloane sits up, attaches the hunting knife to her waist, 
           unzips the tent, and steps onto the ledge...

           EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           ...Sloane walks up to the pile of rope that’s been moved. She 
           picks up the rope and inspects it. 

                                 SLOANE
                        Mia’s rope...

           She runs her hand along the rope. 
           The bright moon reflects off the metal of her hunting knife 
           on her waist. 

           We slowly PAN from her hunting knife, to her hands on the 
           rope, to the granite wall, which is just a few feet ahead.

           We hold on the granite wall for a beat, so we can no longer 
           see Sloane and the rope.

           Sloane enters the frame as she walks to the wall. She puts 
           her hand on the cold granite.

           As she touches the wall, she hears, very softly, from the 
           mountain itself...

                                 MOUNTAIN
                        Let her falllll.

           She jumps backwards, almost trips. She regains her balance. 
           Panicked, she looks around the ledge. 

           She looks towards the granite wall again. Its menacing 
           crevices cast dark shadows in the moonlight.  

           She runs back to her tent and jumps in.

           INT. TENT - EARLY MORNING - FOLLOWING DAY

           Sloane wakes up to the first rays of sunlight beating down on 
           her tent.

           Stephen doesn’t snore. Weird...

           Sloane shakes him. He doesn’t move.

                                 SLOANE
                        Hey! Wake up.

           Sloane tugs on his shoulder and turns him on his back 
           revealing...

           Kevin, Sloane’s fellow medical resident. He looks up at 
           Sloane and smiles. The empty bottle of whiskey lies next to 
           him.

           Sloane leans down and starts to kiss him. She rolls on top of 
           him, but her expression quickly changes from one of lust to 
           one of disgust as she tastes something...

           She looks down and yells. In the sleeping bag is now the 
           Patient. 
           Bruises cover his neck and his lips are a dark purple. The 
           patient opens his eyes, revealing yellowed sclera and dilated 
           pupils. He opens his mouth, and through rotted teeth he 
           whispers...

                                 PATIENT
                        Sloaneeeee.

           Sloane wraps her fingers around his purple neck, and tightens 
           her grip, strangling him.

           Sloane shoots up from her sleeping bag, sweating profusely 
           and breathing heavily.

           She looks down at Stephen. His face is ghost white, lips 
           purple. Sloane puts her hand over his mouth to feel for his 
           breath.

           Nothing.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen! No!

           Sloane shoots up again.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane! Sloane! Are you ok?

           Sloane looks at Stephen. Touches his face. She hugs him 
           tightly.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You ok? Sounded scary.

                                 SLOANE
                        Yeah...

           Sloane squeezes Stephen and her eyes water. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        That dream sounded insane! I wrote 
                        down some of the shit you were 
                        saying--

                                 SLOANE
                        --Can you not do that?

           Sloane looks at Stephen’s neck and notices faint bruises. She 
           gently rubs his neck.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Want me to make you some coffee?
           Sloane nods. Stephen kisses Sloane’s head and walks out of 
           the tent. 

           Sloane stares down at her hands, afraid of them.

           She realizes her hunting knife is still attached to her hip. 
           She unclips it and throws it on top of Stephen’s sleeping 
           bag.

           ECU: The hunting knife. There’s nothing on the blade. Until 
           we look closer at the serrated edge. Unbeknownst to Sloane, 
           we see tiny ROPE FIBERS along the blade of the knife.

           EXT. LEDGE - MORNING - LATER

           The group stands at the ledge looking up at the remaining 
           1000 feet of granite. All four of them look tired and 
           haggard. 

           Mia and Luna are using the ROPE that had been moved the night 
           before.

           Luna rubs her temple.

                                 LUNA
                        My head is pounding.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s just the thin air up here. 

           Mia holds her head. 

                                 MIA
                        Me too. I feel dehydrated.

                                 SLOANE
                        Do you guys need to rest today?

                                 MIA
                        No, I’ll be good. Just going to 
                        move slow.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Mia, you and I lead again?

           Mia holds her head in pain.

                                 MIA
                        Luna, can you?

                                 LUNA
                        Sure.
           Luna and Stephen walk up to the wall.

           They both dry the bottom of their shoes with their chalked 
           hands. They step onto the wall and place their fingers in the 
           first holds.

           EXT. ROCK FACE - DAY - LATER

           Luna and Stephen are 150 feet above the ledge, 550 feet above 
           the base camp. They mark each hold with chalk for Sloane and 
           Mia to follow.

           Stephen stops climbing and shakes out his right hand while 
           holding on with his left.

                                 LUNA
                        You good?

                                 STEPHEN
                        These holds are razor sharp. My 
                        hands are shredded.

                                 LUNA
                        We’re almost at the end of the 
                        pitch. Just shake it out.

           Stephen wipes each shoe onto the opposite pant leg, drying 
           them. The wind picks up, blowing Stephen’s t-shirt.

                                 STEPHEN
                        This wind is a bitch!

           They hear wings flap. Stephen turns around. An eagle is 
           circling them nearby.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey! Get out of here!

           Luna turns around to see the eagle flying right at her. She 
           panics and SLIPS.

                                 LUNA
                        Ah! Fuck!

           Luna DROPS 20 feet until her ROPE catches her fall.

           ECU: the rope stretches tight.

           Luna BOUNCES up and down a few times before swinging back to 
           the rock face. The rope seems fine.

           Luna SLAPS the wall.
           EXT. ROCK FACE - LATE AFTERNOON - LATER

           Stephen and Luna belay Sloane and Mia from the top of pitch 
           4, 800 feet above ground.

                                 STEPHEN
                        My forearms are burning like crazy.

           Luna holds up her forearms.

                                 LUNA
                        Mine are totally swollen. Today was 
                        brutal.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tomorrow’s harder.

                                 LUNA
                        Fuck me...

           ON SLOANE / MIA: 

           Sloane and Mia are 100 feet below Stephen and Luna.

           Mia struggles, lagging behind Sloane by about 20 feet.

           Sloane finds a wide portion of the crack and sticks her hands 
           into it. 

                                 SLOANE
                        Mia! The crack widens up here. Use 
                        the hand jams to rest for a minute.

                                 MIA
                        Ok!

           Sloane catches her breath. She looks down at the ground far 
           below them. She closes her eyes and breathes in the cool air.

                                 MIA
                        Fuck! My legs are already starting 
                        to wobble.

                                 SLOANE
                        Just find a crack and shift your 
                        weight back and forth to recover. 
                        You just need a second.

                                 MIA
                        I need water!

                                 SLOANE
                        We’re almost there.
           Mia reaches up to a moist hold. She GRIPS it, but her hand 
           SLIPS and she FALLS.

           ECU: the rope STRETCHES tight. We watch the OUTER SHEATH 
           stretch, and at its most extended point, we see the INNER 
           CORE of the rope. It’s TORN.

           Mia BOUNCES up and down a few times. The rope HOLDS her, 
           despite the TEAR.

           Sloane sprints ahead, expertly maneuvering the crack.

           EXT. ROCK FACE - LATE AFTERNOON - LATER

           Sloane reaches Stephen and Luna. Stephen gives Sloane a high 
           five and a kiss. She catches her breath and takes a huge sip 
           of water.

           Sloane is both excited and exhausted. She leans back and 
           yells up to the sky.

                                 SLOANE
                        Woo!!

           Beneath them, Mia continues to move up the rock face. She has 
           about 50 feet to go.

           ON MIA:

           Mia exhales through her teeth as she grabs a new hold, 
           bracing for impact.

           She SQUEEZES the hold, and yells as the razor sharp edge of 
           the granite SLICES into her fingers.

                                 MIA
                        Fuck!!

           Luna cheers from above.

                                 LUNA
                        C’mon Mia! Keep pushing!

                                 MIA
                        I can barely hold a cam! 

           Mia reaches the wide crack. She JAMS her hands into it, and 
           starts to cry.

                                 MIA
                        Motherfucker! I hate this shit so 
                        much.
           Mia tries to catch her breath. 

           She hears a loud SHRIEK from inside the crack. A BAT is 6 
           inches above her hands. It FLIES out of the crack and BRAISES 
           her face.

           Mia SCREAMS and RIPS her hands out of the hold. She FALLS 
           backwards and shoots down 12 feet.

           ECU: the rope STRETCHES tight again. The outer sheath TEARS 
           further. We HEAR and SEE the individual threads of the inner 
           core start to POP and TEAR. 

           The rope reaches its most extended point, and just as we 
           expect Mia to shoot back up, we hear a loud...

           POP!

           The rope TEARS completely.

           Mia lets out a guttural and horrified SCREAM. The sound waves 
           bounce off the granite and speed through the park below.

           Mia FALLS down the rock face.

           She SLAMS onto the ledge 350 feet below, and the force sends 
           her body off the ledge another 400 feet down into the meadow.

           ON STEPHEN / LUNA / SLOANE:

           They all watch Mia fall to her death.

                                 LUNA
                        No!!

           Luna cries hysterically.

                                 LUNA
                             (Through sobs,)
                        What the fuck was that?!

           Sloane looks below, frozen, shocked. Stephen puts his hand 
           over his mouth and cries.

                                 LUNA
                        This was such a stupid fucking idea 
                        to come here! 

           Luna tries to control her breathing.
                                 LUNA
                             (Through sobs,)
                        No one’s in the fucking park...we 
                        have no service...and we’re 800 
                        feet up a wall! 

                                 SLOANE
                             (Softly,)
                        I’m so sorry...I’m so sorry...

           Sloane looks at the meadow below.

                                 SLOANE
                        Oh my god...

                                 LUNA
                        We need to go down! We need to go 
                        down now!

           The sun is setting. Night is rushing in. 

           Sloane needs to take control of the situation...

                                 SLOANE
                        Let’s all stay calm. Let’s think 
                        about this--

                                 LUNA
                        --Think about what?! Mia is fucking 
                        dead!

           Luna sobs more.

                                 SLOANE
                        We’re closer to the top than the 
                        bottom. The way down is up.

                                 LUNA
                        Then let’s keep fucking moving!

           Stephen looks down at the meadow, sobs.

                                 SLOANE
                        Luna, listen. It’s about to get 
                        dark--

                                 LUNA
                        --I don’t care! Let’s go now!

                                 SLOANE
                        Luna. We’re going to get hurt if we 
                        go now. 
                                 LUNA
                        She’s fucking dead!!

                                 SLOANE
                        I know, Luna. I know. But we’re not 
                        gonna also get hurt, right? We’re 
                        gonna stay safe.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane’s right...

           Luna puts her face in her hands and cries more. Stephen’s 
           body shakes in fear.

                                 SLOANE
                        Both of you need to sit in your 
                        harnesses and try to stay calm. I’m 
                        going to set up our portaledges so 
                        we can sleep for a little. Can you 
                        both stay calm for me?

           Luna nods her head and slaps the rock in anger. Stephen nods 
           sadly.

                                 SLOANE
                        We’re going to get off this 
                        mountain soon. I promise...

           Luna stares down at the torn rope and wails.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           We are back in the mountain house. The carvings on the walls 
           dance in the candle light. 

           The Person stands at the far wall and carves more jagged 
           lines into the perfect circle with a hunting knife. We look 
           at her from behind and still cannot see her face.

           Richard’s Shadow walks up behind her and puts his hand on her 
           shoulder.

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        It’s time to go...

           The Person finally turns around and looks at Richard...

           Through the dim lighting and dirt on her face we think we can 
           see Sloane, who we will refer to as SLOANE’S SHADOW. Her face 
           is littered with small cuts, she has a flat affect, and her 
           eyes are completely black.
           But we’re still not sure it’s Sloane until Richard’s Shadow 
           confirms it...

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        Take my hand Sloaney...

           Richard’s Shadow leads Sloane’s Shadow out of the mountain 
           house.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Richard’s Shadow and Sloane’s Shadow jump down to the forest 
           floor. Their stained white outfits contrast the darkness 
           around them.

           Richard’s Shadow leads Sloane’s Shadow through the forest 
           towards the trail in the direction of the peak.

           EXT. ROCK WALL - PORTALEDGES - NIGHT

           Two portaledges hang from separate anchors, side by side. 
           It’s a bed 800 feet in the sky, made of metal tubing with 
           nylon stretched over it, and above each one is a nylon tent. 
           The portaledges are supported by four suspensions that 
           connect to the anchor. Their climbing gear hangs from slings 
           at the entrance of each one.

           Luna sits in one looking incredibly sad and defeated and 
           Stephen and Sloane sit in the other. They each wear harnesses 
           and are tied to the anchor to protect them.

           Wind blows and the metal tubing taps against the granite over 
           and over again.

                                 SLOANE
                        Here, Luna, use some of this hand 
                        ointment. You’ll need it for 
                        tomorrow.

           Sloane reaches over to Luna’s portaledge and accidentally 
           DROPS the ointment.

                                 SLOANE
                        Ah! Fuck. 

           It falls 800 feet. They hear the aluminum bottle echo as it 
           hits the granite ledge below, immediately bringing back 
           horrific memories of Mia’s fall.

           Luna closes her eyes, holds back tears. She stares into the 
           night sky and shakes her head in disbelief. 
                                 LUNA
                        I can’t believe we’re up here still 
                        while she’s down there...

           Sloane reaches across the portaledges and holds Luna’s arm.

                                 SLOANE
                        I’m so sorry Luna...

           Luna begins to cry again.

           Sloane hesitates to speak, then finally breaks the silence.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen, remember last night when I 
                        woke you up? And I told you I 
                        thought someone was outside our 
                        tent?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah. No one was there. Remember?

                                 SLOANE
                        I know. But I heard someone. And 
                        the pile of ropes had been moved.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I know we’re all traumatized right 
                        now, but I can assure you that no 
                        one was on that ledge. It was a 
                        freak accident. It’s all in your 
                        head.

                                 SLOANE
                        Exactly! It’s in our heads. It’s in 
                        our minds. I don’t know what it is, 
                        but there’s something that’s after 
                        us.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Nothing is following us. You’re the 
                        most logical person I know. You 
                        know none of that’s true.

           Sloane shakes her head.

                                 SLOANE
                        Every single one of us has had a 
                        pounding headache--

                                 STEPHEN
                        --It’s the altitude.
                                 SLOANE
                        I know what high altitude feels 
                        like! This is different. And 
                        I’ve...

           Sloane hesitates.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What?

                                 SLOANE
                        I’ve heard the mountain speak. 
                        Twice.

                                 LUNA
                        What did it say?--

                                 STEPHEN
                        --Enough! Do you realize what we’re 
                        talking about?! Mia is dead and 
                        we’re talking about the mountain 
                        speaking to us? Sloane, you’re just 
                        imagining it cause you heard all 
                        those stories about your Dad here. 
                        It’s not real--

                                 SLOANE
                        --I’m telling you--

                                 LUNA
                        --What stories?--

                                 STEPHEN
                        --Whatever the fuck is happening we 
                        can all agree that we need to get 
                        the hell off this mountain 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 LUNA
                        We shouldn’t have been here in the 
                        first place.

           Luna aggressively zips her portaledge shut. 

           The two portaledges sit side by side, gently swaying in the 
           wind, illuminated by the camp light that dangles in 
           between...

           INT. LUNA’S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT - LATER

           Luna sleeps on her portaledge. The wind howls against the 
           granite, rocking Luna’s portaledge back and forth. 
           Each time the portaledge’s metal tubing makes contact with 
           the granite wall, the sound echoes through the quiet night.

           The wind howls louder. The portaledge SWINGS OUT further, and 
           BACK into the wall. Luna is TOSSED a couple inches.

           Luna wakes up from the collision, disoriented. The wind 
           calms. The portaledge is still again.

           Luna closes her eyes for a few moments until...

           We faintly hear something from the wall...

                                 MOUNTAIN
                        Wake uppppp.

           Luna SHOOTS UP and stares in the direction of the wall.

                                 LUNA
                        What the fuck was that?

           The wind screams against the rock face, picks Luna’s 
           portaledge up and outwards, and gravity SLAMS the portaledge 
           back into the granite wall.

           The metal tubing COLLIDES with the granite. Luna is TOSSED 
           around inside, and her body is LAUNCHED into the granite 
           wall. She lands back on the portaledge.

           ECU: Luna’s harness is no longer clipped into the anchor.

           Luna grips both edges of her portaledge, squeezes the metal 
           tubing, and breathes deeply.

                                 LUNA
                        It’s just the wind...

           The wind stops. The camp light outside her tent continues to 
           swing.

           Luna notices her harness is not clipped into anything.

                                 LUNA
                        What the fuck?

           Luna goes to clip herself in when...

           EXT. PORTALEDGES - CONTINUOUS

           ...The wind violently FLIPS Luna’s portaledge.

           Meanwhile, Stephen and Sloane’s portaledge, only a few feet 
           away, is completely STILL.
           Luna SCREAMS in terror, as she...

           INT. LUNA’S PORTALEDGE - CONTINUOUS

           ...Misses her opportunity to clip herself in, and is TOSSED 
           and SPUN around her portaledge as it FLIPS.

           The wind stops.

           The portaledge is still.

           Luna reorients herself and realizes that the cot is ABOVE 
           her, and she is lying on the inner roof of the flipped tent.

           She hears the nylon tent RIP as it tries to hold her weight.

                                                                   SNAP

                                                                   SNAP

                                                                   SNAP

           The nylon tent cover RIPS off the portaledge, and at the last 
           second, Luna GRABS the metal tubing above with one hand.

           The nylon tent cover drifts down gently in the wind.

           Luna hangs from the portaledge with one arm, a black abyss 
           beneath her dangling legs.

                                 LUNA
                        Sloane!! Stephen!!

           Sloane and Stephen’s portaledge remains STILL. They don’t 
           wake up to Luna’s screams.

                                 LUNA
                        Help me!!

           Luna swings her other arm up and now hangs on the metal 
           tubing as if it’s a pull up bar. She uses all her strength to 
           pull herself up.

           As her forearms and biceps make a 90 degree angle, the wind 
           races downwards and SNAPS three out of the four suspensions.

           The portaledge SWINGS downwards, hanging on by one piece of 
           suspension.

           Luna hangs onto the corner of the portaledge as it dances in 
           the wind.

           The wind STOPS. 
                                 LUNA
                        Sloane!! Stephen!! Fucking help 
                        me!! Help!!

           Then, the biggest gust of wind yet SWINGS the portaledge so 
           far out that it’s nearly PERPENDICULAR to the wall.

           The portaledge reaches the peak of its outward movement, and 
           then races back towards the granite.

           Luna screams as she heads for the wall, unprotected.

           The wind rushes past her face as she SLAMS into the wall HEAD 
           FIRST and...

           RELEASES her grip from the metal tubing, FALLING into the 
           black abyss below.

           The metal tubing TAPS against the granite a few more times 
           gently as the wind calms.

           Sloane and Stephen’s portaledge remains STILL.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BASE OF MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           We stare ahead at the granite wall. Barely visible in the 
           night.

           Footsteps approach us from behind as Richard’s Shadow and 
           Sloane’s Shadow enter the frame.

           They walk to the base of the wall slowly and robotically. 
           They look up at the granite that towers over them.

           Richard’s Shadow looks down at Sloane’s Shadow.

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        That feeling in your stomach? That 
                        means you’re ready. Richard took 
                        years, but Sloane is ready now. 
                        Remember: she’s not in control. We 
                        are.

           Richard’s Shadow grabs two holds and hoists himself up. 
           Sloane’s Shadow follows.

           Their frail frames transform as they pull themselves onto the 
           rock face with NO ROPES. Both suddenly seem strong and agile 
           as they FREE SOLO up.
           Richard’s Shadow sprints up the wall at an inhuman speed, and 
           Sloane’s Shadow follows close behind.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PORTALEDGES - EARLY MORNING

           Luna’s portaledge looks like a crime scene. TORN suspensions, 
           RIPPED nylon, and traces of BLOOD on the metal tubing.

           Stephen opens his tent and sees Luna’s portaledge.

           He SCREAMS in horror as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PORTALEDGES - MORNING - LATER

           Stephen and Sloane embrace each other silently, crying. 

           Stephen grabs his head in pain.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ah! Fuck! Ah!

           Stephen holds both sides of his head.

                                 STEPHEN
                        My fucking head. It’s on fire. 

           Sloane holds Stephen’s hands.

                                 SLOANE
                        Something is trying to kill us. And 
                        it’s taking over our minds.

           Stephen rubs his temple and struggles to keep his eyes open. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        What the fuck is happening? 

                                 SLOANE
                        I don’t know...I don’t know...but 
                        we need to get off this fucking 
                        mountain.

           Stephen looks at Sloane desperately.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane...are we going to die?

           Sloane goes into survival mode. 
                                 SLOANE
                        No Stephen! We’re gonna make it to 
                        the top. We’re almost there baby.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m not gonna be able to do it...my 
                        head...

                                 SLOANE
                        Here’s what we’re gonna do. You’re 
                        gonna belay me from here. Can you 
                        do that?

           Stephen nods, wipes tears.

                                 SLOANE
                        Good. When I get to the top, I’m 
                        gonna build a z-pulley and pull you 
                        up. You won’t need to do anything. 
                        You’ll just need to strap in. Can 
                        you do that?

           Stephen starts to lose consciousness. Sloane grabs his 
           cheeks.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen. Baby. Stay here. Stay 
                        here.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I can’t see straight...

                                 SLOANE
                        You don’t need to see straight. You 
                        just need to belay me. Can you do 
                        that?

           Stephen rubs his head in pain.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ll try...

           Stephen’s eyes start to flutter again.

                                 SLOANE
                        Hey! Stay with me. 

           Stephen opens his eyes.

                                 SLOANE
                        You remember our third date in 
                        college? When you took me on that 
                        hike? And we crossed the river? You 
                        remember that?
           Stephen smiles at the memory.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah...

                                 SLOANE
                        What did you do when I fell in the 
                        river and got swept downstream?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I...I saved you.

                                 SLOANE
                        Yes! That’s right! You saved me. 
                        You were so brave.

           Sloane puts her hand on Stephen’s chest.

                                 SLOANE
                        I know that bravery is still inside 
                        you. I know you haven’t felt it in 
                        a long time, but it’s in there. Can 
                        you find that for me?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I can find that. I can find that...

           Stephen looks up at the remainder of the wall, intimidated.

                                 SLOANE
                        And Stephen...

           Stephen looks at Sloane.

                                 SLOANE
                        ...My answer is yes. 

           Stephen smiles through tears.

                                 SLOANE
                        I’m sorry that I stopped caring. 
                        That I stopped paying attention. 
                        And I don’t know why it took this 
                        shit to realize how much I love 
                        you. But it did. And now I see the 
                        answer so clearly. 

           Sloane kisses Stephen once more. Stephen hugs Sloane tightly.

                                 SLOANE
                        I can’t wait to be with you at the 
                        top.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ROCK LEGDE - MORNING

           Sloane’s Shadow and Richard’s Shadow climb onto the ledge 
           where Sloane, Stephen, Mia, and Luna camped. 

           Sloane’s Shadow shakes out her muscles.

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        How’re you feeling?

           Sloane’s Shadow gives Richard’s Shadow the thumbs up.

                                 SLOANE’S SHADOW
                        Let’s keep moving.

           They both walk to the wall and continue up at inhuman speeds.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROCK FACE - MORNING - LATER

           Sloane ascends the rock face. She is about 50 feet above 
           Stephen.

                                 SLOANE
                        You ok baby?

           Stephen gives Sloane the thumbs up. Something then catches 
           Stephen’s attention.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sloane! Something’s on your left!

           Sloane looks to her left. About five feet away is a BLACK 
           SNAKE, slithering on a small ridge just above her hand. 
           Sloane reaches for her hunting knife.

           The snake lifts its head off the ridge and moves in the 
           direction of Sloane, HISSING.

           Sloane grips her hunting knife, SWINGS it across her chest, 
           and SLICES the snake’s head CLEAN OFF.

           Snake blood SPRAYS onto her face and shirt. She closes her 
           mouth and eyes to avoid the shower. 

           The snake head falls below. Sloane grabs the remaining body 
           of the snake and flings it off the rock wall letting out a 
           cathartic scream.

                                 SLOANE
                        Go fuck yourself!
           Sloane looks around the rock face wildly, amped up.

                                 SLOANE
                        What else?! I’ll fucking kill you!

           ON STEPHEN:

                                 STEPHEN
                        What the fuck?

           Stephen struggles to make sense of what’s happening as five 
           feet of bloody, headless snake falls right behind him.

           Stephen is sprayed with snake blood. He wipes his face with 
           his shirt and dry heaves a few times.

                                 STEPHEN
                             (Trailing,)
                        What is happening...?

           Stephen’s eyes start to flutter again.

           Sloane yells from above.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stay with me Stephen! Don’t pass 
                        out on me! Stay with me!

                                 STEPHEN
                             (Trailing,)
                        I’m so tired...

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen! Stay with me!

           Sloane’s voice drowns out, as Stephen looks at the rock wall. 
           He smiles and touches it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        So soft...

           A 4 inch CRACK suddenly OPENS right in front of him.

                                 MOUNTAIN
                        Come resttttt.

           Stephen sticks one of his arms into the crack. He PRESSES his 
           body against the rock face.

           Stephen’s eyes begin to close when...

           He is HIT with a few tiny pieces of granite from above and he 
           hears a low RUMBLING.
           The two sides of the crack CLOSE together again.

           Stephen’s arm is CRUSHED. We hear the bones in his forearm 
           BREAK under the immense pressure of the granite.

           Through tears, Stephen SCREAMS in unimaginable pain.

           Then, the mountain RELEASES his arm. His limp arm is 
           SHREDDED, BLOODY, and BROKEN.

           Stephen looks at his mangled arm and passes out in a state of 
           shock.

           ON SLOANE:

           Sloane sees Stephen below swaying in the wind, unconscious.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen! Oh my god. Stephen! I’m 
                        coming down!

           Sloane starts to descend.

           ON STEPHEN:

           Stephen is still unconscious when we hear the granite begin 
           to separate again. Tiny pieces of rock fall from above, and 
           the crack reveals itself.

           This time, the crack is about 3 feet wide and has a perfect 
           ledge to sit on within it.

                                 MOUNTAIN
                        Come insideeeee.

           Stephen comes to, but seems utterly confused and disoriented. 
           He grabs his throbbing arm in pain and starts to cry.

           Then he sees the MOUNTAIN SEAT right in front of him.

           Stephen’s body is pulled towards the seat as if he’s a 
           magnet. Stephen sits in the seat, and leans his back against 
           the wall of the dark crack.

           ON SLOANE:

           Sloane descends carefully. She can no longer see Stephen.

                                 SLOANE
                        Stephen! Stephen! Where are you!?
           Sloane quickens her pace downwards.

           ON STEPHEN:

           Stephen falls asleep in the crack. The crack darkens and we 
           can hardly see him.

           Tiny bits of rock begin to fall from above, followed by a 
           loud rumbling again.

           The sides of the crack start to CLOSE IN on Stephen.

           Stephen continues to sleep as...

           The wall CRUSHES his entire body. We hear his body BREAK in 
           hundreds of different places.

           Stephen disappears into the rock wall as the crack closes 
           completely.

           ON SLOANE:

           The rock face SHAKES as the crack closes - it’s a VERTICAL 
           EARTHQUAKE. 

           Tiny pieces of rock rain down on Sloane’s head.

           ECU: Sloane GRIPS two holds with all her strength. 

           The SHAKING finally stops.

           Sloane manages to stay on the wall. 

           We FOLLOW a small piece of rock as it falls down the granite 
           wall.

           After a few seconds the rock collides with a SHOULDER.

           We pull back to see Richard’s Shadow and Sloane’s Shadow 
           climbing at breakneck speeds, quickly gaining on Sloane.

           BACK ON SLOANE:

           Sloane cries and hugs the still wall, trying to catch her 
           breath.

           There is a TUG on her harness.

           She looks down and sees that the rope that connected her to 
           Stephen is being PULLED into the mountain.
           As the rope is swallowed up by the mountain, the TUG 
           intensifies.

           The rope PULLS Sloane outwards and down. She quickly grabs 
           her hunting knife and SLICES the rope.

           Sloane stops getting pulled into the mountain. She brings her 
           hand back up to a hold and has four points of contact on the 
           wall again.

           She takes a moment to catch her breath. She looks down at the 
           meadow below, at her torn rope, and at an absent Stephen.

           In that moment, she realizes that she is...

           FREE SOLOING, ALONE, 1300 FEET UP A GRANITE WALL.

           She looks up. 100 feet left.

           Sloane looks down again. Bad idea. She hyperventilates. Her 
           palms moisten and her grip starts to loosen.

           She wipes each hand on her pants then reapplies chalk.

                                 SLOANE
                        Don’t panic. Breathe. Think about 
                        it in steps. You’re not going to 
                        die today...not today. 

           This moment is interrupted by a WHITE EAGLE that lands on a 
           branch nearby that sticks out of the rock face.

           The eagle looks at Sloane.

                                 SLOANE
                        Hi.

           A moment of peace.

           The eagle then takes off. It flies up to the top of the rock 
           face within seconds. 

           Sloane enviously watches it glide up to the top effortlessly.

                                 SLOANE
                        I’ll see you soon...

           ON RICHARD’S SHADOW / SLOANE’S SHADOW: 

           Richard’s Shadow looks up and sees Sloane.

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        There she is...
           Sloane’s Shadow looks up and for the first time smiles.

           The two quicken their pace towards Sloane.

           ON SLOANE:

           The granite darkens and cools as clouds roll in. The wind 
           picks up and the temperature falls precipitously. 

           Sloane looks up at the dark clouds.

                                 SLOANE
                        I’ve gotta fucking move.

           Sloane continues her ascent to the top. 

           She studies each hold before gripping it. She is methodical 
           and precise in her movements.

           Sloane grips a piece of granite. She senses its rotten. She 
           massages her fingers into it and puts some pressure on it.

           It BREAKS right off the wall. She knew it.

           She reaches to a more stable hold and continues up. 

           Sloane finds a slight CRACK and rests. She moves her body in 
           different directions, attempting to relieve pressure from her 
           battered limbs.

           Sloane’s forearms are SWOLLEN, her fingers are covered in 
           DRIED BLOOD and TORN SKIN, and her right climbing shoe has 
           blood stains on it from a CUT on her leg.

           We now look at Sloane from above as she rests on the rock 
           face.

           While Sloane has not yet seen them, we see Richard’s Shadow 
           and Sloane’s Shadow gaining on her. 

           Sloane takes a few deep breaths and continues up. The meadow 
           and forest below are just specks in the distance.

           She expertly grabs the holds ahead and glides up the rock 
           face. 

           With 65 feet to go, Sloane stops again. She holds her head in 
           pain.

                                 SLOANE
                        Ahh! Fuck!

           She massages her temple.
                                 SLOANE
                        You’re fine. You’re fine. You’re 
                        fine...

           Then, from within the rock, she hears...

                                 MOUNTAIN
                        Where’s Stephennnnn?

           Sloane shakes her head, tries to ignore it.

                                 SLOANE
                        It’s in your fucking head!

           The rock face RUMBLES and SHAKES again. Sloane grips the 
           holds and looks down to see...

           STEPHEN’S BODY get LAUNCHED from within the rock face. 

           His body goes FLYING OUTWARDS and DOWN into the meadow below.

           The mountain laughs. The laughter seems to come from all 
           around Sloane. 

           Sloane watches Stephen’s body fall. She VOMITS in between her 
           legs, the last of her nutrients. She wipes her mouth and 
           cries. 

                                 SLOANE
                             (Through tears,)
                        Stephen...I’m so sorry...I’m so 
                        sorry...

           As Sloane watches her vomit drip down the rock face she sees 
           them...

           Richard’s Shadow now within 15 feet.

           Sloane’s Shadow 20 feet behind him. 

           Sloane screams in horror. She stares closely at Richard’s 
           Shadow. Is that him?

                                 RICHARD’S SHADOW
                        Sloaney...

           It’s him...or some version of him. Her worst nightmare is 
           happening.

           Richard’s Shadow is now 10 feet from Sloane’s legs.

           Sloane turns to the wall and reaches up, but he is moving too 
           quickly.
           Richard’s Shadow is now 5 feet below her.

           Sloane stares at him in shock and deep confusion

                                 SLOANE
                        It’s in your head...you’re not your 
                        Dad...it’s in your head...

           Then Sloane feels him PULL DOWN on her leg...

           It’s real.

           Adrenaline pumps through Sloane’s veins as she grips her 
           holds even tighter. 

           Richard’s Shadow pulls down on her leg harder.

                                 SLOANE
                        No!!

           Sloane feels her grip slipping. She channels all her strength 
           and KICKS Richard’s Shadow with her other foot.

           His grip on her leg loosens, giving Sloane a short window to 
           kick him again.

           She drives her foot down into his face. We hear the bones in 
           his nose BREAK as Sloane makes contact.

           Richard’s Shadow releases his grip from Sloane’s leg and 
           falls off the rock face down to the meadow below.

           We are back in the opening scene and now realize that the 
           falling body was Richard’s Shadow. 

           We watch his long, mangled hair dance wildly in the wind as 
           he falls. A silhouette in the darkening night.

           We follow him down, and this time, we see his body explode on 
           the forest floor.

           His arms and legs lie on the ground at nauseating angles, 
           blood is splattered all over the granite wall behind him, and 
           his wet hair rests over his face.

           ON SLOANE:

           Sloane holds back tears as she sees Sloane’s Shadow gaining 
           on her quickly. 

           There is no time to make sense of it. She needs to keep 
           moving.

           Sloane analyzes the path ahead and continues up.
           After about 10 feet, her left foot SLIPS. She presses her 
           body against the wall.

           Sloane looks up. 25 feet left.

           Sloane looks down. Sloane’s Shadow is only 15 feet behind.

           She feels a drop of liquid on her shoulder. She turns to look 
           at the dark clouds that cover the sun.

                                 SLOANE
                        Rain. Fuck.

           Sloane feels another drop on her arm.

           She looks down. It’s not rain. It’s BLOOD.

           She looks up to see...

           An AVALANCHE of BLOOD pouring down the rock face.

           The BLOOD snakes its way down the crevices and cracks.

           Sloane closes her eyes and grips the holds, bracing for 
           impact.

           The BLOOD showers Sloane. It sounds like she’s caught in the 
           middle of a CRASHING WAVE.

           It finally STOPS. 

           Silence. 

           Sloane is COVERED in blood. She opens her eyes. The whites of 
           her eyes shine brightly against the dark red that covers her 
           body.

           Sloane YELLS up to the top of the mountain.

                                 SLOANE
                        Fuck you!! Fuck you!!

           Sloane’s Shadow, also covered in blood, is now only 10 feet 
           behind Sloane.

           Sloane quickly dries her hands on the inside of her shirt.

           She carefully and efficiently grabs each hold, avoiding the 
           bloody wet spots as she moves up.

           Sloane’s exhausted legs wobble with every movement. She 
           gathers all her strength to keep moving. 

           Sloane yells down to Sloane’s Shadow.
                                 SLOANE
                        What the fuck do you want from me?!

           Sloane’s Shadow stares at Sloane in a trance and continues 
           moving towards her.

           Sloane turns to look up and cannot believe it. 10 feet left.

                                 SLOANE
                        C’mon! C’mon!

           Sloane reaches for a hold 6 inches too far. She misses the 
           hold and her feet SLIP.

           She quickly readjusts. Safe again... 

           But Sloane’s Shadow is now only 5 feet behind.

                                 SLOANE
                        Don’t fuck it up now.

           8 feet left. Then she sees it.

           The last thing she wants to see.

           8 feet of FEATURELESS ROCK ahead. 

           Nothing to grip onto. No holds.

                                 SLOANE
                        Fuck!!

           Sloane inspects the rock wall, searching for the solution. 

           To her left, more FEATURELESS ROCK. 

           She looks to her right. She sees it. 

           4 feet away, there is an 8 foot stretch to the top filled 
           with holds.

           But there’s one problem... 

           The 4 feet to her right is more sickening featureless rock.

           Sloane is TRAPPED. 

           Sloane’s Shadow is now only 2 feet behind Sloane.

           There’s only one way out of this...

           Sloane needs to DYNO...NOW.
           A climbing move in which the climber performs an all-points-
           off jump from one set of holds to another set of holds.

           For a moment in time, her entire body will be off the wall as 
           she jumps 4 feet horizontally, with 1392 feet of granite 
           below.

           Sloane gets in position.

           She closes her eyes.

           Quick Flash: Richard hoists Younger Sloane onto the base of a 
           wall.

           Quick Flash: Richard and Younger Sloane sit on the edge of a 
           ledge, eating peanut M&Ms, laughing as the sun sets.

           Quick Flash: Richard drives Younger Sloane in his Ford F-250 
           Pick Up, and they sing along to the music.

           Quick Flash: Richard robotically walks into a house, head 
           down, clothes filthy. Sloane and her Mother run up to him and 
           hug him in a panic. He does not look up at them.

           Quick Flash: Richard sits across from a psychiatrist in a 
           white coat. 

           Quick Flash: The Psychiatrist speaks to Sloane and her 
           Mother. Both of them fight back tears.

           Quick Flash: Richard looks down at Younger Sloane.

                                 RICHARD
                        You control as much as you can. You 
                        prepare as much as you can. You 
                        practice as much as you can. That’s 
                        all you can do. That’ll give you 
                        the strength to punch any fear you 
                        have right in the nose.

           Sloane opens her eyes...

           As Sloane’s Shadow reaches for Sloane’s leg, Sloane PUSHES 
           off the wall and LAUNCHES herself to the right.

           She is AIRBORNE. Sloane’s Shadow watches.

           The meadow and forest wait to consume Sloane below.

           Sloane clears the four feet of featureless rock and STICKS 
           out her hands to catch the HOLDS.

           She MISSES the first one with her right hand.
           She CATCHES the second one with her left hand.

           The momentum of the jump sends her legs SWINGING to the 
           right.

           Her legs SWING back down like a pendulum. 

           She GRIPS the second hold with her right hand.

           But the FORCE of her swinging legs is too much to bear.

           Her hands SLIP...

           She FALLS. 

           Sloane closes her eyes, stretches out her arms, and accepts 
           her fate as she drops down from the sky...

           Then...

           She STOPS falling...

           And BOUNCES up.

           She looks down at her harness and sees a ROPE attached.

           She follows the rope up to the top of the mountain to find...

           RICHARD, belaying her from above. Young, healthy Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        Almost there Sloaney!

           Sloane, speechless, SWINGS back to the wall.

           8 feet of holds left.

           She CRIES and SCREAMS as she moves up each hold towards her 
           father.

           Sloane’s Shadow DYNOs after Sloane and lands the jump 
           perfectly. She is now inches behind Sloane.

           Sloane has 2 feet left.

           Sloane reaches towards the final hold.

           Sloane’s Shadow reaches up and grabs Sloane’s leg, but Sloane 
           is pulled out of her Shadow’s grip as...

           Richard stretches his hand down, grabs Sloane, and PULLS her 
           up.
           Sloane crawls onto the horizontal surface and hugs the 
           ground. 

           Her vertical nightmare is over.

           She lies on her back, and through tears, blood, and 
           astonishment, yells into the sky.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        I’m so proud of you.

           Sloane, through blurred vision, looks up to see Richard 
           smiling.

           Richard reaches down and lifts Sloane to her feet. Richard 
           wears a climbing harness, climbing shoes, and a helmet.

           Sloane looks at her father, touches his face.

                                 SLOANE
                        Dad!

           Sloane hugs him and cries.

                                 SLOANE
                        I missed you.

                                 RICHARD
                        I missed you too, Sloaney. 

           We watch this embrace until we hear a GRUNT behind them.

           Sloane turns around to see Sloane’s Shadow hoisting herself 
           up onto the top of the mountain.

           Sloane’s Shadow stands and stares at Sloane. Both look 
           exactly the same at this point, completely covered in blood 
           and dirt.

                                 SLOANE
                        What the fuck do you want from me?!

           Sloane reaches deep into her energy reserves and charges 
           towards her Shadow, who stands at the edge of the mountain.

                                 SLOANE
                        What do you want?! Who the fuck are 
                        you?!

           Sloane’s Shadow stares silently as Sloane approaches her 
           aggressively.

           Sloane now stands one inch from her Shadow. Sloane looks into 
           her Shadow’s empty, black eyes.
                                 SLOANE
                        Who are you?!

           Sloane SHOVES her Shadow backwards towards the edge.

           Sloane’s Shadow easily regains her footing and charges back 
           at Sloane.

           Sloane’s Shadow TACKLES Sloane to the ground. The back of 
           Sloane’s head lands on the ground with a THUD.

           Sloane’s Shadow puts her hands around Sloane’s neck and 
           begins to squeeze.

           Sloane uses all of her strength to drive both of her knees 
           simultaneously into her Shadow’s back.

           Her Shadow’s grip momentarily loosens, giving Sloane an 
           opportunity to flip her Shadow over.

           Sloane is now on top of her Shadow and strangles her.

                                 SLOANE
                        What do you want?!

           For the first time, Sloane’s Shadow opens her mouth to speak, 
           but no words get through her constricted vocal chords. 

                                 SLOANE
                        What did you say?!

           Sloane slightly loosens her grip on her Shadow’s neck.

           Sloane’s Shadow opens her mouth to speak...

                                 SLOANE’S SHADOW
                        Stop fighting me...Let me in...

           Sloane squeezes her neck harder.

                                 SLOANE’S SHADOW
                        Don’t be afraid...

           Sloane notices writing stitched into the bottom of her 
           Shadow’s shirt, barely noticeable. It reads: Fairview 
           Psychiatric.

                                 SLOANE
                        Who are you!?

           Beat, as Sloane’s Shadow smiles slightly.

                                 SLOANE’S SHADOW
                        I’m you...
           Sloane tightens her grip and YELLS into her Shadow’s face.

                                 SLOANE
                        You’re not me!!

           Sloane’s Shadow uses both arms to shove Sloane off with all 
           of her force.

                                 SLOANE’S SHADOW
                        You can’t run away from me any 
                        longer...

           Sloane’s Shadow is now on top of Sloane.

                                 SLOANE’S SHADOW
                        You’re just like Dad. He fought so 
                        hard...

           Sloane stops fighting. She looks into her Shadow’s black 
           eyes. Desperate for an answer. 

                                 SLOANE
                        What did Dad see?

           Sloane’s Shadow smiles. Her eyes grow even darker.

                                 SLOANE’S SHADOW
                        Himself...

           Sloane yells and flips her Shadow over. The two wrestle and 
           roll around on the edge of the mountain.

           Sloane’s Shadow uses her legs to flip Sloane over her own 
           body.

           Sloane lands on the ground with a bone crunching THUD. She 
           passes out.

           Sloane’s Shadow stands up, picks Sloane up, and throws her 
           over her shoulder. 

           She walks to an area that is surrounded by 30 upside down 
           tree roots arranged in a perfect circle. The roots stick out 
           of the ground and their trunks extend downwards into the 
           ground.

           EXT. CIRCLE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS

           Sloane’s Shadow reaches the center of the circle of trees.

           In the center is an OPERATING TABLE. 
           Sloane’s Shadow throws the unconscious Sloane onto the 
           operating table. There is a set of surgical tools and a 
           surgical mask next to it.

           Sloane’s Shadow puts on the surgical mask and picks up a pair 
           of SCISSORS. She cuts through the center of Sloane’s shirt. 

           She then reaches for a scalpel. She positions the scalpel 
           just beneath Sloane’s neck.

           Sloane’s Shadow makes an INCISION in Sloane’s upper chest, 
           and guides the scalpel down to Sloane’s lower stomach, 
           creating an 18 inch incision down her torso.

           Sloane’s Shadow grabs both sides of this newly formed 
           incision and pulls them apart in opposite directions. Her 
           body blocks our view of what we presume are Sloane’s insides.

           Sloane’s Shadow climbs onto the operating table with Sloane. 
           She sticks her head into the open incision. Her head 
           disappears INSIDE of Sloane.

           Then her arms disappear, then her torso, then her hips, then 
           her legs, and then her feet get sucked into Sloane’s body. 

           We watch the two sides of the incision move back towards each 
           other on their own like magnets. 

           The incision closes. The skin from either side stretches on 
           its own over the wound.

           The wound disappears. We watch Sloane’s chest move up and 
           down again with every breath.

           Sloane finally coughs. She shoots up from the operating 
           table. 

           She feels her chest. It’s fine.

           She feels underneath her. She is lying on the stone ground 
           again.

           The circle of trees have disappeared. 

           Sloane’s Shadow is gone.

           Sloane yells into the sky. Primal. From the deepest places 
           within herself. 

           Sloane hears something move nearby. She turns around.

           Standing a few feet away is...

           Her Younger Self. Staring at her with a huge smile.
           Next to her Younger Self is the young and healthy Richard who 
           pulled Sloane to the top.

           Richard and her Younger Self wave goodbye and turn to the 
           forest.

           They walk into the distance holding hands.

           Sloane watches them walk away. A time she will never get 
           back.

           Sloane cries more. She curls up into the fetal position. Her 
           eyes flutter. Her body shuts down. She passes out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           OVER BLACK

           ...the sound of a HELICOPTER.

           EXT. TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

           Sloane opens her eyes, and through blurred vision, she sees a 
           white, gold, and blue helicopter with the California Highway 
           Patrol insignia pasted on its tail.

           Two EMTs jump out of the helicopter with a spinal board. They 
           run up to Sloane.

           Just as they reach Sloane, she passes out again...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Sloane wakes up in a hospital bed.

           She starts to sit up when she feels an excruciating pain in 
           her stomach.

           She lies back down and stares up at the ceiling.

                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        Sloane!

           Stephen enters, holding a bag of peanut M&Ms.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Here baby. Thought you could use 
                        some of these.
           Sloane looks up at Stephen. Her eyes tear up and she smiles.

           We are on Sloane’s face. 

                                 SLOANE
                        I don’t think I’ve ever appreciated 
                        you more than I do right now...

           Sloane reaches up to touch Stephen’s face when we hear...

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Where’d you get those from?

           Sloane looks away from Stephen and towards the NURSE (60).

           The Nurse looks down at the bag of Peanut M&Ms.

           Sloane turns back to Stephen...

           He’s gone.

                                 NURSE
                        Anyone ever tell you that you look 
                        just like your father?

           Sloane looks up at the Nurse, deeply confused.

           Sloane looks down at her body and realizes she’s wearing all 
           white. She looks closely at her shirt, which has writing 
           stitched into it: Fairview Psychiatric. 

           Sloane looks up at the Nurse again. She tries to speak but 
           can’t get the words out.

                                 NURSE ELLEN
                        You’ve gotta rest Sloane. I’ll be 
                        back in 30 minutes to check up on 
                        you.

           Sloane watches the Nurse exit. She starts to breathe quickly, 
           panicked. She looks around the room, eyes wild.

           She moves her arms up...

           But she feels resistance...

           She pulls her arms up harder. They’re stuck.

           She looks down...

           Her wrists are tied to the hospital bed by LEATHER STRAPS.

           Then we hear a BANG. BANG. BANG. from the window.
           Sloane turns towards the window. In the distance is Lytta’s 
           Peak. It looks majestic in the bright sun.

           The peak now seems to be moving slowly towards us and the 
           noises of the room intensify.

           Sloane opens her mouth to scream and we...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
