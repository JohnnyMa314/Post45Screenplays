                               October 2019
           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jacksboro, Texas. Population 1,311. A neglected old family 
           home. Looks like a family lived here twenty years ago, but no 
           longer does. 

           ESTEE, 30’s, is what is locally referred to as a LIFER, aka a 
           woman who never left her pathetic hometown and whose wasted 
           potential has made a home atop her shoulders like a ton of 
           bricks. 

           She is currently avoiding her existential woes by baking 
           complicated SOURDOUGH RYE BREAD in her kitchen. 

           She looks small in the big empty house, like a child whose 
           parents never came back home. She wears an old pajama dress 
           full of holes from years of use.

           She places all the baking ingredients on the table, and 
           starts bringing them to life like a mad conductor. Flour, 
           yeast, sugar, eggs -- a congregation of disparate materials, 
           manipulated into one cohesive, smooth, harmonious ball of 
           dough in her skilled hands. (AND YES THIS IS A METAPHOR FOR 
           LATER, THANKS FOR ASKING.) 

           She puts her full arm strength into it, exorcising her demons 
           into the dough. (They say the demons make it rise faster.) 

           She dumps the dough into a bowl, puts a wet towel over it to 
           let it rise. Finished, she slumps into a chair and chugs from 
           a bottle of bourbon. Just a casual low-key small sip. Then 
           another. Then another. Then another. 

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Estee lies spread out in bed, drunk. Her sheets look 
           childish, like she’s been using them since she was a teen. 
           She drunkenly sings loudly to no one, her song of choice is 
           “Silly Love Song” by Wings/Paul McCartney, but instead of 
           singing -

           “IIIIIII Llllllllove Yooooooooou,” 

           she sings “Fuuuuuuuck myyyyyyy liiiiiiife.” 

           Over and over and over again. Then, mid-sentence, she falls 
           asleep.
           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN

           A hungover Estee, barely standing, pops multiple pieces of 
           dough into the oven, sets a timer, squints at the sun rising 
           outside her window. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Jacksboro, Texas. Population 1,311. Well, 1,304 after that 
           mass shooting in the diner. Technically 1,305 if that old man 
           who took two in the knee pulls through. Don’t feel too bad 
           for him though, he was the shooter. 

           Estee, carrying a bag of freshly baked bread, walks down Main 
           Street - a crumbling, impoverished commercial street, trash 
           everywhere, half the stores boarded up, graffiti full of hate 
           and slurs. Surely this was a quaint town once upon a time. 
           Maybe in the 70’s. 

           She walks by a neglected park. A sad sign reads “Davy 
           Crockett Park, Est. 1925” Grass gone yellow, asphalt cracked. 
           Broken benches. Hate graffiti everywhere. Trash everywhere. 

           In the distance, an old rusty sign for “PIGGLY WIGGLY 
           SUPERMARKET” falls off its hinges and crashes to the ground 
           with a loud THUD. Estee doesn’t even blink as she keeps on 
           walking.

           She passes by an old dilapidated house. On the porch, in a 
           rocking chair, A RIFLE across his lap, sits DOOMSDAY STEVE, 
           50’s, a pessimistic, possibly mentally unstable man. He calls 
           out to Estee as she walks past. 

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        Why bother? Nothing matters. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (fake cheer)
                        Good morning Mr. Aitken!

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        Twenty years tops before the world 
                        ends. Your capitalist greed, your 
                        vacant souls and your screens got 
                        us here. It’s irreversible. The 
                        damage. It’s all ending.

                                 ESTEE
                        If it’s all ending, maybe you 
                        should go have a donut?

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        THE DONUT IS THE PROBLEM! 
                                 ESTEE
                        Like the metaphorical donut or the 
                        literal donut...?

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        All kindsa people coming to take 
                        what’s mine. And it’s only gonna 
                        get worse the less there is to go 
                        around. So I’mma be right here. 
                        Guarding what’s mine. So no one can 
                        take it. So no. I don’t want a 
                        freakin’ donut. 

                                 ESTEE
                        OK Mr. Aitken, have a good one! 

           She picks up the pace, regretting her daily engagements with 
           this man. Up ahead she sees a CROWD GATHERED, mostly MEN, 
           outside a --

           PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC

           A “JESUS LOVES YOU” billboard peeks ominously behind the 
           building.

           Estee rolls her eyes as she walks past. The crowd screams and 
           purposely invades the space of TWO TEENAGE GIRLS, frightened, 
           holding hands. 

           The crowd’s leader, KENNY, 30’s, gets in the girls faces, 
           repeatedly screaming --

                                 KENNY
                        MURDER!!!! MURDER!!!!! 

           The others join in. “MURDER!!! MURDER!!! LIFE STARTS AT 
           CONCEPTION! LIFE STARTS AT CONCEPTION!” 

           They girls meekly navigate their way through the crowd, 
           getting pushed, prodded and name-called all along the way. An 
           exhausted NURSE, 40’s, quickly opens the front door of the 
           clinic and ushers them inside, locking the door behind her 
           like she’s warding off a zombie attack, which in some ways, 
           she is. 

           Estee watches all this and her blood boils. She gets in 
           Kenny’s face. He cracks a shit eating grin. 

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh. Here comes the spinster 
                        feminazi brigade.
                                 ESTEE
                        For fuck’s sake, Kenny, you 
                        colossal fucking hypocrite. You 
                        single handedly kept this place in 
                        business fifteen years ago. 
                        (at his crowd of 
                         followers)
                        Did you know he knocked up every 
                        girl in my class? He’d be here 
                        twice a week. I swear, he had a 
                        membership. Like one of those 
                        sandwich shop punch-in cards. “Buy 
                        seven, get one free.” 

                                 KENNY
                        (defensive, at crowd)
                        Yeah... well... that was a long 
                        time ago. It was my former self. My 
                        base self. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh yeah? Did you evolve?

                                 KENNY
                        Sure did. Jesus came to me. In the 
                        shower. Showed me the way. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Wow. OK. Gross. But OK. Don’t you 
                        people have... I dunno, just 
                        spitballing here... jobs to go to?

                                 KENNY
                        Not since you libtards shut down 
                        the plant. Now we got jack shit. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Well. I’m glad you’re spending your 
                        time wisely. 

                                 KENNY
                        I’m saving lives. What the fuck are 
                        you doing with your life? 

                                 ESTEE
                        Fuck you.

                                 KENNY
                        You wish.

           Estee walks off, giving him the finger. He gives her the 
           finger back. Then he turns his attention back to the task at 
           hand. Screaming “MURDERERS!!!” at crying girls.  
           INT. BAKERY - MINUTES LATER

           Estee enters her workplace, a MOM AND POP BAKERY that looks 
           like it’s been handed down for generations, everything old 
           fashioned, quaint and bright. An assortment of colorful cakes 
           in the fridge up front, freshly baked breads propped up 
           against the back wall. 

           The owner, MR. SHELBY, 60’s, tired, friendly, old school, 
           arranges desserts behind the counter. 

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        Mornin’ Estee. 
                        (at her bread)
                        Uh oh. What did the mad scientist 
                        make this time?

                                 ESTEE
                        Rye Sourdough. Just a few. 

                                 MR. SHELBY 
                        You know nobody wants that funky 
                        granola stuff round here. 
                        (purses his lips 
                         comically)
                        That sourdough makes the face 
                        pucker up. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Yeah well. Maybe today they’ll want 
                        it, huh?

           Mr. Shelby shrugs. A beat. He smiles. 

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        Go on then. Put’em up there.
                        (under his breath)
                        They won’t. 

           He’s right. They won’t. But he knows if she doesn’t feel like 
           she’s making even the slightest bit of difference in this 
           world, some day she just won’t show up for work, and they’ll 
           find her at home, dead. 

           She smiles, grateful for his support. She puts on her apron 
           and props her breads up along with the standard plain baked 
           goods, the kind that do sell. 

           DING. The door opens. In walk COLIN and RON, 30’s, a handsome 
           couple, they look like big city people on a nightmare 
           vacation in the boonies. Reading the room, Colin quickly 
           takes a few steps away from Ron. 
                                 COLIN
                        Morning. We’d like to place an 
                        order.

           Mr. Shelby takes them in, then quickly looks down at the 
           baked goods he’s sorting. He never makes eye contact with 
           them again.

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        Sorry, gentlemen, if I could point 
                        you in the direction of that sign 
                        on the door. 

           Colin, wary, looks at the door. 

                                 COLIN
                        “Sweet Dreams Are Made of Cheese”?

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        No, underneath it.

                                 RON
                        “Once you lick the frosting off a 
                        cupcake it’s a muffin, and muffins 
                        are healthy”?

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        No, Christ, to the right. By the 
                        Jesus poster.

           Colin looks at the Jesus poster. It says “YOU ARE ALL EQUAL 
           IN THE EYES OF THE LORD.” He squints until he sees a smaller 
           sign underneath it. 

                                 COLIN
                        “We reserve the right to serve or 
                        not serve anyone we see or don’t 
                        see fit to serve or not serve.” 

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

           Estee dies of embarrassment. Colin rolls his eyes at Ron. 

                                 COLIN
                        I told you, bitch. 

           Ron just laughs. 

                                 RON
                        Well. I wanted to experience your 
                        third world shithole backwards 
                        childhood slumtown for myself. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RON (CONT'D)
                        And now I have. So I am very 
                        satisfied. Five stars on Yelp. 

           Without another word, they leave the store. 

           Estee stares at Mr. Shelby, fuming. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Really?

           He pretends he didn’t hear her, continues his work. She 
           stares at him for a long beat. Finally, she throws her apron 
           down-

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking five.

           She runs out. 

           EXT. BAKERY - CONT’D

           She sees Ron and Colin a block ahead.

                                 RON
                        I need to shove five sloppy 
                        cheeseburgers into my face hole 
                        right this second to palate cleanse 
                        this entire day. 

                                 COLIN
                        Get me eight. 

            They kiss and part ways. A beat. Estee runs after Colin. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Hey. HEY! 

           Colin turns around. 

                                 COLIN
                        What now? 
                        (puts his wrists forward)
                        You wanna arrest me?

                                 ESTEE
                        Come here for a second.

                        What were you gonna order back 
                        there?
                                 COLIN
                        A cake. It’s not even a fucking 
                        wedding cake. It’s for my mom’s 
                        retirement party. 

                                 ESTEE
                        I’ll bake it for you. Free of 
                        charge. When do you need it?

           Colin scrutinizes her... Why is she offering? Is she hitting 
           on him? She knows he’s gay, right?

                                 COLIN
                        (suspicious)
                        Tomorrow. Why are you doing this? 
                        You know I’m... 

           She just stares.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        You know there’s no... 

           She just stares. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Like, I’m.. I’m with a man.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh no! I’m not hitting on you. 
                        Though I totally would. I mean 
                        damn. No, I just... I want to help 
                        because I’m ashamed I live here and 
                        I want to make it better, OK?

                                 COLIN
                        OK. Thank you. Thanks. I appreciate 
                        it.

           He takes out a pack of smokes. They’re old school menthols, 
           like we smoked when we were teens. He lights a cigarette. 
           Offers her one. She takes it. They smoke together. She coughs 
           and chokes but plays it off like it’s totally cool. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ I forgot what a 
                        shithole this town is. I can’t 
                        believe I’m smoking menthols. If my 
                        boyfriend finds out he’ll legit 
                        murder me. I haven’t smoked in 
                        decades. Only when I visit here. I 
                        regress to some powerless teenage 
                        wet blanket version of myself.

                        I’m just here for the weekend 
                        though, thank Christ. Shit, I feel 
                        so bad for the miserable fucks who 
                        never left. The lifers. THE LIFERS. 
                        I mean... Can you imagine? If THIS 
                        was your entire world? FOREVER?

           Estee dies just a little bit. 

                                 ESTEE
                        You know, I remember you from high 
                        school. 

                                 COLIN
                        Oh shit no way, we went at the same 
                        time?!

                                 ESTEE
                        Yeah. I was the one with the hair.
                        (gesturing... something)
                        Estee.

           A beat. He doesn’t remember her at all, his memory bank 
           filled to capacity with the much more exciting rich life he’s 
           lived since he left this town. But knows he has to say 
           something.

                                 COLIN
                        Oh yeah totally. Estee. You were...
                        (scrambling)
                        “Most likely to”, uh... um... 

                                 ESTEE
                        No, I wasn’t actually. I never got 
                        one of those.

           Estee dies some more. 

           Colin does the math. Realizes she’s one of those lifers he 
           just ruthlessly trash talked. Damage control time.

                                 COLIN
                        I mean. This town isn’t all bad. 
                        It’s got... charm. It’s got that 
                        lake, right? Quaint AF.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh yeah totally. It’s like one of 
                        those hidden charm things. Really 
                        really really hidden charms. I 
                        would have totally left too, but, 
                        you know... I have this autoimmune 
                        skin condition thing.

                        I’ve been busy, and--

                                 COLIN
                        Oh totally. Girl, I get it. Hey, 
                        home is where you make it. And the 
                        world’s dying anyways. We got 
                        twenty years tops. So... Nothing 
                        matters. Right?

                        Right. So... Cake... tomorrow at

                                 COLIN
                        Great. Thanks, Estee. Thanks for 
                        holding it down here. 

           She smiles a pained smile and watches him walk off. 

           INT. BAKERY - EVENING

           Estee and Mr. Shelby work in tense silence. It’s the end of 
           the workday. Estee sadly eyes the bread wall. All her funky 
           granola rye sourdoughs are still displayed on the shelf. No 
           one here wants them. No one here sees their beauty. And no 
           one here ever will. 

           She throws them into the trash, takes her apron off. 

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        Maybe tomorrow. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - SUNSET

           Estee walks down Main Street. At the corner, she spots a NEW 
           STORE, “GRAND OPENING” sign out front. She looks closer. It’s 
           a MEDICAL MARIJUANA STORE. She snorts.

                                 ESTEE
                        Pfft. Good luck. 

           A beautiful, buttoned up, ex-cheerleader perfectionist 
           wholesome Christian woman in too much make-up, conservative 
           clothes, gold cross necklace, walks out the front door of the 
           weed shop. This is SHERYL, 40’s, Estee’s sister. Estee is 
           shocked to see her.
                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Sheryl? In a weed shop? Has hell 
                        frozen over?!
                        (looking around)
                        It doesn’t look frozen. 
                        (a beat)
                        That’s a joke, cuz we live in hell.

           Sheryl puts on a fake smile she reserves just for Estee.

                        Oh hey sis! I was just in there 
                        explaining to the nice young man 
                        inside that this town has no 
                        interest in

                        drug dealing operation elsewhere, 
                        I’ll personally rain bureaucratic 
                        hellfire down upon them straight 
                        from the mayor’s office, who, as

                        making baked ham. You could do one 
                        of your cute bread things.

                        Come to church on Sunday? We’d love 
                        to have you. You know I’ve been 
                        praying for you. Oh and we have a 
                        new recruit! Illegally handsome and 
                        very single! Remember Jimmy from 
                        the car dealership?

                        Jimmy? Strip club Jimmy whose dick 
                        fell off? 

                                 SHERYL
                        Oh that’s just a myth. And anyways, 
                        Jesus came to him in the shower. 
                        Changed his life. Did a total 180. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Did Jesus glue his dick back on? 

                                 SHERYL
                        You’re a lost cause, you know that?

                                 ESTEE
                        Yes. I do. Speaking of nothing, I 
                        gotta go, I got a nothing I need to 
                        be at. Bye Sheryl.

           Estee starts to walk off.

                                 SHERYL
                        OK! Come to church!

                                 ESTEE
                        I’ll think about it. 

           She won’t. 

                                 SHERYL
                        (calls after her)
                        Oh and we’re having a picnic at the 
                        lake after. Come and wear 
                        something... nicer!

                        I’ll think about it.

           She won’t. 
           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Estee swipes through TINDER on her phone. She swipes left on 
           three profiles of random losers. We think she’s gonna keep 
           swiping through dozens more - but after three, the app 
           displays a message - 

           “We’re sorry. We’ve run out of profiles in your area. Try 
           again tomorrow.”

           Desperate, she goes to the “Messages” section of the app. ONE 
           NEW MESSAGE from ZACK. It reads - “I remember you. You showed 
           me your boobies in fifth grade. How about a repeat 
           performance?” 

           Estee shudders and throws away her phone, like it carries a 
           disease. The kind of disease that made Jimmy’s dick fall off, 
           maybe. 

           She hears COMMOTION outside. She runs out.

           EXT. ESTEE’S STREET - CONT’D

           A TOWNIE POLICE CAR parked two houses down. She sees CHIEF 
           DEPUTY BILLY GABLES JR. 30’s, tall lanky man, second fiddle 
           to his Sheriff dad. Chip of unrealized potential on his 
           shoulder, just like Estee. He’s escorting GLADYS, 70’s, tiny 
           Colombian grandma, to his police car. 

           Estee runs up to them and stops them in their tracks. There’s 
           a weird tension between Estee and Chief Deputy Billy we can’t 
           quite place. 

                                 ESTEE
                        What the fuck’s going on, 
                        (with derision)
                        Chief Deputy?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Police business. Orders from the 
                        top. 

                                 ESTEE
                        You mean from Daddy?

           Chief Deputy Billy winces at this but quickly recovers.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        As a matter of fact yes. He’s away 
                        on important police business and 
                        asked me to take care of this for 
                        him. 
                                 ESTEE
                        Take care of what exactly?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        (not proud of it)
                        Gotta look at her papers.

           Estee reels.

                                 ESTEE
                        Her papers? Are you fucking joking 
                        me?! Gladys has lived here for 
                        centuries. No offense, Gladys.

                                 GLADYS
                        None taken.

                                 ESTEE
                        She babysat me when I was a 
                        toddler, Billy. Fuck, she babysat 
                        YOU when you were a toddler. 
                        (remembering)
                        She taught you English for fuck’s 
                        sake! Remember you had a Spanish 
                        accent all through elementary 
                        school? “Chévere” was your favorite 
                        word, which we all thought was VERY 
                        weird. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        I remember.  

           Chief Deputy Billy looks guilty for a moment, then he hardens 
           again. He opens the car door and gently gets Gladys inside.

                                 ESTEE
                        She’s fucking ancient, Billy! No 
                        offense, Gladys.

                                 GLADYS
                        (from inside the car)
                        None taken.

                                 ESTEE
                        She probably babysat your parents 
                        too when they were kids. Fuck, 
                        she’s so old she may have founded 
                        this town for all we know. No 
                        offense, Gladys.

                                 GLADYS
                        (from inside the car)
                        None taken. 
                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        (loses his temper)
                        Look. I know. I KNOW. There’s 
                        nothing I can do about it, OK? 
                        Orders from the top.

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright you Nazi Robot. Fuck you, 
                        fuck your daddy and fuck your 
                        orders. Gladys, if he doesn’t let 
                        you go like in five fucking 
                        minutes, you call me. 

           Chief Deputy Billy gets in Estee’s face. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Keep mouthing off you can come 
                        along for the ride. 

           Now she gets in his face. They’re inches away now. Sexual 
           tension, pure hatred between them.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh yeah? Wanna deport me? Wanna 
                        kick me out of this town? 
                        (whispers)
                        I fucking wish.

           A beat. Then Estee starts to walk off, consumed with shame 
           and anger. She yells out at the universe.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Fuck this town. Fuck it to 
                        shit. I hope it burns to the 
                        ground.  

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        With you in it?

                                 ESTEE
                        Yes. Fucking yes. Just call me 
                        Samson. LET ME DIE WITH THE FUCKING 
                        PHILISTINES. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Should I be on arson watch?

                                 ESTEE
                        No you dolt. I’m being fucking 
                        metaphorical. Good fucking night.

           Estee storms off, enters her house, slams the door. 
           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           With unstoppable rage and fiery anger, Estee works on an 
           adorable white frosted cake for Colin’s retiring mom Linda. 

           She puts the final touches, writing, “HAPPY RETIREMENT, 
           LINDA” in blue frosting on top. As she works, she sings the 
           song “Shake Your Love” by Debbie Gibson, but instead of the 
           lyrics “Shake your love, I just can’t shake your love”, she 
           sings -

                                 ESTEE
                        Fuck this town. Burn it to the 
                        ground. 
                        (Mariah Carey level solo, 
                         minus the talent)
                        Fuck this town to hell. Genocide it 
                        off the map. 

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The singing continues in bed, where Estee is spread out and 
           drunk. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (singing)
                        Kiiiiill me. Kiiiiiiiill me. Kiii--

           She falls asleep. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Another day, another midlife crisis for Estee. She walks down 
           the street, carefully balancing the wrapped delicate white 
           cake in her arms. She passes by DOOMSDAY STEVE, still sitting 
           on his porch, rifle on his lap, he gives her his usual 
           morning greeting.

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        YOUR LIFE IS A JOKE. NOTHING WILL 
                        MATTER WHEN THE WORLD ENDS. 

           Close to her breaking point, she can’t help but stop. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh give it a break, Mr. Aitken. 
                        What the fuck happened to you? You 
                        know me. Estee? You were my 
                        teacher. 9th grade algebra. 
                        Remember? My mom was the principal. 
                        We’d have you over for pot roast on 
                        Sundays.
                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        Your words are meaningless. We’ve 
                        passed the threshold of collective 
                        irresponsibility. We fractured. 
                        Fractured. Fractured. It’s too 
                        late. They’re coming for what’s 
                        mine and I won’t let them take it. 

           Estee makes one last ditch effort to reach him. The old him. 
           She stares deeply into his eyes.

                                 ESTEE
                        You had so many smart funny things 
                        to say about math and about the 
                        world. I used to think you were the 
                        only sane person in this town. 
                        (remembering)
                        You’d say... how if religion is 
                        defined by a system of ideas that 
                        contains unprovable statements... 
                        then math is not only a religion, 
                        it is the only religion that can 
                        prove itself to be one. I just 
                        thought that was so neat. Remember?

           This seems to trigger him. He slowly rises. For a second he 
           seems human again. Normal. Fragile. He connects. But then his 
           eyes go dark. His face twists in anger. 

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        IT DOESN’T MATTER. It’s all over.

           He moves towards her, rifle in his arms, menacing. 

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Only one true constant, and that’s 
                        death. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Jesus. Fuck it. Lost fucking cause 
                        like the rest of them.

           She walks off, creeped out. Up ahead - her favorite stop on 
           her morning walk of torture -- 

           PLANNED PARENTHOOD

           Kenny and his gang of unemployed trolls are gathered there 
           again, chanting their anti-choice slogans. 

                                 KENNY
                        Oh shit, watch out guys, here comes 
                        the Feminazi freedom fighter. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENNY (CONT'D)
                        With that dusty vagina, she 
                        couldn’t get preggers if she tried.

                                 ESTEE
                        Fuck off, Kenny. Not today.

           She keeps walking, and he lets her, but she can’t help but 
           look back. A FRAIL WOMAN, red eyes, comes limping out of the 
           clinic. The men close in on her, intimidating, Kenny at the 
           lead. He starts chanting.

                                 KENNY
                        MURDERER! MURDERER!

           Estee snaps. Turns back. Marches towards Kenny. Full of anger 
           and violence and the need to do... something. But what? Is 
           she gonna punch this large man with her tiny hands? Without 
           thinking, she takes her beautiful white cake she spent all 
           day baking AND VIOLENTLY SMASHES IT INTO HIM. 

           A chunk of cake that reads “LINDA” slides off his cheek and 
           down his shirt. He recoils, stunned, wiping it off.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        YOU FUCKING BITCH.

                                 ESTEE
                        EAT SHIT KENNY. GET A FUCKING LIFE 
                        YOU HYPOCRITE MISOGYNIST ASSHOLE. 

           Look, we get it - Estee is angry at everyone. But this feels 
           different. This feels bigger. Like Estee’s about to snap. 
           Irreversibly. 

           Frozen, she stares at the ruined cake on the ground. This is 
           her life summed up in a single image. 

           She bends down and starts to SCOOP UP PIECES OF CAKE into her 
           purse. It’s heartbreaking and senseless. Her arms are covered 
           in cake up to her elbows. 

           Kenny steps up to her, ready to get violent, when she rises, 
           truly deranged--

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!! 

           In eerie timing -- the “JESUS LOVES YOU” billboard behind the 
           Planned Parenthood building comes loose off its hinges and 
           falls to the ground with an ugly THUD. 

           Jesus. Kenny takes a step back, legitimately frightened. His 
           posse of angry assholes also recoils, scared. 
           The Frail Limping Woman who just exited the clinic clings to 
           one of the asshole men to protect her from the crazy 
           screaming woman. 

           Then Kenny goes soft. Approaches Estee like you would a 
           wounded wild animal. 

                                 KENNY
                        Geez, Estee. Take it easy. You 
                        alright?

                                 ESTEE
                        NO. FUCK YOU. GO TO HELL. ALL OF 
                        YOU.  
                        (at Frail Woman, gently)
                        Not you. I’m sorry for everything. 
                        (at everyone else)
                        BUT DEFINITELY ALL OF FUCKING YOU. 
                        DIE IN A PAINFUL SCORCHING FIRE, 
                        YOU PATHETIC SMALL MINDED LIFERS. 

           Estee storms off. 

                                 KENNY
                        (apologetically at crowd)
                        She had a hard life. 

           MONTAGE OF ESTEE LOSING HER SHIT ALL OVER TOWN, FULL MENTAL 
           BREAKDOWN MODE

           Estee stomps down the street like a woman thinking hard on 
           how to most efficiently assemble a bomb. Her arms covered in 
           cake up to her elbows. She looks completely deranged. She is 
           completely deranged. She passes by a parked truck where SID, 
           30’s, redneck-vibes, peeks his head out, name calling A MAN 
           on the other side of the street. 

                                 SID
                        Why don’t you go back where you 
                        came from, slanted eye 
                        motherfucker!

           Estee turns on her heels, as if someone just called her name. 
           She marches straight up to Sid, gets in his face.
                                 ESTEE
                        I’d say YOU go back where YOU came 
                        from, but even the decrepit vaginal 
                        doomsday hell hole that spit you 
                        out wouldn’t take you back having 
                        seen what you turned out to be, you 
                        vile, ignorant waste of oxygen 
                        backwards motherfucking soulless 
                        HATEFUL MACHO BITCH.  
                        (a beat)
                        Say hi to Holly for me.

                                 SID
                        Will do.
                        (spits)
                        Cunt.

           A FEW BLOCKS DOWN

           She spots a CONFEDERATE FLAG hanging taut between two edges 
           of a truck bed. She rummages in her purse through mounds of 
           cake bits, pulls out a HIGH HEELED SHOE. She stares at the 
           fancy shoe, and starts laughing hysterically like a mad 
           woman.

                                 ESTEE
                        Why do I have this? I’m not going 
                        anywhere! I’m NEVER going anywhere. 

           With the sharp end of the heel, she starts SLASHING the flag, 
           tearing it up, laughing maniacally. 

           A FEW BLOCKS DOWN

           She spots TWO MEN in wife beaters (no longer a PC term, but 
           in this case - fitting) SCREAMING at each other in a parking 
           lot, a small argument spiraled out of control. One of them 
           pulls out a gun. 

           Estee walks up to them and starts BARKING LIKE A DOG. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        ARF ARF ARF! ARF!!! That’s what you 
                        sound like right now. ARFARFARFARF! 
                        I’d say you sound like pitbulls but 
                        that would be an insult to pitbulls 
                        who are in fact misunderstood, 
                        sensitive loving creatures, while 
                        you are nothing but fragile scared 
                        children cloaked in pride and ego 
                        and so much bullshit it makes me 
                        want to empty an entire AK magazine 
                        into my fucking face.  
           With that, the MAN WITH THE GUN pivots his arm, AIMS HIS GUN 
           AT ESTEE, a menacing smile on his face. That should shut her 
           up. But she doesn’t flinch. She just spread her arms like 
           Jesus.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        BY ALL MEANS.

           This gives him pause. What the fuck? He lowers his gun. She 
           seems almost disappointed.

           AT THE BAKERY

           Estee peeks her beet red, angry head into the bakery. Mr. 
           Shelby looks up from his work. 

                                 ESTEE
                        I FUCKING QUIT YOU HYPOCRITE BIGOT 
                        GRAMPA FOSSIL FUCK. 

           She slams the door shut. Mr. Shelby shrugs, resumes his work. 

           END MONTAGE

           Exhausted, Estee slows down. Deflates. The adrenaline rush, 
           aka her only source of happiness in this town, leaves her 
           body and all that’s left is misery. 

           Then she sees the MEDICAL MARIJUANA SHOP, “OPEN FOR 
           BUSINESS.” She stops. Walks inside.

           INT. WEED SHOP - CONT’D

           Estee enters. Looks around. This is exciting new territory in 
           an otherwise mind-numbingly familiar town. 

           It looks like a normal shop. That happens to sell weed. At 
           the counter - GABE, 20’s, not white. Smart, sad eyes, but 
           always smiling like the Cheshire cat. (You know, cuz weed.)   

           Estee walks up to him, still red, broken down with cake arms.

                                 ESTEE
                        Heard they’re trying to shut you 
                        down.

                                 GABE
                        Oh yeah? Where’d you hear that?

                                 ESTEE
                        It’s a small town. Everybody knows 
                        everything. They probably will too.

                        They always get their way. So enjoy 
                        it while it lasts. But enough about 
                        you. I need drugs. The hard stuff.

                                 GABE
                        Like heroin?

                                 ESTEE
                        You sell that?

                                 GABE
                        No. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Then why are you offering? Give me 
                        a weed. 

                                 GABE
                        Do you have a medical card?

                                 ESTEE
                        No. Fuck. This was stupid. Good 
                        fucking bye. 

           She starts to walk out.

                                 GABE
                        I can get you one.

           She spins around. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Are you a doctor?

                                 GABE
                        (no)
                        Yes. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (hmm)
                        OK. 

           He hands her an official looking notepad and a pen. 

                                 GABE
                        Fill out all your details here. 

           She does, then slides it back. He examines the info.

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        Estee? Is that a bible name? Ester?
                                 ESTEE
                        No. 
                        (doesn’t really want to 
                         talk about it. Finally-)
                        It’s... I’m named after Estee 
                        Lauder, OK? My mom was a fan of the 
                        cosmetics line. The night time 
                        moisturizer was a particular 
                        favorite. Kept her young. She died 
                        with youthful skin. 

                                 GABE
                        So you’re named after a 
                        moisturizer?

           Estee tries to find a better way to put it. Fails.

                                 ESTEE
                        Yes. I’m named after a moisturizer.

                                 GABE
                        Cool. I’m Gabe. Named after one of 
                        the seven archangels, the herald of 
                        good news who appeared to Mary to 
                        announce her pregnancy and the 
                        impending birth of the Christ-
                        child. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Wow cool, congratulations, you win 
                        the name competition, can we move 
                        this along?

                                 GABE
                        Yes. So, in order to approve you, I 
                        gotta list your medical reasons for 
                        needing prescription marijuana.

                                 ESTEE
                        A ferocious, all consuming hatred 
                        of this town and everyone in it?

                                 GABE
                        Got anything a little more... 
                        medical?

                                 ESTEE
                        Look, I’m a lifer, Gabe. It’s a 
                        terminal illness. Stage four. No 
                        cure. All we can do now is ease the 
                        pain. Not only am I a lifer, Gabe, 
                        I’m a social pariah. A despicable 
                        outsider in a one-minded town.

                        They’d collectively curb stomp me 
                        if it wasn’t for my tragic sad sack 
                        sob story cautionary tale tragic 
                        past, so instead they just walk on 
                        eggshells around me, which is 
                        arguably worse than straight 
                        forward violence. I’m a powerless 
                        leper, Gabe. An obsolete oddity and 
                        a freak of nature. A plant that 
                        grew up wrong in a hostile 
                        environment, and it is so... so... 
                        thirsty.

           Gabe blinks.

                        Also, I got a skin condition.

                                 GABE
                        Cool that works. I mean not cool 
                        about the skin condition, or the 
                        social pariah. I’m sorry. 
                        Genuinely. Have you been down to 
                        the lake? I hear it works wonders 
                        for skin stuff.

                                 ESTEE
                        What are you, a tour guide? Sell me 
                        some drugs.

                                 GABE
                        OK. OK. Let me issue you the 
                        certificate. 

           Gabe scribbles on the notepad. He tears the paper, hands it 
           to her. 

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        There you go. Just bring this paper 
                        back anytime you want to buy, OK? 
                        Now what kind do you want? We got a 
                        bunch of buds and vapes. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Got any edibles? My lungs are shit. 

                                 GABE
                        No, sorry. Not yet anyways. 
                        Companies are skeptical about 
                        selling to... this location. They 
                        figure we’re gonna go out of 
                        business in two weeks tops. 
                                 ESTEE
                        Toldya. It’s gonna happen. Devil’s 
                        lettuce. Very ungodly. 

                                 GABE
                        Devil’s lettuce. That’s right. 
                        Anyways, if you can’t smoke, you 
                        can just make your own edibles at 
                        home. Like, cook it or bake it.

           Estee’s eyes light up at the word “bake.” 

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh fuck that’s right. I’m a baker. 
                        And I just got a big fucking 
                        opening in my schedule, on account 
                        of I blew up my life, so I can 
                        totally do that. OK, let me buy 
                        some buds or flowers or whatever. 
                        (leans forward)
                        I’m gonna need a fucking bouquet, 
                        Gabe.

           He nods, smiles, takes out some options for her to choose 
           from. She looks him over instead.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never seen you before. Are you 
                        new? People never move here. They 
                        only move out of here. Why would 
                        you voluntarily come here? Did 
                        Jesus come to you in the shower? Oh 
                        shit, are you in witness protection 
                        program? 

                                 GABE
                        Ha. No. Well, if I was I couldn’t 
                        tell you, right? 

           He winks at her. She winks back. He winks again. She winks 
           back. A beat.

                        No, I’m not. Why am I here... Well, 
                        my buddy asked me if I want to run 
                        this branch, cuz nobody else would 
                        touch it. And I thought, you know 
                        what... This country’s falling 
                        apart, right?

                                 ESTEE
                        (fake shock)
                        WHAT! 
           They smile at each other. Camaraderie. Such a rare commodity 
           for Estee in this town. 

                                 GABE
                        And I thought it would be helpful 
                        to go somewhere that’s the opposite 
                        of where I live... A ground zero of 
                        sorts. To live with the other side. 
                        To try... and understand... the 
                        enemy. Proverbially speaking.

                                 ESTEE
                        Wow. We’re the enemy, huh? I’m 
                        offended. Where are you from?

                        Like the park? In California? 
                        People live there? Do you live 
                        inside a giant tree? 

                                 GABE
                        Well not inside the park, but in 
                        the town right next to it, yeah.

                                 ESTEE
                        And do you guys like... Play 
                        hackysack and eat tofu and hug 
                        trees and cry about whales?

                        Well don’t know why anyone would 
                        leave that slice of paradise to 
                        come here, but, hey, here you are, 
                        so welcome to hell.

                                 GABE
                        If you hate it here so much, why 
                        don’t you just leave?

           EXT. BUS STATION - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A remote, tiny bus stop. Estee sits alone on a bench, 
           suitcase in hand. She watches as the bus drives away. As if 
           physical glue keeps her on that bench, her heart breaks 
           realizing she doesn’t have the courage to leave this town.

                                 ESTEE
                        Well I would. I tried. It’s just... 
                        It’s complicated. I spent my whole 
                        life here. And... My parents died. 
                        And I gotta sell their house. And 
                        it’s just been busy, and I haven’t 
                        had time to do it, you know? It’s 
                        hard. Selling a house. Here. Cuz no 
                        one in their right mind would buy 
                        here. And there’s also... My skin 
                        condition. You know, and the 
                        lake... And...

                                 GABE
                        Got it. Well. It’s just that... You 
                        know... when someone hates their 
                        life and their town and their home 
                        and everyone around them it usually 
                        means they mostly just hate 
                        themselves. 

           Camaraderie = over. Estee’s walls shoot back up. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright Dr. Phil, what are you my 
                        shrink? Sell me some drugs. 

           He smiles. Nods. Bags up her goods. She pays, grabs the bag 
           and leaves, shutting the door behind her.

           A beat. She peeks her head back in.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Am I the enemy?

           He considers.

                                 GABE
                        TBD.

           Fair. She smiles, nods and leaves. 

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           In her kitchen, following a recipe on an old busted laptop, 
           Estee finishes straining a homemade MARIJUANA BUTTER, meant 
           for cooking. She takes a deep breath, inhaling it. Nods, 
           approving.

           She then opens a YOUTUBE VIDEO -- of a VIRAL STONER BAKING 
           SHOW. The host, STONER GREG, 19, Santa Cruz born and bred, 
           bro, hang loose, eyes red like the sun, slurs his way through 
           a POT BROWNIE TUTORIAL. 
                                 STONER GREG (ONSCREEN)
                        So you take the... the... Eggs.
                        (bursts laughing)
                        Why are eggs? You know? Like 
                        seriously. Why are eggs?

           Estee shakes her head, experiencing some buyers remorse. 

                                 STONER GREG (ONSCREEN) (CONT’D)
                        Then, just. Haehe... Just.. pour 
                        the brownie mix, into...

                                 ESTEE
                        (disgusted)
                        Pff. Store bought brownie mix?! 
                        What is this bullshit amateur hour?

           She SLAMS the laptop shut. Rummages through her drawers and 
           pulls out an assortment of baking ingredients. 

           She starts bringing them to life like a mad conductor. Flour, 
           cocoa powder, sugar, eggs, and now the weed butter -- a 
           congregation of disparate materials, manipulated into one 
           cohesive, smooth, harmonious brownie batter in her skilled 
           hands. (AND YES THIS IS A METAPHOR FOR LATER, THANKS FOR 
           ASKING.) 

           DING! -- She pulls a beautiful brownie pan out of the oven. 
           She cuts a small piece. Sniffs it. Tastes it. Considers it. 
           Devours the whole piece. Waits. 

           AN HOUR PASSES. She still sits there. Scratching her head. 
           It’s not working. She hesitates. She eats another piece. 

           AN HOUR PASSES. She still sits there. Scratching her head. 
           It’s not working. 

           She’s about to pull another piece when --

           BOOM! PAUL MCCARTNEY’S “SILLY LOVE SONG” (or a budget 
           friendly equivalent) STARTS BLASTING FULL VOLUME FROM AN 
           INVISIBLE RADIO IN THE SKY, THE COLORS GO BRIGHT AND CRISP, 
           FULL HD OR 4K OR WHATEVER THE FUCK AND SURROUND SOUND DOLBY 
           7.1 LIKE A CHOIR OF GODDAMN ANGELS BATHES ESTEE IN A 360 
           DEGREE AURAL HALO, AS HER FACE FULL OF DEEP SET FROWN LINES 
           CONTORTS INTO A STRANGE UNFAMILIAR EXPRESSION.

           A smile. 

           She looks down at her body. Wiggles her toes. And starts 
           swaying. She starts singing along to the song that’s playing 
           in the radio in her head. But instead of her usual 
           improvisational “KILL ME / BURN THIS TOWN” she sings THE 
           ACUTAL GOD/PAUL MCCARTNEY GIVEN LYRICS. 
                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        (sings)
                        I.... Love.... Yooooou.

           It’s a goddamn religious experience. Arguably as powerful as 
           Jesus visiting you in the shower. 

           She sings, her face full of shock and awe -- at how a single 
           substance, a NATURAL PLANT AT THAT, can singlehandedly and 
           overwhelmingly strip away decades of depression and sadness 
           and grief and anger and self-loathing. 

           OUTSIDE OF ESTEE’S HOUSE

           From outside the house, we see Estee dancing and running 
           around through various warmly lit rooms in the house -- a 
           genuine, heartwarmingly joyous party of one. 

           INT. ESTEE’S HOSUE - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT AFTERNOON

           Estee awakes with a JOLT. She slept on the floor hugging the 
           tray of brownies. She wipes the drool off her face. The high 
           gone. The worries back. Still, thinking about last night... 
           she smiles. She looks down at the brownies. Gets an idea. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - EVENING

           Police station front desk. Estee, sunglasses on, walks up to 
           the RECEPTIONIST, 20’s, stern, no bullshit. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Hi. I need to see Chief Deputy 
                        Billy. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Is he expecting you?

                                 ESTEE
                        He’s expecting my fist.

           Receptionist stares.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        I mean yes. 

           Receptionist sizes her up, not impressed.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Estee.
           The name registers with the Receptionist. As if Estee is some 
           urban legend in this town. The Receptionist softens. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        He’s in his office. 

           Estee salutes and walks down the hallway and into -

           CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY’S OFFICE

           Chief Deputy Billy and Gladys sit by his desk, a MOUNTAIN OF 
           PAPERS between them. Estee walks in, metaphorical guns 
           blazing. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright Sheriff Fuck Face, you let 
                        her go or what?
                        (her eyes go wide at the 
                         sight of Gladys)
                        Oh Jesus, Gladys, you’re still 
                        here?! Christ Billy, did you make 
                        her sleep in a cell like a 
                        criminal, you KAPO FUCK?

           Chief Deputy Billy rolls his eyes. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        You know Estee, that sympathy card 
                        you wield around town is starting 
                        to get mighty worn. Might lose its 
                        power soon you keep abusing it.

                                 ESTEE
                        Great metaphor, “Chief.” Those 
                        night school creative writing 
                        classes sure are starting to pay 
                        off. Why don’t you call daddy, have 
                        him come discipline me and you can 
                        watch and jerk off and--

           Gladys puts a warm hand on Estee to prevent escalation.

                                 GLADYS
                        Don’t worry Esterella, he did no 
                        such thing. He took me to his house 
                        for dinner and let me sleep in the 
                        guest room. The same room where I 
                        used to tuck you in when you were a 
                        baby, isn’t that right, my little 
                        Billy?

           Billy loses his mind at this emasculation. He turns to Gladys 
           and yells at her in surprisingly eloquent Spanish.
                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Déjalo, abuela, deja de decirle a 
                        todo el mundo que hice eso o me 
                        meteré en un verdadero problema!!

           Translation: “Quit it, grandma, stop telling everyone that I 
           did that or I'll get into trouble.” Gladys yells back --

                                 GLADYS
                        Deja de gritar, sabes que tienes 
                        presión arterial alta, chico!!

           Translation: “Stop shouting you know you have high blood 
           pressure, kid.”

           They keep yelling in Spanish. Estee watches for a beat, like 
           she’s observing a game of sports she doesn’t know the rules 
           of. Then SHE starts yelling in surprisingly decent Spanish.

                                 ESTEE
                        ¿Cuándo vas a dejarla ir, cerdo?

           Translation: “when are you gonna let her go, pig?”

           The three of them start yelling at each other in a cacophony 
           of Spanish. Things quiet down, then Gladys gets a mischievous 
           smile on her face. 

                                 GLADYS
                        All this tension. I’m surprised you 
                        two never... 

           With that, they explode. 

                       ESTEE
           Are you joking?! I wouldn’t 
           touch this neutered cowboy 
           redneck bigot with a six foot 
           pole! Folks like him are the 
           problem with this town! Never 
           thinking for himself, never 
           questioning anything! A cog 
           in the fucking machine! 
                                           CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                                       Are you kidding?! That woman 
                                       thinks she’s some tree 
                                       hugging liberal hippie but 
                                       she got more rage, sadness 
                                       and hatred in her heart than 
                                       all of us combined! I’m still 
                                       waiting to wake up one day to 
                                       find that she shot down the 
                                       entire town!

           Ouch. An awkward silence. Finally, Chief Deputy Billy turns 
           to Estee with as much calmness as he can muster. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Look, Estee, I don’t have time for 
                        this right now. This town is 
                        falling apart. Now we got a 
                        marijuana epidemic to fight. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        And I’m doing it all by myself 
                        until daddy comes back. Please. 
                        Just let me do my job. Leave and 
                        we’ll be finished quicker. Don’t 
                        make me call someone to escort you 
                        out of the building.

                                 ESTEE
                        Don’t worry, Führer, I’m leaving. I 
                        just wanted to give Gladys 
                        something to eat in case you’ve 
                        been starving her. 

           Estee rummages in her bag, pulls out a WEED BROWNIE. She 
           hands it to Gladys. Leans down and whispers in her ear.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        (in Spanish)
                        Something small to alleviate the 
                        pain. 

           Estee winks. Gladys gets the message and smiles, takes the 
           brownie. Estee starts to walk out. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Where’s mine?!

                                 ESTEE
                        (without stopping)
                        You don’t get one, you diabetic 
                        fuck.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER

           Estee exits the police station. Up ahead she spots her sister 
           Sheryl in too much makeup and a pink power suit, chatting up 
           some POLICE OFFICERS about the risk drugs bring to this town. 

           Estee curses silently, turns around, hoping to escape unseen.

                                 SHERYL
                        THERE SHE IS!

           Estee freezes in place.

                                 ESTEE
                        Fuck shit fuck fuck shit.

           Estee spins around.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        (big smile)
                        HEYYYY!
           Sheryl puts an arm around her.

                                 SHERYL
                        You’re coming to dinner.

                                 ESTEE
                        Actually I already ate--

           INT. SHERYL’S HOUSE - YARD - LATER

           An impeccably groomed yard outside an ugly McMansion. 

           Estee sits by a picnic table, looking small and trapped in a 
           prison of A MILLION SIDE DISHES, PLATES, BOWLS, endless cans 
           of BUD LIGHT. (Riddle for the readers - if the devil created 
           weed, who created Bud Light?) 

           Sheryl’s hubbie SHAWN, 40’s, good looking in a bland way, 
           grills in the background, humming Smash Mouth tunes to 
           himself. Sheryl keeps popping in and adding more plates to 
           the table.

                                 ESTEE
                        Is the football team coming over to 
                        eat, or...?

                                 SHERYL
                        (obnoxiously cheery)
                        Oh shush. We’re just happy to have 
                        you. It’s a special occasion!

           Sheryl and Shawn’s daughter CHLOE, 8, dances around in a 
           ballerina outfit, showing off to Estee, who couldn’t possibly 
           give less fucks.

                                 ESTEE
                        Very nice. Great legwork. 

           Sheryl finally takes a seat. Cracks open a Bud Light. 

                                 SHERYL
                        So how are things?

                                 ESTEE
                        Shit.

                                 SHERYL
                        HEY. Not in front of the ildchay.
                        (pig latin for “child”)

                                 ESTEE
                        Sorry. Things are itshay. 
                        (pig latin for “shit”)
                                 SHERYL
                        Work?

                                 ESTEE
                        Itshay.

                                 SHERYL
                        Boys?

                                 ESTEE
                        Itshay.

                                 SHERYL
                        Sex?

                                 ESTEE
                        Non-existshay.

                                 SHERYL
                        Come to church tomorrow, meet 
                        Johnny.

                                 ESTEE
                        You mean icklessday Johnny? Who 
                        slept with all the rostitutespay 
                        until his icksday fell offsday? 

                                 SHERYL
                        Oh stop it, that’s an urban legend! 

                                 ESTEE
                        All legends have an origin story. 

           THUD, Shawn drops a giant chunk of meat on the table, ending 
           the conversation. Time to eat. 

           LATER

           Sheryl, Shawn, Chloe and Estee all recline around the table, 
           stuffed. 

           Sheryl looks down at the open bag by Estee’s feet. A TEMPTING 
           PLASTIC CASE OF BROWNIES peeking through. Sheryl lights up.

                                 SHERYL
                        Oh hon, you brought dessert?? How 
                        nice!

           Sheryl fishes the container out of the bag before Estee has a 
           chance to stop her.

                                 ESTEE
                        No! That’s not for you!!
                                 SHERYL
                        Um. RUDE. 

           Sheryl giggles at Shawn as she removes the lid and puts the 
           brownies at the center of the table. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Seriously, don’t. They have...

           Estee stares at the gold cross chain around Sheryl’s neck.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        (scrambles)
                        They’re not very good.

           Sheryl takes a piece, playfully rolls her eyes.

                                 SHERYL
                        You’re so self deprecating, Estee! 
                        We’ve talked about this. You gotta 
                        believe in yourself, girl. 

           Sheryl and Shawn both eat a piece. Estee stares in horror.

           Then little Chloe reaches a tiny hand into the case for a 
           brownie piece. Estee has a heart attack. She shoots up.

                                 ESTEE
                        NO! YOU CAN’T!

           They all stare at her like she’s crazy.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        It’s got... tons of alcohol. So. 

                                 SHERYL
                        Oh... Alright. Chloe put it back 
                        hon, it’s not for you, baby.

           Chloe gets angry. About to cry. Sheryl stands, still eating. 

                                 SHERLYL
                        How about I get you ice cream from 
                        the kitchen?
                        (at Estee)
                        These are good, doll!

           Estee smiles, nervous, grabs the brownies and quickly puts 
           them back in her bag, zipping it tight. 

           LATER

           It’s near midnight, and Estee, Sheryl and Shawn are still out 
           in the yard doing something they’ve never done before.
           HAVING A GOOD TIME. 

           Laughing their ass off. The kind of laughter with tears and a 
           belly ache. Red eyes. Sheryl has stripped away her fake 
           cheery perfectionist bullshit act and is chugging beer, being 
           clumsy and disheveled and goofy and human in a way that Estee 
           hasn’t seen in years if not decades. 

                                 SHERYL
                        And then dad goes... he goes... 
                        “You two... are in such a fucking 
                        degree of trouble... that I’m 
                        considering sending you... to a 
                        boarding school... with your great 
                        aunt.. in New Jersey.” And he said 
                        “New Jersey” like it was a 
                        terrifying place where really bad 
                        stuff happens. We were scared of 
                        New Jersey for years. Heck, I’m 
                        still scared to go there. 

           Estee and Sheryl cry laugh together. The whole thing seems 
           rare and surprising and precious to Estee. Sheryl grabs hold 
           of a chair, feeling dizzy.  

                                 SHERYL (CONT’D)
                        Man, those Bud Lights are going to 
                        my head. Wooo! I feel silly. What 
                        were we talkin’ about?

                                 SHAWN
                        My wife, the teetotalist. 

           Sheryl smacks him. They all laugh and laugh. 

           We CLOSE IN on Estee watching Sheryl, an idea forming in her 
           head. She fidgets with her bag under the table, caressing the 
           container of brownies. Then she abruptly stands and grabs her 
           belongings. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright I should get going. But 
                        hey. I was thinking. Maybe I will 
                        come to church tomorrow after all. 

           Sheryl’s face lights up with genuine joy. 

                                 SHERYL
                        YAYYYY!!!

           She stands and hugs her sister tight. 
                                 SHERYL (CONT’D)
                        (whispers in Estee’s ear)
                        I miss you.

                                 ESTEE
                        (whispers back)
                        That’s just the weed talking.

           Sheryl abruptly breaks the hug.

                                 SHERYL
                        What?!

                                 ESTEE
                        What?! NIGHT GUYS!! Thanks for 
                        dinner!

           Estee walks off. Sheryl shakes her head at Shawn, laughing. 
           She picks up a Bud Light can, shakes her head at it. What do 
           they put in these things these days?! 

           PRE-LAP: CHURCH ORGAN MUSIC.

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Estee rummages through her drawers and pulls out an 
           assortment of baking ingredients. EIGHT STICKS OF PRE-
           PREPARED MARIJUANA BUTTER AMONG THEM.

           She starts bringing the ingredients to life like a mad 
           conductor, in sync with the holy, awe-inspiring church organ 
           music. Flour, yeast, sugar, eggs, and now the weed butter -- 
           a congregation of disparate materials, manipulated into one 
           cohesive, smooth, harmonious cookie batter in her skilled 
           hands. (AND YES THIS IS A METAPHOR FOR LATER, THANKS FOR 
           ASKING.) 

           The organ music reaches a crescendo as she pulls SEVERAL PANS 
           FULL OF TEMPTING COOKIES OUT OF THE OVEN. A bright sacred 
           HALO surrounds them.

           The church music continues over --

           EXT. CHURCH - NOON

           The fine people of Jacksboro, decked in their Sunday best, 
           swarm inside a beautiful, old-timey CHURCH -- the beating 
           heart of the community, and the one place seemingly 
           unaffected by the dilapidation of this otherwise dying town. 
           At the entrance, by a picnic table, Sheryl, in a tailored 
           bubblegum pink dress, hands out flyers advocating shutting 
           down the marijuana dispensary before it brings cocaine, crime 
           and prostitution to their town. 

           Next to her -- Estee, in an ill-fitting conservative dress, 
           offers HER SPECIAL FRESHLY BAKED COOKIES to every person 
           walking by. Her face is full of fake cheer as she addresses 
           the passerby’s.

                                 ESTEE
                        Hey Charlene! Oh this? Just a 
                        little Jesus fuel. Want one? Hey 
                        Bruce. Cookie? Danny! How’s that 
                        leg? LINDA. Happy retirement you 
                        old bag! Have a cookie! No, 
                        unfortunately not for kids, it’s 
                        got alcohol, see. OK see you 
                        inside! Not if I see you first! No, 
                        you! No, you! Alright take it easy.

           Nearly every person takes a cookie and nibbles on it as they 
           enter the building. All except Chief Deputy Billy, the 
           diabetic. He exchanges hateful glances with Estee as he walks 
           past. She flips him off discreetly, then continues cheerfully 
           handing out cookies to the church goers. 

           INT. CHURCH - LATER

           EXTREME CLOSE UP on the face of community leader, PASTOR 
           MICHAELS, 50’s, dignified and distinguished, his eyes closed 
           in prayer. 

           A long silent beat. Then he opens his eyes. THEY ARE RED AND 
           BLOOD SHOT. A smile spreads on his face, maybe wider than is 
           acceptable under these sacred circumstances. 

           You see, the dignified Pastor.... is stoned as fuck. 

           We PULL BACK and see him standing, maybe slightly swaying, 
           onstage. 

           He starts singing with the voice of an angel, the famous 
           hymn, “HIGHER GROUND.”

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        I’m pressing on the upward way,
                        New heights I’m gaining every day;
                        Still praying as I’m onward bound,
                        “Lord, plant my feet on higher 
                        ground.”
           We go to THE AUDIENCE -- the place is PACKED TO THE BRIM with 
           townsfolk, who all share Pastor Michael’s look - BLOODSHOT 
           RED EYES and BIG GOOFY SMILES ON THEIR FACES. They sing along 
           to the next verse, the music giving them goosebumps. They 
           feel so good, Jesus MUST be in the house today. 

                                 CROWD
                        Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
                        By faith, on Heaven’s tableland,
                        A higher plane than I have found;
                        Lord, plant my feet on higher 
                        ground.

           We CLOSE IN on ESTEE, watching the whole thing from the 
           audience. She’s smiling too, but maybe for different reasons. 
           She closes her eyes and sings with irreverent passion. 

                                 ESTEE
                        My heart has no desire to stay
                        Where doubts arise and fears 
                        dismay; Though some may dwell where 
                        those abound, My prayer, my aim, is 
                        higher ground.

           LATER

           The ceremony has ended and the crowd gets up to leave, 
           chatting as they go. Estee watches as people HUG EACH OTHER 
           in a way they never have before - genuinely, warmly, full 
           body, intimate - with no shame, fear or anger. Rowdy 
           teenagers hugging grandmas. Conservative church ladies 
           hugging immigrants. Right hugging left. Left hugging right. 
           Some hugs last an uncomfortably long time. 

           Chief Deputy Billy watches the whole thing, scratching his 
           head. Odd behavior for their town. Very odd. Something 
           suspicious going on. Something he can’t quite put his finger 
           on. 

           Estee’s smile grows bigger. 

           ENTER -- MONTAGE OF ESTEE MICRO-DOSING THE SHIT OUT OF THE 
           ENTIRE TOWN --

           * Estee baking at home, bringing together a congregation of 
           disparate materials, manipulated into one cohesive, smooth, 
           harmonious cookie batter in her skilled hands. (YOU GET THE

           but Estee SLAPS his hand away. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, “Chief.” Too sugary for 
                        someone of your poor health. Tell 
                        you what, I’ll make you a healthy 
                        salad some day soon.

           She winks at him with derision and walks off with the 
           cupcakes. He watches her go, suspicion growing. 

           * Estee delivers a sponge cake to an OLD FOLKS HOME. 

           * Estee sits on a bench, watching the SLOWLY TRANSFORMING 
           TOWN, gone from tense, ugly, divided, full of hatred, fear 
           and paranoia -- to goofy, giggly, innocent and child-like.

           * For the first time in twenty years, Doomsday Steve rises 
           from his porch, lays down his rifle on the ground and helps

           * Kenny and his gang of pro-life trolls still hang outside 
           the Planned Parenthood clinic - except they seem to have

           it with the patients as they walk by.  

           * Sid the name calling racist redneck runs wildly in the 
           street after a PACK OF LOOSE PUPPIES, giggling hysterically.

           * Mr. Shelby hugs a tree for no reason. 

           * We go CLOSE on ESTEE, watching the seemingly positive 
           influence of everything she’s done, a huge smile on her face, 
           wiped off momentarily... by pangs of guilt. 

           END MONTAGE

           INT. WEED SHOP - LATER

           Estee walks in to find Gabe stocking shelves. 
                                 ESTEE
                        Hey partner! 

           He looks her over.

                                 GABE
                        Well you’re looking better.

                                 ESTEE
                        What can I say... Jesus came to me 
                        in the kitchen.

                                 GABE
                        Hallelujah. 

                                 ESTEE
                        So I wanted to run something by you 
                        real quick. I wouldn’t call it an--
                        (exaggerated quotation 
                         mark fingers)
                        “ethical dilemma”, cuz that sounds 
                        dramatic, but basically... I’ve 
                        kinda been using the weed for 
                        baking. And, you know, I’ve kinda 
                        been handing out said baked goods, 
                        and sort of, in a small roundabout 
                        way, kinda micro-dosing the entire 
                        town without their knowledge. Just 
                        a little bit. Just like a low-key 
                        fun amount. And I just wanted to 
                        run that by you, super casually, 
                        since it feels like a very light 
                        grey-area moral issue...

           Gabe stops what he’s doing and stares at her. 

                                 GABE
                        Oh yeah, no, that’s 100% morally 
                        wrong.

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright, sounds like we’re kind of 
                        unsure on where this stands 
                        ethically.

                                 GABE
                        No, it’s definitely absolutely 
                        ethically wrong.

           Gabe walks back to the counter. She follows him like a 
           deranged puppy. 
                                 ESTEE
                        I mean yeah, 100%, totally hearing 
                        you, but also, at the same time, is 
                        it? Sounds like a real thinker. You 
                        know?

                                 GABE
                        No it doesn’t. It’s wrong. Period.

                                 ESTEE
                        Yeah, but you know. In this era... 
                        in this country... in this 
                        presidency... Right... Wrong.. It’s 
                        all kinda upside down, ya know?

                                 GABE
                        That’s not an excuse.

                                 ESTEE
                        You know what. This sounds like a 
                        complex 50-50 dilemma we both need 
                        to sleep on. 

                                 GABE
                        No we don’t. Clear as day. 
                        Absolutely wrong.

                                 ESTEE
                        (ignoring him)
                        So until we decide, I’m just gonna 
                        need a casual kilo real quick so I 
                        can keep micro-dosing the town, 
                        because frankly, it makes them 
                        more... 
                        (thinks)
                        Cuddly, and less... 
                        (thinks)
                        Evil... and I like that. 

           Gabe shakes his head.

                                 GABE
                        It’s illegal to sell that much. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Please.

           But he just shakes his head. Estee thinks how to sway him. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Hey... you said you came here to 
                        learn about the other side. How 
                        about an official... 
                                 (MORE)

                        first-of-its-kind Jacksboro tour 
                        from a hardcore life-long local?

           Gabe smiles. 

           TOUR MONTAGE (TOO MANY MONTAGES? NEVER!!)

           Estee leads Gabe through various streets and corners, using 
           secret passages, doors and alleyways only the hardcore locals 
           know about. As they weave through hidden corners and secret 
           nooks, she gives him little monologues, he just listens and 
           smiles. Down one street --

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        This is the crack den formerly 
                        known as a Piggly Wiggly’s.  

           Down another street --

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        This is where I had my first kiss! 
                        Also where a man shot an entire 
                        family because the baby looked at 
                        him funny.

           Down another street - 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Oh man, there used to be a great 
                        Chinese restaurant here all the 
                        families would go to for special 
                        occasions like graduations and 
                        such. It had the cool lanterns, the 
                        little personal dish heaters, the 
                        lazy susans, everything!! Then it 
                        got burned down “”by accident”” and 
                        now it’s an Autozone with a black 
                        market gun shop in the back. Anyhoo-

           Down another street - 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        This is where I used to take ballet 
                        classes. Ages 4 to 13! Had to quit 
                        when they switched to point. My 
                        toes weren’t built to stand 
                        upright, you know? Also this is 
                        where the KKK rally convenes when 
                        they roll into town.

           Down another street, unremarkable in every way -- but Estee’s 
           face darkens.
                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        This is where my parents died. It 
                        was a... 
                        (a beat)
                        Let’s just keep going.  

           Gabe’s face fills with empathy. 

                                 GABE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Let me take you to the best slash 
                        only ice cream place in town! 

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Estee and Gabe walk down a shaded suburban street, ice cream 
           in hands. 

                                 ESTEE
                        So tell me again about ending up 
                        here? Cuz I still don’t buy it, no 
                        offense. 

                                 GABE
                        (smiles)
                        Well. The short long short version 
                        is... I finished college. Public 
                        policy. Real sexy stuff.

                                 ESTEE
                        Too sexy, some might say.

                                 GABE
                        And I saw things falling apart and 
                        I wanted to help fix them. So I 
                        started working in politics. In 
                        campaigns. Fast forward a few 
                        months... I’m in a purple bathrobe 
                        that’s not even mine, lying on the 
                        carpet of a house that isn’t mine, 
                        trying to find a reason to get up 
                        and start my day and failing, day 
                        after day after day. Beard down to 
                        here.

                                 ESTEE
                        Sounds familiar. Minus the beard.
           [QUICK FLASHBACK to Estee lying bed drunk with a bottle of 
           whiskey singing “Kiiiiill me.... Kiiiiiiiill me...”]

                                 GABE
                        What happened here... What’s been 
                        happening here... In this country. 
                        I just didn’t see it coming. Nobody 
                        did. And I entered something 
                        like... a crisis of faith. But not 
                        Christian faith. Human faith. Faith 
                        in humanity.

                                 ESTEE
                        Sounds painfully familiar.

                                 GABE
                        And when I finally got up off the 
                        floor... I told myself I have to 
                        find a way to reaffirm my faith. I 
                        have to believe again. So I came 
                        here. For one last ditch effort. 

                                 ESTEE
                        And if the verdict is we’re all 
                        garbage?

                                 GABE
                        I dunno... What would an old... 
                        grizzled.. Cowboy do round these 
                        here parts if he got tired of 
                        living?

                                 ESTEE
                        Shotgun to the head. 

           Gabe smiles, nods - Bingo. Estee marvels at that. Looks at 
           Gabe in a new way. His depression and suicidal tendencies a 
           clear turn-on for her. 

           She stops and grabs his hand in hers without thinking.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Well Gabriel. I think you and me 
                        are a lot alike. And I think you’re 
                        the kind of person who wants to 
                        change things for the better. And 
                        here in front of us is a golden 
                        opportunity to do that. So I think 
                        we should go into business together 
                        and give this a shot. And if it 
                        doesn’t work, we can give each 
                        other a shot. To the head. What do 
                        you think?
           Gabe looks down at their held hands. Estee looks down too. 
           They quickly yank their hands apart, but CUT TO --

           DING! CLOSE on Gabe handing Estee a giant bag full of weed. 
           We’re back at the --

           INT. WEED SHOP - CONT’D

                                 ESTEE
                        Thank you. This is good. You’ll 
                        see. This will be good. 

                                 GABE
                        Mm hmmm. These cuddly townsfolk 
                        aren’t gonna be so cuddly when they 
                        find out what you’ve been doing to 
                        them without their consent, you 
                        know. 

                                 ESTEE
                        We’ll cross that proverbial shit 
                        bridge when we get there. Consider 
                        it a grand experiment in humanity! 
                        Your main purpose for being here, 
                        after all. 

                                 GABE
                        OK, well... I hope you have a fire 
                        extinguisher at home. Because 
                        they’ll be coming with torches. And 
                        pitchforks.

                                 ESTEE
                        Ha, Gabe, please. What do you think 
                        this is, Deliverance? You jaded 
                        west coast hippie. It’s gonna be 
                        great. You’ll see! 

           She slaps some money on the table and runs out.

           A beat. She peeks her head back through the door.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not the enemy, right?

           He considers. Smiles. 

                                 GABE
                        TBD.

           Fair. She smiles, nods, heads out. Gabe watches her go. Is 
           that love in his eyes? Hard to tell, they’re so red.
           EXT. TOWN HALL - DAY

           At a protest outside town hall, sporting signs that demand 
           closing the weed shop, “RID US OF THIS DEVIL’S LETTUCE!”-- 
           Sheryl and her gang of RIGHTEOUS CHURCH SISTERS are giggling 
           uncontrollably as they nibble on some of Estee’s specialty 
           PINK CUPCAKES.

                        I’ve been feeling so good lately. 

                                 RIGHTEOUS SISTER #1
                        Me too! I’m like... Laughing all 
                        the time.

                                 RIGHTEOUS SISTER #2
                        (whispers)
                        And my appetite is out of control! 
                        Need an ice cream IV for my vein 
                        with the amount I’ve been eating! 
                        I’m like - Is this early menopause?

                                 SHERYL
                        God forbid! But GIRL, SAME. Except 
                        funny thing is... 
                        (whispers)
                        I don’t even care about my weight 
                        that much anymore??

                                 RIGHTEOUS SISTER #3
                        Um, speaking of sweets, your 
                        sister’s baking... #addicted. 

                                 RIGHTEOUS SISTER #2
                        SERIOUSLY. And every time she feeds 
                        them to us it’s like “ACK! SUGAR 
                        HIGH! SOS! SOMEONE HELP ME!” 

           As the Righteous sisters continue to giggle, we CLOSE IN on 
           Sheryl, looking at their weed shop protest signs... she 
           starts to put it together. The weed shop. Estee. The Bud 
           Light. The cookies. The giddiness. The high... A range of 
           expressions on her face. She slowly walks up to the box of 
           cupcakes on the table, and with anger and panic, slides them 
           into the trash.  

           She stares at the trash for a long beat. Then, torn, she 
           takes the cupcakes out of the trash and puts them back on the 
           table. 
           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Estee, incredibly stoned, blood shot eyes, sits in the center 
           of a BAKED GOODS EMPIRE. Cookies, cakes, pastries, the works.

           She closes her eyes. And starts singing... AMAZING GRACE. 

           She sings it comically, Mariah Carey minus talent, drawing 
           out certain notes and adding cringe worthy embellishments to 
           every other word.

                                 ESTEE
                        Amaaa......
                        (longest pause)
                        ... zing graaeaeaeaaaaace. How...
                        (longest pause)
                        Sweet, the...
                        (longest pause)
                        ... Souoeuouououn---

           BANG BANG BANG. LOUD BANGING on her front door makes her JUMP 
           and grab her chest.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Oh Jesus!

           She waits a beat. Maybe it’ll go away. 

           BANG BANG BANG. Fuck.

           She runs to the window, peeks out the curtains. 

           Gabe was right. Deliverance is here -- as outside her door 
           stands THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, VERY ANGRY EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR 
           FACES. (Are they holding torches or are those just 
           cellphones? Kind of hard to tell.)

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        (hushed)
                        Oh shit. Oh fuck. Shit. FUCK. SHIT.

           BANG BANG BANG. 

           Estee looks all around. Nowhere to run nowhere to hide. She 
           runs to the kitchen. Grabs a knife. Then puts it down. Grabs 
           a broom. Then puts it down. UGH, THINK, STONED BRAIN, THINK. 

           BANG BANG BANG. 

           Finally, she grabs a can of COOL WHIP. Yeah. That’s a good 
           weapon, stoned brain, great job. Wielding the can, she walks 
           up to the door and opens it. She puts a big smile on her 
           face.
                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        OH HEYYYY. Hey there, ev.. 
                        Everybody! What a nice surprise! 
                        And it’s not even my birthday for 
                        another month!

           They stare her down, angrily.

                                 SHERYL
                        We know what you’ve been doing, 
                        Estee. 

                                 KENNY
                        And it ain’t fucking right. 

                                 ESTEE
                        What? What are you talking about?! 
                        Is it my singing in public? I know 
                        my voice is an acquired taste, so I 
                        get it. You know what, fine. You 
                        got me. I’ll stop. No more singing 
                        in public. I give you my word!

                                 SHERYL
                        No, Estee. It’s that... that... 
                        (whispers)
                        Devils lettuce.

                                 ESTEE
                        I’m sorry, what?

                                 SHERYL
                        (whispers)
                        Devil’s lettuce. 

                                 ESTEE
                        I’m sorry, what?

                                 SHERYL
                        (whispers)
                        Devil’s lettuce. 

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        Oh quit it! WE KNOW. We know what 
                        you’ve been up to. And it is a 
                        serious crime.

                                 SHERYL
                        If the Sheriff found out about 
                        this...

                                 KENNY
                        Or hell, even Chief Deputy Billy...
           Estee drops the smiley act. Fuck these guys. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright cool. Am I going to prison 
                        for the rest of my life or what? 
                        Fuck this shit, happy to leave. I’d 
                        be happier in a jail cell than in 
                        the fucking Dante’s Inferno eternal 
                        purgatory shitstorm hell hole that 
                        is this town. So let’s go. Lock me 
                        the fuck up. 

           Murmurs, nudges and the clearing of throats. No one wants to 
           speak up. Finally -- 

                                 KENNY
                        (quietly)
                        Well... Not so fast.

                                 ESTEE
                        Huh?

                                 SHERYL
                        (almost inaudible)
                        Estee... While this is a serious 
                        crime... We’re willing to let this 
                        slide... 

                                 ESTEE
                        Huh?

                                 MR. SHELBY
                        (a faint whisper)
                        If... You keep making it... for us.

                                 ESTEE
                        Huh?

                                 KENNY
                        We want more. 

                                 ESTEE
                        More... Weed? I mean. The weed 
                        store’s right there. Why don’t you 
                        just buy some for yourself? 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        BECAUSE IT’S THE DEVIL’S LETTUCE! 

                                 ESTEE
                        But... It’s still the devil’s 
                        lettuce in my baking. 
                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah... but that’s... You know... 
                        Different. It’s baked goods! Baked 
                        goods are innocent... and 
                        wholesome... And it’s... out of our 
                        control.... If... You keep serving 
                        it to us... And... We keep eating 
                        it... innocently and unknowingly. I 
                        mean, you’re basically forcing our 
                        hands here. It’s your sin, not 
                        ours. We’re the victims here.

                                 KENNY
                        It’s a fun little loophole!

           Estee just stares, digesting all of this. 

                                 ESTEE
                        I mean... 
                        (a beat)
                        OK. Sure. 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        Great. That’ll be all. Goodnight. 

           The entire crowd turns on their heels and walks off, leaving 
           Estee standing there, incredulous. 

           A beat. She bursts out laughing for a long long time. 
           MEANWHILE--

           INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

           Chief Deputy Billy sits slumped at his desk, a bored 
           depressed look on his face. He picks up a SHERIFF ACTION 
           FIGURE that looks just like him. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        And now we’d like to bring to the 
                        stage, a man... nay... a hero... 
                        who saved the town... and the 
                        country... from itself... And the 
                        crowd goes wild... 
                        (whispers)
                        Ahhhhh... Ahhhhhhhhhh.

           Suddenly, his computer screen comes alive with a FACETIME 
           CALL from Daddy, aka SHERIFF WILLIAM GABLES. 

           Chief Deputy Billy immediately straightens in his chair, an 
           urgent look on his face. He smooths down his uniform, hair, 
           then answers the call. 
           SHERIFF WILLIAM GABLES, 50’s, large and intimidating, appears 
           on the screen. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Son.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Dad. Father. Sir.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Holding it down?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Absolutely. 100%. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Anything to report?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        (thinking long and hard)
                        No. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Go on.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        That’s it.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Then why the concerned look?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        (debating, finally)
                        Well that’s just it. Father. Sir. 
                        It’s been quiet. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Ain’t that a good thing?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Real quiet. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Too quiet?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Too quiet. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Quiet how?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        People getting along quiet.
                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        (mulling this over)
                        I don’t like it.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Me neither.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        America doesn’t work like that. 
                        Social harmony... It’s not for us. 
                        People getting along... It could 
                        undermine everything we’ve worked 
                        so hard to build over the past few 
                        centuries. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        You mean capitalism and the war 
                        machine?

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        (ignoring him)
                        Find out more. Find out what’s 
                        behind this... Quiet. Could be a 
                        cult situation. You know folks love 
                        their cults down here. Or could be 
                        Russian interference, trying to 
                        undermine the very essence of our 
                        democracy. Find out what Kool-Aid 
                        they’re drinking, son, and how we 
                        take it away before it gets 
                        poisoned.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        I get that reference.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Good. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        And you got it, sir father. I’ll 
                        look into it. You can count on m--

           CLICK. The line goes dead. No love from the old man. 

           Chief Deputy Billy picks up the Sheriff action figure again. 
           Brings it up to his face. Stares at it. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Time to make daddy proud. Chief Deputy Billy walks up to a 
           mechanic, SHANE, 50’s.
                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Shane. Awfully quiet lately, ain’t 
                        it?

                                 SHANE
                        Sure is.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Any clue why?

                                 SHANE
                        Nope.

           Awkward silence. Billy doesn’t know where to take it from 
           here. A little green on the investigating front. Finally--

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Well I’ll see ya. 

                                 SHANE
                        Sounds good.

           A block away, he approaches THREE KIDS ON BIKES.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Kids. Awfully quiet ar--

                                 KID
                        We didn’t do it!

           The Kids quickly pedal away. Crud. He walks a few blocks 
           down, spots TWO GRANDMAS on a park bench. Bingo. Approaches.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Agnes. Ethel. 

           The two grandmas just stare. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Awfully quiet around here, ain’t 
                        it?

           The two grandmas grunt. Grandma #1 rummages in her purse, 
           takes out a MYSTERIOUS OBJECT wrapped in a few used 
           KLEENEXES. With agonizing slowness, Chief Deputy Billy 
           watches as she unwraps the object, revealing... A COOKIE. 
           Looks like Estee’s cookie. Slowly, she snaps it in half and 
           offers Grandma #1 the other half. The Two Grandmas nibble 
           slowly in silence, watching Chief Deputy Billy.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Well alright then. Thank you for 
                        your time.  
           With that he walks away. They watch him go.

                                 GRANDMA #1
                        Is he real or am I hallucinatin’?

           Grandma #2 shrugs, grunts. 

           INT. WEED SHOP - LATER

           Chief Deputy Billy enters the weed shop, takes it all in. 
           Finds Gabe reading a book behind the counter. Panic crosses 
           Gabe’s face for a moment, then he settles back into his 
           stoner expression. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Greetings. Chief Deputy Billy. 

                                 GABE
                        Hi there. Gabe. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Pretty quiet round here.

                                 GABE
                        Yep.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        How’s business?

                                 GABE
                        Quiet. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Not a lot of clientele. 

                                 GABE
                        Nope. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        How you stay in business then?

           DING! As if on cue, in walks Estee. Chief Deputy Billy rolls 
           his eyes.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Wow. Color me surprised. 

           Estee walks past Billy. They stare each other down with 
           mutual suspicion and disdain.

           She stands by the counter, saying nothing, waiting for Billy 
           to leave. He stares at her, not moving. Gabe stares at them 
           both. A stand-off.
           A long beat. Finally, Chief Deputy Billy heads towards the 
           exit.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Y’all have a good day now, ya hear?

           Estee cynically salutes at him. Waits for him to exit. He 
           does. Then she turns to Gabe, all smiles.  

                                 ESTEE
                        Ugh. Ignore him. Toothless. His 
                        daddy’s the real cop and he’s MIA. 
                        Anyhoo - Howdy Partner! Turns out 
                        you were right. Re: Deliverance. 
                        Torches. Pitchforks. The works! 
                        Except guess what. They... 
                        (wink)
                        Gave me their banjo, if you know 
                        what I mean.

                                 GABE
                        (blinks)
                        Have you seen Deliverance?

                                 ESTEE
                        No. But! This is huge. The town 
                        wants our business, Gabe. 
                        Everything you were worried about - 
                        immorality, lack of ethics, 
                        illegality blah blah etc. Out the 
                        window! They give us full consent 
                        to drug them! 

           This doesn’t seem to soothe Gabe.

                                 GABE
                        Huh.

                                 ESTEE
                        This is great. Makes our experiment 
                        less shady and more righteous. 
                        So... Full steam ahead! Just need 
                        another super casual kilo and it’s 
                        BAKE O’CLOCK! 

                                 GABE
                        I dunno, Estee...

                                 ESTEE
                        Please Gabe. A chance to change 
                        things. Together. A rare chance... 
                        To see the good in humans. Like we 
                        said. Give it a shot. Or a shot to 
                        the head. Please?
           Gabe hesitates. Is that love in his eyes? Hard to tell, 
           they’re so red. Eventually, like always, he folds.

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Estee enters her kitchen with MULTIPLE LARGE SHOPPING BAGS. 

           She takes out SEVERAL POUNDS OF FLOUR. Roughly 80 eggs. 40 
           sticks of butter. And other insane amounts of baking 
           ingredients. She gets to work. Bringing all the disparate 
           ingredients to life in her skilled hands, when THERE’S A 
           KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Her clothes full of flour, she opens. 

           Standing there is GLADYS, the town’s ancient, very legal 
           Colombian grandma. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Gladys! Oh thank god, Sheriff 
                        asshole let you go?

                                 GLADYS
                        Yes, it was.. A misunderstanding. 
                        Don’t worry.

           But then Gladys crosses her arms, a disapproving parental 
           look on her face. 

                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        I ate your cookie.

                                 ESTEE
                        (swallows)
                        Look, Gladys, I know what you’re 
                        thinking. It’s immoral, maybe 
                        borderline unethical, maybe just a 
                        smidge illegal, but--

                                 GLADYS
                        If you’re going to do it, Ms. 
                        Esterella, do it right. 

           With that, Gladys pushes past Estee into the kitchen, puts an 
           apron on and starts arranging the baking ingredients her way -
           like someone who has been to this kitchen before countless 
           times over the years and knows where everything is. Estee 
           follows her, in surprise and awe.

           Gladys takes the marijuana buds and the butter, and starts 
           manipulating them with an expertise way beyond Estee’s skill 
           level.
                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        You can increase the potency in the 
                        bake by decarboxylating the kief. 

                                 ESTEE
                        De-whatting the what? 

                                 GLADYS
                        Just watch.

           Gladys continues to work. Estee continues to watch, her eyes 
           growing wider.

                                 ESTEE
                        Gladys, you minx! I didn’t know you 
                        knew how to do this kinda stuff! 

                                 GLADYS
                        (in Spanish)
                        What, you think I was always an 
                        ancient grandma? I used to be young 
                        like you, you know. 

           Estee starts taking notes on everything Gladys is doing. 

           ENTER -- BAKING MONTAGE

           * Gladys teaches Estee how to elevate her weed baking skills. 
           Together they make - Cakes. Pies. Cookies. Pastries. 

           * Estee and Gladys pull more and more trays out of the oven.

           * CLOSE ON - THE WINDOW SILL. Where several BAKED WEED GOODS 
           such as pies and cakes now sit, piping hot, like a Saturday 
           morning cartoon. Next to the goods - a JAR with some bills in 
           it, marked “PAY WHAT YOU CAN.”

           * HANDS grab the BAKED goods from the window sill.

           * Estee and Gladys pull more and more trays out of the oven.

           * The Money jar slowly fills and empties.

           * Estee places more and more baked goods at the window sill. 

           END MONTAGE

           The sun has set. After a good day’s work, Gladys and Estee 
           sit at the kitchen table, now stoned off their own baked 
           goods, still nibbling, laughing their asses off together.

           Estee counts the money from the jar. Not too shabby. She 
           hands a cut to Gladys, who pockets it. 
           As Estee continues counting, Gladys suddenly GRABS HER ARM, 
           turns it over. Inspects it. There’s a new RASH there. Like an 
           eczema flare-up. Pink and raw. Gladys gives Estee a concerned 
           knowing look. Estee yanks her arm back, shrugs it off.

                                 ESTEE
                        It’s nothing. It’s not gonna be bad 
                        like it used to. I just had a 
                        stressful week. Don’t worry. 

           Gladys scrutinizes Estee. Finally, she smiles. 

                                 GLADYS
                        The day I stop worrying about you 
                        is the day I die. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Well guess we’re looking at 70 more 
                        years of worrying then, Gladys. 
                        Might wanna take some cookies for 
                        the road.

           They smile at each other. Gladys stands. Gathers her things. 
           Estee walks her to the door. They hug. Break apart. Gladys 
           grabs Estee’s face with her hands.

                                 GLADYS
                        I want you to think about what 
                        you’re doing here. You have an 
                        opportunity. To do good. To fix 
                        things. To fix this place. Don’t 
                        waste it.

           Estee stares, feeling a little disturbed, emotional. Gladys 
           pats her on the head and leaves. Estee stares at the closed 
           door, thinking hard. 

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           TV is open to the local news. Estee walks in with an OLD 
           COLORFUL BOX marked “HIGH SCHOOL.” 

           She stares at it, heavy hearted. Then opens the lid. On top 
           sits her yearbook. She reluctantly opens it, flips over to 
           her class. Finds her picture. It’s her but it’s like a 
           different person. Smiling. Hopeful. Emotionally intact. 
           Before shit went bad. 

           She flips a few more pages, a FAMILY PHOTO falls out. Her 
           parents, her and Sheryl. Everybody’s smiling. Happy. 
           Wholesome. A perfect family. Estee stares at it, a million 
           emotions on her face, then she quickly slips it back into the 
           yearbook and puts it away, as if it’s contagious. 
           [QUICK FLASHBACK of Estee at the bus stop, the bus leaves 
           without her, she didn’t have the courage to get on it.]

           Back in her living room, she reaches for the thing she’s been 
           looking for - a LARGE PAD OF COLORFUL PAPERS. And some 
           COLORFUL MARKERS. 

           She places them on the carpet, and starts making large SIGNS, 
           the content of which we don’t yet see. 

           EXT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Across the street, in the dark, Chief Deputy Billy sits on a 
           bench. He raises BINOCULARS. He scribbles something into an 
           empty notebook.

           Suddenly, Estee’s head peeks through a window.

                                 ESTEE
                        Can I fucking help you, you giant 
                        creepy perv?

           Chief Deputy Billy bolts out of his seat, pretends to be 
           investigating a nearby lamp post.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Nope. Just making the rounds. 
                        Official police business. Go back 
                        inside! That’s er, an order!

           She watches him for a beat.

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright, you fucking weirdo.

           She goes back inside. 

           EXT. PARK - MORNING

           Estee, with a backpack, starts hanging up her colorful signs. 
           We see the content for the first time - “CLEAN THE PARK, GET 
           A COOKIE.” 

           She finishes hanging up her signs, and sets up shop by a 
           bench, laying out cleaning supplies and an appetizing jar of 
           cookies, no longer available on her window sill. Finished, 
           she waits.  

           Slowly, RANDOM PEOPLE show up. Unemployed folks. Bored folks. 
           Do-gooders. New weed addicts. They see the signs. Some of 
           them keep walking. But some of them pause. Smile. Grab a 
           cookie and get to work. 
           Estee watches as a bunch of GOOD SAMARITANS, stoned out of 
           their gourds, lovingly pick up trash, paint benches, plant 
           new flowers and seeds, and scrub away hate graffiti. 
           Occasionally they stop, forgetting where they are. Some take 
           naps. Or talk to trees. An OLD COUPLE makes out. But mostly, 
           they’re all productive, and the neglected park starts looking 
           brand new. Estee smiles.

                        This one’s for you, Gladys. 

           INT. DINER - SAME TIME

           Chief Deputy Billy sits at the counter, observing the 
           passerby’s. Everybody is getting along. Laughing. Chatting. 
           Weird combinations of people you wouldn’t normally see. And 
           they’re all eating... A lot. Strange. Very strange. He 
           scribbles down notes on a tiny notebook. The TV catches his 
           attention.

           ON TV -- The local Jacksboro news. News anchor SANDRA 
           DINGRANDO faces the camera in a sharp suit.

                                 SANDRA DINGRANDO (ON TV)
                        Local law enforcement reports an 
                        astonishing 80% drop in crime rates 
                        -- and at the same time -- a steep 
                        incline in fast food establishment 
                        related burglaries. We now go live 
                        to Papa John’s on Cecil Street, 
                        where teen employee Kevin Rodriguez 
                        was held at gunpoint only 
                        yesterday. 

           ON TV - Footage of the local PAPA JOHN’S. 

                                 KEVIN (ON TV)
                        The guy... He had a gun in one hand 
                        and a hamster in the other. I 
                        thought that was kind of weird, but 
                        I wasn’t gonna argue with the gun 
                        part. Anyways, he stole eight extra 
                        large pizzas, and... that’s it. Oh 
                        and all the mozzarella sticks. But 
                        that’s it. Didn’t even take any 
                        cash from the register, which I 
                        thought was odd. 

           Chief Deputy Billy takes it all in, thinking hard.
           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Estee baking and baking and baking. An empire of baked goods. 
           Baked goods placed on the window sill. Grabbed by random 
           hands. Cash dropped into the JAR. 

           A KNOCK on the door. Estee, covered in flour, the rash on her 
           arm growing, opens the door. 

           It’s KENNY. Her Planned Parenthood mortal enemy.

                                 ESTEE
                        God, what?! You don’t need to come 
                        inside, just grab what you want and 
                        drop some cash in the jar.

           Kenny breaks into a smile. Fuck, he’s already stoned.

                                 KENNY
                        I know. I just thought. You know, 
                        maybe we could...

           Estee rolls her eyes. CUT TO --

           EXT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - PORCH - SUNSET

           Estee and Kenny sit on rocking chairs on her porch. They’re 
           now both stoned. 

                                 KENNY
                        It’s a good thing you’re doing. 
                        Don’t let anyone tell you 
                        otherwise.

                                 ESTEE
                        (cynical)
                        Thanks, Kenny. Coming from you, 
                        that means a lot.

                                 KENNY
                        You know... I knit.

                                 ESTEE
                        You’re a nit? Tell me something I 
                        don’t know.

                                 KENNY
                        No. I knit. I’m a knitter. I knit.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh... OK. Weird. But OK.
                                 KENNY
                        Ever since I turned... I dunno... 
                        20-something. I’ve had this...

           He raises his hand to where his chest is. He starts shaking 
           his hand manically. It’s disturbing.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had this... Unrest. This 
                        rage... This fear... Whatever the 
                        fuck you wanna call it. And... It 
                        just showed up. And it wouldn’t 
                        leave. I felt like it was eating me 
                        alive. And I didn’t know what to do 
                        with it. 

           [QUICK FLASHBACK to Estee at the bus stop. The bus leaves 
           without her. She didn’t have the courage to leave.]

                                 ESTEE
                        I get that.

                                 KENNY
                        (stoned)
                        I’m sorry, what are we talking 
                        about?

                                 ESTEE
                        Rage. Fear. Paralysis.

                                 KENNY
                        Oh yeah yeah yeah. And I saw 
                        something on TV. One of them TV 
                        doctors. They said people like me 
                        need to find... a hobby... to focus 
                        them... to focus their hands. 
                        Something that’ll.... exhaust you 
                        till you don’t feel that... that.. 
                        (his hand shakes more)
                        Shakiness anymore... So I chose 
                        knitting.

                                 ESTEE
                        And?

                                 KENNY
                        Shit. It worked. For a while. Must 
                        have knitted... some fifty, sixty 
                        scarves? Twenty sweaters. Even some 
                        dang mittens! Got my whole family 
                        fully outfitted for many, many 
                        winters to come. 

           Estee laughs. Kenny laughs too. But then he frowns.
                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        But then... one day... it wore off. 
                        Then I got angry again. And it got 
                        bad. Real bad. And I did some shit 
                        I ain’t proud of. But then Jesus... 
                        He came to me.

                                 ESTEE
                        In the shower, we know.

                                 KENNY
                        That’s right. But here’s the 
                        kicker. Gonna tell you a secret 
                        right here.... 
                        (whispers)
                        Even he didn’t stick around. One 
                        day the ease was gone and I was on 
                        my own with the shakes again. I 
                        thought I was fucked for real this 
                        time. Till I ate your cookies.

           Estee smiles. Didn’t see that coming.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Now to be clear - I’m not cured. 
                        I’ll never be cured. And I know 
                        that now. But this... This makes it 
                        more... manageable. So I figure, 
                        somewhere between your baking, 
                        Jesus and the knitting... I can get 
                        by... I can.

           His hand still on his heart, shaking. Suddenly he stops. The 
           hand goes still.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        I can be OK. I think.

           Estee smiles. Without thinking, she grabs his hand, squeezes 
           it. They hold hands for a second, then she quickly recoils. 
           He recoils too. He stands.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        So I guess all this to say... Thank 
                        you. I know you and me have had a 
                        rough go at it. And I know how you 
                        hate this place and everybody in 
                        it. And how life dealt you a shit 
                        hand and all that. But I want you 
                        to know that you did good. With 
                        your hand. You did good.

           Estee stands. Tears up.
                                 ESTEE
                        Thanks Kenny. 

           Moment of truth... Do they dare... hug? Neither of them 
           budges. 

                                 KENNY
                        OK I’m gonna go now. 

                                 ESTEE
                        OK. Bye Kenny.

           They just stand there for a moment. Finally, he nods and 
           leaves. She watches him go. She breaks into a smile. She 
           feels something creeping in... a feeling she hasn’t felt in 
           many years... Pride. 

           She watches the purple sky, the sun disappearing behind the 
           horizon. Then she feels a presence there. And smoke.

           She turns her head to it. It’s Gabe, on her lawn, smoking a 
           joint. Is that jealousy in his eyes? Hard to tell, they’re so 
           red. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, you scared me. How’d you 
                        know where I live?

           He climbs up the porch steps.

                                 GABE
                        It’s a small town. Everybody knows 
                        everything. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh. OK. Well. You want something to 
                        drink? Wanna come inside?

                                 GABE
                        No. Listen. I’ve been thinking... I 
                        don’t want to do this with you 
                        anymore. The experiment. I’m done.

                                 ESTEE
                        What?! But we’re making such a 
                        difference in this town!

                                 GABE
                        I have to doctor my receipts. 
                        Divide your purchases into multiple 
                        fake accounts cuz you’re buying so 
                        much and you’re the only client. I 
                        could go to jail. For a long, long 
                        time. I did not come here for this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I did not come here for any... 
                        complications.

                                 ESTEE
                        Please, Gabe. This is... This is 
                        the only thing I have. This is the 
                        only thing I’m good at... This.

           Gabe loses his temper for the first time.

                                 GABE
                        I don’t care! I’m not from here! I 
                        don’t know any of you people! 
                        That’s not my problem! You’re not 
                        my problem! You’re not-- Jesus, 
                        what’s that on your arm?

           He grabs her arm, sees the rash. It’s growing. She yanks her 
           arm back, protectively. 

                                 ESTEE
                        It’s nothing. I told you. I have a 
                        skin condition.

                                 GABE
                        Yeah, that... doesn’t look good. 
                        Have you been to the lake?

                                 ESTEE
                        Fuck the lake, Gabe! There is no 
                        lake! The lake doesn’t exist! The 
                        lake is a lie! It’s like that cat 
                        in the box, you don’t know if it’s 
                        alive or dead.

                                 GABE
                        Schrodinger's cat?

                                 ESTEE
                        Yes! It’s Schrodinger’s lake.

                                 GABE
                        No it’s not! It’s a real lake that 
                        definitely factually exists.

           (Stoner arguments, man.)

                                 ESTEE
                        Not to me! I’ve never been.

                        You know there’s a world that 
                        exists outside your point of view, 
                        right?
                                 ESTEE
                        I’ll believe it when I see it.

                                 GABE
                        Wow. Small town mentality. So 
                        painfully typical. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Does condescension pass down in 
                        your genes where you come from or 
                        is it taught at local schools? Cuz 
                        I swear sometimes you woke big city 
                        fancy hipster liberals are more 
                        narrow minded than we, your so 
                        called enemy, has ever been.

                                 GABE
                        Grab a fucking jacket, cuz we’re 
                        going to the lake right now.

                                 ESTEE
                        It’s 80 degrees out, so I don’t 
                        need a damn jacket, and also I’m 
                        not fucking going. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           They’re going. Estee even put on a light jacket. They walk 
           down a street, a dark field up ahead. To their left they see 
           a beautifully lit yard, a large crowd gathered, someone 
           RECITING POETRY inside.

                                 ESTEE
                        It’s a new poetry night some local 
                        folks organized. Weed got them all 
                        creative and whatnot. 

                                 POETRY RECITER (O.S.)
                        (reading, muffled)
                        America. Amer.... Ica. She is my 
                        greatest love. And yet she betrays 
                        me thusly.

                                 ESTEE
                        (cringes)
                        Look, it’s not good poetry. But 
                        they’re expressing themselves! 
                        That’s healthy, you know? 

           LATER

           Gabe and Estee walk down a field, up a mountain, surrounded 
           by trees. The sun has fully set. 
           We’ve never been anywhere like this before in this story. 
           We’ve never been anywhere... pretty like this before. And as 
           odd as it seems - neither has Estee. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. Who knew this town had all 
                        this stupid beautiful nature in it.

                                 GABE
                        Literally everybody. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Not me. 

                                 GABE
                        If you read up on the town 
                        folklore, they say even Jesus 
                        visited this lake.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh yeah? Did he grab a red eye from 
                        the middle east? 

                                 GABE
                        Hey, I’m just telling you the 
                        story. Jesus descended into these 
                        down here waters... 
                        (whispers)
                        ...and vanished. 

           Estee’s eyes light up.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh man, do you think Jesus has been 
                        popping up in everyone’s showers 
                        because of the lake? Like maybe he 
                        just came to the lake, and like, 
                        peed in it a little? And it 
                        filtered into everyone’s showers? 
                        Since the town’s water source is 
                        this lake? So his juices end up in 
                        showers?

           Gabe just blinks. Estee stares at him, waiting for a 
           response.

                                 GABE
                        Oh I’m sorry, I thought that was a 
                        rhetorical question.

           They enter a deeper forested area. It’s a beautiful night.
                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        You seem different, you know, from 
                        when I met you. Not that I wanna 
                        take all the credit. 
                        (self conscious)
                        I mean... not me, the weed.

                                 ESTEE
                        I feel different. Less...

                   ESTEE (CONT'D)
           Sad.
                                                 GABE
                                       Angry and hateful and crazy.

           Estee smacks him. They laugh. They it gets quiet. Awkward.

                                 ESTEE
                        So what are you latest findings 
                        here? Since we’re all just lab rats 
                        in your grand political experiment. 

                                 GABE
                        Well, not much yet, but... There’s 
                        one thing. I think I figured out 
                        the secret to life. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh. Just that? Pff. Call me when 
                        you get something big.

                                 GABE
                        Wanna hear it?

                                 ESTEE 
                        Yes please.

                                 GABE
                        Are you sure?

                                 ESTEE
                        Yes!

           He keeps her waiting on purpose. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Fucking tell me!

                                 GABE
                        I’m not sure you’re ready.

           She SCREAMS. He laughs. 
                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        OK. OK. Jesus. Here it is...
                        (dramatic pause)
                        Everybody is very different... But 
                        we’re all unhappy in the same way. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (disappointed)
                        That’s it?!

                                 GABE
                        That’s it. Everybody has different 
                        moral codes... beliefs... 
                        Personalities... behaviors... 
                        Dreams... nightmares... enemies.... 
                        But once you strip down the 
                        circumstances.

           As he says this, he gently takes off her jacket. She recoils.

                                 ESTEE
                        What are you doing!

           He gently turns her around. And then she sees it for the 
           first time.

           THE LAKE.

           It’s real. And it’s beautiful. Surrounded by trees, the 
           crystal clear waters shine brightly as the moon reflects in 
           the ripples. 

           Estee’s eyes well up as she takes it in. Because something 
           this beautiful has no place in an ugly town like this. And 
           the fact that it exists -- and has existed this whole time --
           makes her angry. 

           And the fact that she’s being a pussy right now makes her 
           even angrier. Coward. She quickly wipes her tears away before 
           he sees.

                                 GABE
                        It’s OK. You don’t have to be 
                        strong all the time.

           But she doesn’t feel comfortable. She puts on a smile. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Race you there!

           She starts running towards the water. He blinks. Then runs 
           after her.
           They jump in with a big SPLASH. Estee squeals with joy and 
           laughter and surprise and, you know, weed.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! It’s real. 

           Gabe laughs at her reaction.

                                 GABE
                        I tried to tell you. 

           She starts swimming around, taking in the place. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh yeah, Jesus has definitely been 
                        here.

                                 GABE
                        You can feel it?

                                 ESTEE
                        I can feel it. 

           Suddenly, her eyes LIGHT UP.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        You should baptize me.

                                 GABE
                        Aren’t you already baptized?

                                 ESTEE
                        Yeah but... it’s been a while, 
                        and... everybody involved is dead, 
                        so... Let’s do it again!

                                 GABE
                        I don’t know that I know how.

                                 ESTEE
                        Just... hold my head underwater. 
                        And mutter some... garbage.. Or 
                        something.

                                 GABE
                        (unsure)
                        OK.

                                 ESTEE 
                        OK here we go!

           She grabs his hand, puts it on top of her head, and DIVES IN.
                                 GABE
                        Uh... Garbage... garbage garbage...
                        Garbage... May you find the peace 
                        and happiness you seek. Amen.

           A beat. He loosens his hand’s grip on her head, ready for her 
           to come up for air. But then HER hands shoot out of the 
           water, grab his hand, and force it to force her head down so 
           it stays underwater. Yikes.

           Look, guys, marijuana can help depression but it sure don’t 
           cure it. 

           Gabe starts to panic. Her head’s down there a long ass time. 
           He fights to free his hand from her hands. 

           Then everything goes still. Then she SHOOTS UP, GASPING FOR 
           AIR. Then she starts to laugh. And scream. And laugh.

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, you scared me.

                                 ESTEE
                        WOOOO! Now you have to say 
                        something official like... like... 
                        I now pronounce you...

                                 GABE
                        I now pronounce you...

                                 ESTEE
                        Born again.

                                 GABE
                        Christian?

                                 ESTEE
                        Just... born again is fine.

           They both giggle, taking in the water, the sky, the stars, 
           the moon. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        You want me to do you?!

                                 GABE
                        I’m good. 

           Gabe looks down from the sky and finds Estee staring at him.

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        What?
                                 ESTEE
                        Why are you really here? 

                                 GABE
                        I told you.

                                 ESTEE
                        What do you want?

                                 GABE
                        To know my enemy.

           She swims towards him. Gets close.

                                 ESTEE
                        Am I your enemy?

                                 GABE
                        Maybe.

           She swims closer.

                                 ESTEE
                        But I’m not like them, I’m like 
                        you.

                                 GABE
                        (bittersweet)
                        It’s fascinating that you think 
                        that.

           This gives her pause. She wasn’t expecting that. Then she 
           comes even closer. 

           Inches apart. A beat. They kiss. It’s sweet and tender. They 
           break apart and stare at each other.

                                 ESTEE
                        I’m not your enemy. I’ll show you. 
                        I’ll show you it’s a good thing 
                        we’re doing here. Let me show you. 
                        (thinks)
                        Come to church on Sunday. 

                                 GABE
                        That’s not really my thing.

                                 ESTEE
                        Please. Just come. 

           He nods. 
           EXT. SHERYL’S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           Estee, still dripping wet and high on life and romance and OK 
           maybe weed, BANGS on Sheryl’s door. A long beat.

           Then Sheryl opens the door. She looks... different. The 
           polish is gone. So are the structured suits. She wears 
           sweatpants. Dirty shirt. Dried chocolate ice cream around her 
           mouth. Eyes bloodshot red. She looks... plumper. More 
           disheveled... And a little lost. 

                                 SHERYL
                        Christ Estee, do you know what time 
                        it is?

                                 ESTEE 
                        YES I DO DEAR SISTER BUT I COULD 
                        NOT WAIT. For I am born again! I am 
                        free! I am ALIVE!

                                 SHERYL
                        Jesus, are you high?

                                 ESTEE
                        I mean... Yes. Aren’t you?

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah, that’s a fair point. 

           Sheryl leads Estee to porch chairs, they sit down and talk in 
           hushed tones. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Damn Sheryl, you don’t look so 
                        good. 

                                 SHERYL
                        I know. I... uh... I’m high all the 
                        time now. I can’t stop. It was fun, 
                        at first. But now... I don’t know. 
                        The entire town is... changing. It 
                        feels.. Different. Wrong. Immoral.

                                 ESTEE
                        Have you seen who’s running the 
                        country? Right and wrong are 
                        archaic terms, Sheryl. It’s all 
                        just chaos. Who cares!

                                 SHERYL
                        That’s not an excuse! You don’t 
                        emulate bad behavior. You lead by 
                        example. Leadership. That’s what we 
                        were taught.

                        That’s what mom and dad always used 
                        to say-- 
                        (quoting the bible)
                        “Pay careful attention to 
                        yourselves and to all the flock, in 
                        which the Holy Spirit has made you 
                        overseers, to care for... ugh... I 
                        forget... Oh yeah, the church of 
                        God, which he obtained with his 
                        own... blood or whatever.” Acts 
                        20... something something.

                                 ESTEE
                        Yeah OK sure but like, also, 
                        (quoting the bible)
                        “Not many of you, like, should 
                        become teachers, my brothers, for 
                        you know that we who teach will 
                        totally be judged with greater 
                        strictness. For we all stumble in 
                        MANY WAYS, Sheryl. And if anyone 
                        does not stumble in what he says, 
                        he is, like, a perfect man, able 
                        also to bridle his whole fucking 
                        body or whatever. If we put bits 
                        into the mouths of horses so that 
                        they obey us, we totally guide 
                        their whole bodies as well. Look at 
                        the fucking ships also: though they 
                        are so large and shit, they are 
                        driven by strong freakin’ winds, 
                        they are guided by a very small 
                        rudder or like wherever the will of 
                        the fucking pilot directs. So also 
                        the tongue is a small fucking 
                        member, yet it boasts of great 
                        things. How great a forest is set 
                        ablaze by such a small fire... you 
                        know?!” James 3:4 or whatever. 

           Sheryl just stares, shocked. 

                                 SHERYL
                        How the heck do you remember all 
                        that?!

                                 ESTEE
                        I don’t know, Sheryl. I have a lot 
                        of free time. 

                                 SHERYL
                        I just... Things were set. They 
                        were clear. Our way of life... it 
                        was clear. And now it’s... messy.

                        I spend nights looking out at the 
                        sky. Instead of watching my HGTV. 
                        I’m thinking thoughts I never 
                        thought before. I’m... questioning 
                        things. I friggin’ hate it, Estee. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Why! Sheryl, questioning is GOOD. 
                        It’s what makes us better. The 
                        greatest minds in the history of 
                        mankind were great because they 
                        questioned. And they dared be in 
                        limbo. Dare to be in limbo, Sheryl!

                                 SHERYL
                        But limbo is terrifying!! Why is it 
                        so scary?

                                 ESTEE
                        Because it is. For everyone. But 
                        especially for people like you and 
                        me. Who suffered loss. And trauma.. 
                        And sudden... change. Change is 
                        scary. But Sheryl it’s necessary. 
                        And its wonderful. If you just give 
                        it a chance. Please. Give it a 
                        chance with me. 

           Estee grabs Sheryl’s hands. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll show you. Just come to church 
                        on Sunday. OK? 

           Reluctantly, Sheryl nods. 

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY

           More BAKED WEED GOODS get placed on the window sill. More 
           random HANDS of locals grab the goods, insert cash into the 
           slowly filling MONEY JAR. 

           A particular CHUBBY HAND reaches for an apple crumble when 
           ESTEE GRABS IT TIGHT.

                                 ESTEE
                        Pastor Michaels. I was wondering if 
                        I could ask you for a small favor. 

           PRE-LAP: CHURCH ORGAN MUSIC. 
           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Estee’s face, eyes closed. She starts singing. 

                                 ESTEE
                        All praise to Him who reigns on 
                        high, In majesty supreme.
                        Who gave His life for man to die,
                        That He might man redeem.

           She opens her eyes, they’re bloodshot red. 

           We go WIDE. The Church is packed to the brim with TOWNSFOLK. 
           Nibbling on cookies. Smiles on all their stoned faces. 

           And Estee.... Is on stage. In Pastor Michaels’ place. Wearing 
           some kind of robe. Dignified, yet odd looking... Estee 
           looking. For not being a cult leader, she sure is starting to 
           look like one. 

           The entire crowd, aka THE NEW CHURCH OF HOLY EDIBLES, joins 
           her in song. 

                                 CROWD
                        Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man
                        Once ruined by the fall,
                        Thou hast devised salvation’s plan,
                        For Thou hast died for all.

           They finish singing.

                                 ESTEE
                        Please be seated. 

           They all obey. She scans the crowd. Everybody is there. 
           Sheryl. Kenny. Gabe. Even Chief Deputy Billy. She opens her 
           mouth to speak, then realizes she doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        And God said to the people of 
                        Israel...

           Fuck. What DID he say? She’s struck by a bad case of stage 
           fright, combined with shitty weed memory. Everybody stares at 
           her, expectantly.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Abandon ye prejudices and, just 
                        like... Come together, man. 

           A few people exchange glances. But mostly it goes down smooth 
           with this community of newfound stoners. God was a cool guy! 
           He would totally say something like that. 
                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        And uh... Overcome thy differences. 
                        And do good. You know? Oh uh. 
                        Deuteronomy 28. 5. Anyways. This 
                        town. This town...
                        (she starts pacing)
                        Has been around for a long time. 
                        Through wars. Conflict. And a 
                        recession or three. But never... 
                        has it shown such division. Such 
                        ugliness. Such un-Christlike 
                        behavior... as it has in these dark 
                        times. But today... TODAY... We say 
                        ENOUGH! Today we come together. And 
                        we look at one another. And we call 
                        each other by the only name that 
                        matters - “Friend.” Say it with me. 
                        “Friend!” 

           Oddly enough, they do.

                                 CROWD
                        Friend!

                                 ESTEE
                        “Neighbor!”

                                 CROWD
                        Neighbor!

                                 ESTEE
                        (winces, gets over it)
                        “F... Family!”

                                 CROWD
                        F... Family!

           Gabe watches with awe. The town truly coming together under 
           Estee’s guidance. 

                                 ESTEE
                        And that’s what we’re gonna call 
                        each other from now on. And to that 
                        end - me and my friends and my 
                        neighbors and my family are gonna 
                        start making some changes around 
                        here. And we’re gonna make this a 
                        better place, together. In fact, 
                        there’s gonna be a great kickoff 
                        event this afternoon at the newly 
                        renovated Crockett park, and I hope 
                        y’all can make it... And all I ask 
                        from you... my friends... my 
                        neighbors... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ESTEE (CONT'D)
                        is that you keep an open mind as we 
                        execute these changes. And in the 
                        spirit of generosity, don’t forget 
                        all the goods, baked and 
                        otherwise... that I kindly provide 
                        onto you. 

           She pointedly stops. A veiled threat under the guise of 
           kindness. A long silence. Some blinking.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Uh... so uh... If you hear me, let 
                        me hear an Amen!

           A long beat. Finally -

                                 CROWD
                        (enthusiastically)
                        AMEN!

           Chief Deputy Billy watches from the last bench, as he 
           realizes without a shadow of a doubt that this real 
           suspicious quiet, whatever it may be... It’s somehow all 
           related to Estee.

           EXT. PARK - THAT AFTERNOON

           A few TABLES arranged together at the center of the newly 
           renovated park. Estee and Sheryl sit behind a large colorful 
           banner Estee made at home that reads “GIVE A GUN, GET A 
           KITTEN.” They’re surrounded by large cages full of small 
           SHELTER KITTENS up for adoption.  

           A few people mill about. Various reactions, from enthusiasm 
           to disgust. 

           Stoner Sheryl put in an effort for this public appearance, 
           but is still a little more disheveled than usual. She plays 
           with an orange kitten on her lap. Gabe sits with them, 
           watching the proceedings, fascinated. 

                                 GABE
                        Are you telling me people are 
                        really gonna give up their guns?! 

                                 ESTEE
                        Of course not. This is Texas. 
                        They’d chop off their own dicks 
                        before they give away their guns. 
                        But we’re hoping they’re willing to 
                        part with... some of their guns. 
           A stoned-out-of-his-mind COWBOY, 50’s, drops a SEMI-AUTOMATIC 
           on the table with a THUD, as if to prove her point. 

                                 COWBOY
                        I’d like one of them, 
                        whatchamacall’em.

                                 SHERYL
                        A cat?

                                 COWBOY
                        Yep that’s it. Gimme the chubby guy 
                        with the stripes. That’s a lil 
                        tiger in the making. 

           He signs a form and gets handed a KITTEN. He melts with the 
           kitten in his hands. Estee tosses the gun into a LARGE 
           CARDBOARD BOX filled with similar guns. Gabe watches in awe. 

           Chief Deputy Billy walks by, taking in the scene. He 
           exchanges suspicious hostile glances with Estee. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        You sisters trying to steal my job?

                                 SHERYL
                        Never, Billy. Just trying to help 
                        keep the peace and quiet in this 
                        town.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        I’d say you’ve done a mighty good 
                        job at that. Been quiet lately. 
                        Real quiet. 
                        (pointedly)
                        Too quiet. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Jail cells feeling too empty, Chief 
                        Deputy? Hands tingling for some 
                        action?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Nice sermon, Estee. Didn’t peg you 
                        for the religious type.

                                 ESTEE
                        What can I say, I’ve seen the 
                        light.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Praise the lord. I was actually 
                        wondering if I could discuss some 
                        police matters with you. Alone.
                                 ESTEE
                        Bit busy at the moment. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        My schedule’s wide open. Just say 
                        when.

           Estee thinks for a moment. Gets an idea.

                                 ESTEE
                        Come by my place later. I’ll fix us 
                        some dinner. 

           Chief Deputy Billy is taken aback. Didn’t expect such an 
           offer from such a hostile woman. Suspicious. Still. What 
           better way to investigate someone than a firsthand invitation 
           to poke around their home. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        You got it. 

           Estee nods, tosses another gun into the box, as more GIGGLING 
           PEOPLE line up to get their kittens. 

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Estee the baker tries something new -- cooking a normal 
           dinner. She slides a ham into the oven. Sets the timer. KNOCK 
           ON THE DOOR. She runs over and opens it.

                                 ESTEE
                        You’re early!

           But it’s not Chief Deputy Billy. It’s Pastor Michaels. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Hey Pastor Michaels!

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        I hope I’m not interrupting.

                                 ESTEE
                        Of course not! Would you like to 
                        come in?

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        No, I... I really can’t stay. I 
                        just wanted to say great work 
                        today. Really... Unique sermon. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Thank you.
                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        You know, you really have done a 
                        big service to our town. Bringing 
                        people together like that. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Aw, thanks.

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        In fact, other... neighboring 
                        towns... Well, they heard of 
                        this... service... you provide... 
                        And were... likewise interested... 
                        in... adopting our model... 

           Estee nods blankly.

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS (CONT’D)
                        And they were indeed... 
                        wondering... if... Perhaps... we 
                        could extend our services... to 
                        them.

           Estee finally gets it.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh. OK. Uh... Sure! If they’re 
                        willing to pay. We can do it. 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        Yes! They’re very much willing to 
                        pay. Top dollar even.

                                 ESTEE
                        Excellent. We’ll arrange it then. 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        Great.

           He still lingers at the door.

                                 ESTEE
                        Is there anything else... or? 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        Maybe... Just... something small... 
                        for the weekend?

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh of course!

           She runs into the kitchen, comes back with a PIE.
                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        This is a good one! You’ll like it. 
                        Just.. Take it slow, eh?

           Pastor Michaels gratefully accepts the pie. He bows. But does 
           not offer money. Instead he offers a - 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        Bless you.

           Estee nods. A divine act of kindness. Just then, Chief Deputy 
           Billy walks up the steps, dressed half fancy and holding a 
           bottle of wine. Feeling somewhat awkward. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Am I interrupting?

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        No I was just leaving. Take care, 
                        you two!

           Pastor Michaels scurries along. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Hey! Come in!

           INSIDE

           Chief Deputy Billy inspects her house. Looking for clues... 
           of something. Estee scrutinizes Chief Deputy Billy, 
           suspicious. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        You look sharp... ish.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Thanks. Ish. 

           Chief Deputy Billy scrutinizes Estee, suspicious.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t know the famed Jacksboro 
                        baker could cook.

                                 ESTEE
                        Ha, don’t be so sure I can - we’ll 
                        see! I got this ham. It’s what my 
                        mom used to make for--

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        For Sunday night dinners. I 
                        remember. 

           Estee gives him a surprised look.
                                 ESTEE
                        You remember that?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Yeah. Been over once or twice. 
                        Maybe YOU don’t remember. But she 
                        was a great cook. 

           Something vulnerable and real between them. They quickly 
           break it, uncomfortable. She goes back to cooking. He gets 
           busy opening the bottle of wine, pours them both glasses.

                                 ESTEE
                        Don’t poison mine, eh?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Too late!

           They hold up their glasses.

                                 ESTEE
                        To death and deception!

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        What?

                                 ESTEE
                        What? Cheers! 

           They don’t take their eyes off each other as they drink.

           A BUZZER GOES OFF ending the moment. Dinner is ready. 

           She serves them both. Chief Deputy Billy takes a bite of the 
           ham. Chews quietly for an unnerving amount of time, making 
           Estee feel self-conscious.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        And the verdict is...?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        ... Almost as good as mom’s. 

           Estee smiles, sadly. 

           LATER

           Their plates empty. Between the booze and the banter - the 
           suspicion between them seems to have dissipated. They laugh 
           like close friends, or maybe something more. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Well Estee. That sure was 
                        something.
           Estee bows. Chief Deputy Billy sways a little.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Wow. Feeling the wine. Damn. Didn’t 
                        know I was such a lightweight.

           Estee just leans back in her chair. Watches him. Smiles. 
           Because it’s not the alcohol he’s feeling. She really baked 
           that baked ham. That’s right. This some Phantom Thread shit 
           right here. Chief Deputy Billy tries to stand, quickly sits 
           back down. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Damn. I am feeling... woozy. 

           Estee just continues to smile and stare, making him feel even 
           more self-conscious. He giggles.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        What? What are you looking at?

           Estee laughs.

                                 ESTEE
                        Nothing. You just look cute when 
                        you’re stoned. 

           Chief Deputy Billy laughs. Good one. Then he gets it. Then he 
           GASPS. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        What?! 

           Estee jumps up, full of fire, a finger in his face. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Are you investigating me?! Is that 
                        why you’re constantly around?! Is 
                        that why you’re here tonight?! What 
                        do you want from me?!

           Chief Deputy Billy jumps up, full of fire, a finger in her 
           face.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Did you drug me?! Did you put stuff 
                        in my food?! Do you... 

           It fucking finally dawns on him.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD. You’re a baker. You’re a 
                        BAKER. You’ve been feeding the 
                        town. OH GOD. OH GOD. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Is THAT how you’ve managed to mind 
                        control this entire town?! THROUGH 
                        DRUGS?! YOU’VE BEEN FEEDING THE 
                        TOWN DRUGS?!

                                 ESTEE
                        YES. FUCKING YES. And you know 
                        what, Chief Deputy Billy? THEY 
                        FUCKING LOVE IT. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Oh my god. That’s why it’s been so 
                        quiet. Real quiet. Too quiet. 
                        Everybody’s stoned. Everybody’s 
                        stoned!!! 

           She half climbs the table to get more in his face. 

                                 ESTEE
                        AND THEY FUCKING LOVE IT. CAN’T GET 
                        ENOUGH. BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN 
                        TO THEM. BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO 
                        THIS TOWN.

           He half climbs the table to get more in her face. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        YOU’RE MAKING THE ENTIRE TOWN BREAK 
                        THE LAW. YOU’VE TURNED US ALL INTO 
                        CRIMINALS. WE’RE FUCKED. WE’RE SO 
                        FUCKED!!

           They stare at each other for a long beat - full of suspicion 
           and fear and paranoia and hatred. Enemies. 

           And then, obviously, they kiss, passionately.

           They start to maneuver towards the living room, still 
           kissing. She breaks free, gasping.

                                 ESTEE
                        Spying on me like this... Snooping 
                        outside my window. YOU’RE A GIANT 
                        CREEP. AND IT’S NOT OK!

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Oh because running a one-woman 
                        small town drug cartel is REALLY 
                        LEGAL AND SUPER OK! 

           They stare at each other for a beat. Then kiss some more, 
           maneuvering towards the --

           BEDROOM
           He shoves her down on the bed, then he giggles, then he gets 
           very serious. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        I just wanna state for the record 
                        that THIS IS NOT OK.

                                 ESTEE
                        Shut your fucking mouth and take 
                        your shirt off.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        OK.

           He takes his shirt off and gets on top of her. Sexual tension 
           so thick you could cut it with a sexy sex knife - His face 
           inches from hers, both breathing hard - he tells her what 
           every woman wants to hear.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna have to tell Daddy. 

           Estee starts to laugh hysterically, realizing she’s in deep 
           trouble. He starts to laugh too, from the drugs.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh no. Don’t tell daddy, Billy. 
                        That would be bad. That would be 
                        very very bad. 

           She’s about to shove him off, when he grabs her face, with 
           great tenderness.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        OK. OK I won’t. I won’t.

                                 ESTEE
                        Promise?

           He caresses her face, like someone who is truly smitten. He 
           nods. Then she nods. OK. It’s OK.

           And then, you know, they have sex.

           LATER

           Naked under the sheets, they lay there, together. Somewhere 
           between giddiness and complete shame. The two of them 
           together... Enemies their entire lives. Nobody wanted this. 
           And yet... Maybe they’re not so different after all. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        I envy you.
                                 ESTEE
                        Me?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Yeah. 
                        (in Spanish)
                        You’re brave. 

                                 ESTEE
                        I’m not brave. I’m chickenshit.

           [QUICK FLASH -- Estee at the bus stop, the bus leaves without 
           her. Too scared to get on it.]

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        You are brave. Look at what you’ve 
                        done. With the town. Took some 
                        balls. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (in Spanish)
                        You can be brave too.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        I can’t be shit. I’m just daddy’s 
                        little helper. Carrying out orders. 
                        And one day I’ll become daddy. And 
                        I’ll have my own son to boss 
                        around. And he’ll be carrying out 
                        orders. And then he’ll have a son. 
                        And I’ll just drop dead one day in 
                        the supermarket and be forgotten a 
                        couple of years later.

                                 ESTEE
                        It doesn’t have to be that way. Say 
                        you got dealt a shit hand. Like me. 
                        We got dealt a shit hand. So either 
                        you say - “Welp, got dealt a shit 
                        hand, might as well fold”, or you 
                        say - “I got dealt a shit hand, so 
                        who fucking cares, might as well 
                        play the shit out of that hand, 
                        terrify everybody at the table till 
                        they’re pissing their pants, and 
                        maybe with enough luck, 
                        intimidation and chaos I might 
                        accidentally win”, ya know?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        I guess so. Guess I never thought 
                        about it that way. 
                                 ESTEE
                        Me neither... But now... I figure 
                        why not. I always thought being a 
                        lifer is a curse. And it is. It 
                        fucking is. It’s a terminal 
                        disease.... But turns out it’s also 
                        strangely... powerful. Like a 
                        superpower. Everybody knows you. 
                        Everybody trusts you. Under the 
                        right circumstances... Why, you 
                        could get them to do... virtually 
                        anything. I can get them to do 
                        anything. Even you... 

           She looks at him, he’s passed out. 

           MORNING

           Estee wakes up first. Hungover. Depleted. She stares at the 
           sleeping Chief Deputy Billy. He’s sweet, but she feels 
           nothing. She looks down at her arm. The rash is spreading.

           INT. WEED SHOP - SAME TIME

           Gabe reads a book behind the counter. Estee walks in with a 
           pep in her step.

                                 ESTEE
                        Good morning, business partner! 

           He lights up at seeing her.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        (loudly)
                        We’re expanding operations! Uh, I 
                        mean...
                        (whispers)
                        We’re expanding operations.

                                 GABE
                        What does that mean?

           To answer, she smacks A THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE TABLE. 

                                 ESTEE
                        It means I’m gonna need to buy you 
                        out here. 

                                 GABE
                        Estee...
                                 ESTEE
                        Do you know Sheryl is currently in 
                        talks with the mayor to turn the 
                        abandoned Piggly Wiggly crack den 
                        into a shelter for the needy? And.. 
                        AND... we’re raising money for 
                        underpaid teachers in like three 
                        freakin’ districts, not to mention, 
                        raising funding for the arts in 
                        elementary schools, and and...

           Gabe hesitates.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, man! I’ll just bake for 
                        the next 70 hours straight like a 
                        one woman sweatshop, then we can 
                        celebrate in our special place! Ya 
                        know, by the lake! 

           She grabs his hands. Squeezes them. Pleading. Somewhere in 
           all this - Gabe is swayed. Yet again. Reluctantly, he nods. 
           They start piling goods into brown paper bags. 

                                 GABE
                        Just... Please be discreet. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (loudly)
                        ALWAYS AM!
                        (whispers)
                        I mean.. Always am.

           INT. ESTEE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Estee and Gladys start baking enormous amounts of baked 
           goods. Pies, cakes, pastries, breads, cookies, THE WORKS! 
           They package all the goods in fancy new containers, and brand 
           them with freshly made specialty stickers that read “BAKED” 
           or another cringey pun brand name of your choice.  

           As they work, Gladys eyes Estee, something on her mind. 

                                 GLADYS
                        I don’t know that it’s the best 
                        idea to be romantic with two 
                        different people at the same time.

                                 ESTEE
                        What? Where’d you hear that?
                                 GLADYS
                        It’s a small town. Everybody knows 
                        everything. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Right. Well. Why the fuck not, 
                        Gladys. Pardon my French. I can be 
                        with two people. I can do what I 
                        want. This my town now. 

                                 GLADYS
                        I’m just afraid you’ll get hurt.

                                 ESTEE
                        Well Gladys, that makes one of us. 

           EXT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Estee and Gladys load up their wrapped baked goods into an 
           UNMARKED WHITE VAN. Estee hands the DRIVER a THICK STACK OF 
           CASH, like a straight up mobster / cartel boss. 

           A FIRE TRUCK DRIVES PAST a few blocks away, sirens BLASTING. 
           Estee and Gladys look at each other, puzzled.

                                 DRIVER
                        Oh yeah, a house burned down on 
                        Banks Street. It’s OK, they got 
                        everybody out. 

           Hmm.

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           Feeling all kinds of out of it, Chief Deputy Billy sits in 
           his office. A FACETIME call from Sheriff Daddy. He hesitates. 
           Then answers. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Well?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Hi dad, sir. Uh. I’ve looked into 
                        things. And uh. There’s some strong 
                        leads, and uh... You know. Slowly 
                        but steadily making progress... And 
                        uh... 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        You got nothing, do you? 

           Silence.
                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Hmmm. Maybe I should come back 
                        early. Take care of it myself. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        No, dad, don’t worry about it, I 
                        got it covered, I--

           CLICK. Line goes dead. 

           EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

           Estee and Gabe splash around the lake in another blissful 
           nighttime swim. Gabe does a handstand underwater. Then comes 
           up for air. Estee applauds. 

                                 ESTEE
                        What are you.. Some.. Fuckin.. 
                        Olympian? Olympiad? Olympian?

           Oh yeah, they’re very stoned. 

                                 GABE
                        I’m an Olympiadic performer, yes.

           She swims towards him. They stare at each other. He goes 
           serious.

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        What if it all goes wrong? What 
                        you’re doing?

                                 ESTEE
                        How? Everybody signed up for this. 
                        This is a fully consensual 
                        operation. And it makes everybody 
                        happy. The only potential risk that 
                        goes through my mind is obesity. 
                        And you know, there are worse ways 
                        to live and die. 

                                 GABE
                        Yeah, well. There are other dangers 
                        you may be overlooking. I have to 
                        order larger quantities for the 
                        store now, you know. Which 
                        stretches believability in a town 
                        like this. Which means my lies grow 
                        bigger in accounting for said weed. 
                        I’ve made up so many fake accounts 
                        I’m running out of name 
                        combinations. 
           She puts her arms around him. Brings him close. 

                                 ESTEE
                        I can help you with that. 

           She kisses his cheek.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        I know a lot of names.  

           She wraps her legs around him.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Like Bob... Bob... Bob Smith.. 
                        George Smith... Albert... Smith. 

           He kisses her back.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Fred... Fred... G... 
                        Grant..chester.

                                 GABE
                        That’s a good one.

           And then, you know, fuck it, they have sex. 

           DON’T JUDGE ESTEE, YOU PREHISTORIC FUCKS. It’s 2019. A woman 
           can do whatever the fuck she wants with her body and soul. 

           Or, you know, do judge her. She IS a highly immoral, selfish, 
           chaotic, clinically depressed, wholly destructive and self-
           sabotaging person. Does a past full of tragedy really redeem 
           that? That’s your call. I’M JUST THE WRITER, WHAT DO I KNOW.

           PRE-LAP: BANGING ON THE DOOR.

           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Estee opens the door in a bathrobe, looking a hot mess. 

           Her rash is looking much worse now. Spread to both arms. She 
           hides it under the bathrobe. 

           Sheryl is at the door, in a strange velour track suit, eating 
           a donut anxiously. 

                                 SHERYL
                        We’re late to the thing! 

                                 ESTEE
                        (squints)
                        What thing?
                                 SHERYL
                        The ribbon cutting on the thing... 
                        You know... The Piggly Wiggly 
                        shelter... Thing?

                                 ESTEE
                        Are you already high? Jesus Sheryl, 
                        it’s not even noon.

                                 SHERYL
                        Are you seriously judging me right 
                        now? Look at you, you look like... 
                        fucking.. That movie.. With the 
                        guy. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Big Lebowski? 

                                 SHERYL
                        BINGO!

           Estee grabs her keys, locks the door.

                                 ESTEE
                        Alright let’s go.

                                 SHERYL
                        You’re going like that? In a robe?

                                 ESTEE
                        Why the fuck not. This my town now!

           Sheryl rolls her eyes. They start walking. 

                                 SHERYL
                        Just don’t forget the thing... 
                        about that guy... You know with the 
                        wings. And the sun. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Icarus?

                                 SHERYL
                        BINGO!

           STREET

           They walk down the street at a hurried pace. Estee in a 
           bathrobe. Sheryl puts on sunglasses and fishes a slice of 
           pizza from her purse. 

                                 SHERYL (CONT’D)
                        There’s trouble in paradise, you 
                        know. That house that burned down? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHERYL (CONT’D)
                        It’s cuz everybody took a long hard 
                        fucking nap! Left food in the oven. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Sheryl can you take smaller bites? 
                        It’s hard to understand you.

                                 SHERYL
                        This isn’t a joke! Worst part? Took 
                        the fire department a long ass time 
                        to get there - cuz they were all in 
                        the woods doing a stoner 
                        reenactment of Grease.

                                 ESTEE
                        The musical?!

                                 SHERYL
                        People are losing their minds, 
                        Estee. I don’t know if this Perma- 
                        High life is good for them. I 
                        mean... You and I... We’re 
                        professionals, we can handle it.

           Sheryl takes out an empty hamburger bun from her purse, 
           starts nibbling on it.

                                 SHERYL (CONT’D)
                        But the laypeople... I don’t know. 
                        I think we might need to better.. 
                        Regulate... moderate... 

                                 ESTEE
                        (not listening)
                        Yeah sure etc. Of course. We will! 
                        You got it. 

           CLOSE ON: A RED RIBBON BEING CUT WITH GIANT SCISSORS. 

           EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - LATER

           Sheryl and Estee, surrounded by OFFICIAL LOOKING FOLKS and 
           THE MEDIA cut the ribbon on the REVAMPED PIGGLY WIGGLY - now 
           a shelter for people in need. Cameras flash as they wave at a 
           CHEERING AUDIENCE. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (pandering like a 
                         politician)
                        Are these scissors huge or did I 
                        just eat too much cake?

           Everybody laughs and cheers, an adoring audience. 
           Pastor Michaels urgently makes his way to Estee. 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        (whispers)
                        We got a problem. One of the 
                        delivery vans got pulled over. 

                                 ESTEE
                        (smiling at crowd)
                        Fuck. OK. We’ll talk about it 
                        later. 
                        (at crowd)
                        GOD BLESS THIS TOWN!

           Across the street, an official Sheriff’s police car pulls 
           over. 

           Daddy’s back in town. SHERIFF WILLIAM, even more large and 
           intimidating in the flesh, exits the car. He walks over to 
           the main event, taking it in, chatting up the locals.

           Chief Deputy Billy sees him and dives into some bushes. But 
           then he thinks against it and stands up. Brushes himself off. 
           Walks up to daddy.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Father! Dad. Sir. You’re back! But 
                        I had it covered.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Yeah well I didn’t buy anything you 
                        were selling. You had the little 
                        lamb voice of someone who had gone 
                        and lost their way. Gone and fell 
                        in love with the town. Or a tree. 
                        Or a woman. Meanwhile murmurs of 
                        the strange going-ons in this town 
                        have been growing. So I decided to 
                        cut the amateur hour and  
                        personally come and check it out. 
                        To expedite results, no offense to 
                        your blatant incompetence.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        None taken. And what strange going-
                        ons?! This town is completely 
                        normal!

           A STONED, FULLY NAKED MAN runs past the crowd, belting a 
           Tammy Faye song of your choice from the top of his lungs. 

           William stares pointedly at Chief Deputy Billy.
                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY (CONT’D)
                        That’s just Fred, you know he’s 
                        crazy.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        And what’s this ceremony all about?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        They’re converting the Piggly 
                        Wiggly crack den into a shelter. 
                        Normal!

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Mm hmm. We’ll see about that. 

           With that, Sheriff William walks off, begins his own 
           investigation. Chief Deputy Billy watches him go.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Crud.

           MEANWHILE ON THE FRONT STAGE OF THE EVENT

           Bathrobe Estee and Stoner Sheryl, the new queens of town, 
           wave at the crowd and start to walk off, stopping 
           occasionally to shake hands and field answers from the press. 

           An average looking MAN comes over to greet them and Sheryl 
           gives him a big hug.

                                 SHERYL
                        Estee! This is who I’ve been 
                        meaning to introduce you to for 
                        AGES! Johnny! Remember Johnny from 
                        the car dealership?

                                 ESTEE
                        You mean Dickles-- Johnny! Yes. Hi!

                                 SHERYL
                        (to Johnny)
                        Johnny this is Estee my very single 
                        sister.

                                 ESTEE
                        (under her breath)
                        Eh, getting a lot of action these 
                        days but OK.

                                 SHERYL
                        And she’s not always in a bathrobe! 
                        Just to be clear.
           From afar, Estee spots Sheriff William making the rounds, 
           doing actual investigative work, unlike his incompetent son. 
           She swallows hard, realizing her show is about to end for 
           good. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Lovely to meet you, Estee. Love 
                        what you’ve been doing around here. 
                        Big fan. Was thinking maybe we can--

                                 ESTEE
                        (distracted)
                        Totally. Talk to my agent. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER

           Estee, in her bathrobe, walks down the street, feeling 
           suddenly small and lost. 

           [QUICK FLASHBACK -- Estee at the bus stop, the bus drives 
           away. She didn’t have the courage to get on it.]

           She observes her small town, the bane of her existence, and 
           how it’s changed for the better... and for the worse. 

           MORE FIRE TRUCKS RUSH PAST. 

           She overhears TWO GRANDMAS ON A BENCH.

                                 GRANDMA #1
                        His house exploded. He got very 
                        high and tried to microwave a hat. 

           Up ahead, a TRAFFIC JAM. The cause - a MAN dancing on top of 
           his car to Earth Wind & Fire. 

           POLICE CARS ZOOM PAST. Chaos... GROWING. Everywhere. 
           People... losing their minds. 

           Pastor Michaels runs up to Estee. 

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        Another delivery van just got 
                        pulled over. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Another one?! Jesus, what are they 
                        like, checking for drugs on the 
                        highways?!

                                 PASTOR MICHAELS
                        Yes. That’s literally what they do.
                                 ESTEE
                        Right. OK. That’s fair. Maybe... 
                        Maybe it’s a holy sign from above 
                        that we need to stop... Everything.

           He opens his mouth to speak but she just keeps on walking.

           EXT. PARK - LATER

           Estee sees DOOMSDAY STEVE aka MR. AITKEN her former math 
           teacher gone mad, now looking quite sane, if a little stoned 
           and giggly, holding an outdoors class to a group of KIDS. 
           Math and teaching tools scattered on the grass. 

           Estee smiles a sad smile and walks up to him.

                                 ESTEE
                        You’re teaching again!

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        I am! Well not officially. I just 
                        grabbed these kids. I mean not in a 
                        criminal kidnapping kind of manner. 
                        Their parents are around... 
                        Somewhere. Anyways. Feels good.

                                 ESTEE
                        Even though the world’s gonna end?

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        Gotta make the little we have left 
                        count, right?

           A SMALL CHILD walks up to Estee and pulls on her bathrobe.

                                 SMALL CHILD
                        We’re learning about fucktals!

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        (quickly)
                        Fractals. He means fractals. 

           Seeing the child, Estee grows even sadder and more desperate, 
           feeling like a lost child herself.

                                 ESTEE
                        Hey Mr. Aitken... You got any like, 
                        I dunno... advice for me... Like 
                        fun.. Math.. Metaphors.. For life.. 
                        Like you used to when we were kids?
                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        Hmm.. Let’s see... Well I think 
                        fractals are a pretty neat 
                        metaphor, aren’t they? A fractal is 
                        a uh... a never-ending pattern. 
                        We’re talking infinitely complex 
                        patterns that are self-similar 
                        across different scales. They are 
                        created by repeating a simple 
                        process over and over in an ongoing 
                        feedback loop. Driven by recursion, 
                        fractals are images of dynamic 
                        systems – pictures of Chaos. Neat, 
                        huh?

                                 ESTEE
                        OK... And uh... What’s the uh... 
                        What’s the.. The metaphor here 
                        exactly?

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        Well. Chaos... is everywhere. And 
                        human behavior repeats itself... 
                        Our demons drive us to repeat the 
                        same behaviors again... and again.. 
                        And again.. But... The important 
                        thing to understand is that 
                        underneath all the variables... we 
                        are all self-similar. We are all 
                        the same. 

                                 ESTEE
                        But it doesn’t feel that way 
                        anymore. Things have gotten so 
                        fractured. People got so angry and 
                        spiteful and small. I tried to save 
                        it, I tried to save this town, 
                        but... I can’t. It’s not 
                        sustainable. 

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        But you are.

                                 ESTEE
                        I’m what?

                                 DOOMSDAY STEVE
                        Sustainable. 

                                 ESTEE
                        What if I’m not? The loop has to 
                        end at some point. 

           An EXPLOSION in the distance. 
           INT. ESTEE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Estee dramatically dumps all the weed into trash bags. She 
           then dumps all her baking ingredients into trash bags.

           The kitchen is now empty. Sterile. 

           OUTSIDE

           She throws out large bags of trash. 

           EXT. SHERYL’S HOUSE - SUNSET

           Estee knocks on Sheryl’s door, still in the bathrobe, the 
           rash everywhere now.

           Sheryl opens the door, She wears an old pajama dress full of 
           holes from years of use. Similar if not identical to the one 
           Estee wore in the beginning of this film. There’s a WEED 
           COOKIE peeking out of her pocket. 

           They both have lost looks on their faces. Two orphans. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Jesus. You look like me.

                                 SHERYL
                        That bad, huh? And look who’s 
                        talking, with that robe. You look 
                        like that guy from that movie.

                                 ESTEE
                        Big Lebowski? We’ve had this 
                        conversation before, Sheryl.

                                 SHERYL
                        Sorry, my memory’s shit lately. 

                                 ESTEE
                        What’s going on?

                                 SHERYL
                        I just don’t know... anything... 
                        anymore.

                                 ESTEE
                        Sheryl, I told you, not knowing is 
                        good. 

                                 SHERYL
                        But I used to know. I knew 
                        everything. When mom and dad di-- I 
                        rose to the challenge. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHERYL (CONT'D)
                        I maintained their public image. I 
                        was there to take over. For the 
                        town. A leader. An example. And 
                        there was a comfort in that. And 
                        now... I don’t know anymore.

                                 ESTEE
                        Do you want to go back to that?

                                 SHERYL
                        Heck no. 

                                 ESTEE
                        GOOD. Then don’t. Then live with 
                        the not knowing until you figure 
                        out who you wanna be. Not for mom 
                        and dad. Not for the town. Not for 
                        me. But for you. 

           Sheryl takes out the cookie.

                                 SHERYL
                        So I just do this to feel nothing 
                        forever?

           Estee grabs the cookie from Sheryl, throws it into the 
           bushes.

                                 SHERYL (CONT’D)
                        HEY!

                                 ESTEE
                        You don’t have to do that if it 
                        doesn’t work anymore.

                                 SHERYL
                        Then what?

           Estee gets emotional. Grabs Sheryl with both hands. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Sheryl. You’re my big sister. 
                        You’ve always taken care of me. You 
                        are strong. And you will figure it 
                        out. I have full faith. And I love 
                        you.

                                 SHERYL
                        (suspicious)
                        Why are you being soft? Did you do 
                        something? Are you going to do 
                        something?
                                 ESTEE
                        No! Can’t we share a moment?

                                 SHERYL
                        What are you planning? Estee you’re 
                        not gonna do anything crazy are 
                        you?

                                 ESTEE
                        No! What am I gonna do, drown 
                        myself in the lake?! Get outta here 
                        Sheryl, you’re just stoned. Now 
                        give us a hug. 

           Sheryl eyes her suspiciously. Then she gives in. They give 
           each other a big long hug. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        (tearing up)
                        Have a good night, OK?

           EXT. LAKE - SUNSET

           Estee walks up to the lake. It’s magic hour. The area is 
           empty and quiet. The lake serene. Beautiful. Sad. Perfect.

           She takes off the bathrobe, her entire arms are covered in a 
           rash now, she slowly enters the lake. She lowers herself into 
           the water until only the top half of her head is visible. 

           Then she hears a SPLASH from the other side of the lake. It’s 
           an ALLIGATOR. It stares at her. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Do you mind? I’m trying to die 
                        here. 

           The Alligator doesn’t budge.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I get it. Suicide is 
                        irresponsible and selfish. But I 
                        have no options left, Mr. 
                        Alligator. I’m a toxic leper. An 
                        obsolete oddity and a freak of 
                        nature. A plant that grew up wrong 
                        in a hostile environment. But I now 
                        know with certainty that I can’t 
                        leave. And I can’t stay either, cuz 
                        I poison everything. So what do I 
                        do, huh? This is the only logical 
                        choice. You get it. You’ve been 
                        around. 
           The Alligator starts swimming towards her, threateningly. 
           Most humans at this point would get very scared, but as we 
           already know Estee, she responds a little differently. Her 
           face twists in anger.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE YOU DUMB 
                        BITCH ASS ALLIGATOR THIS IS MY 
                        FUCKING LAKE I OWN ALL OF THIS SHIT 
                        GO TO SOME DUMB SWAMP AND STAY 
                        THERE YOU PIECE OF SHIT NO ONE 
                        INVITED YOU HERE.

           The Alligator blinks, considers this. Then he gently makes a 
           U-Turn, swims away, exits the lake and waddles out of sight.

           Content, Estee nods to herself, resumes trying to die. She 
           lowers herself down to the water. Closes her eyes. Prepares 
           to descend fully, forever. Sweet release. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Estee! 

           Estee rolls her eyes and floats up.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh for fuck’s sake. Can’t a woman 
                        die in peace?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        What?

                                 ESTEE
                        What? How’d you find me?

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        It’s a small town. Everybody knows 
                        everything. Listen, I need to talk 
                        to you! Daddy’s here. And he’s 
                        better than me at... figuring stuff 
                        out, and... 

                                 ESTEE
                        It’s OK. I know. It’s all over for 
                        Estee. 

           Chief Deputy Billy’s face fills with unexpected tenderness. 
           In full uniform, he walks into the water to speak to her face 
           to face. She laughs a bit at his commitment. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Estee, what we had... maybe it’s 
                        the drugs, but... it felt good. 
                        I... I want to be with you.
                                 ESTEE
                        That’s cute, Billy, but I’m not 
                        built for that. Or for anything. 
                        I’m just an obsolete relic freak 
                        who doesn’t belong here anymore.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        But that’s not true! You’ve got 
                        superpowers, remember? You’re a 
                        lifer. Everybody knows you. 
                        Everybody trusts you. Under the 
                        right circumstances... Why, you 
                        could get them to do virtually 
                        anything. You can get me to do... 
                        virtually anything.

                                 ESTEE
                        You know what, I think that was 
                        just the drugs talking. I don’t 
                        think anyone can make anyone do 
                        anything. Let alone themselves. I 
                        think we’re doomed to remain stuck 
                        in our own loops, Billy.

           That gives Billy pause. Uh.. What?

                                 GABE (O.S.)
                        Oh. Hello. Didn’t know we were 
                        having a party.

           Gabe stands on the shore, watching them, irate. 

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh for fuck’s sake. 

           Gabe takes his shirt off and also enters the water.

                                 GABE
                        I hope I’m not interrupting. It’s 
                        just that the lake is kind of our 
                        place. It’s where we go to discuss 
                        the drug operation we’re running.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Oh cool. Well I’m the local cop 
                        investigating that drug operation.

                                 GABE
                        Yeah well, we had sex.

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        Yeah well, we also had sex, so...
                                 ESTEE
                        Can you both maybe, just like, fuck 
                        off forever? 

           Just then, Sheryl runs over, looking panicked and disheveled.

                                 SHERYL
                        Estee! Estee! 

                                 ESTEE
                        JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Is there a 
                        birthday party here or what the 
                        fuck is going on?

                                 SHERYL
                        It’s the Sheriff. He got the fancy 
                        out of town police involved. 
                        They’re coming. They’re... there’s 
                        a raid. Planned. To stop... you. 

                                 ESTEE
                        I know. It’s cool. Don’t worry 
                        about it. Wanna come in for a swim? 
                        All the cool kids are doing it. 

           And with that, MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR FACES and TOWNSPEOPLE 
           come pouring in. Gladys, Mr. Shelby, Kenny and his cronies, 
           Pastor Michaels, etc. Etc. THE ENTIRE TOWN. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.

                                 KENNY
                        We’re here to protect you, Estee. 
                        We won’t let them take you.

                                 ESTEE
                        Please let them take me. 

                                 KENNY
                        NEVER. 

           They all gather on one side of the lake. On Kenny’s cue, they 
           all take out VARIOUS GUNS.

                                 ESTEE
                        Oh Christ. Put those away, will 
                        you?!

           As if on cue, A SWAT TEAM, ALL IN BLACK, HELMETS, WEAPONS 
           DRAWN, run down the hill and gather on the opposite side of 
           the lake from the townsfolk. Sheriff William at the head.
           More and more TOWNSFOLK show up. Old ladies. Angry youngins. 
           Church ladies. Cowboys. More SWAT TEAM on the other side.

           TWO CAMPS. On opposite of the lake. 

           A MEXICAN STAND-OFF. A DUEL. Guns drawn. 

           Sheriff William gets on a MEGAPHONE. 

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM (ON MEGAPHONE)
                        Estee Lynne Dorci. You’ve had your 
                        fun but now it’s time to call it 
                        quits. You have ten seconds to exit 
                        the water and come with us.

           Kenny nods at the TOWNSFOLK and they all raise their guns, at 
           the ready.

                                 KENNY
                        Just say the word, Estee, we’ll 
                        shoot them down.

                                 ESTEE
                        They’re fucking cops, Kenny.

                                 KENNY
                        But they ain’t our cops. They’re 
                        out of town cops.

                                 ESTEE
                        NONETHELESS!

           Gabe swims to shore, alone on the sidelines, a removed party 
           of one. Observing, as he always does. Fearful but fascinated 
           at how their experiment will finally end.

           Chief Deputy Billy, still in the water, knows this is it. His 
           moment to be brave. His moment to take a stand, make a 
           difference, play the hand he was dealt, like a gosh darn 
           hero. 

           He swims to shore over on the town’s side, joins Kenny, takes 
           out his gun, ready to betray his father and defend Estee. 
           Sheriff William sees this and gets on his megaphone.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM (ON MEGAPHONE)
                        Son. What are you doing. Get over 
                        here RIGHT NOW.

           A beat. Chief Deputy Billy hesitates. Then he hurriedly walks 
           over to Dad’s side, head hung low. He stands behind Sheriff 
           William, makes eye contact with the always brave Estee, then 
           fills with doubt again.
           He marches to the sidelines, where Gabe sits. 

                                 CHIEF DEPUTY BILLY
                        I’m just gonna... I’m gonna.. I’m 
                        still kind of working out my 
                        position here, please go on, don’t 
                        let me keep you.

           Everybody rolls their eyes. Resumes business.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM (ON MEGAPHONE)
                        Estee come out with your hands up, 
                        I ain’t playing around here.

                                 KENNY
                        Leave her alone!

           Everybody grabs tighter hold of their guns. One wrong move 
           and this could all go very wrong.

           Estee, in the eye of the storm, still submerged in the lake. 
           She is absolutely done with all of this. With all of them. 
           She swims up to a ROCK in the middle of the lake and CLIMBS 
           IT.

           From the shore, it looks like she’s STANDING ON WATER. 

           A GRANDMA on shore GASPS, crosses herself. 

                                 GRANDMA
                        (whispers)
                        Just like Jesus.

                                 ESTEE
                        It’s a rock, Ethel. I’m on a rock. 
                        (loudly)
                        NOW LISTEN THE FUCK UP. I 
                        appreciate what y’all are trying to 
                        do here, but no thank you. Put 
                        those guns away. I’m ready to pay 
                        for what I’ve done. But before I go 
                        I just have one last thing to say. 

           Then she just stands there silently for a very long time. The 
           Townfolk look her over. At her drenched figure. Exposed arms. 
           The rash has spread and covers almost all of her visible skin 
           now. It looks irritated too, like she’s been scratching.  

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Everybody always asks me, “Gee 
                        Estee, if you hate it so much, why 
                        don’t you just leave?” And I always 
                        give bullshit answers. 
                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        (on megaphone)
                        Come out with your hands up--

                                 ESTEE
                        CHRIST, GIVE ME FIVE FUCKING 
                        SECONDS TO SPEAK MY GODDAMN MIND 
                        BEFORE YOU TAKE ME AWAY FOREVER, 
                        YOU SMALL SAD SACK COG IN THE 
                        INDUSTRIAL FASCIST AMERICAN MACHINE 
                        RUINING LIVES SINCE IN THE DAWN OF 
                        FUCKING MAN, but also I hope Ruth 
                        is doing well, give her my best, 
                        ANYWAYS, I always give bullshit 
                        answers. But I’ll tell you the real 
                        truth now. The real real truth. 
                        (a beat)
                        I hate this town. I hate all of 
                        you. I really hate all of you. And 
                        I hate myself too. But I don’t 
                        leave this town, because you don’t 
                        leave family. You just don’t. No 
                        matter how dysfunctional, how 
                        selfish, how misguided, immoral, 
                        ugly, stupid self-righteous, 
                        hypocritical, violent, crude... you 
                        just... Don’t leave family. My 
                        parents left us. 

           Estee makes eye contact with Sheryl and despite herself, 
           starts tearing up.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        And I know how much that hurts. So 
                        I can’t leave. I can’t... 

           She chokes.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        You know what? No. I don’t like 
                        this metaphor. Let’s try a 
                        different one. A more poignant one. 
                        And yes I pronounce the g in 
                        poignant, so fuck you. 

           Estee toughens back up. Takes a deep breath. A beat.

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        This town is like a cancer. This 
                        country... is a cancer. Don’t get 
                        me wrong now, I ain’t idealizing 
                        the past - it’s always been a 
                        cancer. But now... this cancer... 
                        It’s gone and metastasized... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        And morphed... And mutated... And 
                        spread... And now you can’t cut it 
                        out anymore. It’s there. Forever.

           Silence.

                                 OLD MAN
                        (quietly)
                        Did she say this town is like 
                        pasta?

                                 ANOTHER OLD MAN
                        (quietly)
                        No, cancer.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Oh my, how morbid.

           A GUNSHOT GOES OFF IN THE CROWD.

                                 STONED COWBOY
                        OOPS, MY BAD!

           Then things quiet down again.

                                 ESTEE
                        But here’s the thing about cancer. 
                        It’s your own cells that turned 
                        against you... poisoning 
                        everything. They’re still yours. 
                        It’s your cells. Do you get it? Why 
                        haven’t I left? Because I knew long 
                        before everybody else figured it 
                        out, that it’s your cells. There’s 
                        no you... apart... from them. Do 
                        you understand?

           Silence. She faces the town. A final goodbye. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        As much as I hate it, and fuck 
                        knows I do - there’s no me apart 
                        from you. And that’s why I can’t 
                        leave. Ever. 
                        (a beat)
                        Unless I die. 

           With that, she dives into the lake and disappears.

           The Townsfolk GASP. Murmurs. Cries. She’s gone. 
                                 ETHEL
                        (gasps)
                        She disappeared in the lake, just 
                        like Jesus!

           A long sad quiet beat. 

           Then Estee BURSTS through the water. She gasps, catching her 
           breath.

                                 ESTEE
                        OK. I’m ready to go now.

           She waddles awkwardly towards William and the SWAT Team. She 
           reaches the shore and they tackle her to the ground. Cuff 
           her. She cooperates fully. 

           Then they come for Gabe. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        DON’T FUCKING TOUCH HIM! He had 
                        nothing to do with this.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        He ran the shop. He was your 
                        supplier.

                                 ESTEE
                        He was no such thing. I broke into 
                        his store, after hours. Multiple 
                        times. Stole his shit. Messed with 
                        his accounts. Threatened his life. 
                        Look at him then look at me, you 
                        know he’s not capable - You know I 
                        am. 

           William looks her over. Shrugs. Good point.

                                 SHERIFF WILLIAM
                        Son, we’ll be in touch. And you can 
                        kiss your license goodbye. 

           Gabe nods. Raises his hands, a surrender. They start leading 
           Estee away. She passes by Gabe. She bolts forward and plants 
           an aggressive kiss on him. Then she’s dragged away. She calls 
           after him --

                                 ESTEE
                        Am I the enemy?

           He smiles a sad smile. 

                                 GABE
                        TBD. 
           As they lead her away, the Townsfolk just watch quietly. 

           Then they break into cheer and applause, a loving thank you 
           for Estee. 

           It’s a sweet gesture, but it brings her no joy. Her face 
           still serious, as they take her up the mountain, and escort 
           her into a BLACK SUV. 

           The SUV pulls out and drives away. 

           INSIDE THE CAR

                                 ESTEE
                        Hey can you crack open the window 
                        an inch?

           An AGENT, buff and severe, stares her down, refusing. 

                                 ESTEE (CONT’D)
                        Oh for fuck’s sake, what am I gonna 
                        do, slice myself into thin layers 
                        and slide out through the crack?! 
                        Open the fucking window, you 
                        useless void where a human being 
                        should be.

           A beat. The Agent cracks open the window. Estee nods thanks. 

           The wind blows on her face. 

           She watches out the window as they pick up speed, following a 
           trail out of town.

           A small faded sign reads “NOW LEAVING JACKSBORO.”

           Estee reads it, and for the first time -- she breaks into a 
           real smile. Not a stoned smile. Not a cynical smile. Not a 
           revenge smile. Not a suicidal smile. A real one.

           A smile of pure relief. Going to prison, but free at last. 

           The Lifer is dead. 

           THE END.
