           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           Welcome to Salton City, a desolate desert town one hour past 
           the oasis of Palm Springs.

           -A single CAR cruises down a dark highway. Its HEADLIGHTS 
           illuminate a CARVED SIGN: SALTON SEA, CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST 
           LAKE. The words glimpsed through a thick cloud of red dust.

           -Flies devour a rotting FISH CORPSE. Barely any water remains 
           in the "LAKE." Just 350 square miles of flat, dry earth.

           -Not even a coat of cheery blue paint can prevent this single 
           story CHURCH from more closely resembling a mobile home than 
           a place of worship.

           -A car door SLAMS in a PARKING LOT full of PICK-UP TRUCKS. A 
           SHADOWY FIGURE enters BOB'S BAR, a dive with NEON SIGNS in 
           the window. We catch a whiff of CONVERSATION and COUNTRY 
           MUSIC before the door closes, and we're plunged us back into 
           SILENCE. Nothing to hear but the dust-blowing WIND.

           -A ruined neighborhood of RANCH HOMES. Some vacant. Others 
           with FOR SALE SIGNS that promise reduced prices on the lawn.

           End montage. 

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT.

           We HOLD ON a modest, white HOUSE. Its windows dark and drawn. 
           A MAILBOX with the name HERNANDEZ written in neat letters. 
           The whole place is ordinary... Except for its second story.

           Suddenly, or perhaps finally, SOMEONE enters the frame. 
           Moving toward the house with both CONFIDENCE and URGENCY. 
           They wear a SKI MASK and their body is slight-- either a 
           woman or a small man. 

           The Intruder veers at the FRONT PATH. Changes course. Hoists 
           themselves over a rusted FENCE at the side of the house.

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS.

           DIRTY SNEAKERS land, sending up more DUST.

           The Intruder pauses to make sure no lights click on in the 
           house... Then creeps along the yard's perimeter en route to 
           the BACKDOOR. Passing: a TREE SWING flailing in the wind; 
           PATIO FURNITURE covered in dirt and grime; a large DOGHOUSE 
           that fails to deliver on its promise of a snarling beast. 
           Soon, the scorched grass beneath their feet turns to 
           concrete. An UNSCREWED LIGHT means the Intruder maneuvers the 
           PORCH in the darkness.

           They reach for the doorknob with a GLOVED HAND and a KEY that 
           reads DO NOT COPY... Then remove their shoes before entering.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           The refrigerator hums. Straining to stay cold. On its door 
           are PHOTOS, DRAWINGS and a GROCERY LIST-- the markings of an 
           organized young family. 

           CLICK! The Intruder ignites a FLASHLIGHT. Its blaze pointed 
           at a PORTRAIT on the fridge: MOM (35), DAD (35), SON (6) and 
           GERMAN SHEPHERD. 

           They pause. Study the photo. Touch the Woman's face... Then 
           slide the acrylic out from under the magnet and pocket it. 

           Creak! A DRAWER opens. But even this family's junk drawer is 
           neat. Making it easy for the Intruder to rifle past SCISSORS 
           and GLUE STICKS-- to find a WAD OF CASH.

           INT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The Intruder tiptoes in with flashlight extended. They move 
           with ease. Know WHEN and HOW to evade each piece of 
           FURNITURE. Like they've been here before. 

           Although modest, this room has been looked after with care. 
           PLASTIC FLOWERS. COASTERS. BLANKETS. Everything in its place. 

           The Intruder heads toward the front of the house when their 
           SOCKED-FOOT meets an errant LEGO. Plastic JAMS into FLESH. 
           They shove a hand in their mouth. BITE. Stifling any howls.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           The Intruder peers around the corner, then pull back. Sharp. 
           They look again, more careful this time, and clock a heap of 
           MOTIONLESS FUR. Sprawled across the floor. The Shepherd!

           They approach. Kick the dog's belly. Note the dried WHITE 
           FOAM around its snout. Then step over the corpse. Carry on.

           INT. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS.

           Step by step, the Intruder creeps up the stairs. 
           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT.

           The Intruder finds FOUR DOORS on the second floor-- three 
           closed and one open. They turn off their flashlight and 
           approach the FIRST CLOSED DOOR. Their 10-INCH HUNTING KNIFE 
           glinting in the moonlight streaming in through the windows. 

           They turn the knob. The door opens at an unbearably slow 
           pace. Inch... By inch... Until they can see inside.

           The elaborately pillowed GUEST ROOM is empty. Neat as a pin.

           But wait! There's someone in there!

           The Intruder panics... Only to realize the "person” is a 
           MEN'S JACKET. Hanging, forgotten, on the closet door. Phew.

           They pull back and head for the SECOND DOOR. Both CLOSED and 
           LOCKED. The name DYLAN written on it in bright STICKERS.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. DYLAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           DYLAN (6) sleeps. Unaware of the knob jiggling behind him.

           There's a series of HANDWRITTEN NOTES taped to the door 
           frame, written in the same script as the mailbox. They remind 
           Dylan to BRUSH HIS TEETH and PICK UP HIS TOYS.

           The LAST NOTE, scrawled in a messier, hurried penmanship, 
           demands that he keep his door shut and locked AT ALL TIMES. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           They pass the THIRD DOOR, an empty BATHROOM, before focusing 
           on the FOURTH DOOR at the end of the hall. CLOSE ON their 
           FEET as they creep toward it. Rocking from BALL to HEEL.

           A SOUND! They sidestep into the shadows as... Dylan, half-
           asleep in Star Wars pajamas, stumbles into the bathroom. A 
           beat before we hear URINE meet PORCELAIN.

           They retrace their steps. Look into the bathroom. Fingers 
           tightening around the knife's shaft as they watch Dylan sway 
           over the toilet. 

           FLUSH! They pull back. Dylan returns to his room and locks 
           the door with a CLICK! 
           Unable to risk another interruption, they block Dylan in with 
           a nearby CHAIR... Then refocus on the FOURTH AND FINAL DOOR.

           It, too, is locked. And like Dylan's door, it lacks a 
           keyhole. Just a CIRCLE into which they insert a BOBBY PIN.

           JIGGLE! JIGGLE! POP! 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The door creaks open. There's a WOMAN on the BED. BLACK HAIR 
           spooling onto on a pillow. As we yearn for her to wake up...

           The Intruder creeps in. Removes a CELLPHONE from the bedside 
           table. Points their flashlight at the woman and IGNITES.

           Sheets fall away as MARY (35) sits up. Her pupils dilating in 
           the focused LIGHT. Face turning from CONFUSION to ALARM. 

                                 MARY
                        W-who are you?

           The Intruder steps forward, and Mary clocks their knife.

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        What do you want???

           Another step. Mary reaches for her phone, but it's gone.

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        Please. My son. He's in his room.

           Another step. Mary backs up against the HEADBOARD. Gathering 
           the floral bedding around her nightgown-clad body. She 
           removes her ENGAGEMENT RING and holds it out. It's not a 
           large diamond, less than a half-carat, but it's something.

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        Take this. And there's some cash in 
                        a drawer in the kitchen.

           But the Intruder doesn't take the ring. Instead, they set 
           their flashlight on the nightstand, illuminating Mary in a V-
           shaped beam, and perch on the edge of the bed. Mary musters 
           what remains of her courage:

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        My husband has a gun. He should be 
                        here any-

           Mary stops. Noting the ROPE in the Intruder's hand. She nods, 
           resigned, and holds out her wrists to be bound. 
           Next, they reveal a pair of white, cotton UNDERWEAR. Built 
           for comfort, not appeal. Mary recognizes them as her own.

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        H-how did you... Have you been wat-

           SHOVE! The panties go in Mary's mouth. The Intruder mounts 
           her, as if about to rape. Their faces close enough for a 
           breath to rustle Mary's hair. 

           Then, for no apparent reason, they hesitate. As if uncertain.

           That is... Until Dylan YELLS and BANGS on his door.

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                        Mom! Help! I'm stuck!

           Mary's eyes are wide and pleading. Please. Don't. She watches 
           as they unsheathe their knife with a SWHING! 

           Mary has no time to register what's happening before the 
           Intruder SLICES her carotid artery. Blood pours from her 
           neck. She tries to speak. A gurgle escapes. But it only 
           accelerates the bleeding. They stroke her hair and shush her. 
           As if soothing a child. Mary gives a final heave. Then DIES. 

           INT. DYLAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Dylan HURLS himself against the door.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT.

           A DRUNKARD staggers down the sidewalk. He thinks he hears a 
           noise in Mary's house... Pauses... Then shrugs. Carries on.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The Intruder rests Mary's head on a pillow. Pulls the sheets 
           up to cover her wound. Strokes her cheek. Her eyes stare up 
           at the ceiling. Giving us a glimpse of her masked attacker.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           Dylan POUNDS on his door as the Intruder walks past.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The Intruder considers the immaculate living room.
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Dylan hurls himself against the door one last time... Then 
           collapses, exhausted, to the floor. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The room has been ransacked. Titled PICTURE FRAMES. SHARDS OF 
           GLASS on the carpet. A COFFEE TABLE balanced on its side. A 
           brighter space on the CONSOLE where the TELEVISION once sat.

                                 FEMALE HOST (V.O.)
                        Although initially investigated as 
                        a homicide, the Imperial County. 
                        Sheriff has since ruled Mary's 
                        death a robbery gone wrong. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - NIGHT.

           SARAH HALSTED (37) slumps over her desk. Feels someone's gaze 
           upon her. She opens her eyes. Panicked.

           Acting on instinct, Sarah SHOVES her stalker to the ground. 
           Accidentally knocking out an EAR POD in the process so that a 
           PODCAST fills the room at a loud volume.

                                 FEMALE HOST (V.O.)
                        Her body showed no signs of forced 
                        intercourse. And there was no 
                        semen, no blood, no DNA of any kind 
                        found at the scene. Which makes me 
                        think whoever did this, robber or 
                        not, knew what they were doing.

           Sarah scrambles to alight a LAMP. Her face, pretty and just 
           starting to succumb to middle age, falls when she realizes 
           the person is... Her daughter, RILEY (9). A mini Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        Riley? What are you-

                                 FEMALE HOST (V.O.)
                        But then why tuck her in after? It 
                        seems like such an odd thing to do 
                        after slitting someone's throat.

           She needs to turn this off. Now. Before it traumatizes Riley.
                                 FEMALE HOST (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Two months later, and without so 
                        much as a suspect-

           The podcast stops. Sarah's hands go to her hips.

                                 SARAH
                        You're not supposed to be in here.

                                 RILEY
                        I can't sleep.

           Sarah's anger turns to sympathy-- to love.

                                 SARAH
                        Thinking about tomorrow?

           Riley hesitates... Then nods. Sarah touches her cheek.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Go back to your room. I'll be there 
                        in a second to read you a story.

           Riley doesn't want to leave her mother, but does as told.

           Once alone, Sarah sits at her desk. Lets her heart rate slow. 
           Her fear over-the-top for someone startled by her own child.

           She stands, revealing the hardwood floor to be covered in 
           MAPS and NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS: Sarah's investigation into Mary's 
           death. We glimpse headlines, all from SMALL-TOWN PAPERS:

           SALTON CITY RESIDENT KILLED IN OWN BED.

           LOCALS DEMAND ANSWERS IN UNSOLVED CASE OF SLAIN MOTHER.

           INTEREST WANES AFTER HERNANDEZ DEATH RULED A ROBBERY.

           Sarah gathers it all into the top drawer of a FILING CABINET 
           beneath her desk. A TEQUILA BOTTLE goes in the bottom drawer, 
           surrounded by other fine liquors-- a makeshift OFFICE BAR.

           She locks the cabinet and hides the KEY under a MUG OF PENS. 
           There's a PICTURE printed on the ceramic-- Riley grinning 
           atop the Empire State Building. Sarah clocks it with a smile.

           On her way out, she pauses to look inside one of the many 
           CARDBOARD BOXES that fill the room. Like they just moved in. 

           She flips past a COLUMBIA JOURNALISM SCHOOL DIPLOMA and finds 
           a series of FRAMED ARTICLES from The Daily Inquirer. And 
           whose should be on the byline except her own. SARAH HALSTED. 

           She studies them with longing before turning out the light.
           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, RILEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           NOTE: ALTHOUGH SARAH'S OFFICE IS FULL OF BOXES, THE REST OF 
           THE HOUSE IS IMMACULATE AND UNPACKED. A TIDY DREAM HOME.

           Riley lies in bed. Bathed in the warm glow of a nightlight.   
           Cuddling the family's Golden Retriever, CHARLIE (2), as Sarah 
           reads from an old, worn BOOK. Gesturing dramatically.

                                 SARAH
                        The little mermaid parted the 
                        purple curtains of the tent and saw 
                        the beautiful bride asleep with her 
                        head on the Prince's breast. The 
                        mermaid bent down and kissed his 
                        shapely forehead. She looked at the 
                        sky, fast reddening for the break 
                        of day. She looked at the sharp 
                        knife and again turned her eyes 
                        toward the Prince, who in his sleep 
                        murmured the name of his bride. His 
                        thoughts were all for her, and the 
                        knife blade trembled in the 
                        mermaid's hand. But then she flung 
                        it from her, far out over the 
                        waves. Where it fell the waves were 
                        red, as if bubbles of blood seethed 
                        in the water. With eyes already 
                        glazing she looked once more at the 
                        Prince, hurled herself over the 
                        bulwarks into the sea, and felt her 
                        body dissolve in foam.

                                 RILEY
                            (a beat, then)
                        The Little Mermaid dies?

                                 SARAH
                        Not in the movie. But in the book.

                                 RILEY
                        What? Why?

           Sarah studies her daughter. As if deciding how honest to be.

                                 SARAH
                        So all the little girls like you  
                        would like it. But sometimes, when 
                        you change the ending, you change 
                        the whole story. 

                                 RILEY
                        But-
                                 SARAH
                        -Enough. Time for bed.

           Sarah tucks the sheets tight, kisses Riley's forehead and 
           heads for the door. Pausing.

                                 SARAH  (CONT'D)
                        Sleep tight, Baby Bear. I love you.

           She waits until Riley closes her eyes before closing the 
           door. Leaving it ever so slightly ajar. Once alone, Riley's 
           eyes flicker back open. Her face full of DREAD. Of CONCERN.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT.

           Sarah slips into bed beside her sleeping husband, TOM HALSTED 
           (38). She kisses his neck, and he stirs without waking. She 
           tries again. He murmurs with drowsy frustration:

                                 TOM
                        I'm sleeping.

           Rejected, Sarah grabs her pillow and stalks toward the door. 
           When she opens it, we hear a SCREECHING SOUND and CUT TO--

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING.

           Sarah wakes to her PHONE ALARM. Hunched over her LAPTOP. Like 
           she's been there all night. She straightens. Rubs her neck. 
           We wonder why she seems so disoriented... Until we spot the 
           (now empty) TEQUILA BOTTLE on its side. 

           Sarah stops the alarm and opens Instagram to a DIRECT MESSAGE 
           CONVERSATION with @LuluTrueCrime. They've been trading notes 
           about Mary. Lulu's last message still awaiting Sarah's reply.

           ON THE SCREEN: 

           If you agree the robbery looks staged... 2100 S Marina Dr.

           Sarah squints at the address, when:

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Babe? Have you seen my blue tie?

           It takes all of Sarah's self-restraint to pocket her phone... 
           But not until she logs out of Instagram and closes the app. 

                                 SARAH
                        One sec. I'll help you find it.
           She locks both her investigation and the tequila away in the 
           filing cabinet. Hides the key under the mug. Only once the 
           room is purged of her obsession does she finally exit. 

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           The Halsted family owns a large, traditional home in upscale 
           Pasadena. Every yard on their block is mowed and perfectly 
           manicured. The only blight? A small HOLE in the Halsted's 
           picket fence. We PUSH IN on it.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah slathers jam onto bread. The kettle SQUEALS. She rushes 
           to turn off the stove. Leaving a STICKY STREAK on its dial.

                                 SARAH
                        Shit. 

           She sucks her finger and wipes the jam with her robe's 
           sleeve. Tom enters, amused and broad-shouldered, as he knots 
           the blue tie. The finishing touch of his suit.

                                 TOM
                        Everything ok in here?

           Sarah whips around. STARTLED, once again, by her own family. 
           He takes the kettle and pours Sarah a cup of tea.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Here.

                                 SARAH
                        Thanks.

           Noting how disheveled she looks in comparison, Sarah tightens 
           her robe and finger combs her hair. But Tom barely notices 
           her. Too busy eyeing the half-made sandwiches on the counter.

                                 TOM
                        Is one of those for me?

                                 SARAH
                        Ya, but don't get too excited. It's  
                        just PB&J. I still have to go groc-

                                 TOM
                        -Shit. I should have told you. 
                        Mom's taking me to lunch with some 
                        of the other partners. 
                                 SARAH
                        Why should you tell me that?

                                 TOM
                        I don't know... Listen. About last 
                        night-

                                 SARAH
                        It's ok. Really. 

                                 TOM
                        -I know it's been a while since... 

           It's awkward as he fumbles for the right words. 

                                 SARAH
                        I know. It's been hard for me too.

                                 TOM
                            (blushing, embarrassed)
                        No. Of course. It's obviously 
                        harder for you... I just want you 
                        to know that... We'll get there.

           Tom smiles. She smiles. A brief moment of camaraderie before 
           he notes the TIME and gets distracted. Picks up his pace.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        You sure you'll be ok?

                                 SARAH
                        What do you think I'm going to do? 
                        Burn the house down?

                                 TOM
                            (laughing awkwardly)
                        What? No... But maybe you could 
                        call my sister? Let her take you to 
                        lunch?

           Sarah pulls a face. No way in hell she's doing that.

                                 SARAH
                        Remind me again why I agreed to 
                        live so close to your family?

           They continue to tease one another. Playful:

                                 TOM
                        Because you love me?

                                 SARAH
                        Hm... That doesn't sound right. 
                                 TOM
                        Because you couldn't resist showing 
                        off Big Blue?

           Tom flexes and kisses his biceps.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh. Yes. How could I possibly live 
                        without people knowing I snagged 
                        the star quarterback of the 2001 
                        high school football season?

                                 TOM
                            (laughing, then)
                        I know it's been a few months since 
                        the move, but today feels good. 
                        Like life is finally starting... 

           Sarah smiles. He heads for the exit, then turns back.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Before I forget. Did we ever get 
                        that hundred grand?

                                 SARAH
                        I think the bank said Friday?

                                 TOM
                        Jesus. Escrow should have closed 
                        weeks ago. We could really use the 
                        money now that you aren't working.

           It's as if Sarah's been SLAPPED. She lashes out.

                                 SARAH
                        Then would you be able to fix that 
                        hole in the fence?

                                 TOM
                            (surprised, sour)
                        I told you I would fix it this 
                        weekend.

                                 SARAH
                        Hey. Don't blame me. I'm just 
                        trying to avoid another note from 
                        you-know-who.

                                 TOM
                        I said I'll do it.

           They stare. The atmosphere no longer loving, but tense.
           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Tom approaches one of two gleaming AUDIS in the driveway. 
           His? A slick sedan. Hers? A marmish SUV. He opens the door 
           and looks back at the house. Equal parts ANGRY and CONCERNED.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: Riley enters as Sarah watches Tom get 
           into his car. Once again STARTLING her mother. Sarah is quick 
           to force a smile, but Riley doesn't miss a thing. Oddly 
           perceptive for a fourth grader.

                                 SARAH
                        Hey there, Baby Bear. What do you 
                        want for breakfast? Yogurt? Cereal? 

           Riley plops down at the table. Grumpy.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Cereal it is... So are you excited?

           She procures Riley's breakfast and takes a seat. A beat.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Look. I know it's hard. Starting at 
                        a new school. But you've never had 
                        trouble making friends before... 
                        And your cousins will be there!

           Riley makes a face. Identical to the face Sarah made earlier 
           in reference to Tom's sister. These Halsted women are twins.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I know. They are kinda weird.
                            (imitating)
                        Splatoon 2 is like, so much better 
                        than Fortright.

                                 RILEY
                            (giggling, cheered)
                        It's called Fortnite, Mom!

                                 SARAH
                        Shit. I swore I'd be nicer about 
                        your dad's family. They're the only 
                        reason you got into Westbridge.

           Riley shrugs, unimpressed by both her school and the swear 
           word, and watches a BUS pull to the curb outside the WINDOW. 
           Not a yellow one, but a MERCEDES VAN.
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You ready?

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY.

           Riley runs outside. Her Disney's LITTLE MERMAID BACKPACK 
           bouncing. Sarah starts after her... Then FREEZES in the door. 

           Riley turns back. Notes Sarah's fear. Offers a comforting 
           smile too mature for her age. And boards the van with a wave. 

           When the Mercedes pulls away, Sarah spots a cluster of MOMS 
           (30s) gathered across the street with matching BLOWOUTS. She 
           PANICS, caught off guard by their sudden appearance, as the 
           clique's leader, CINDY, whispers to the group:

                                 CINDY
                        She doesn't work. She can't keep 
                        house. Have you seen that hole in-

           Sarah SLAMS and LOCKS the front door. Grumbling to herself:

                                 SARAH 
                        And who says LA doesn't get cold...

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah enters with Charlie in tow. She approaches a STACK OF 
           BOXES. Reaches for one on top, and they all tumble down.

           OLD ISSUES of The Daily Inquirer tabloid spill onto the 
           floor. As Sarah picks them up, her eyes land on a headline: 

           CRIME REPORTER OUT AT INQUIRER FOLLOWING ATTACK.

           She shuts her eyes. Remembering. 

           INT. SARAH'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - FLASHBACK.

           Sarah writhes on the floor. Gagged. Bound. Alone in her 
           living room. Lit by the city lights outside the window.

           End flashback.
           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, FAMILY COMPUTER ROOM - PRESENT DAY.

           Charlie's LICKS bring Sarah back to reality. She shoves the 
           tabloids back into the box, trapping the memory inside, when 
           her phone BEEPS with an event reminder for THERAPY. Ugh.

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sarah opens the front door, keys in hand. But again she STOPS 
           at the threshold. Unable to go outside. She takes a breath. 
           Sticks a toe onto the porch. Only to PANIC and RUN inside.

           Cindy clocks Sarah's behavior from the house next door. 

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - DAY.

           Sarah's therapist, LAUREN (40s), is on VIDEO CHAT. Noting the 
           MESS OF BOXES in the background of her patient's shot.

                                 LAUREN
                        I was hoping I'd finally get to 
                        meet you in person. It's Riley's 
                        first day, right? That must be hard 
                        after having her home all summer.

           Sarah avoids eye contact and looks outside. Thinking she 
           either doesn't want or doesn't need therapy.

                                 LAUREN (CONT'D)
                        You know, Sarah... Rape used to be 
                        something women didn't talk about. 
                        Something we bottled up. But things 
                        are different these days.

                                 SARAH
                        People cope in different ways.

                                 LAUREN
                        And Tom? How's he coping?

                                 SARAH
                        Good. Other than the fact that he's 
                        repulsed by my naked body.

                                 LAUREN
                        I see... A lot of men struggle with 
                        intimacy after these types of 
                        incidents... And what about Riley?

                                 SARAH
                        What about Riley?
                                 LAUREN
                        How's she handling everything?

                                 SARAH
                        She's nine. We haven't discussed it 
                        with her.

                                 LAUREN
                        I'm sorry. It's just, I thought... 
                        Wasn't she home during the attack?

                                 SARAH
                        She was asleep.

           Lauren doesn't agree, but says nothing. 

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah locks the door, then slides her VANITY in front of it.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah basks in the hot BATH. The same PODCAST flows from high 
           tech speakers. The host sounds young. Almost immature:

                                 FEMALE HOST (V.O.)
                        Guys. The response to my first 
                        episode has been amazing. I’ve 
                        gotten sooo many messages asking 
                        why I care about this case. Why 
                        I’ve dedicated my life to solving 
                        it. And while I wouldn’t say Mary 
                        and I were friends, we did cross 
                        paths a few times at the diner 
                        where she worked. And wouldn't you 
                        want to help if someone you knew 
                        got murdered?

           Sarah shakes her head. Closes her eyes. Listens.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY.

           Charlie barks as Riley enters and drops her bag to the floor.

                                 SARAH
                        How was it?

                                 RILEY
                        Ok. Do we have Pop-Tarts?
                                 SARAH
                        How about an apple?

           But she can't resist Riley's puppy dog eyes.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Fine. But only one! 

           Riley scampers off, forcing Sarah to yell after her:

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        And no telling Dad! You know how he 
                        is about healthy snacking.

           She picks up Riley's backpack and hears a CLANGING sound. 
           Unzips it. Looks inside and finds SCISSORS. Not the arts and 
           crafts kind but the ultra-sharp gardening kind. That's odd...

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY.

           Two Pop-Tarts SHOOT out of the toaster.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - DAY.

           Sarah enters with Charlie at her heels. She fights the urge 
           to lock the door. Leaves it ajar so she can hear Riley.

           QUICK CUTS AS: Sarah gets the key, unlocks the filing cabinet 
           and procures her investigation. 

           She reaches for the liquor drawer, then sees the mug with its 
           photo of Riley. Decides not to drink and sits at her desk.

           She finds @LuluTrueCrime on Instagram. LULU (21) is young, 
           lithe and pretty. More influencer than murder investigator.

           Lulu's feed is a mix of SELFIES and PROMOTIONAL POSTS for her 
           new podcast. Is this really who Sarah's been listening to???

           In her most recent post, she wears glasses to appear serious. 
           Despite making duck face. Its caption reads: WHY DO DUCKS 
           MAKE GREAT DETECTIVES? BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS QUACK THE CASE.

           Sarah rolls her eyes and reads the comments.

           ON THE SCREEN:

           Why does everyone assume it's a guy? Girls kill too.

           90% of murders are committed by men.

           Can we please talk about the dog obviously being poisoned?
           Sarah furrows her bow and scratches Charlie's head... When, 
           suddenly, she's STARTLED by her VIBRATING phone.

                                 SARAH
                        H-hello?

           A long beat during which Sarah panics. Who would call her?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Thank fucking God I caught you. 
                        Things are insane over here.

           We INTER CUT between the two women. CHRISTINE (50s) is hard 
           at work in her tiny Manhattan office. She's gruff. Grizzled 
           from years editing The Daily Inquirer, but still trying to 
           maintain a youthful appearance with MAKEUP and TIGHT CLOTHES. 

           Sarah checks the time. 5:00 PM here. 8:00 PM out East.

                                 SARAH
                        Right. Almost time to go to print.

                                 CHRISTINE 
                            (typing, distracted)
                        Mhm. If Alex ever finishes writing 
                        this Le Coucou review. That guy. I 
                        swear... Listen. I got your email. 
                        Both of them. Aren't you supposed 
                        to be retired? 

           Christine forks DELIVERY SALAD into her mouth. Chewing when:

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        You're really into this Salton City 
                        thing, aren't you?

                                 SARAH
                        The Sheriff insists it's a robbery. 
                        That she must have caught them off 
                        guard. But then why leave her 
                        engagement ring? And why tuck her 
                        in after? If you killed someone out 
                        of a panic, wouldn't you want to 
                        get out of there as soon as 
                        physically possible?

           Christine opens a drawer. Reveals a DESK BAR identical to 
           Sarah's. Washes down her half-chewed salad with a VODKA SWIG.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I hear you, but there's a reason 
                        the story hasn't gone national. 
                        Maybe if Mary were White. Or if the 
                        kid had died too.

                        But a middle-aged woman gets killed 
                        in the boondocks? Who's gonna care? 

                                 SARAH
                        I wouldn't call 35 middle-aged. And 
                        What's scarier than having your 
                        throat slit with your son in the 
                        next room?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Ya. That part's good. Less so the 
                        part where she's a poor waitress...  
                        Have you already forgotten the 
                        rules? Are they young? Wealthy? 
                        Powerful? Attractive? Good victims 
                        need to be enviable.

                                 SARAH
                        I just think-

                                 CHRISTINE
                        -Listen. I know how addictive this 
                        shit can be. I literally sit here 
                        all day hoping for bad things to 
                        happen to people I don't know. How 
                        fucked is that? But after what 
                        happened last year... I suggest you 
                        quit cold turkey.
                            (then, enthusiastic)
                        Wait! You live in LA! If you want 
                        drama, why not write a screenplay?

           Sarah rolls her eyes.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT.

           Tom returns from work to find Sarah and Riley eating dinner. 

                                 TOM
                            (light, but judging)
                        PB&J and Easy Mac in the same day? 
                        Damn, Riley. It's your lucky day.

           Sarah winces. Tom sits and snags a bite of Riley's pasta. 

                                 RILEY
                        Hey! That's mine!

                                 TOM
                        Daddy tax!

           Riley laughs. Tom avoids Sarah's gaze and takes another bite. 
                                 SARAH
                        How was work?

                                 TOM
                        Busy. But it's actually kind of 
                        good to be busy, you know? TO be 
                        needed. You have to see my office. 
                        It's got Insane views of Echo Moun-

           Sarah tunes him out. Her mind elsewhere.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT.

           Sarah brushes her teeth. Tom opens the MEDICINE CABINET and 
           hands her a PILL BOTTLE with an encouraging smile. The label 
           says it's CLOZAPINE-- a powerful antipsychotic. He opens the 
           bottle and shakes one out. Hands it to Sarah. She pops the 
           pill... Only to spit it out when Tom turns away.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT.

           The glow of Tom's ESPN APP lights the otherwise dark room. 
           Sarah kicks a leg in frustration. Hoping he'll wake and turn 
           off his phone. But he doesn't, so again she slips out of bed. 

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - NIGHT.

           Sarah hits play on the SECOND EPISODE OF LULU'S PODCAST. Half 
           listening as she opens the filing cabinet and pours tequila. 

                                 LULU (V.O.)
                        You're not gonna believe it, but...
                            (makes drum roll sound)
                        I managed to get my grubby little 
                        paws on the crime scene photos!

           Sarah stops in her tracks. Glass raised to her lips.

                                 LULU (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm sure you're all dying to know 
                        how I snagged these bad boys, but a 
                        reporter never reveals her sources. 
                        And let me tell you, the whole 
                        thing looks fishy as fu-

           PAUSE. Anxious to understand the girl's big break, Sarah 
           opens Instagram to Lulu's last message. Still unanswered.

           ON THE SCREEN: 

           If you agree the robbery looks staged... 2100 S Marina Dr.
           Sarah GOOGLES the ADDRESS-- a DINER three hours away in 
           Salton City. Compared to one of her marked-up MAPS, it's the 
           same diner where Mary worked and less than a mile from Mary's 
           house. She furrows her brow. Chugs what's left of her drink.

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING.

           Riley boards the Mercedes. It pulls away, revealing the same 
           moms across the street. Cindy glances at Sarah and whispers. 
           Presumably telling them about Sarah's odd behavior yesterday.

           Sarah SLAMS the door.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - DAY.

           Sarah rants to Lauren on Zoom. She's riled up. Her cool 
           veneer from the previous session? G-o-n-e.

                                 SARAH
                        I don't know why the Sheriff isn't 
                        taking it seriously. This guy knew 
                        to unscrew the porch light. Knew 
                        about the dog. About husband being 
                        out of town. Who spends that much 
                        time watching someone, only to 
                        attack when they're home? Most rob-

                                 LAUREN
                        -Sorry to interrupt, Sarah. But is 
                        it possible you're focusing on 
                        someone else's tragedy in order to 
                        avoid your own?

           Sarah looks outside. Made even angrier by the HOLE IN THE 
           FENCE. She looks, sharply, back at Lauren. In the eyes.

                                 SARAH
                        Have you ever been raped?

                                 LAUREN
                        No.

                                 SARAH
                        Then how could you possibly know?

                                 LAUREN
                        I'm not saying I can empathize, bu-

                                 SARAH
                        -You know what? This isn't working. 
                                 LAUREN
                        Hang on. Let's talk about thi-

           Sarah slams her laptop shut, opens Instagram on her phone and 
           types a hasty response to Lulu.

           ON THE SCREEN:

           Today. Noon.

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY.

           Again, Sarah FREEZES in the doorway. Exhales. Then steps out. 
           But it sticks this time. She rushes to lock the door. Scans 
           her yard for HAZARDS as she runs to her car and squeals away.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           As Sarah drives, the LA suburbs giving way to barren desert.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           There's no cell signal after Palm Springs. Spotify cuts out. 
           Sarah scans the radio. Passing stations of STATIC, COUNTRY 
           MUSIC and HISPANIC FOLK SONGS before stopping on:

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        There's no question you've broken 
                        some of the most important stories 
                        of the decade. And the reporting in 
                        your 2019 best-selling book is 
                        undeniably cinematic. But you've 
                        also been accused of omitting any 
                        details that could dampen the 
                        drama. Of inserting yourself too 
                        much into the story. How much if at 
                        all does that concern you?

                                 INTERVIEWEE (O.S.)
                        Not at all, Rachel. I wrote my book 
                        because people want to know about 
                        me. How it felt for Harvey 
                        Weinstein to have me followed. For 
                        NBC to kill my story out of fear.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        But isn't it true that the latter, 
                        at least, lacks compelling proof? 
                        That some worry you lack ethics?
                                 INTERVIEWEE (O.S.)
                        I resent that accusation. At some 
                        point, every journalist has to ask 
                        the question: Is it better to be 
                        accurate? Or to be heard?

           Sarah stares at the speakers. As if she can see the words 
           flowing out and then dissipating into the air.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           As Sarah passes the sign for Salton City, her car clocks 112 
           DEGREES. She turns onto the pathetic, one block strip of 
           DOWNTOWN. BOARDED BUILDINGS; OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE with OXYGEN 
           TANKS. The only lively business? Bob's Bar. From the opening.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           Sarah parks behind the DINER. Grabs her purse, giving us a 
           glimpse of the HANDGUN inside. She opens the door, instantly 
           overwhelmed by the STENCH. Covers her nose as she exits.

           INT. DINER - DAY.

           A BELL announces Sarah's arrival. The diner falls silent. Its 
           few PATRONS staring at the urban stranger in their midsts.

           Sarah is relieved to spot LULU, smiling and waving, in a 
           CORNER BOOTH. She heads over, passing a PHOTO MEMORIAL FOR 
           MARY on the wall-- Mary at the diner; Mary with her son.

           As Sarah slides into the booth, she can't help but stare at 
           Lulu. She knew the girl was young, but not this young. Not an 
           overly made up child.

           Lulu bangs out the last few words of a text and puts her 
           PHONE face up on the table. Noting Sarah's stares, she beams.

                                 LULU
                        Not what you expected, right? But 
                        true crime isn't just for 
                        housewives anymore. We're 
                        mainstream. 

           Lulu doesn't notice Sarah wince at the word housewives. Too 
           focused on the waitress, MELANIE (50s), arriving with JUICE.

                                 MELANIE
                        OJ on the house for our local 
                        Barbara Walters. 
                                 LULU
                        Thanks, Mel. You're the best.

           Lulu is beaming. But as soon as Melanie turns away, she drops 
           the smile. Pushes the glass aside.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        I can't even drink orange juice 
                        with my reflux. But free is free.

                                 SARAH
                        You know, back when I interned at 
                        the Times, we couldn't even accept 
                        a free glass of water.

                                 LULU
                        Well, it's a good thing I don't 
                        work for the Times. I'd ask if you 
                        were hungry, but there's nothing 
                        here for less than 3,000 calories. 
                        It's like, come on people. Have you 
                        heard of açai? ... Anyways, I'm so 
                        glad you're here. When I saw you 
                        were a journalist, I was like, Holy 
                        shit. She's perfect.

           Sarah doesn't admit she's no longer a journalist.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        I actually read about what happened 
                        to you. Have you ever considered 
                        doing a podcast? I just wish they 
                        hadn't caught the guy. It's way 
                        scarier when they don't catch the 
                        guy.

                                 SARAH
                        Isn't that kind of the point?

                                 LULU 
                        Oh my God! Of course. I'm just 
                        saying. That HBO show got so boring 
                        as soon as they caught the guy.

           BUZZ! BUZZ! Lulu reveals another cellphone. Sarah wonders why 
           she has two, but doesn't ask. 

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. Thought I put them both on 
                        silent. Things have been so crazy 
                        since we launched last week.

           As Lulu sends a text. Gets a text. Sends a text:
                                 SARAH
                        ... So how can I help?

           Lulu looks up. Puts this phone FACE DOWN, unlike its sibling.

                                 LULU
                            (looking up)
                        We both agree this wasn't just a 
                        robbery. But it hasn't gotten any 
                        attention in the press. And what 
                        does a lazy press make? Lazy cops.

           Lulu beams. Seemingly finished. Pleased with her conclusion.

                                 SARAH
                        I'm still not sure what-

           Lulu rolls her eyes. Wishes Sarah could keep up.

                                 LULU
                        -We need to light a fire under 
                        their ass. So I'm thinking, what if 
                        you write about it for the 
                        Inquirer? And if you can mention my 
                        podcast, even better.

                                 SARAH
                        Honestly, there isn't much to say 
                        that you haven't already covered. I 
                        was actually wondering what you we-

                                 LULU
                        -That's where you're wrong.

           She procures a BINDER. It falls to the Formica with a SMACK.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        This is where I track everything. 
                        Never let it out of my sight.

           Sarah stares at it. Yearning.

                                 SARAH
                        ... Can I?

           Lulu nods and slides the binder across the table. Sarah flips 
           through. Pausing on the gruesome CRIME SCENE PHOTOS-- dusty 
           footprints, the unscrewed patio light, the ransacked living 
           room, the dead dog... Mary tucked beneath bloody bedding.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        How did you get these?
                                 LULU
                            (smiling, coy)
                        I have my sources.

           Sarah turns the page-- POLICE RECORDS of Mary reporting 
           HANGUP CALLS in the days leading up to her attack.

                                 SARAH
                        I didn't know she got hangup calls.

                                 LULU
                        Mhm. Everyone just thought she was 
                        paranoid. That it was a prank. No 
                        one believed she was in danger. Not 
                        the cops. Not her gross husband.

           Lulu's voice has started to attract stares. Sarah darts an 
           apologetic glance at a nearby DINER. Then, softer:

                                 SARAH
                        Ya. What about him? Could he have 
                        had something to do with it?

                                 LULU
                        Nope. He's got a rock hard alibi. 
                        Was out-of-state on his trucking 
                        route when it happened. So unless 
                        he hired someone... 

           Lulu's second phone buzzes again. But she resists answering.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        What's weird is she wasn’t sexually 
                        assaulted, so this wasn’t about 
                        sex. And they left her ring, so it 
                        wasn't about money either. If you 
                        ask me, I think it was about power. 
                        About someone's need for control.

           Lulu's intuition catches Sarah off guard.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        Which brings me to my point. The 
                        real reason I asked you here today.
                            (taking time, relishing)
                        There's been another attack. 

                                 SARAH
                        Another attack?

                                 LULU
                        It actually happened a few weeks 
                        before Mary. And this time, there 
                        was a survivor.
                                 SARAH
                        A survivor?

                                 LULU
                        Are you going to repeat everything 
                        I say?

                                 SARAH
                        No. It's just... This doesn't seem 
                        like the kind of guy who would let 
                        someone go.

                                 LULU
                        I know, right?

           SLOW MOTION as Lulu reaches into her purse. Sarah panics, for 
           some reason worried she's about to be attacked, but all Lulu 
           procures is a PIECE OF PAPER that she hands to Sarah. 

           ON THE PAGE: 

           Lisa Anderson. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is this them? I don't understand. 
                        Why hasn't it been in the news?

                                 LULU
                        Rumor has it the Sheriff doesn't 
                        wanna scare our last few tourists. 
                        Salton City used to be something of 
                        a celeb hotspot, you know. Frank 
                        Sinatra and the like. But those 
                        days are over. O-v-e-r.

                                 SARAH
                        Have you tried talking to this Lisa 
                        person?

                                 LULU
                        Bitch keeps slamming the door in my 
                        face. Says she doesn't want to bait 
                        the guy or something... That's 
                        where you come in. I was hoping she 
                        might talk to a real journalist.

           Sarah's chest puffs with pride. Real. Journalist.

                                 SARAH
                        What makes you so sure the cases 
                        are tied? 
                                 LULU
                        30-something woman attacked after 
                        reporting hangup calls. No man in 
                        the house. Only difference is this 
                        chick managed not to die.

                                 SARAH
                        Why haven't you covered it?

                                 LULU
                        My source wants it kept quiet. 

                                 SARAH
                        Wait... So even if this woman tells 
                        us something, we can't publish it?

                                 LULU
                        Don't worry about that. We'll cross 
                        that bridge when we get to it.

                                 SARAH
                        Ok... But who's your source?

           Avoiding the question, Lulu pretends to look out the window.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You have to tell me if I'm going to 
                        help you.

                                 LULU
                            (a groan, then)
                        It's possible I have a secret 
                        boyfriend... Who's a cop.

                                 SARAH
                        You're dating a cop? 

           Lulu panics. Eyes darting around to ensure no one has heard.

                                 LULU
                        Sh! I said it was a secret. And 
                        technically he's a sheriffs deputy. 
                        But ya. He keeps me in the know.

           As Sarah internalizes this bombshell...

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        Have you ever been on a press trip? 
                        They sound so glam.

                                                           CUT TO:
           EXT. DINER - DAY.

           Lulu walks Sarah to her car. Unbothered by the STENCH.

                                 SARAH
                        Can I ask? About the smell?

                                 LULU
                        Oh. Like rotten eggs, right? It's 
                        hydrogen sulfide. Courtesy of our 
                        "lake." You'll get used to it... So 
                        when can you get back out here?

                                 SARAH
                        I'm not sure. I'll have to check my 
                        schedule and get back to you.

                                 LULU
                        Right. You've got a kid.

                                 SARAH
                        H-how do you know that?

                                 LULU
                        Dunno. Must have seen it on social. 
                        Anyways, this was great. Talk soon. 

           Lulu hugs Sarah, oblivious to her stiff discomfort, and heads 
           toward the BUS STOP. Leaving Sarah to rush into her car.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Sarah locks the doors and opens Instagram. She hasn't posted 
           anything in over a year. And there are no mentions of Riley. 
           The first thing on Tom's feed, however, is a photo of Riley 
           on her first day of school. Fucking. Tom.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           Sarah drives down residential blocks. Passing RANCH after 
           RANCH that reminds us this was once a mildly prosperous area. 
           Some houses are vacant. Others are collapsed, marked only by 
           a tall FIREPLACE. By RUSTED CARS and COUCHES on the lawns.

                                 LULU (V.O.)
                        It's crazy how much this place has 
                        changed. 
           INT. DINER - FLASHBACK. 

                                 LULU
                        People used to come from all over. 
                        At one point, we actually had more 
                        visitors than Yosemite. But the 
                        lake started to evaporate around 
                        the time I was born. That’s why I 
                        started the podcast. To get out.

                                 SARAH
                        Where would you go?

                                 LULU
                        Anywhere, I guess.

                                 SARAH
                        What about your boyfriend?

           Lulu shrugs.

           End flashback.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - PRESENT DAY.

           Sarah reaches the HIGHWAY... But decides not to merge.

           EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - DAY.

           Sarah parks and gets out. Her shirt instantly drenched with 
           SWEAT. Her shoe sticking to a forgotten strand of CRIME SCENE 
           TAPE as she walks up the path to the dark house. The FRONT 
           DOOR is locked, so she walks to the side and hops the fence. 
           Mimicking the Intruder's path.

           NOTE: AS SARAH SEES EACH PIECE OF EVIDENCE, WE WILL FLASH 
           IT'S MATCHING CRIME SCENE PHOTO.

           EXT. MARY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah procures a NOTEPAD and looks around. Summer hasn't been 
           kind to this yard. The grass is scorched. Everything covered 
           in a film of red dust. She writes down the words SWING and 
           DOGHOUSE, then lets herself in the unlocked backdoor. But not 
           without noting the unscrewed PORCH LIGHT.

           INT. MARY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The room is UNTOUCHED since the cops were here. Like it all 
           just occurred. Sarah's shoe CRUNCHING GLASS as she enters.
           Her investigative brain works at superhuman speed, clocking: 
           LATEX GLOVES; BLACK SOOT from fingerprint dusting; some 
           HANGING PICTURES, still somehow straight on the wall. She's 
           most interested in the OVERTURNED COFFEE TABLE, still resting 
           on its side. Approaches it and is able to flip it over with a 
           slight FLICK of the finger. She puts the table back and makes 
           another note-- COFFEE TABLE NOT FULLY FLIPPED?

           She hears a NOISE! JUMPS! Looks at the KITCHEN with dread.

           INT. MARY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN.

           Sarah enters. Cautious. Follows the SCRATCHING SOUND to the 
           BROOM CLOSET. She takes a breath before opening it, terrified 
           of what she'll find, only to discover... A RAT gnawing on 
           spoiled food in the TRASH CAN. She shakes her head.

           EXT. MARY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sarah tosses a BAG into the TRASH BIN.

           INT. MARY'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           She pauses where the dog died. Closes her eyes. Pictures it.

                                 PODCAST FAN (V.O.)
                        Can we please talk about the dog 
                        obviously being poisoned?

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. MARY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           Although beckoned by the door at the end of the hall, Sarah 
           stops to glance in every room. It all looks totally normal. 
           Dylan's room still a shrine to the kid who once lived here. 
           Finally, she reaches Mary's door. Hesitates before opening.

           INT. MARY'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The MATTRESS is gone, but dried BLOOD abounds-- on the WALLS; 
           on the END TABLE; on the BED FRAME. It's a horrifying sight.

           She closes her eyes and sees MARY'S CORPSE before her.
           Sarah collapses to floor. Spies a pool of BLOOD where it must 
           have soaked through the mattress. She chokes, as if about to 
           vomit, and clenches her eyes. Tries to make it disappear.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - FLASHBACK.

           Sarah writhes on the floor. Gagged and bound. Her muffled 
           PLEAS for help. But this time, there's a MAN with a SKI MASK 
           and GLOVES atop her. RAPING HER.

           End flashback.

           INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY, HOURS LATER.

           BUZZ! The phone's vibrations JOLT Sarah back to reality. She 
           misses the call, but sees several TEXTS from Tom. Stunned to 
           learn that it's 4 PM. Where did the time go?

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT.

           Sarah pulls up. Disappointed to see a PORSCHE CAYENNE in the 
           driveway.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT.

           Sarah finds her family eating dinner with Tom's sister, LILY 
           (38), and her twin SONS (9). Riley's head the only non-blonde 
           one of the bunch. As Charlie rushes forward, tentative:

                                 SARAH
                        Sorry. Guess I lost track of time.

           No one looks at Sarah except Riley, who seems sympathetic.

                                 TOM 
                        And forgot to be here when your 
                        daughter got home from school? 

                                 LILY
                        Come on, kids. Let's go watch PBS.

           Lily gathers the children and shuttles them out of the room. 

                                 TOM
                        ... So are you going to tell me 
                        what finally inspired you to leave 
                        the house? Or is that another one 
                        of your secrets?
                                 SARAH
                        Secrets?

                                 TOM
                        Don't do that. Don't act like you 
                        haven't been hiding something.
                            (then, with eye contact)
                        This was supposed to be a fresh 
                        start, Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        It is. 

                                 TOM
                        It doesn't feel like it.

                                 SARAH
                            (tentatively honest)
                        Well... Maybe that's because you 
                        made me quit my job and move across 
                        the entire country.

                                 TOM
                        No one made you do anything. 

                                 SARAH
                        Come on. You wanted me to stop 
                        working the day I had Riley. 

                                 TOM
                        That is so unfair.

                                 SARAH
                        Why else would we move here?

                                 TOM
                        Because I was never going to make 
                        partner in New York. Because Mom 
                        was the only one who would pay me 
                        enough to sustain our lifestyle. 
                        And there are newspapers in LA if 
                        you really need to work. 

                                 SARAH
                        What am I going to do? Get a job at 
                        People? That's even worse than the 
                        Inquirer. And why are you posting 
                        photos of Riley on Instagram when I 
                        specifically asked you not to?

                                 TOM
                        Seriously? You wanna talk about 
                        social media right now? Ok. Fine.
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Well, I highly doubt any of my 200 
                        followers care what Riley wore on 
                        her first day of fourth grade.

                                 SARAH
                        Then why post it? 

                                 TOM
                        I don't know. It's what people do.

                                 SARAH
                        But your profile is public. Anyone 
                        can see.

                                 TOM
                        Jesus, Sarah. When did you get so 
                        paranoid?

           He regrets the words as soon as they're out of his mouth.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        That came out wrong. What I meant 
                        to say is... We can't live scared.

           THROUGH A CRACK IN THE DOOR: Riley watches her parents fight.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, RILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT.

           Sarah tucks Riley into bed. Charlie at her feet, per usual.

                                 SARAH
                        Sorry I wasn't here when you got 
                        home from school.

                                 RILEY
                        That's ok.

           Riley opens her mouth... about to say something, when:

                                 SARAH
                        Good night, Baby Bear. I love you.

                                 RILEY
                        Love you too.

           Sarah turns out the lights. But Riley's eyes stay open.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - NIGHT.

           QUICK CUTS AS: Sarah unlocks the filing cabinet, pours a 
           drink and turns on her computer. She types LISA ANDERSON into 
           Google and finds something in the SALTON CITY POLICE BLOTTER.
           ON THE SCREEN: 

           Salton City resident Lisa Anderson reported a break-in on the 
           400 block of Bruner Place at 10 PM on Sunday, May 3. The 
           suspect fled upon encountering the homeowner. There were no 
           signs of forced entry, and nothing was reported stolen.

           Sarah visits WhitePages.com. Finds a number for Lisa 
           Anderson. Writes it down, then clears her browser history.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: Sarah watches Tom buckle Riley into the 
           backseat of his car. Waits for the ignition to start before 
           calling Christine. We INTER CUT between the two women.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sarah. I didn't expect to hear from 
                        you again so soon. Listen, I'm kind 
                        of in the middle of some-

                                 SARAH
                        -I went to the house. The robbery 
                        was clearly staged. And nothing had 
                        been touched, which makes me think 
                        cops still consider it an active 
                        scene. Also, I found out there was 
                        another attack. And a survivor.

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        Well, haven't you been a busy bee?
                            (types on her computer)
                        I don't see anything about another 
                        attack.

                                 SARAH
                        That's because the Sheriff's 
                        suppressing the story.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What? Why would he do that?

                                 SARAH
                        Doesn't wanna scare tourists.

           Christine pushes back her chair. Suddenly interested.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Corrupt cop stories are très hot 
                        right now, you know.

                                 SARAH
                        I know.
                                 CHRISTINE
                        But where are you getting this 
                        deluge of info?

                                 SARAH
                            (coy, imitating Lulu)
                        I have my sources.

           Christine looks up. Her ASSISTANT hovering in the doorway.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Listen. I have to run. But if you 
                        can connect the attacks and find a 
                        corrupt cop angle, then maybe we 
                        can discuss an article... You trust 
                        your source, right?

                                 SARAH
                            (a beat, then)
                        I do.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Good. Go back out there. See what 
                        you can find. And make sure to get 
                        every gory detail. I want to know 
                        what color her panties were. If 
                        they were grannies or a thong. 
                        Sometimes our readers care more 
                        about that shit than what actually 
                        happened.

           Sarah nods.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY.

           Lulu texts as Sarah loads the dishwasher.

           ON THE SCREEN: 

           When should we visit Lisa?

           Sarah pockets her phone without responding.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY.

           Sarah calls Lisa. Someone picks up, but doesn't speak...

                                 SARAH
                        ... Hello? Lisa? My name is Sarah 
                        Halsted, I'm a journalist with-
           CLICK! The line goes dead. At first, Sarah is stunned. Then 
           she sets her jaw and strides out of the room. Determined.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY.

           Keys in hand, Sarah heads for the front door when she 
           realizes... There's someone in her house. She panics, then:

                                 SARAH
                        Riley? What are you doing here?

                                 RILEY
                        I don't feel good.

                                 SARAH
                        What? How'd you get home?

                                 RILEY
                        You weren't answering, so Aunt Lily 
                        got me.

           Sarah peers out the window, but doesn't see Lily's car in the 
           driveway. She approaches Riley. Puts a hand to her forehead.

                                 SARAH
                        You don't feel warm.

           Lulu texts again. 

           ON THE LOCK SCREEN: 

           Hello???

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        How bad are you? 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           Sarah drives with Riley and Charlie in the backseat. 

                                 RILEY
                        Where are we going?

                                 SARAH
                        Mommy has to work.

           Riley opens her mouth, presumably to remind Sarah that she 
           doesn't work, then decides better.
           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY.

           Sarah refuels in Salton City. The off brand gas station as 
           decrepit as the rest of town. It's surfaces faded from the 
           desert sun. The MALE ATTENDANT stares, then looks away when 
           Sarah makes eye contact. It feels ominous. Threatening.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           Sarah parks and turns to Riley and Charlie.

                                 SARAH
                        You sure you're ok? I won't be 
                        long.

           Riley nods. Sarah grabs her purse and exits.

           EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah approaches the FRONT DOOR of the dark, seemingly 
           uninhabited house. Suddenly STARTLED, when:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           Sarah whips around. Pulls out the gun and points at Lulu, 
           whose hands fly into the air.

                                 SARAH
                        Lulu? What are you doing here?

                                 LULU
                        Not pulling guns on innocent 
                        friends, I'll tell you that much.

           Sarah puts the gun away. Glances back at Riley, who is too 
           busy petting Charlie to have noticed anything.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        Why do you have that thing?

                                 SARAH
                        I'll tell you if you tell me how 
                        you knew I was here.

                                 LULU
                        Steve called from the gas station.

                                 SARAH 
                        And how does Steve know who I am?

           Lulu gestures toward Sarah's Audi. Now covered in dust.
                                 LULU
                        You don't exactly blend in... I 
                        can't believe you were going to 
                        interrogate her without me.

                                 SARAH
                        I think you mean interview.

                                 LULU
                        Whatever. You knew I wanted to 
                        come.

                                 SARAH
                        I was going to call you after. I 
                        just thought Lisa might be more 
                        willing to talk woman-to-woman.

                                 LULU
                        And what am I?

                                 SARAH
                        That's not what I meant... It's 
                        just... You're here now. You may as 
                        well come.

           The trust between these two women has begun to unravel, but 
           they set it aside for the task at hand.

           They head for the front door. Sarah prepares to knock, but 
           Lulu beats her to the punch.

           A series of LOCKS click open. The door cracks. Its CHAIN 
           still in place. We can just glimpse a sliver of LISA (30s).

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Hi. I'm Sarah Halsted with The 
                        Daily Inquire-

                                 LISA
                        -I know who you are.

           The door starts to close, but Sarah blocks it with a FOOT.

                                 SARAH
                        We spoke briefly on the phone? I 
                        believe what happened to you is 
                        related to the death of Mary 
                        Hernandez.

                                 LISA
                        No shit.

           Lisa tries to shut the door again when... Riley appears. 
           Hopping from foot to foot.
                                 RILEY
                        Mom? I have to go!

           Softened by a child's presence, Lisa groans and steps aside 
           to let them in. Her eyes nervously combing the lawn.

           INT. LISA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Lisa plops into a LaZ-boy, wheezing, and puffs her INHALER.

                                 LISA
                        Highest rate of asthma 
                        hospitalizations in the state.
                            (then, pointing)
                        Can's down there. Be quick.

           Riley disappears. Glancing back at her mother.

           Sarah scans the room, instantly clocking: the half dozen 
           LOCKS on the door, the RIFLE against the sofa, the EMPTY CANS 
           dangling from the windows to alert Lisa to any intruders. 
           Lulu, of course, is too busy texting to see any of this.

                                 SARAH
                        Can you tell us what happened?

                                 LISA
                        So you can tell me I'm lying too?

                                 SARAH
                        Lisa. Can you just consider for a 
                        second that I might really want to 
                        help you? That I'm being sincere? 

           She holds Lisa's gaze, who sighs. Then, begrudging: 

                                 LISA 
                        A few weeks back, my phone started 
                        ringing off the hook. But I'd pick 
                        up... and there was no one there.

           Lulu pockets her phone. Suddenly interested.

                                 SARAH
                        They didn't say anything?

                                 LISA
                        No, but I could hear them-

           Riley appears. Which Lisa uses as a chance to stop.

                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        Thank God. Was about to get chatty.
           She ushers her guests to the door. Anxious for them to leave.

           EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Riley and Lulu head for the Audi. Sarah lingers on the porch.

                                 SARAH
                        Thanks again. You know where to 
                        find me if you ever want to talk.

           Lisa has started to close the door when Sarah spots a DOG 
           BONE lying in the grass and turns back.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Can you answer one more question? 

                                 LISA
                        Will you leave if I don't?

                                 SARAH
                        Do you have a dog?

           Riley and Lulu look back. Intrigued.

                                 LISA
                        Used to. But she ran away last 
                        week. And here I thought us bitches 
                        were supposed to stick together.

                                 SARAH
                        Got it. Thanks for your time.

                                 LISA
                        And I don't wanna hear a word of 
                        this on your little podcast, ok?

           Lulu opens her mouth to retort, but Lisa shuts the door.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           Sarah drops Lulu outside her crumbling APARTMENT COMPLEX. A 
           few dozen units with outdoor hallways.

                                 LULU
                        I can't believe she said it was 
                        little. It's like, hello. I had 
                        1,000 downloads last week.

                                 SARAH
                        ... So what'd you think?
                                 LULU
                        That she was kind of a bitch.

                                 SARAH
                        You can't call the victim a bitch.

                                 LULU
                        She said it first! 

                                 SARAH
                        Sources can be this way. Especially 
                        after something traumatic. It's our 
                        job not to make them clam up.

                                 LULU
                        Or... Maybe she's just a bitch.

                                 SARAH
                        Give it time. I'll get her to talk.

           Lulu gets out of the car, then leans back in the open window.

                                 LULU
                        Just call me next time, ok? You 
                        don't wanna see this bitch angry.

           Lulu smiles. Then turns, head already buried in her phone. 
           Leaving Sarah to wonder if that was a joke or a threat.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           They're halfway back to Pasadena, when:

                                 RILEY
                        I didn't really have to go to the 
                        bathroom. I made it up so that lady 
                        would let you in her house.

           Sarah looks in the rearview. Shocked.

                                 SARAH
                        Riley! You shouldn't lie like th-

                                 RILEY
                        -Why'd you ask about the dog?

                                 SARAH
                            (considering, then)
                        Mommy's looking for a bad guy. And 
                        whoever they are, I think they have 
                        a thing for dogs.
                                 RILEY
                        Dogs?

                                 SARAH
                        Dogs give people a false sense of 
                        security. You leave windows open, 
                        forget to lock the door. But if 
                        something happens to the dog-

                                 RILEY
                        -You're toast.

           Sarah watches Riley imitate dragging a knife across her neck.

                                 SARAH
                        Maybe we should cut down your 
                        screen time...

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT.

           Sarah's surprised to find the house dark despite Tom's sedan 
           in the driveway. Her cell full of MISSED CALLS from him.

                                 RILEY
                        Don't worry. I won't tell him.

           Surprising Sarah again with her odd behavior.

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT.

           The front door is AJAR. Sarah stops in her tracks. But Riley 
           and Charlie race inside.

                                 SARAH
                        Riley, wait-

           But it's too late. They're already gone.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS. 

           Sarah enters. Leaves the front door open just in case.

                                 SARAH
                        Tom?

           She looks around, but nothing seems askew.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        You're back.
           He turns on a lamp. Revealed to be sitting alone.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        The school called. Apparently Riley 
                        didn't show up today.

                                 SARAH
                        She came home sick.

           Tom cocks an eyebrow in disbelief.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Seriously. Ask your sister. She 
                        picked Riley up.

                                 TOM
                        You really think I didn't call 
                        Lily? You were gone for hours!

                                 SARAH
                        I'm sorry. We didn't mean to worry-

                                 TOM
                        -At least you've finally overcome 
                        your agoraphobia. That's what? Two 
                        days in a row? So where were you?

           Sarah opens her mouth to respond, but Tom cuts her off.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        You know what, forget it. Whatever 
                        you say would just be another lie.

           He storms out of the room. Sarah staring after him.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT.

           Tom reads Sports Illustrated in bed. Sarah enters and 
           approaches the dresser. She applies eye cream and considers 
           Tom in the mirror. 

                                 SARAH
                        I really am sorry.

           Tom looks up. Waits for her to say more. But she doesn't.

                                 TOM
                        I've tried everything. Giving you 
                        space. Not giving you space. But no 
                        matter what I do, it's wrong.

           Sarah goes to sit beside him. Perched atop the bedding.
                                 SARAH
                        I know. I just... miss us.

                                 TOM
                        I do too.

           She leans in, about to kiss when...

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Wait-

           At first, he resists her lips on his. Then things intensify. 
           He slides her nightgown off her shoulder. Pulls her atop him.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING.

           Sarah hums as she waits for the kettle to boil. Tom enters 
           and wraps his arms around her from behind. Kisses her neck. 
           She moans, but doesn't startle. Already less anxious.

           Riley enters as her parents kiss.

                                 RILEY
                        Ewwwwww!

                                 TOM
                        Hey, little lady! You're in luck. 
                        Daddy can take you to school. We 
                        wouldn't want your mom kidnapping 
                        you again, would we? 

           He winks to show Sarah he's kidding.

                                 RILEY
                        Can I eat breakfast in the car???

                                 TOM
                        Sure. But nothing too crumby. 

                                 RILEY
                        Can I sit in the front seat?

                                 TOM
                        Don't push it.
                            (then, to Sarah)
                        Talk tonight?

           She nods. They both smile. Tom ushers Riley toward the door.
           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: Sarah watches Tom buckle Riley in. His 
           car gleaming next to hers, covered in dust. She's surprised 
           when her phone rings. Even more surprised that it's... Lisa.

                                 SARAH
                        Lisa. I'm so glad you called-

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        -Ya really think you can catch him?

                                 SARAH
                        I think I'm your best shot.

                                 LISA
                        Ok, then. Let's talk.

           Sarah takes notes as Lisa talks.

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        Like I said. It all started with 
                        the phone calls.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. LISA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK.

           Lisa's LANDLINE PHONE rings. She answers.

                                 LISA
                        Hello? ... Hello? 

           A beat, then HEAVY BREATHING. Lisa STARTLES, then recovers.

                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        What? You having an asthma attack?

                                 LISA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I assumed it was a prank. It gets 
                        so hot here in the summer. Everyone 
                        goes a little crazy.

                        But they kept calling.

           The landline rings. Lisa answers, already irritated.

                                 LISA
                        Whoever this is, you gotta stop.

           HEAVY BREATHING.

                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        Don't make me call the police.

           Then, their voice manipulated:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Go ahead.

           Lisa slams down the phone.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        That's all they said? Go ahead?

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        At first. But then...

           INT. LISA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - FLASHBACK.

           The landline rings. And rings. Lisa, microwaving a TV dinner 
           in her messy KITCHEN, tries to ignore it. But it's incessant.

                                 LISA
                        I'm not kidding, I-

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                            (manipulated voice)
                        -I'm gonna slit your throat.

           She GASPS and RIPS the cord out of the wall. 

           End flashback.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Did you call them? The police???
                                 LISA
                        What do you think I am? Stupid? The 
                        fuckers didn't believe me. Or at 
                        least not that I was in danger. 

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        So... They did nothing?

                                 LISA
                        Nope. Nada. Zilch. Not even when 
                        things got worse.

           INT. LISA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK.

           Lisa enters wearing a UNIFORM from a local grocery store. 
           Puzzled to find a WINDOW, which she's sure she closed, open.

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        It started to feel like someone had 
                        been in the house. Things were 
                        missing. Out of place.

           She shuts the window. Peers through the glass. 

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Did you call the cops again?

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        Why? So they could blow me off 
                        twice? Anyways, there was no time. 
                        He attacked the next night.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. LISA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK.

           Lisa enters, in uniform, and tosses her purse onto the sofa.

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        I always work the late shift on 
                        Tuesdays. Get home around 10, 
                        10:30. Fucker musta known that. 
                        What he didn't know is that I'd 
                        have a friend with me.

           CHRISTIE (20s) enters in the same uniform. Shuts the door.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        I'm so sorry to put you out. Can't 
                        believe I forgot my keys. 
                                 LISA
                        Stop apologizing. You're fine... 
                        Want something ta drink?

                                 CHRISTIE 
                        Sure. Whatever you got.

           Lisa nods and heads into the...

           KITCHEN.

           She grabs two BEERS. Failing to notice... The Intruder hiding 
           on the other side of her fridge. Eyes wide behind their mask.

                                 LISA
                        It's almost a full moon. Whaddya 
                        say we drink in the yard?

                                 CHRISTIE (O.S.)
                        Fine by me.

           The Intruder looks at the BACK DOOR and panics. Realizing the 
           women will have to walk right past them to get outside.

                                 LISA
                        Wanna sweater? It's hot as hell all 
                        day, and then poof! Antarctica!

                                 CHRISTIE (O.S.)
                        Sure. Thanks.

           Lisa puts down the drinks and exits. The Intruder flattens 
           their body against the fridge. Trying to be invisible.

           Christie saunters in. Cracks her beer. Snoops around. She 
           studies the FRIDGE PHOTOS, then opens a DRAWER. Finds a FOIL, 
           NEEDLE and SPOON. She slams it shut. As if they might bite.

           Lisa wanders in with a sweatshirt for Christie.

                                 LISA
                        I'll meet you out there. Just gotta 
                        get the opener.

           Christie nods, awkward, and takes the drinks outside. Lisa 
           opens a different drawer. Rummaging for the bottle opener.

           Suddenly, the Intruder JUMPS out! Brandishing their knife!

           Lisa SCREAMS. With her hand still in the drawer, she procures 
           a CHEF'S KNIFE and points it at the Intruder. They stare at 
           the blade... At Lisa... Then bolt. She starts after them, but 
           stops in the doorway and screams:
                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        You're lucky I have bad knees!

           The FRONT DOOR slams. Christie runs in from the yard, 
           panicked, to find Lisa wielding the knife.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        What's going on? 

           Lisa turns. The blade points at Christie, who recoils.

                                 LISA
                        Th-there was someone here!

           Christie follows Lisa's gaze... But sees nothing.

                        Yup. Pussy. Clearly didn't expect 
                        Christie to be there. Although I

           OPEN and RANSACKED. She goes over to the drawer and digs.

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        It belonged to my father. Cops said

                                 SARAH
                        And the cops didn't reach back out 
                        after Mary?

                                 LISA
                        Nope. Those idiots could barely get 
                        a cat out of a tree...

           As Lisa's voice fades out... We PUSH IN on Sarah's face.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sarah is locking the filing cabinet when Charlie runs in. 
           Desperate for pets. Sarah obliges her, failing to notice 
           that... She drops the KEY in the process.
           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DUSK.

           Sarah talks to Lulu on the phone while boiling pasta. We 
           INTER CUT with Lulu's tiny apartment and its MAKESHIFT 
           RECORDING STUDIO, where she has Sarah on speakerphone.

                                 LULU 
                        He just ran??? Without taking 
                        anything???

           Sarah pictures the WATCH... Considers being honest... 

                                 SARAH
                        Just some old underwear.

                                 LULU
                        Just like Mary. What a perv. Can't 
                        believe I missed that call. I 
                        didn't even hear my phone ring.

                                 SARAH
                        Actually... I thought it might be 
                        better if I talked to Lisa alone.

                                 LULU
                        Sarah... 

                                 SARAH
                        What? She hated you!

                                 LULU
                        So you went behind my back? Talked 
                        to my source without me?

                                 SARAH
                        She called me, Lulu.

                                 LULU
                        You could have conferenced me in! 

                                 SARAH
                        I did what was best for the 
                        investigation.

                                 LULU
                        Did you? Or were you trying to cut 
                        me out? Hog all the glory?

                                 SARAH
                        It's not about that. I don't know 
                        why you're so upset. We got the 
                        information we needed. 
                                 LULU
                        I just think it's weird. Like you 
                        were trying to hide something... 

                                 SARAH
                        What would I be trying to hide?

                                 LULU
                        I don't know, Miss Carries A Glock 
                        In Her Purse. Don't they always say 
                        it's those closest to the case that 
                        are the most suspicious?

                                 SARAH
                        In what world am I the closest 
                        person to the case? I didn't even 
                        know Mary... You knew Mary.

                                 LULU
                        Are you seriously accusing?

           A MAN enters Lulu's apartment. He wears a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
           UNIFORM, but is only seen from behind. The SECRET BOYFRIEND!

                                 SARAH
                        Only because you accused me! Why  
                        even tell me about Lisa if I wasn't 
                        allowed to talk to her?

                                 SECRET BOYFRIEND (O.S.)
                        LULU!

           Lulu, who thought she was alone, FREEZES. Caught red-handed.

                          LULU
                                                      SARAH
           Shit.
                                           Who is that?

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        I've gotta go.

                                 SARAH
                        Lulu, wait-

           CLICK! The line goes dead. As Sarah stares at her phone...

           INT. LULU'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS.

           ... Lulu fights with her Boyfriend. His face still hidden.

                                 LULU
                        Babe. I can explain. 
                                 SECRET BOYFRIEND 
                        Explain what? That you blabbed 
                        confidential information?

                                 LULU
                        Well... Ya... That's pretty much 
                        what happened.

                                 SECRET BOYFRIEND
                        I try to help, and this is how you 
                        repay me? I could get fired, Lulu!

                                 LULU
                        No one will suspect you. I swear. 
                        No one even knows we're dating.

           He PUNCHES the wall, narrowly missing Lulu's face, and storms 
           out of the apartment. Leaving Lulu stunned. 

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT. 

           Sarah ladles BUTTERED NOODLES out to Riley and Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Pasta again? Are you trying to 
                        fatten me up?

                                 SARAH
                        Don't worry. There's only mac this 
                        time. No cheese. 

           Tom laughs. Riley doesn't get what's so funny, but is 
           thrilled to see her parents getting along.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING.

           Sarah wakes up, happy to be wrapped in Tom's arms. She rolls 
           over and checks her phone. Surprised to find SEVERAL MISSED 
           CALLS from Lisa. Takes her cell and tiptoes into-

           THE HALLWAY.

           Lisa answers on the first ring.

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        Well, would you look who it is. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hey, Lisa. What's up?
                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        What's up? What's up? 

                                 SARAH
                        Is something wrong? I just woke up. 

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        Why don't you ask your friend?

           CLICK! 

           Sarah's fingers shake as she pulls up the THIRD AND LATEST 
           EPISODE of Lulu's podcast, which published that morning.

           ON THE SCREEN: 

           THE SURVIVOR. How One Woman survived Mary Hernandez's killer 
           and corruption at the Imperial County Sheriff's Department.

           Furious, Sarah calls Lulu. We INTER CUT between the women:

                                 LULU
                        Lulu speaking. 

                                 SARAH
                        How could you?

                                 LULU
                        How could I what?

                                 SARAH 
                        You stole my interview!

                                 LULU
                        So? You stole my lead! It's a 
                        shame, really. We could have worked 
                        well together. Me, the young 
                        upstart. And you, the older 
                        journalist. But it's such a drag 
                        doing things-
                            (imitating Sarah's voice)
                        They way they're meant to be done.

                                 SARAH
                        There's a reason we have ethic-

                                 LULU
                        -Whatever.

           CLICK! 

                                 SARAH
                            (sotto, distraught)
                        Can people stop hanging up on me?
           Tom appears in the hallway. Groggy. Ruffling his hair.

                                 TOM 
                        Is everything ok?

                                 SARAH
                        Ya. Everything's fine.

                                 TOM
                        Come back to bed.

           He extends a hand. Sarah forces a smile and lets him lead her 
           back into the bedroom.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - DAY.

           Sarah watches Tom put Riley in the car, then calls Christine.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Well, would you look who it is. My 
                        little Truman Capote. You know, I 
                        was just talking about you-

                                 SARAH
                        -I spoke to the other woman. The 
                        survivor. The two cases are almost 
                        identical, other than the fact he 
                        didn't kill Lisa. Which I'm 
                        starting to think was a mistake... 
                        We need to publish something. Now.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Ok... But what's the rush? 

                                 SARAH
                        The rush is my source fucked me. 
                        The rush is we need to warn the 
                        public before he strikes again.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Did you find any proof linking the 
                        cases?

                                 SARAH
                        How could they not be? The hangup 
                        calls, the underwear, the dogs-

                                 CHRISTINE
                        -And you don't have any proof of
                        police wrongdoing? Nothing you can 
                        use to make it look that way?
                                 SARAH
                        No... But the Sheriff's totally 
                        fucking up this investigation! They 
                        still think Mary was a robbery gone 
                        wrong! 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Listen. Sarah. I understand why 
                        you're anxious to write something. 
                        But I can't publish a story just so 
                        you can get back at your source. 

                                 SARAH
                        You've published articles for less 
                        legitimate reasons. Or have you 
                        forgotten the time we accused an 
                        innocent man of murder just to beat 
                        The Daily Mail to a scoop? We sent 
                        the cops in the wrong direction for 
                        weeks! They might have caught the 
                        guy if it weren't for us.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sarah. You need to calm down.

                                 SARAH
                            (a breath, then calmer)
                        How many serial killers did I 
                        profile for The Daily Inquirer?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don't know. Maybe a dozen?

                                 SARAH
                        I know how these guys work. Better 
                        than anyone else. He's going to 
                        strike again. Soon. He's probably 
                        already chosen his next victim.
                            (then, voice cracking)
                        I can't let what happened to me 
                        happen to anyone else.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        ... Ok. Fine.

                                 SARAH
                        Really???

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes. But only a web piece. And only 
                        if you publish under a pseudonym.

                                 SARAH
                        A pseudonym? 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        These are my terms. I want 700 
                        words in the morning. And remember. 
                        The gorier, the better. I want 
                        tears. Actual tears while I'm 
                        reading it.

                                 SARAH
                        Understood.

           Sarah hangs up and immediately texts Lulu.

           Sarah parks in front of the GROCERY STORE and checks her 
           phone. Wondering why Lulu hasn't responded to her text.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT.

           As Sarah enters with GROCERIES, Riley runs up. Warning:

                                 RILEY
                        Mom-

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        -Riley, go to your room.

           Tom walks in behind her. His face stern.

                                 RILEY
                        But-

                                 TOM
                        -Now.

           Riley looks at her mom... Hesitates... Then does as told. 

                                 SARAH
                        What's going on?

                                 TOM
                        What is this?

           He holds out a key-- the key to her filing cabinet. Shit.

                                 SARAH
                        Tom. I can explain.
                                 TOM
                        Did you at least tell the police 
                        what you found this time?

           Her silence indicates that she hasn't. Tom shakes his head.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I can't believe you. It's your job.

                                 SARAH
                        Actually... No. It isn't.

                                 TOM
                        Ok. Maybe it's not your job. But it 
                        is your duty as a human being.

           Sarah shrugs.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        You do realize this makes you just 
                        like them. The criminals. Getting 
                        off on other people's misery.

                                 SARAH
                        The cops already have their theory. 

           Tom sinks into a chair. Head in his hands. Totally spent.

                                 TOM
                        And here I thought therapy was 
                        finally working.

           She puts down the groceries and approaches him. Tentative:

                                 SARAH
                        Actually... I quit therapy.

                                 TOM
                        Jesus, Sarah. Really? I thought 
                        you'd learned your lesson.

                                 SARAH
                            (a beat, then furious)
                        Learned my lesson? It's not my 
                        fault I got raped.

                                 TOM
                        You know that's not what I meant. 
                        It's just... You're going to make 
                        us a target again.
                                 SARAH
                        See. There it is. Blame... Well 
                        then I should probably tell you 
                        that I talked to Christine.

                                 TOM
                        Your old boss Christine? Why?

                                 SARAH
                        She wants me to write about it.

                                 TOM
                        You can't be serious. After 
                        everything we've been through.

                                 SARAH
                        I'm publishing under a pseudonym. 
                        But if there's something I can do 
                        to catch this guy, I have to do it.

                                 TOM
                        There is something you can do. You 
                        can call the fucking cops!
                            (beat)
                        You know what... Maybe Riley and I 
                        should stay with Mom for a while. 
                        Until things calm down.

                                 SARAH
                        Seriously? You're just gonna leave?

                                 TOM
                        I think it'd be best... For Riley. 

           Sarah opens her mouth, then decides not to object.

                                 SARAH
                        Ok. Fine. Maybe you're right.

           Although Tom suggested it, he was hoping she'd object.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - NIGHT.

           Sarah stays up all night. Drinking and writing her article. 
           Looking at the mug with its picture of Riley.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: Sarah watches Riley KICK and SCREAM as 
           Tom loads her into the Audi beside SUITCASES. 
                                 TOM
                        Riley! Stop! You're going to 
                        scratch the leather.

           She's about to chase after them when Christine calls. INTER 
           CUT:

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        Um, hello. Your article is blowing 
                        the fuck up. 

                                 SARAH
                        Really? I didn't know it'd gone up.

           Sarah puts Christine on speaker and opens her article on her 
           phone. Scans through the HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF COMMENTS.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Everyone loves the detail about 
                        Lisa's watch. About the Star Wars 
                        posters in Dylan's room. It's all 
                        so tragic. I want a follow up ASAP.

           Sarah NODS.

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Sarah?

                                 SARAH
                        I'm nodding.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Good. And let's lay off the 
                        personal anecdotes this time. Don't 
                        think I missed the bit about the 
                        author being a young mom. If and 
                        when we catch the guy, we'll tell 
                        everyone who you are. Until then, 
                        you need to lie low.

                                 SARAH
                        Ok. I'll head back out there. See 
                        what I can dig up.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Good girl. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah can't believe Lulu still hasn't responded to her text.
           She opens Instagram. Surprised Lulu, who posts constantly, 
           hasn't in over a day. Her last photo? A SELFIE of Lulu on a 
           hike. Its caption reads: Think outside. No box required.

                                 SARAH
                            (sotto)
                        Fucking puns.

           She opens her Daily Inquirer article. Scans the new comments. 

           ON THE SCREEN:

           Another case??? If the pigs had taken it seriously, maybe 
           Mary would still be alive. 

           How'd the podcast miss the detail about the watch? Not that 
           it changes anything. But still.

           A bit risky to conduct your own murder investigation with a 
           child in the house, don’t you think? Even in a place as safe 
           as Pasadena.

           Sarah rereads the last comment. She types CONTROL+F and 
           searches for the word Pasadena. It's nowhere in her article.

           Only two people know where she lives. Christine and... Lulu.

           Sarah reopens Instagram. Studies Lulu's smile in that selfie. 
           Is Lulu outing her? And if so, why? 

           Suddenly, the LANDLINE rings. Sarah STARTLES and answers it.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        H-hello?

           There's a long beat. Sarah panics. Is this a hangup call???

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Hello??? Who is this?

                                 TELEMARKETER
                        Hi! I'm calling from Rusnak Audi to 
                        discuss your extended car warranty-

           She SLAMS down the phone.

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - LATER.

           Sarah loads both Charlie and an OVERNIGHT BAG into her car.
           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Meanwhile, back inside, the LANDLINE rings... And rings... 

           EXT. TOM'S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY

           Sarah parks before the tasteful MANSION where Tom grew up. 
           Tom's mother, CLAIRE HALSTED (65), peers out a window. She 
           watches Sarah ring the bell, then lets the curtain close.

           Tom opens the door. Confused to see his wife.

                                 TOM
                        Sarah? What are you doing here?

                                 SARAH
                        I have to go out of town for a few 
                        days.

                                 TOM
                        Ok... I'm sorry... It's just... How 
                        is that even possible? You couldn't 
                        even leave the house a week ago. 

                                 SARAH
                        I guess I just needed a reason.

                                 TOM
                        And we weren't enough of a reason? 

                                 SARAH
                        I was hoping to see Riley.

           She peers around Tom into the house. He hesitates. Steps 
           aside. 

           INT. TOMS' PARENTS HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY.

           Tom and Claire play BRIDGE as a HOUSEKEEPER bustles behind 
           them. Seen more closely, Claire is the definition of a WASP. 
           The kind of woman who won't leave the house without lipstick.

           She looks outside, where Sarah and Riley swing, and TUTS.

                                 TOM
                        Calm down, Mother. I can feel the 
                        judgement zinging off of you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sorry. I know it's awful what 
                        happened to her.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        But you can’t waste your life 
                        waiting for Sarah to get better. 
                        You have Riley to think of.

                                 TOM
                        PTSD fries the brain. Makes you see 
                        threats where there aren't any.  

                                 CLAIRE
                            (then, looking outside)
                        What do you think she does all day 
                        while you're at work?

                                 TOM
                        How should I know?

                                 CLAIRE
                        You don't know how your own wife 
                        spends her time?

           Tom looks through the window and considers this thought.

           EXT. TOM'S PARENTS' HOUSE, BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah and Riley swing. Charlie DIGS in Claire's ROSEBUSHES, 
           which Sarah notes with a smile. 

                                 RILEY
                        Why can't I come?

                                 SARAH
                        I wish you could, Baby Bear. But 
                        it's only one night. Maybe two.

                                 RILEY
                        B-but Charlie.

                                 SARAH
                        Charlie loves it here. She's a huge 
                        fan of Grandma's prize-winning 
                        roses.

                                 RILEY
                            (starting to cry)
                        But-but you said...

                                 SARAH
                        What did I say?

                                 RILEY
                        About the bad man and dogs. 
                                 SARAH
                            (puzzled, then 
                            remembering)
                        Oh, Riley. I'm going to be fine.

           She musses Riley's hair. Kisses the top of her head.

           EXT. TOM'S PARENTS' HOUSE - LATER.

           Tom walks Sarah to her car. Sees the luggage in the backseat.

                                 TOM
                        It isn't just one story, is it? 
                            (beat)
                        Maybe, when you get back, we should 
                        discuss our future.

           Tears fill Sarah's eyes as she nods.

           EXT. TOM'S PARENTS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           WIDE SHOT: Someone watches Tom and Sarah. STALKING from afar.

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - DAY.

           Sarah slows as she drives past Lulu's apartment building. She 
           calls, but is sent straight to voicemail.

                                 LULU (O.S.)
                        You've reached Lulu. Leave a 
                        message, and I'll call you back 
                        when TikTok gets boring.

           BEEP! Sarah opts not to leave a message.

           EXT. MOTEL - DUSK.

           Sarah parks at a BUDGET MOTEL. Its VACANCY SIGN half-lit. The 
           whole place is 1950s. When Salton City used to be in style.

           INT. MOTEL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER.

           The stout receptionist, CAITLIN (20), looks up from the rerun 
           of The View that she's watching an old CRT TV. Sarah squints 
           to read her NAME TAG.

                                 SARAH
                        Hi, Caitlin. Do you have any rooms?
                                 CAITLIN
                        You wanna view of the parking lot 
                        or a view of the highway?

                                 SARAH
                        Uh... Parking lot, I guess.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Good choice.

           As Caitlin procures a key, Sarah reaches for her WALLET.

                                 CAITLIN (CONT'D)
                        Cash in the morning is fine. 

           Sarah nods. Heads toward the smudged glass DOOR, then pauses:

                                 SARAH
                        Is there a liquor store near here?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Across the street.

           Sarah nods... About to leave...

                                 CAITLIN (CONT'D)
                        But it closed. Nothing stays open 
                        around here. If you wanna drink, 
                        you'll have to go to Bob's.

                                 SARAH
                        Bob's?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Up the street. On your left. Just 
                        follow the stench of Wild Turkey. 

                                 SARAH
                        Got it. Thanks. 

           Caitlin watches Sarah leave, then picks up the rotary phone.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sarah enters the shabby room. Notes its MUSTY SCENT and 
           STAINED CARPET. A forgotten TOENAIL CLIPPING on the bedding.

                                 SARAH
                        Well, Toto. I've a feeling we 
                        aren't in Pasadena anymore. 

           She heaves her suitcase onto the bed.
           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT. 

           QUICK CUTS AS: Sarah unzips her bag, puts her toiletry kit in 
           the bathroom and checks the MINIBAR-- if you can call a few 
           NIPS in a broken fridge a minibar. 

           She takes the booze to the bed, puts a TOWEL over the 
           decades-old comforter, and shoots a nip. Reaching for her 
           LAPTOP when her cell rings. She scrambles for it, hoping it's 
           Lulu. But it's Tom. And that's good too.

                                 SARAH
                        Tom. I'm so glad you-

                                 RILEY (O.S.)
                        -Mom?

           We INTER CUT with a panicked Riley. Her bedroom at Claire's 
           house is frilly, pink, out of date. Likely Lily's old room.

                                 SARAH
                        Riley? Is everything ok???

                                 RILEY 
                        Ya. I just wanted to talk to you.

           As Sarah's heart rate slows, she tries to make conversation.

                                 SARAH
                        What'd Shelly make for dinner?

                                 RILEY 
                        Prime rib.

                                 SARAH
                        Mmm. I would kill for her prime 
                        rib. The only good thing about that 
                        house is the food. You should see 
                        the restaurants out here. There's 
                        not even a McDonald's.

           Sarah pulls back the CURTAIN. Stares at the empty street. Her 
           stomach GROWLS. Sarah stands and heads for the door.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You've got your presentation 
                        tomorrow, right? Who's it on again?

                                 RILEY
                        Alice Roosevelt.

                                                           CUT TO:
           EXT. MOTEL - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah emerges with the phone to her ear. She approaches the 
           VENDING MACHINE at the end of the open hall. Feeds it a buck.

                                 SARAH
                        Remind me who she was again?

                                 RILEY 
                        Teddy Roosevelt's daughter.

                                 SARAH
                        Right. The one with a drug problem.

                                 RILEY
                        Mom!

           Sarah presses the buttons for a SNICKERS.

           EXT. MOTEL - CONTINUOUS.

           WIDE SHOT: Someone watches Sarah from the parking lot. We 
           can't see them, but we can hear their BREATHING.

           EXT. MOTEL - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah thinks she feels their gaze upon her. Looks around, but 
           doesn't see anyone.

                                 RILEY
                        You're the one who says not to 
                        judge a story by its cover.

                                 SARAH
                        Sorry. You're right.

           She fishes her Snickers out of the machine.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

           Sarah crawls back onto bed and bites the Snickers. Her jaw 
           fighting the stale caramel. She can't resist opening Lulu's 
           Instagram again. For what feels like the millionth time.

           Finally, there's a NEW POST. LULU and a FEMALE FRIEND (early 
           20s). Making faces and hugging. The caption reads: JUST 
           ANOTHER NIGHT WITH THE GIRLS.

           But wait. Where's the pun? It doesn't sound like Lulu at all.
           Sarah's about to put her phone away when she spies a MAN in 
           the background of the photo. Zooms in, but can just glimpse 
           his profile. She closes her eyes and remembers:

                                 LULU (V.O.)
                        It's possible I'm seeing someone... 
                        A cop.

           She opens the IMPERIAL COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WEBSITE. 
           Finds a list of all the deputies. She scans their HEADSHOTS. 
           Compares each face to the photo. Identifies a possible match.

           MITCH HAYES (40s) smiles up at her from the screen.

           Sarah shudders, turns out the light and goes to bed. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT.

           As Lulu approaches a NEWS STATION, she chats on the phone.

                                 LULU
                        It's just local channel, but I'm 
                        psyched. I've never been on TV.
                            (she pauses, listens)
                        I think they said six. God. I hope 
                        Paul's the one who interviews me. 
                        He's so hot.

           Hearing footsteps, Lulu stops in her tracks. Looks around. 
           Until distracted by her phone conversation.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        Of course, I brought my own 
                        foundation. What am I going to do? 
                        Have my face not match my neck?

           She's about to enter the building when... a GLOVED HAND 
           appears and CHLOROFORMS her with a TOWEL. Lulu passes out. 
           Her phone clatters to the ground. The kidnapper picks it up.

           EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT.

           Lulu wakes in a truck bed. She hears COUNTRY MUSIC blaring in 
           the cabin. Looks up at the expansive sky. She can tell she's 
           in the middle of the desert from the lack of light pollution.

           She tries to stand, but her feet are tied. Her hands knotted 
           behind her back. Strains against the rope, but it won't give.

           Lulu stops... Thinks... Remembers her second phone.
           She can just reach her jeans pocket. It takes some wriggling, 
           but the device FALLS out and SLIDES to the back of the truck.

           Lulu pauses to make sure the driver hasn't heard anything... 
           Then crawls toward the phone. Her face close to the screen.

                                 LULU
                        Siri, call 911.
                            (then, louder)
                        Siri, call 911.

           The phone lights up. Lulu relieved to see ONE BAR of service. 

                                 SIRI
                        Calling Sarah Halsted.

                                 LULU
                        What? No! 

           But it's already calling.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        No! Siri! Call 911!

           The music turns off. Shit. They must have heard her. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah rolls over. Doesn't wake. Misses the call.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

           INT./EXT. TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS.

           We can barely hear Sarah's recorded VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Hi. You've reached Sarah Halsted. 
                        Please leave a message, and I'll 
                        return as soon as possible.

           BEEP! Lulu hisses:

                                 LULU
                        Pick up your fucking phone, Sarah.  
                        I know you're in town.  

           The truck stops.  
                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        I've been kidnapped!

           A door opens and closes. Footsteps approach.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        I'm not joking. I'm in the middle 
                        of the fucking des-

           The TAILGATE opens. Lulu screams as the attacker grabs her 
           ankles and drag her to the back of the truck. She thrashes, 
           rolls onto her back and seems to recognize them. 

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        Seriously? You?

           They yank. Lulu lands in the dirt and is CHLOROFORMED again.

           We PUSH IN on Lulu's phone. Still lit up, still recording its 
           message. Until a GLOVED HAND picks it up and ends the call.

           EXT. SALTON SEA - NIGHT.

           Lulu comes to on the dried lake bed. Her eyes struggling to 
           adjust to the darkness. She gags at the stench of several 
           dead TILAPIA floating a few feet away in the shallow water. 

           But where's her attacker?

           She fights against her ligatures to no avail. Gives up and 
           screams. Breath escaping her mouth in the cold desert air. 

                                 LULU
                        I know you're out there!

           She waits, then tries again. Her tone soft. Almost sweet.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        I just wanna talk to you. I won't 
                        tell anyone what I saw.

           The truck, parked a few feet away in the shadows, ignites its 
           headlights. Lulu blinks. Energized. Is her plan working?

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        I know how to keep my mouth shut.

           The INTRUDER gets out of the truck and approaches. Wearing 
           their ski mask and gloves.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        You know I never cared who did it. 
                        I just wanted the-
           They pull out their KNIFE. Lulu panics.

                                 LULU (CONT'D)
                        Please. You've known me my whole-

                                 INTRUDER
                        -Shut up!

           The Intruder forgets to manipulate their undeniably MALE 
           VOICE. Lulu does as told, but can't stay quiet for long.

                                 LULU
                        You don't have to do this.

                                 INTRUDER
                        I SAID SHUT THE FUCK UP!

           He SMACKS her, not expecting Lulu to fall backwards and SMASH 
           her head on a ROCK. BLOOD trickles out of the wound. Lulu 
           touches her hand to it, then looks at the blood. Passes out.

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Shit!

           He rushes forward. Falls to his knees. Gathers Lulu's head in 
           his lap. She's unconscious. His hands now covered in BLOOD.

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Come on, Lulu! Wake up!

           But she doesn't. He seems oddly distraught given the 
           circumstances. Checks her pulse, then WAILS like a wounded 
           animal. Uses his fingers to close her eyes. Accidentally 
           smearing blood on her face. Whispers:

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry.

           Trembling, he pulls out his knife and... SLITS her jugular. 
           Blood gushes from throat. He cries, rocking Lulu in his arms.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING.

           Sarah gets out of bed, pads over to the coffee machine and 
           turns on the TV NEWS while she waits. Sees Lulu's VOICEMAIL.

                                 SARAH
                        Finally, she appears.

           She hits play. The first thing she hears is COUNTRY MUSIC.
                                 LULU (O.S.)
                        Pick up your fucking phone, Sarah. 
                        I know you're in town. 

           The music stops.

                                 LULU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I've been kidnapped!

           A truck door opens and closes.

                                 LULU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm not joking. I'm in the middle 
                        of the fucking des-

           A SCREAM! Lulu's body SCRAPES against the truck bed.

                                 LULU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Seriously? You?

           THUD! Lulu's body hits the dirt. She hears the sound of 
           someone breathing, then the message ends.

           Sarah whips around. Shocked. Her confusion amplified when she 
           registers LULU'S FACE on the TV. 

           ON THE SCREEN: A REPORTER addresses the camera.

                                 LOCAL REPORTER
                        The 21-year-old was something of a 
                        local celebrity, thanks to her true 
                        crime podcast investigating the 
                        murder of Salton City resident Mary 
                        Hernandez earlier this summer.

           Sarah grabs the TRASH CAN and VOMITS atop the empty NIPS. 

           EXT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY.

           Sarah's car SCREAMS into the parking lot. An UNSEEN FIGURE 
           watching from a window as she runs inside.

                                 SARAH (PRE-LAP, V.O.)
                        You think I care about protocol? I 
                        need to talk to him. Now.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, LOBBY - DAY.

           Sarah glares at a no-nonsense secretary, ROSIE (70s).
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        M'am. I'm gonna need you to lower 
                        your voice.

                                 SARAH
                        Do I look like a m'am to you?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        You really want me to answer that?

           MITCH HAYES strides in. A giant, hulking, powerful man. 

                                 MITCH
                        Everything alright out here? 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Deputy Hayes. This woman is asking 
                        for you. Quite rudely, I might add.

                                 MITCH
                        Sarah. I thought you might come.

           That Mitch knows who she is only furthers Sarah's suspicions.

                                 MITCH (CONT'D)
                        Why don't we talk in private?

           Sarah hesitates... Then lets Mitch put a hand on her shoulder 
           and usher her from the room. Resenting his touch.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Mitch hands Sarah a cup of water. She takes a grateful sip as 
           he sits opposite her. He has bags under his eyes-- a wreck.

                                 MITCH
                        So she told you about us. She was 
                        good at many things, Lulu. But not 
                        secrets.

           He smiles, as if recalling a fond memory.

                                 SARAH
                        I think she knew her killer. Her 
                        message said, Seriously? You? 

           Mitch takes Sarah's hands. Muscles rippling in his forearms.

                                 MITCH
                        I promise you we're gonna find 
                        whoever did this. But you have to 
                        know it wasn't me. I loved Lulu.
           She retracts her hands, but her conviction starts to waiver.

                                 SARAH
                        If you loved her so much, why not 
                        tell people you were together?

                                 MITCH
                        The Sheriff won't let us date 
                        reporters, although I'm not really 
                        sure you could call Lulu that. More 
                        like a wannabe shock jockey if you 
                        ask me... Either way, I could have 
                        been fired. Still might if people 
                        find out I was helping her.

                                 SARAH
                        Won't it look worse if you hide it?

                                 MITCH
                        Maybe. 

           She looks at a mounted CAMERA. Its light dark. Not recording.

                                 SARAH
                        So what? What do we do?

                                 MITCH
                        You stay quiet. Let me do my job.

                                 SARAH
                        Mitch. We're talking about a serial 
                        killer. We need to tell them every-

                                 MITCH
                        -Whoa. No one said anything about a 
                        serial killer.

                                 SARAH
                        How can you possibly still believe 
                        these cases aren't related?

                                 MITCH
                        Lulu's death has nothing to do with 
                        Mary Hernandez or Lisa Anderson. 
                        For starters, she was at least 10 
                        years younger. And she never 
                        reported any hangup calls. And she 
                        was killed in the desert, not her 
                        house. Serial killer's don't just 
                        change their M.O. like that... No. 
                        The only thing these women have in 
                        common is that they're from here.
                                 SARAH
                        And that Lulu's throat was slit. 
                        Just like Mary's.  

                                 MITCH
                            (pained, soft)
                        Actually, we have reason to believe 
                        Lulu died of a blunt force trauma 
                        to the head. The knife wound seems 
                        to have happened when she was dead.

           Sarah turns green. Internalizing this piece of information.

                                 SARAH
                        You think it's a coincidence that 
                        three women have been attacked over 
                        the course of one summer? That Lulu 
                        dies one day after publicly 
                        connecting Mary and Lisa?

                                 MITCH
                        If it was the same guy, which I'm 
                        not saying it is, Lulu's got no one 
                        to blame but herself.
                            (beat, under Sarah's 
                            glare)
                        Oh, come on. You knew the girl. 
                        It's not like she did that podcast 
                        out of the goodness of her heart. 
                        She wanted attention... I told her 
                        not to run her mouth like that. But 
                        she never was a good listener.

                                 SARAH
                        How could you, Mitch? She's dead!

           Mitch stares, then... SCRAPE! He pushes back his chair.

                                 MITCH
                        You know what? I think we're done 
                        here.

                                 SARAH
                        But we still haven't gotten to-

                                 MITCH
                        -You should be careful, Sarah. 
                        Wouldn't want the same thing to 
                        happen to you, now, would we?

           Is he staring at her neck? Her hand flies to her clavicle. 
           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah runs into her car and locks the doors. She makes sure 
           Mitch hasn't followed her and calls Christine. We INTER CUT:

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        Thank God. I just opened my 
                        computer and saw there was another-

                                 SARAH
                        -What if this isn't just a case of 
                        inept cops? What if the killer is a 
                        cop?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        That would be very interesting. 
                        Really amplifies our angle.

                                 SARAH
                        Whoever did this clearly knows what 
                        they're doing. How else do you 
                        explain the lack of DNA at the 
                        crime scenes? The lack of evidence? 
                        And who better to commit the 
                        perfect murder than a cop?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It wouldn't be the first time. 
                        There was the Golden State Killer, 
                        Gerard John Schaefer... You have 
                        someone in mind?

                                 SARAH
                        A deputy sheriff named Mitch Hayes.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        And you have proof?

                                 SARAH
                        ... No. Not yet.

                                 CHRISTINE
                            (a dramatic sigh, then)
                        Sarah, we've been over this. It's-

                                 SARAH
                        -I can't let him kill again. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You're the one who scolded me about 
                        accusing people without proof.
                                 SARAH
                        Forget what I said! This is bigger 
                        than ethics.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Well, Sarah. I have to say. I like 
                        this side of you. You were always 
                        such a rule follower. It was a 
                        little annoying, really... Listen. 
                        I'll talk to the lawyers. See where 
                        we stand with libel laws. 

           Sarah's beatific smile denotes satisfaction.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

           Sarah paces. Checks the fridge, but it hasn't been restocked. 
           Not that kind of place. Gets her purse. Gun is inside. Exits.

           EXT. BOB'S BAR - NIGHT.

           Sarah passes a fleet of PICK UP TRUCKS en route to the DOOR. 
           Recalling Caitlin's words, she notes the NEON WILD TURKEY 
           SIGN. She enters the bar, failing to notice the MALE FIGURE 
           following her from afar. Walking too slowly to catch up.

           INT. BOB'S BAR - CONTINUOUS.

           This dive is dirty and more than a little run down. A JUKEBOX 
           plays CLASSIC ROCK. The tables are PACKED. Their wood tops 
           STICKY and SCRATCHED.  

           The Salton City PATRONS stare at Sarah. She rolls back her 
           shoulders. Stands tall as she approaches the bar. Wondering 
           if these people know who she is and why she's there.

           She finds the owner, WOODY (50s), drying glasses with a rag 
           that's even dirtier than the cups are. He looks up and double 
           takes Sarah, as if surprised. Watches her select a stool. 

                                 WOODY
                        Can I get ya something?

                                 SARAH
                        Tequila soda. You have Casamigos?

           Woody stares.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        ... Don Julio?
                                 WOODY
                        I can put some Jose in a fancy cup?

                                 SARAH
                        Ok. Fine.
                            (then, sotto)
                        Desperate times.

           She SLAPS a TEN DOLLAR BILL onto the bar. Woody pockets it 
           and goes to fix her drink. Keeps his eyes on her. Suddenly:

                                 PATRON (O.S.)
                        Mitch! Hey! How is it out there?

                                 MITCH (O.S.)
                        Oh, you know. We're all just doing 
                        our best.

           She swivels on her stool. Watches Mitch tip his hat to a MAN 
           who is disappointed when the deputy doesn't come over to him.

                                 SARAH
                            (sotto)
                        You've got to be kidding me.

           Mitch approaches the bar. Sits on the stool next to her. 
           Woody walks over without finishing Sarah's drink.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey, Woody. How ya doing?

                                 BOB
                        Better than you, I'd guess. You 
                        must need a drink.

                                 MITCH
                        A beer would be great.

                                 BOB
                        You sure you don't want something 
                        stronger?

                                 MITCH
                        No, thanks. Whatever's on tap.

           Woody nods, glares at Sarah and walks off. She stares 
           straight ahead, avoiding Mitch's eyes as she mutters:

                                 SARAH
                        I thought someone was following me. 
                        Didn't know it was you.

                                 MITCH
                        Why would I be following you?
                                 SARAH
                        Because I know.

                                 MITCH
                        Know what?

                                 SARAH
                            (louder, staring)
                        That you killed those women.

           People are starting to look. Mitch clenches his fist.

                                 MITCH
                        You know what, Sarah Halsted? 
                        You're starting to piss me off.

                                 SARAH
                        Am I? Am I pissing you off?

           Woody interrupts. Putting her TEQUILA and MONEY on the bar.

                                 WOODY
                        Your money's no good here. Why 
                        don't you drink that and go? 

                                 SARAH
                        But-

                                 WOODY
                        -I said go.

           Woody holds Sarah's gaze like a scolding parents as she 
           chugs, wincing at the cheap booze, and slams down her glass. 
           Glancing back at the men as she heads out the door. Mitch 
           shrugs at Woody like, aren't women crazy?

           EXT. MITCH'S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING.

           Sarah stakes-out Mitch's RANCH HOME from a few houses down. 
           Ducks as he exits and gets into his TRUCK. Only once he's 
           turned the corner does she hurry to the FRONT DOOR. LOCKED.

                                 SARAH 
                        Shit.

           She sneaks around the side and into...

           THE BACKYARD.

           The DOOR is locked. She slides her fingers along the frame. 
           Checks under the mat. Has to jimmy it open with a BOBBY PIN.
           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Mitch's house is obsessively, immaculately clean and dark. 
           The curtains drawn. She turns on the lights and scans. Scoffs 
           at a PHOTO of Mitch grinning at his swearing-in ceremony. 

           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           His bedroom has more WORKOUT EQUIPMENT than personal effects. 
           A BIKE, a BENCH, a FUNCTIONAL TRAINER. He must be obsessed.

           Sarah rolls her eyes and opens a DRESSER DRAWER. Even Mitch's 
           BOXERS are neatly folded. She rifles through. Finds a THONG 
           hidden amongst his clothing. Studies the delicate red fabric. 

           INT./EXT. MITCH'S SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Mitch is two blocks away when he realizes he forgot his 
           phone. He checks his rearview. Pulls a U Turn. Headed back.

           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah's eyes catch on a TRASH CAN. She peers inside. Shocked 
           to discover... a BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE PHOTO of her at 
           the motel. So he has been following her...

           EXT. MITCH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Mitch parks in the driveway and gets out of the truck.

           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah hears a key SCRAPE in the front door. Shit! 

           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Mitch enters. Suspicious to find the lights on. 

           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sarah searches, frantic, for a place to hide.

           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           As he turns off the lights, he hears a NOISE. Heads into--
           THE BEDROOM.

           Mitch finds the room... EMPTY. 

           CUT TO: Sarah. Hiding behind the functional trainer. 

           Mitch spots his phone under the bed. Reaches for it when...

           Sarah accidentally bumps the machine. Making a small CLANG.

           He whips around. Hand on his gun as steps forward.

           Sarah covers her mouth. Tries to quiet her breath.

           Mitch steps closer. And closer. About to reach Sarah when...

           His RADIO chirps. Much to his chagrin.

                                 SHERIFF (O.S.)
                        Hayes. Where are ya?

                                 MITCH
                        Forgot my phone. Had to turn back.

                                 SHERIFF (O.S.)
                        Did you bring the Sliter file home? 
                        I need a phone number.

                                 MITCH
                        Now? 

                                 SHERIFF (O.S.)
                        Now.

                                 MITCH
                        Ok. Let me get it.

           Mitch glances at the machine. Exits. Leaves the door open.

           Once alone, Sarah RUNS to the window and opens it. But 
           there's a SCREEN! She punches, but it doesn't give.

           She glances over her shoulder, worried Mitch will return at 
           any moment. She can hear him talking in the other room.

           Her fingers comb the window. Looking for a way to release the 
           screen. Finally, she finds the PLUNGER PINS and pulls. The 
           mesh gives way. 

           She hoists herself up and out the first floor window...
           EXT. MITCH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah falls to the grass. Her clothes covered in dust and 
           dirt. She runs to her car. Seemingly unnoticed.

           INT. MITCH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Mitch finds a MANILA FILE on his counter. INTO THE RADIO:

                                 MITCH
                        Ok. Got it. 760-654-1862.

           He approaches a picture window and watches Sarah SPEED off. 
           Unsurprised. Like he knew she was there the whole time. 

           INT./EXT. SARAH'S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah speeds home with the SURVEILLANCE PHOTO on her 
           passenger seat. Always checking the REARVIEW MIRROR.

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - DUSK.

           Sarah leaps out of her car. Halfway up the front path when...

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sarah, right?

           Caught off guard, it takes Sarah a moment to place... Cindy.

                                 SARAH
                        Sorry, this really isn't a good-

                                 CINDY
                        -I know it's Fall, but this block 
                        has a rule about burning leaves.

                                 SARAH
                        I'm sorry... What? I haven't even-

                                 CINDY
                        -Liv has been choking on smoke all 
                        morning. She could develop asthma!

                                 SARAH
                        I don't think that's how it works. 

           Realizing, she turns to her house. Stares at it with dread.

                                 CINDY
                        Hello? 
                                 SARAH
                        I-I'm so sorry. I have to go.

           Sarah runs to the door. Leaving Cindy on her lawn.

                                 CINDY
                        I'm talking to you!!!

           She takes a deep breath and slides her key into the lock.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           The door creaks open. Sarah enters. But the house is 
           COMPLETELY NORMAL. Everything in its right place. She sniffs 
           the air, and she does smell smoke. Follows the scent into...

           THE BACKYARD.

           SMOKE rises from a patch of SCORCHED GRASS. Sarah approaches, 
           tentative, and combs through the embers with her foot. What 
           was burned? Dozens of pairs of Sarah's own UNDERWEAR. COTTON 
           PANTIES, LINGERIE-- all different kinds. Sarah turns and...

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           ... Runs inside. Locks the door. Backs away while facing it. 
           Suddenly, the LANDLINE RINGS. She hesitates before answering.

                                 SARAH
                        H-hello? Halsted residence.

           A beat... then HEAVY BREATHING. Sarah drops the phone. 
           Staring at it while she uses her cell to dial 911. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Hi. I'm calling from 529 East Fifth 
                        Street. We have an emergency.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT.

           The FLASHING LIGHTS of SQUAD CARS draw Sarah's neighbors to 
           her lawn. Including the MOMS. Sarah sits. Wrapped in a 
           blanket. Talking to OFFICER KAPLAN (40s) as he takes notes 
           with a pad and paper.

                                 OFFICER KAPLAN 
                        And nothing seems to be missing?
                                 SARAH
                        I don't know. I called you as soon 
                        as I got home.

           She spots Cindy a few feet away. Talking animatedly to a COP. 

                                 OFFICER KAPLAN
                        Your husband. Where's he?

                                 SARAH
                        He's-we've been having some issues.

           Officer Kaplan nods, then flips his pad closed.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I'm telling you, there was someone 
                        here! Why would I torch my own 
                        underwear?

                                 OFFICER KAPLAN
                        These things happen in domestic 
                        disputes.

                                 SARAH
                            (then, an idea)
                        The hangup calls! You must be able 
                        to get those records.

                                 OFFICER KAPLAN
                        We can't investigate every time 
                        prank call... Why don't you get 
                        some rest? Call us tomorrow if 
                        you're still worried?

                                 SARAH
                        You're not even going to make a 
                        report?

                                 OFFICER KAPLAN
                        We don't usually-

                                 SARAH
                        -Please. It's the least you can do.

           He sighs. Exasperated. But reopens his pad.

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT.

           Sarah waits in the empty lobby. Tom rushes in. Runs to her.
           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT.

           Tom parks. Turns off the car. A beat as they sit in silence.

                                 TOM
                        Sarah-

                                 SARAH
                        -Don't.

                                 TOM
                        Things are getting out of control. 
                        I can't... I don't know how to help 
                        you anymore.

                                 SARAH
                        I don't need you to help me. I need 
                        you to believe me. 

                                 TOM
                        Believe what? That someone broke 
                        into our house just to burn your 
                        thongs? Why would anyone do that?

                                 SARAH
                        To scare me. Because I'm close.

           Tom grips the steering wheel until his knuckles go white.

                                 TOM
                        I told you this would happen. That 
                        you would bring back all kinds of 
                        bad memories.

                                 SARAH
                        You're not listening to me!!!

                                 TOM
                        I am listening to you, Sarah, but 
                        you sound crazy. 

           Sarah throws open the door.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Sarah, stop. Where are you going?

           She runs into the house. He doesn't go after her. Drives off.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The phone rings as Sarah enters. She glares at the LANDLINE, 
           then realizes it's her cell. We INTER CUT with Christine.
                                 SARAH
                        Thank God-

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        -Turn on your TV.

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        KTLA.

           Sarah wields the remote.

           ON THE SCREEN: An overly made up REPORTER broadcasts from in 
           front of the Salton City Sheriff's Department.

                                 REPORTER
                        -only wish we'd been able to catch 
                        the man before the attack of one 
                        woman and the death of two others.

                                 SARAH
                        What's going on? 

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        They caught him.

                                 SARAH
                        They caught Mitch???

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        Just watch.

                                 REPORTER
                        The Sheriff updated the press at a 
                        conference earlier this hour.

           THE TV CUTS TO: A PRERECORDED PRESS CONFERENCE. The SHERIFF 
           (50s) addresses REPORTERS from a podium. Mitch at his side. 
           But Sarah doesn't have time to listen.

                                 SARAH
                        I-I don't understand.

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        Turns out it was just a random 
                        drifter. Ugh. What a drag. The 
                        corrupt cop thing was good. Would 
                        have sold so many copies.

           ON TV: BODY CAM FOOTAGE of Mitch handcuffing a DRIFTER. Leads 
           him away from a CAR that's packed to the brim with STUFF.
                                 SARAH
                        They're wrong. It wasn't him.

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        Then why did he have trophies from 
                        all three women in the trunk of his 
                        car? A picture of Mary. Lisa's 
                        watch. Both of Lulu's phones.

                                 SARAH
                        I don't know. Mitch must have 
                        planted them! What are the chances 
                        he caught the killer less than 24 
                        hours after I accuse him?
                            (then, lighting up)
                        He had a photo of me in his house, 
                        Christine!

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You broke into his house? What the 
                        fuck, Sarah? I know how badly you 
                        wanted to solve this. But you're a 
                        journalist, not a prosecutor. 

                                 SARAH
                        So what do we do? 

                                 CHRISTINE 
                        I asked Alex to write something.

                                 SARAH
                        The food critic? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Listen. I shouldn't have encouraged 
                        you. Maybe it's too soon for you t-

           CLICK! Sarah hangs up and SCREAMS!

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, SARAH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah checks Lulu's Instagram, which has become a digital 
           MEMORIAL of sorts. But it's also BLOWING UP with news of the 
           Drifter's arrest. Sarah reads the comments on her last post.

           ON THE SCREEN:

           I miss you already.

           Hell ya!!! They got the fucker!

           Hopefully Newsom will do something about the homeless now.
           Sarah types her own comment. Jabbing at the phone. Muttering:

                                 SARAH
                        They have the wrong guy. And if the 
                        true killer uses this as an 
                        opportunity to get off scot-free... 
                        Well, then he’s a coward. A real 
                        murderer would strike again. 
                        Somewhere with actual police force.

           Replies pour in, but she's already put down her phone.

           ON THE SCREEN:

           LOL. Wut a psycho.

           Give it a rest. They caught the guy.

           Way to make yourself a target lady.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY.

           A wild-eyed Sarah bursts in, interrupting a SESSION. The 
           PATIENT is shocked... But not as shocked as Lauren.

                                 LAUREN
                        Sarah? 

                                 SARAH
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 LAUREN
                            (to her patient)
                        I'm sorry. It'll just be a minute.

           She follows Sarah through the door.

           INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Lauren folds arms across her chest. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Sarah Halsted. In the flesh.

           But Sarah is too manic to respond.

                                 LAUREN (CONT'D)
                        Are you ok? What's going on? 
                                 SARAH
                        I thought I knew how to get better. 
                        That I had a plan. But everything's 
                        spinning out of control. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Do you feel like you're a danger to 
                        yourself or others?

                                 SARAH
                            (adamant)
                        What? No. Nothing like that... It's 
                        just... I think I'm ready to start 
                        therapy again.

                                 LAUREN
                        In person?

                                 SARAH
                        In person.

           Lauren walks over to her COMPUTER. Checks her CALENDAR.

                                 LAUREN
                        Tomorrow at noon ok? 
                            (Sarah nods)
                        And you're sure you're ok in the 
                        meantime? Tom and Riley can help?

           She nods again. Lauren takes her at face value.

           EXT. TOM'S PARENTS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           SCREECH! Sarah pulls into the driveway. Charlie BARKS and 
           throws herself against a window. Claire races to open the 
           door before Sarah can knock. Displeased and concerned.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sarah. What are you doing here? Tom 
                        isn't-

                                 SARAH
                        -I want to see Riley.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Is that a good idea?

                                 SARAH
                        She's my daughter, Claire.

           Sarah tries push past, but Claire blocks her. Her voice 
           placating. Her body language strong.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Why don't you come back tonight, 
                        and we can all have a nice chat?

           Sarah SCREAMS. Lily appears at her mother's side. Both women 
           cross their arms and wait for Sarah to run back to her car. 
           Riley watching everything from an UPSTAIRS WINDOW.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah storms in. SLAMS the door and locks it. The landline 
           RINGS. She runs to answer. 

                                 SARAH
                        Leave me the fuck alone!

           Hears HEAVY BREATHING. Then, their voice MANIPULATED:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I'm gonna slit your throat.

           She THROWS the phone and sets her jaw with defiance. 

           MONTAGE:

           - Sarah walks through the house. She pulls every curtain and 
           locks every external door.

           - Sarah gets the GUN from her purse.

           - Sarah crawls into bed. Fully dressed. Gun in hand. She 
           stares at the door and sips tequila. Begins her stake-out. 

           End montage.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - HOURS LATER.

           Sarah is atop the comforter, staring at the door, when the 
           HOUSE ALARM goes off! It's time. She takes her gun and exits.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah approaches the front door, weapon extended. There's 
           MOVEMENT in the shadows. She points! Ready to shoot!

                                 SARAH
                        Don't move! Hands in the air!

                                 RILEY 
                        Mom?
           It takes Sarah a moment to realize it's... Riley and Charlie. 
           Charlie whimpers and runs to lick her.

                                 SARAH
                        Riley? What are you doing here?
                        Where's your dad? 

           She peers over her daughter's head. Out the window.

                                 RILEY
                        I used his phone to call an Uber.

                                 SARAH
                        He let you do that???

                                 RILEY
                        He was asleep. 

                                 SARAH
                        You can't be here, Riley. I have to 
                        take you back right n-

           She steps toward the front door, then remembers she's drunk.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                            (sotto)
                        Fuck. 

                                 RILEY
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        Nothing... I have to call your dad.

           But Tom's phone goes to VOICEMAIL.

                                 ROBOTIC VOICE (V.O.)
                        You've reached 917.620.7296. Please 
                        leave a message after the tone.

           BEEP! Sarah rushes to get out:

                                 SARAH
                        Tom. Call me as soon as you get 
                        this. Riley's here. At the house.

           Riley watches her mother's panicked behavior.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, RILEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sarah ensures all the windows are LOCKED before kissing 
           Riley's forehead. Charlie asleep at the foot of the bed.
                                 SARAH
                        I'll be right in the other room if 
                        you need anything, ok?

           Riley nods. Sarah heads for the door...

                                 RILEY
                        Wait! Take Charlie!

                                 SARAH
                        She's sleeping.

                                 RILEY
                        Please? 

                                 SARAH
                            (after a sigh)
                        C'mon, girl. Let's go.

           Charlie LEAPS UP on command. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I love you, Baby Bear.

                                 RILEY
                        You too, Mama Bear.

           Sarah turns out the light and exits. Charlie in tow.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah slides to the ground. Gun in hand. Together, she and 
           Charlie guard Riley's door. Pats the dog's head.

                                 SARAH
                        What now, girl? I guess we sleep 
                        here.

           A beat before Charlie hears SOMETHING and BOLTS downstairs.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Charlie! Stop! Where are you going?

           Sarah runs after the dog.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Charlie's tail disappears through the DOG DOOR.

                                 SARAH
                        Charlie! No!
           She unlocks the KITCHEN DOOR and runs outside. 

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS.

           Sarah brandishes the gun wildly. Scanning the shadows for the 
           dog. The PATIO FURNITURE and SHED looming in the darkness.

                                 SARAH
                        Charlie! Come here, girl! Charlie!

           But the dog doesn't appear. Sarah's eyes land on that HOLE in 
           the fence. Just big enough for Charlie to squeeze through. 
           The dog, her ally, is gone. And it's devastating.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Charlie, no.

           She hears a sound. Maybe a twig's SNAP under someone's foot. 
           Panics and goes back inside with one last look for Charlie.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sarah crawls onto the bed, tearing, and resumes her stakeout. 
           The open door providing a clear view of Riley's room.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT.

           Sarah hears someone enter. Turns on the lamp.

           It's the Intruder! 

           They peel off their gloves and mask. Revealed to be...

           Woody. The bartender from Salton City. 

           Sarah's face floods with, of all things, relief.

                                 SARAH
                        Thank God.

                                 WOODY
                        Were you expecting someone else?
                            (then, realizing)
                        Are you seriously still on this 
                        Mitch thing?
                                 SARAH
                        That asshole killed Lulu... Not 
                        that there weren't moments I wanted 
                        to kill her myself.

                                 WOODY
                        What are you talking about? Why 
                        would Mitch kill Lulu?

                                 SARAH
                            (realizing)
                        You didn't...

           Woody looks down. Flushed with guilt. Then turns defensive.

                                 WOODY
                        What else was I supposed to do? She 
                        showed up at the bar. Telling 
                        everyone it was you. I don't 
                        remember anything about that in 
                        your plan.

           INT. BOB'S BAR - FLASHBACK.

           Lulu rants, drunk, to a GIRL FRIEND-- the one from her last 
           Instagram post. Woody pretends to read a newspaper but is 
           actually eavesdropping from behind the bar. A slow night.

                                 LULU
                        At first, I thought she was this 
                        brilliant reporter. But then I was 
                        like, No! She's just a bored 
                        Pasadena mom. It was weird.

                                 LULU'S FRIEND
                        Do you think she had something to 
                        do with it?

                                 LULU
                        Honestly, kind of. I'm gonna have 
                        Mitch look into her.

                                 LULU'S FRIEND
                        I still can't believe you two are 
                        dating. And that he gave you a 
                        secret phone. It's so big city.

                                 LULU
                        I know, right?

                                 SARAH
                        So you killed her? Without talking 
                        to me?

                                 WOODY
                        You told me not to break character 
                        on the phone. Not to risk the 
                        phone's being tapped.

                                 SARAH
                        Did you at least get her binder?

                                 WOODY
                        ... What binder?

                                 SARAH
                        The binder of Lulu's evidence?

                                 WOODY
                        I got both her phones?

                                 SARAH
                        Let me get this straight. First, 
                        you bitch out on killing Lisa. Then 
                        you finally get the balls to kill 
                        Mary, only to panic and leave her 
                        ring. And don't even get me started 
                        on the way you tucked her in after 
                        like some kind of nanny of death.

                                 WOODY
                            (sotto, sad)
                        She deserved something from us.

                                 SARAH
                        Says the guy who just murdered the 
                        most famous person in Salton City 
                        and left behind a binder full of 
                        evidence in her apartment.

                                 WOODY
                        You should have told me about the 
                        binder if it was so important!

                                 SARAH
                        Seriously? You're criticizing me?

           Woody clenches his fists, then regains composure.

                                 WOODY
                        Enough chitchat, Sarah. Where's my 
                        hundred grand?
                                 SARAH
                        I guess you didn't get my note.

                        Oh, I got it. I just thought it was 
                        insane to change fall guys. 
                        Especially to a deputy sheriff.

                                 SARAH
                        Well, I really wish you'd told me 
                        that before I broke into his house.

                        How am I going to explain this to 
                        the cops if he was never in my 
                        house? But that's not even close to 
                        our biggest problem.

           Woody's anger turns to... We're not sure. But he's quiet.

                                 WOODY 
                        ... I know.

           Woody sits in his pick-up truck. Watching the DRIFTER sleep 
           in his car. He makes a call on a BURNER PHONE.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        911. What's your emergency?

                                 WOODY
                        Ya. There's a guy acting strange 
                        outside the Von's on First. Looks 
                        like he's living in his car.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ok. We'll send someone over. Can I 
                        get your name?
                            (beat)
                        Hello? Sir?

           Woody hangs up and drives off.

                                 SARAH
                        How am I supposed to get attacked 
                        if the killer's already in custody?

                                 WOODY
                        I've been thinking... Maybe he was 
                        working with someone? Maybe he 
                        attacked you before he got 
                        arrested? But you were unconscious 
                        and couldn't call for help?

                                 SARAH
                        None of that works.

                                 WOODY
                            (exasperated)
                        I dunno, Sarah. Maybe we let the 
                        whole thing go. You got your story.

                                 SARAH
                        Or... Maybe I turn you in? 

                                 BOB
                        I'd just tell everyone it was you.

                                 SARAH
                        And you think they'll believe that?
                                 WOODY
                        They will when they get this.

           Woody holds up a TAPE RECORDER. That's been recording this 
           entire time.

                                 SARAH
                        You piece of shit.

                                 WOODY
                        I guess I got tired of trusting 
                        you.

                                 RILEY (O.S.)
                        Mom? What's going on?

           Both Woody and Sarah clock Riley, standing in the doorway, at 
           the same moment.

                                 WOODY
                        Hey. You said you'd be alone!

           Sarah's demeanor changes from ANGER to FEAR. She reaches for 
           her gun. Speaking to Woody in a calm, soothing voice.

                                 SARAH
                        Woody. I need you to listen to me. 
                        My daughter showed up at the last 
                        second. She has nothing to do with-

                                 WOODY 
                            (looking around wildly)
                        -Your husband. Is he here too? What 
                        about the fucking Pope?

                                 SARAH
                        She's just a kid, Woody. She 
                        doesn't understand.

           Woody stares at Riley. Deciding what to do. Everyone still.

                                 WOODY
                        I wish I could go back to the night 
                        we met. I'd do it all so different.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. BOB'S BAR - FLASHBACK.

           Woody wipes down the bar after hours. Sarah enters.

                                 WOODY
                        Sorry. We're closed.
                                 SARAH
                        Aw. Come on. Help a girl out.

           A beat, then Woody waves her in. Sarah selects a stool.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I'll take a Tequila soda, please. 
                        Whatever you've got.

           Woody nods and starts to make her drink.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Are you Bob?

                                 WOODY
                        Nah. Bob was my dad.

           Sarah looks around. Sees a PHOTO of Woody, smiling and happy, 
           with his FATHER from the 1950s. From the bar's heyday.

                                 SARAH
                        Well, it looks like your dad's bar 
                        is the only gig left in town.

                                 WOODY
                        And I don't even know how much 
                        longer that will be true.

           Sarah accepts her drink. Woody leans on the bar. Assuming 
           they're about to flirt. And pretty psyched about it. 

                                 SARAH
                        Oh no. Money problems?

                                 WOODY
                        More than problems.

                                 SARAH
                        Well... Maybe I can help.

                                 WOODY
                            (unaware she's serious)
                        How's a pretty thing like you 
                        supposed to help? By attracting 
                        male customers?

           Sarah smiles beatifically.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh my God. Enough with the Daddy 
                        issues. It doesn't change the fact 
                        that you're a murderer.

                                 WOODY
                        I trusted you. But all you ever 
                        cared about was your story. And now 
                        you're sitting here, hands clean... 
                        It ain't right. So I'm thinking, 
                        maybe you need some skin in the 
                        game.

           Suddenly, Woody lunges forward. Grabs Riley.

                                 RILEY
                        Mom!

           He holds the knife to Riley's throat.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Don't you dare hurt her!

                                 WOODY
                        Or what? What are you gonna do?

                                 SARAH
                        Or I'll shoot you!

           She POINTS the gun at Woody and COCKS. 

                                 WOODY
                        Well? Go ahead. What are you 
                        waiting for?

           A beat... Then Sarah's hand falls to her side.

                                 WOODY (CONT'D)
                        That's what I thought. All bark. No 
                        bite. Otherwise, you wouldn't need 
                        me to do your dirty work.

           Riley's skin bulges on either side of the blade.

                                 SARAH
                        What do you want? I'll do anything.

                                 WOODY
                        What I want is to know why? You 
                        told me what, but never why. I 
                        should have asked then, but I'm 
                        asking now.

                        Were you so bored with your own 
                        life that it was worth risking 
                        everything? Risking your family?

                                 SARAH
                        It wasn't about that.

                                 WOODY
                        Then what?

           Sarah stares back.

                                  WOODY (CONT'D)
                        That's what I thought.

           Riley whimpers. Her neck slightly bleeding from the pressure 
           of the blade on her skin. Sarah debates what to do...

                        Well, Sarah. I think it's time we-

           Suddenly, she hurls herself across the room and tackles 
           Woody. His knife sliding away as they tumble to the floor and 
           writhe. A heap of panicked limbs. The two roll over. Woody on 
           top. Holding her down. He wraps his hands around her throat 
           and starts to STRANGLE her.

                                 RILEY
                        Mom!

                                 WOODY
                        Don't worry, kid. You're better off 
                        without her.

           Sarah fights... GASPING for air... Then closes her eyes.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - FLASHBACK.

           Gagged and bound, Sarah gets raped. It's a familiar scene. 
           But this time we see... Riley watching in the hallway. She 
           does nothing to help Sarah. Hence Riley's concern. Her guilt.

           Note: Sarah doesn't notice her daughter.

           End flashback.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY.

           Riley throws herself onto Woody's ankle. Bites down on his 
           flesh. He cries out and kicks. Riley flies into the dresser.
           Sarah's face turns purple as he tightens his grip. Her eyes 
           BULGE out of her head. Veins about to burst.

           Suddenly, a few drops of BLOOD fall onto her face. She looks 
           up and sees the BLADE sticking out of Woody's shoulder.

           Woody has just enough time to register confusion before he 
           releases his grip to pulls the knife from his flesh. Blood 
           pours from the wound. To Riley:

                                 WOODY
                        Why'd you have to do that?

           Woody grows pale, then slouches. Unconscious. Atop Sarah.

           Riley runs over as Sarah crawls out from under Woody and rubs 
           her neck. 

                                 RILEY
                        Mom. I didn't know what to do.

           Sarah tries to talk, but her throat is raw. She wraps an arm 
           around her daughter. They embrace, failing to notice...

           Woody's eyes open. He comes to. He crawls toward them with 
           knife in hand. Almost reached them when...

                                 RILEY (CONT'D)
                        Mom! Watch out!

           Woody grabs Riley's ankle. She falls. He pulls her body 
           toward him. Her fingernails clawing at the hardwood.

           Sarah watches. Panicked. Momentarily frozen. Then scans the 
           room. She sees a LAMP. Grabs it and rips the cord out of the 
           wall, plunging them into darkness. We watch in the moonlight 
           as she BLUDGEONS Woody. Over. And over. At first, he fights 
           back. Arms wailing. Trying to cover himself. Then he goes 
           still. Dead.

           The Halsted women stare down at his corpse. Its skull smashed 
           in. So much blood that it's no longer red, but deep purple.

           Sarah puts her hand on her daughter's shoulders, forcing 
           Riley to look away from Woody's body. She kneels and looks 
           into her daughter's eyes.

                                 SARAH
                        Riley. Go call the police.

           Riley nods and runs out of the room.

                                                           CUT TO:
           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT.

           SQUAD CARS and AMBULANCES flash. PARAMEDICS treat Sarah and 
           Riley with oxygen. POLICE swarm the property. The local moms, 
           including Cindy, have gathered to rubberneck on the lawn.

           For the first time... Cindy smiles at Sarah. Sarah stares, 
           then smiles back. A truce.

           Tom's Audi SQUEALS to the curb. He throws open the door and 
           runs to his family. Practically rabid with worry.

                                 TOM
                        Thank God!

           He envelops Riley in a hug. Then, after a beat, Sarah too. He 
           kisses her head and speaks into her hair:

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

           Tom pulls back and looks around.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Charlie?

                                 SARAH
                        She went through that hole in the 
                        fence. I-I'm so-

                                 TOM 
                        -Don't worry about that right now. 
                        I should have fixed it.

           Sarah studies her husband's face, then nods in agreement. 
           Officer Kaplan appears as they kiss.

                                 OFFICER KAPLAN
                        Well, you were right. I called the 
                        Sheriff in Salton City. It all 
                        matches up. They're on their way 
                        here now. In the meantime, we'll 
                        need you all to come down to the 
                        station. Make a statement.

           Tom pulls his girls close.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

           SUPER: THREE DAYS LATER.
           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING.

           Sarah wakes up. Stretches. Enjoys the sunlight streaming in 
           through the window. The most relaxed we've ever seen her.

           She gets her phone on the nightstand. Opens Instagram. Notes, 
           smiling, that she's gained THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS overnight.

           She checks The Daily Inquirer website for her latest article. 
           This time, she's on the homepage. With a photo.

           ON THE SCREEN:

           SARAH HALSTED: HOW I CAUGHT AND KILLED A SERIAL KILLER.

           She clicks on the article and scrolls straight to the bottom. 
           Reads its many, many comments.

           What a fucking beast.

           I love this woman.

           Can someone please make this a movie?

           A TEXT arrives from Christine.

           ON THE SCREEN:

           Have you thought about my job offer? You could work remotely.

           Sarah doesn't respond. Deletes their entire conversation. 
           She's graduated past Christine and the tabloid now.

           Tom enters with a cup of tea. Sarah puts her phone away and 
           accepts the mug. Tom watches her take a sip. 

                                 SARAH
                        Ok, stalker.

                                 TOM
                        Sorry. It's just... I feel awful. I 
                        should have believed you.

                                 SARAH
                        It's ok. Really.

                                 TOM
                        It's not just about the other 
                        night. Ever since last year... 
                        Since your rape... I haven't known 
                        how to act around you.
                                 SARAH
                            (a hand atop his)
                        It's ok. You don't have to-

                                 TOM
                        -Please. I need to stay this.

           Sarah nods. Waits for him to get the words out.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I felt so helpless, so emasculated, 
                        that I withdrew. From you. From our 
                        marriage. I'm so sorry, Sarah... 
                        Can you ever forgive me?

           She considers his face, then nods. They kiss.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sarah pads downstairs in sweatpants. She sees Tom in the 
           kitchen and sneaks past him. Headed for the front door. 

           EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           The porch is covered with FLOWERS and FAN MAIL. A shrine to 
           Sarah's bravery. She's reaching toward a TEDDY BEAR when:

                                 REPORTER #1 (O.S.)
                        Oh my God! It's her! 

           Three REPORTERS have gathered on the lawn. They go APESHIT. 
           SARAH! SARAH! SARAH!

           Sarah pauses with her hand on the stuffed animal... Acting 
           bashful... Then stands. About to go back inside when... 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Can I ask a question?

           Sarah considers, then waves them over. They rush forward with 
           MICROPHONES extended. A PASSERBY on the sidewalk pulls out 
           their CAMERA PHONE and starts to record, although unsure 
           what's going on. 

           All three reporters ad lib questions, but Sarah can't make 
           out any one voice over the cacophony.

                                 SARAH
                        No questions, but I will make a 
                        brief statement. 
                            (then, with a sigh)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        There's no question this has been a 
                        dark week for our family. I thank 
                        God for giving me another chance at 
                        life. For giving me another chance 
                        with my family. I know I'm the 
                        story of the week, but the fact 
                        that this hasn't gotten national 
                        attention is the real issue. 
                        Because violence against women is 
                        still a second rate story in this 
                        country. And until that changes, 
                        there will be no progress. Thank 
                        you for your time.

           She smiles. Goes back inside as they clamor for more.

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNING.

           Sarah enters to find Tom cooking at the stove. Takes a seat.

                                 TOM
                        You didn't go out there, did you?

                                 SARAH
                        Is someone jealous they're not the 
                        only celeb in the family anymore?

                                 TOM
                        Yup. That's definitely it. Maybe I 
                        should go out there and toss a 
                        football around for them... Look! I 
                        finally learned how to scramble 
                        eggs!

                                 SARAH
                        That's great, honey.

           But she's distracted. Staring at the TV as it plays KTLA.

           ON THE SCREEN: A REPORTER addresses the camera.

                                 REPORTER
                        All anyone in LA wants to talk 
                        about these days is Sarah Halsted, 
                        the Pasadena mom who caught and 
                        killed an alleged serial killer in 
                        her home on Thursday evening. Later 
                        today, Mrs. Halsted will be joining 
                        us for an exclusive interview-

           Tom mutes the TV and puts a PLATE before of Sarah.
                                 TOM
                        No more TV until you eat something. 

           He kisses Sarah on the forehead, although she wants his lips, 
           and puts the pan in the sink. Starts to scrub. Sarah ignores 
           her food. Focused on the muted TV, which now shows a PHOTO 
           they must have gotten from her old Instagram feed.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Is something wrong? Are the eggs 
                        overcooked?

                                 SARAH
                        What? Oh. No. It's not that. I'm 
                        just not very hungry. Must be 
                        nerves about the interview. I might 
                        actually get some air if that's ok?

                                 TOM
                        Ok. Sure.

           But something about Sarah's behavior strikes Tom as odd. Even 
           as she pauses to kiss him with her hands on his chest.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh. I forgot to tell you. The bank 
                        called. The money should be 
                        released from escrow in a few days.

           Tom nods and watches Sarah exit the BACK DOOR.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: Tom watches Sarah enter the SHED, then 
           looks back at the TV, where the NEWS TICKER reads...

           EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH SARAH HALSTED TONIGHT AT 6 PM PST.

           He shakes his head, then resumes doing the dishes... Until he 
           hears Sarah SCREAM.

                                 SARAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Tom! Quick!

           He drops the PAN, which clatters in the sink, and runs.

           EXT. SARAH'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS.

           Both Tom and Riley burst out of the house to find... Sarah, 
           crouched in the grass with Charlie. The dog licking her face.

                                 SARAH
                        Look who I found!
           Riley runs to hug Charlie. But Tom hangs back. Aware Sarah 
           doesn't seem surprised. Riley sniffs and wrinkles her nose.

                                 RILEY
                        She stinks. Can we give her a bath?

                                 SARAH
                        Sure.
                            (playful, to Tom)
                        Want to help?

                                 TOM
                        Be there in a second.

           Sarah follows Riley and Charlie inside. Glancing back at Tom.

           Tom waits for the door to close, then sneaks into...

           INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS.

           Tom inhales the scent of earth. Everything seems normal. LAWN 
           FURNITURE. GARDENING SUPPLIES. He's about to leave when he 
           spots... a makeshift DOG BED of folded tarps in the corner. 

           As he walks toward it, his foot kicks a pill bottle. He picks 
           it up. SARAH'S CLOZAPINE. What are his wife's meds doing in 
           here?

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - FLASHBACK.

                                 TOM
                        Before I forget. Did we ever get 
                        that hundred grand?

                                 SARAH
                        I think the bank said Friday?

                                 TOM
                        Jesus. Escrow should have closed 
                        weeks ago. We could really use the

                        You do realize this makes you just 
                        like them. The criminals. Getting 
                        off on other people's misery.
           INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - FLASHBACK.

                                 TOM
                        Maybe Riley and I should stay with 
                        Mom for a while. Until things calm 
                        down.

                                 SARAH
                        Seriously? You're just gonna leave?

                                 TOM
                        I think it'd be best... For Riley. 

           Sarah opens her mouth, then decides not to object.

                                 SARAH
                        Ok. Fine. Maybe you're right.

           Although Tom suggested it, he was hoping she'd object.

           End flashback.

           INT. SHED - PRESENT DAY.

           Tom gets out his phone. Finger hovering over the number NINE.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?
           Tom turns around. Startled. Hadn't heard Sarah come in.

                                 TOM
                        I was just about to come help you.

           But he's figured it out, and Sarah knows it. She approaches 
           her husband like an animal she doesn't want to scare.

                                 SARAH
                        I had to do it, Tom. It was the 
                        only way. 

                                 TOM
                            (feigning ignorance)
                        Only way to do what?

                                 SARAH
                        Readers don't care about 
                        methodical, well-researched stories 
                        anymore. They don't care about 
                        facts. All anyone wants these days 
                        is entertainment. Michelle McNamara

                        Most editors won't even hire you 
                        unless you have thousands of 
                        followers.

                                 TOM
                        So that's what this is about? Fame?

                                 SARAH
                        No.

                                 TOM
                        Then what? I make enough money.

           She stares at her feet. Embarrassed to admit this next point.

                                 SARAH
                        I've seen how you look at me since 
                        I stopped working.

                                 TOM
                        I don't know what you're talking 
                        about.

                                 SARAH
                        Really? You don't think a little 
                        bit less of me? Staying at home all 
                        day to make sandwiches?

           He knows she's right. Tries to change topics. Regain control. 

                                 TOM
                        The hundred grand. Did you really 
                        think I wouldn't notice?

                                 SARAH
                        I was going to replace it with 
                        whatever I made.

                                 TOM
                        And if your plan didn't work?

                                 SARAH
                        Better Riley be raised by a mom in 
                        prison than a mom without agency.

                                 TOM
                        I don't understand how you can 
                        possibly think that justifies 
                        killing people. 

                                 SARAH
                        You wouldn't.
                                 TOM
                        -And you really think I'm going to 
                        let a murderer raise my daughter?

                                 SARAH
                        Technically, I didn't murder 
                        anyone. And you don't have to let 
                        me do anything ever again. 

           A beat as they stare at each other. Sarah's hand inching 
           toward a pair of GARDENING SHEERS on a shelf.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I don't want to hurt you, Tom.

           Tom turns to run out of the shed. But he trips and falls. 
           Splayed on the dirty floor, he reaches for his phone. Hand 
           stretching toward it when... Sarah KICKS the device away.

           Suddenly, Riley's shadowy figure fills the doorway. She 
           assesses the situation. The sheers in her mom's hand-- the 
           same ones she once had in her backpack.

           Tom watches Riley pick up the phone. Her tiny fingers closing 
           tight around the plastic.

                                 TOM
                        Riley. Give me the phone.

           Riley hesitates.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Riley, we have to call 911.

           Riley looks between her parents.

                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
