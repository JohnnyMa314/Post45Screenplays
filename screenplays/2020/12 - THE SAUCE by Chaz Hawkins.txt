           INT. 66’ CHEVELLE - NIGHT

           SUPER: “TWO MONTHS AGO”

           AL JENKINS (25), black, rides shotty with two other HOODLUMS 
           (20s) while sharing a doobie. Through the windows, one side 
           of the street looks rundown, and the other, opulent. Each 
           shop more unique than the last.

           The doobie burns down, and Al needs to ash it. He searches 
           the central compartment for something to tap the excess into.

                                 HOODLUM #1
                        Watch it, Al.

                                 AL
                        My bad, dog. You got an ashtray?

                                 HOODLUM #1
                        Check the glove compartment.

           As Al pulls the tray out, the ash from the doobie falls onto 
           Hoodlum #1’s WHITE NIKE AIR JORDAN FOUR RETROS. It leaves a 
           scuff. Hoodlum #1 SLAMS on the brakes.

                                 HOODLUM #1 (CONT’D)
                        Dude, what the fuck!

                                 AL
                        What?

                                 HOODLUM #1
                        You scuffed up my retros!

                                 AL
                        Shit, uh, my bad--I--I told you I 
                        needed an ashtray!

                                 HOODLUM #1
                        Bruh, you cappin’. Get out.

                                 HOODLUM #2
                        It’s not that serious--

                                 HOODLUM #1
                        Fuck you mean not that serious? 
                        Ain’t no scuffs on your retros. 
                        Shut yo ass up. Get gone bro.

           Al gets out. SLAMS the door shut.
           EXT. DOWNTOWN COOLCHITOWN - NIGHT

           The Chevelle skirts off with a SQUEAL.

           Al flips the bird as the car flees. He turns--

           A JUNKIE (60s), sunken eyes, seen some shit, pops into Al’s 
           face. Scratches incessantly.

                                 AL
                        Fuck off, Withers!

           The Junkie tweaks away. 

           Al shivers a bit. Checks his watch.

           1:27am.

           The streetlights BUZZ and FLICKER as he treks down the aged 
           side of the street. Passes shop after shop. 

           He stops as he passes UNCLE LEON’S BARBERSHOP. A chilling 
           rendition of the show tune “I’M BLACK” from the play Hair 
           slowly fades in with a fog. 

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           The song GROWS and GROWS. Lingers on the air. Al glances 
           across the street.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        The fuck was in that blunt?

           He crosses the street toward an...

           EXT. HAIR - NIGHT

           Al slowly follows the song to a massive white storefront. A 
           RED, WHITE, and BLUE neon sign lights up. “Hair,” and below 
           it, “Home of The Sauce, the World Famous Shampoo Line.”

           Al stares at the advert. The source of the show tune.

           The front door CREAKS open. BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT escapes.

           Al stops. Investigates it for a second.

           WHOOSH!

           A feathery arm yanks him inside.

           The door SLAMS shut as the white light quickly overtakes...
           INT. TV COMMERCIAL STAGE - DAY

           A white table with a single PURPLE bottle on it sits, alone, 
           in an open sterile room. 

           PRISCILLA BLACK (28), white, this woman could stare directly 
           into Medusa’s eyes and turn Medusa to stone, waltzes to that 
           table in an UNCLE SAM-esque outfit. Grabs the bottle.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Are you like me?

           She removes the hat. Reveals long, straight, blonde hair.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Tired of that same tame do? Good. 
                        At Hair, we’ve birthed the remedy 
                        for you, the Sauce. It’s patented 
                        formula can curl even the 
                        straightest of hair types. Visit a 
                        store near you to purchase your 
                        miracle bottle today!

           She presents the bottle, then squeezes a dollop in her hand. 

           Priscilla massages it into her hair. As she does so, she 
           reveals a shower head to her left. Turns it on. 

           A JINGLE plays as “The Sauce” pops onto the screen in 
           different BRIGHT NEON COLORS.

           SLOW-MO: She washes her hair. Caresses her wet clothes and 
           curves. Her hair says wash me, but her body screams fuck me.

           Simultaneously, THREE VIGNETTES crossfade around her.

           #1 - She rinses shampoo from the top of her head.

           #2 - Runs her fingers through the body of her hair sexually.

           #3 - As shampoo drips from her straight ends, they curl.

           REGULAR SPEED: Priscilla winks. Reveals new kinky curly hair.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        With the Sauce, you too can have 
                        the kinky curly hair you desire--

           CLICK! An after burn BUZZES as it fades away. We’ve been 
           watching a COMMERCIAL ON A RETRO TV.
           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - LEON’S HOUSE - DAY

           SUPER: “PRESENT DAY”

           In the TV’s reflection, JASON (22), black, a kid that could 
           have made it out the hood but gave up before he saw the 
           greener grass, retreats from the switch wrapped in a blanket.

           He slides past clutter and back into his magnet of a bed.

           A framed picture of THERESA WILLIAMS (40), black, with a 
           disapproving face and a SILVER METAL PICK in her hand, glares 
           at him from his nightstand next to a prescription bottle.

           The label reads “Williams, Jason TESTOSTERONE.”

           He SNORES atop a racy porno mag. Drool leaks from his mouth.

           Creep closer...closer...closer--

           WHOOSH!

           A deluge of water washes the mag away along with his sleep. 
           Jason snaps up like a meerkat. Wipes his face.

                                 JASON
                        The fuck, Leon!

                                 LEON (O.S.)
                        Where my clippers at, Specs?

                                 JASON
                        I don’t know, damn.

           Jason glares at his Uncle, LEON (45), black, a walking ball 
           of unresolved, and never-will-be-resolved, anger, with a mop 
           bucket. A crescent moon tuft of hair stretches ear to ear. 

           Leon scrutinizes Jason’s afro. He studies the pristine line 
           work that traces his otherwise unruly face.

                                 LEON
                        Best not be lyin’ to me.

                                 JASON
                        On my mama’s--

                                 LEON
                        Betta watch yo mouth, boy--

           Jason snatches a pillow. Slams it over his face. SPLAT.

           Leon gawks at the mag as water soaks through a picture of a 
           voluptuous, but scantily clad woman in a headmaster’s outfit.
                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Damn, they musta made her in a lab. 
                        She does it for you?

                                 JASON
                        Sometimes--Hold up--Would you--Read 
                        the room, Leon. Bounce. Fuck.

           Leon takes one last glance at Jason as he nestles into his 
           pillow. Leaves through the doorway. Tosses the bucket.

           Jason takes the pillow off. Peeks at Theresa’s picture as she 
           poses with folded arms, an eyebrow raised.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Fine, Mom. I’m getting up.

           Jason rolls up. Slides his wiry legs off the bed. You could 
           feed this cat for 30 cents a day. Imagine, Cinnamon from 
           those Apple Jacks commercials with an afro. 

           He snatches the pill bottle. Shakes it. Only one more left.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

           Jason pops the last pill, rises, saunters to the doorway.

           He grabs a red marker. Scratches an “x” on the calendar hung 
           by his doorway. Covers the words “PAYDAY!” in the square. 

           Jason opens a small drawer revealing LEON’S MISSING CLIPPERS 
           and smiles. Cheerful for a stolen moment.

           INT. LEON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jason drags a towel across the worn carpeted hallway of the 
           meek single-story home while Leon scours the house for his 
           “missing” clippers.

           INT. BATHROOM - LEON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Steam hazes the white-tiled bathroom, two sets of brushes and 
           floss on the off-white, but clearly was once white, sink.

           In the shower, Jason SQUISHES globs of shampoo into his hand. 
           Massages his tall afro. The shampoo runs down his body.

           As he steps into the water to rinse off, Jason’s hands make 
           their way to his waist. He glances at his pathetic erection. 
           Gives a defeated shrug, then slowly masturbates. The saddest 
           yank ever seen, but he glances at the ceiling as the pleasure 
           takes over.

           A very faint KNOCK reverberates from the door. CREAKS open.

           A SHADOW looms in the shower curtain. Rummages for a moment.

           Jason’s more vigorous now. Got...To..Get. There.

           The Shadow raises an arm. Displays a knife-shaped object.

           Jason’s almost there when--

           SKRRRRTTTT!

           Leon rips the curtain open. Jason HOLLERS, jumps, slips on 
           shampoo, and falls on his ass.

                                 JASON
                        Boundaries!

                                 LEON
                        Stop stealin’ my stuff, boy!

                                 JASON
                        Get the fuck out!

           Jason sits up. SLAMS the curtain shut. 

           Leon GROANS, closes his eyes. Pinches the bridge of his nose. 
           He looks up. Wrestles with something in his eyes.

                                 LEON (O.S.)
                        Look, I’m--
                             (fuck apologizing)
                        If you spend your morning tryna 
                        jerk off and run late to my shop 
                        you won’t get paid--

           Jason hugs his legs hard. He hides his face in his knees.

                                 JASON
                        I got it.

                                 LEON
                        11am. No later.

                                 JASON
                        Just have my check ready. 

           Leon nods. Furrows his brow. Eases to the door. Leaves.

           After a moment, Jason rises as water runs down his face. 
           INT. KITCHEN - LEON’S HOUSE - DAY

           The grimy linoleum has seen better days. The frigidaire leaks 
           frigid air with a shut door, and the counters beg for Lysol. 

           Water streams from a faucet into a cast iron pot.

           Flames. An eye of the oven turns on high, then lowers.

           Spaghetti noodles spill into the pot.

           Jason, with a towel wrapped on his head, in boxers, leans on 
           the kitchen island. Munches on spaghetti. Smiles, but when 
           surveys the place. His smile drops.

           This is home. All 1200 claustrophobic square feet of it.

           Jason digs through the couch and snatches a remote. He 
           channel surfs. Unaffected.

           A SCREAM QUEEN HOLLERS bloody murder.

                                 JASON
                        Nope.

           A MALE VILLAIN on TV laughs maniacally.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Pass.

           The NEWS plays. A REPORTER (50s), white, drones on and on. 
           Below him, a banner scrolls on the screen that says, “African-
           American men still rumored missing. It’s been two months...”

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        Another Coolchitown business was 
                        burglarized last night. Miscreants 
                        made off with thousands of dollars.

           Jason turns the volume up.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Victims are now calling the crook 
                        the “White Flight Bandit” as they 
                        only target white-owned stores. The 
                        Sheriff had this to say in regards 
                        to the crime spree. 

           A recording plays on the screen next to the Reporter.

           On screen, SHERIFF YATES (45), white, the type of guy to have 
           a gun rack with a gun rack on it, addresses us from a podium 
           while he sweats PROFUSELY and chugs WATER from a gallon jug. 
           Hair runs from Yates’ scalp like criminals. He dabs at the 
           sweat with a handkerchief. Means well...most of the time.

                                 SHERRIFF YATES
                        Now, y’all ain’t got no reason to 
                        squawk at me this early in the 
                        morning. Yes, we are investigatin’, 
                        and, yes, we have leads. Comprende? 
                        Now, let me get a cup of joe, shit.  

                                 JASON
                        Coolchitown’s finest.

           Jason glances down. Barely notices the banner as--

           REEE! REEE! REEE!

           Jason whips his head to the clock.

           10:30am.

           He GROANS. Hops up.

           Dumps the mostly finished bowl of spaghetti in the sink, then 
           BURPS as he eases into his room and SLAMS the door.

           INT. UNCLE LEON’S BARBERSHOP - DAY

           The worn shop has soul...and cockroaches. Two barber chairs 
           line each side. A retro TV hangs on the wall.

           PERCY (27), black, kind-hearted but spacey, and HAROLD (35), 
           black, lieutenant smart-ass, sit in their barbering chairs 
           while Leon stands at his, faces them. Harold reads the paper.

           An iconic black culture flick like “FRIDAY” plays until--

           Static CRACKLES.

                                 LEON
                        Dammit, not again.

                                 HAROLD
                             (won’t be bothered)
                        You pay the feds?

                                 PERCY
                        ‘Course the old man did. Just needs 
                        a little...
                             (smacks the TV)
                        There. We. Go.

           The TV screen just quits.
                                 HAROLD
                        Days here might be short, but least 
                        you have a future in electrical.

           Harold and Leon laugh while Percy stews.

           CHRINNNGG!

           Jason slides inside. Snags an apron and broom off the wall.

                                 PERCY
                        CP time be damned. Pay up, Leon.

                                 JASON
                        Gonna lose all your money betting 
                        against me, Unc.

                                 LEON
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

           Leon gives each of them five bucks.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t spend it all in one place.

           Jason stuffs Apollonius Rhodius’ THE ARGONAUTICA into a large 
           bookcase full of other classics: Shakespeare’s OTHELLO, 
           Harriet Beecher Stowe’s UNCLE TOM’S CABIN, among many others. 

           Jason turns. The Barbers joke and mess with each other. A 
           family shop, but he’s on the outside. Just watching the show. 
           His eyes a quote emblazoned on the wall.

           “Suffer for a day; earn a lifetime of bliss. - Theresa W.”

           CHRINNNGG!

                                 SHERIFF YATES (O.S.)
                        You boys got time for a cut?

           Yates parades inside with his gallon jug of water in one 
           hand, and his silver TRIDENT-SHAPED belt buckle in the other.

           Leon fake-smiles as Yates PLOPS down in his chair. Combs his 
           caterpillar porn-stache. The other Barbers sit in silence. 

           Jason sweeps around the Barbers’ chairs. Avoids eye contact 
           with the Sheriff. In fact, everyone avoids Yates, but Leon.

                                 SHERIFF YATES (CONT’D)
                        Y’all catch Jayson Tatum’s triple 
                        double, yesterday? He must have 
                        gone to a prep school to have 
                        fundamentals like that. 
                                 LEON
                        You don’t have to do that.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Do what?

                                 PERCY
                        Talk.

           Yates glances at the busted TV. Dabs at sweat on his face.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        So business is good--

           Leon nicks Yates’ lip near the mustache.

                                 SHERIFF YATES (CONT’D)
                        Watch your clippers!

                                 LEON
                        It would be easier to cut your 
                        mustache if it didn’t move.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Let me take a sip.

           Yates chugs water from his jug. They all watch uncomfortably.

                                 PERCY
                        What’s with the jug of water?

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Healthy men need at least 120 
                        ounces a day. You thirsty? I can 
                        share. There may be backwash but--

                                 PERCY
                        Nah, I’ll just get a cup or a water 
                        bottle like a normal person.

           Leon goes back to work. Harold puts down his paper.

                                 HAROLD
                        Well then, y’all making any headway 
                        on the missing townies?

           Leon lets out a defeated sigh, then glares at Harold who puts 
           his hands in the air making a “don’t shoot,” gesture.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        That’s just a rumor. Got one of the 
                        little guys on that one. I’m on the 
                        “White Flight Bandit” case.
                                 HAROLD
                             (under his breath)
                        Of course you are...

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        We protect our family first ‘round 
                        here. Chase rumors second.

                                 LEON
                        Don’t mind him. Just let me finish 
                        up here.

           Jason peeks out the storefront window at the SHOPPERS (18+), 
           white, walking in and out of the shops across the street 
           dressed like hipsters. Beanies, flannels, jeans. 

           Queue in line down the sidewalk to “HAIR.” Everyone in line 
           has STRAIGHT HAIR, but customers exit with ONLY CURLY HAIR.

           MEDDY FREEMAN (22), black, the inner-city kid that surprises 
           everyone by getting into five ivy league schools, glares at 
           “Hair,” then peeks across the street at Leon’s. Sympathy.

           Jason does a double take, but, when he looks back, Meddy’s 
           gone. Just the sea of whiteness remains. Jason’s lost in it.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        You clearly have eyes on the 
                        streets. Know anything?
                             (waits for a response)
                        Hey...Hey, kid!

           Jason shakes free of his trance. Whips to Yates while 
           everyone stares at him. It’s tense. 

                                 SHERRIFF YATES
                        Well?

                                 JASON
                        No, sir. Thanks for your service.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Atta boy. Had me gettin’ a little 
                        itchy at the hip for a second.

           Yates hops up from his chair. Chugs water from his jug.

                                 SHERIFF YATES (CONT’D)
                        You know how to speak to authority. 
                        Won’t end up like yo mama, no way.

                                 LEON
                        That’ll be $25.
                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Be careful, now, Leon. These prices 
                        might drive even the most loyal 
                        customers out the door.

                                 LEON
                             (that’s the plan)
                        Wuldn’t think of it.

           Sheriff Yates whistles to an aged, racist tune such as the 
           “BULLY SONG” by May Irwin as he exits.

           The cash register pops out. Jason tenders the cash with a 
           SHFF...SHFF...

           LATER...

           SHFF...

           Jason puts the last of the cash away as Leon collects 
           everyone’s stash boxes, then Jason sweeps with a blank 
           expression. His mind is elsewhere. 

           Harold and Percy stop on their way out.

                                 PERCY
                        You good? Look like you seen a 
                        ghost.

                                 JASON
                        Um, yea--it’s just--I--

           Harold puts a hand on Jason’s shoulder as he glances across 
           the street again to where Meddy once stood.

                                 HAROLD
                        Don’t pay Yates no mind. Dude came 
                        out the womb bald and blabbering.

           Jason nods, then waves goodbye as Harold and Percy leave.

           TV STATIC SIZZLES throughout the shop. It GROWS with every 
           one of Jason’s broom strokes. Until--

           BANG!

           Jason drops like gunshots just rang out. He tracks the sound 
           to the back office. The door’s ajar.

           Through the crack, Leon counts the till at his worn desk. 
           It’s short...again. He lifts his fist. Reveals a new dent 
           among many others.

           Jason slips inside...
           INT. BACK OFFICE - UNCLE LEON’S BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

           A surprised Leon frantically wipes his face and forces a 
           smile. Jason awkwardly hovers by the door.

                                 JASON
                        You all right, Leon--

                                 LEON
                        Some doors ain’t s’posed to be 
                        opened, negro! 

           Jason nods uneasily as Leon counts bills.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Just another weak day. That shop 
                        across the street is stranglin’ 
                        us...I gotta let you go.

                                 JASON
                        But what about what you said to 
                        chrome dome and the petty bets--

                                 LEON
                        Regulars duckin’ me. You seen the 
                        shop. Dead as roadkill. It’s been--

           Leon shows his cellphone with a barbering app open. 

           THE SCREEN: The kind faces of BLACK MEN by boxes checked as 
           MISSED APPOINTMENTS. Al’s face shines amongst them. 

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Gotta suffer for a day...

           Jason surveys the dilapidated office. Wallpaper peels, 
           linoleum’s cracked, the writing is LITERALLY on the wall. He 
           lands on a large portrait of Theresa.

           On the frame, “In loving memory of Theresa Williams. A 
           mother, sister, and savvy businesswoman.” 

                                 JASON
                        This can’t be the bliss she was 
                        talking about, Leon.

                                 LEON
                        Bliss? When Theresa was around, it 
                        was like the whole hood got silent. 
                        No gangs, burglars, or kidnappings. 
                        That was bliss. Remember that?
                                 JASON
                        It’s hard for me to remember much 
                        from back then.
                             (pleads)
                        But, Leon, I need this job. I gotta 
                        get my pills!

           Leon BANGS on the desk. Turns back from that same picture. 

                                 LEON
                        No, you don’t! You know why I make 
                        that same bet every day? Because I 
                        pray that one day you just won’t 
                        show up no more. That way one of us 
                        will make it out of here. This shop 
                        died when she did. Nothing’s savin’ 
                        it, Specs. 

           Jason tenses a fist. A quiet rage.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Now, go on. You’re practically 
                        furniture around here, and the shop 
                        don’t need another bookcase.

           Jason turns in his apron. Gives Leon the broom. Stops in the 
           doorway. Admires the place one last time. Walks out.

           CHHRRINGGGG!

           The front door SLAMS. Leon sits. Exhales. That hurt. Glances 
           at Theresa’s picture.

           INT. DOWNTOWN COOLCHITOWN - NIGHT

           Darkness envelops the shops. A ghostly fog. Rain’s coming.

           Jason sits on a bench on the sidewalk. TAPS his foot. Waits. 
           He looks both ways. No cars. 

           A KETTLE OF VULTURES SQUAWKS angrily at him from their perch 
           above the shop.

           Jason eyes them, then takes out a cellphone. Texts “O.”

           The text reads, “Where u at, bruh?” Jason, then swipes 
           through photos in his phone.

           Lingers on one of Theresa in front of a CREAM colored HOOPTY 
           with TAN SEATS. 

           He grimaces, then shivers. Forces himself to look away. Both 
           anger and pain wear on his brow. He rises. Tries to light a--
                                 JUNKIE
                        Any change?

           Out of nowhere, the Junkie hovers over Jason’s shoulder. He 
           jumps and turns a 180. Ready to fight.

                                 JUNKIE (CONT’D)
                        Change?

                                 JASON
                        Dammit, Withers. Get outta here.

           As the Junkie walks off, the RED, WHITE, and BLUE neon sign 
           lights up at Hair. Jason raises an eyebrow. Recognition. 
           Peers back at Leon’s.

           The “Uncle” label on the storefront peels back and waves in 
           the wind. Underneath, a slightly off white “TH” endures.

           He surveys the beaten up, rustic, and damn-near-ready-for-
           demolition buildings. ORANGE “For Sale” and “Closed” signs 
           cover most of the storefronts. Poor people strewn about.

           Out of nowhere, a “NOW HIRING JANITOR” sign POPS on next to 
           the Sauce’s ad on Hair’s storefront featuring Pricilla. 

           Its BUZZ and color catches Jason’s attention.

           Jason smirks and rubs his hands together. A plan forms. He 
           checks both ways. Slips over. Shoppers gawk as he crosses. 

           EXT. HAIR - NIGHT

           Shoppers hip-check Jason as he struggles past them to the 
           door. On it, a box full of pens and papers hangs.

           INSERT - APPLICATION TO HAIR

           Just four questions. One for Jason’s FULL NAME. He writes it. 
           CELL PHONE NUMBER. Check. RACE. Black as fuck. HAIR TYPE. 

           BACK TO HAIR

           Jason scrutinizes the paper. Confused. Plays with his hair.

                                 JASON
                        Curly it is.

           Writes it down. 

           P.O.V. OF SOMEONE WATCHING JASON FROM BEHIND

           BREATHY. Strained. 
           Jason slips the paper in the slot, but it’s too bent to fit. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, come on.

           He struggles to flatten it out.

           The P.O.V. creeps closer to Jason. Predatory.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Jason slides the app inside. A SHADOW looms behind him.

           A hand reaches out from the Shadow to his shoulder.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Maybe they’ll make room for a 
                        bookcase--

           A distant, mysterious bell DING, DING, DINGS!

           At the sound, the hand instinctively retreats.

           Startled, Jason surveys the street. Nothing. Until, he spots 
           a wooden post. As he eases over, a Beater parks on the 
           street. Cuts the lights. A PERSON exits.

           THE WOODEN POST

           MISSING PERSONS SIGNS cover it. They look more like MUGSHOTS. 
           There’s more white paper than pole. All of the victims, BLACK 
           MEN. Among them, one of Leon’s missing cuts, Al Jenkins. 

           A WRINKLED HAND slips behind the pole near Al’s mugshot, but 
           Jason never sees it as--

           SOMEONE snatches his shoulder.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           Shocked, Jason swings at ORENTHAL “O” JACKSON (25), if the 
           hood swallowed MLK’s future before he knew he had a dream. 

                                 O
                        Bruh--

           Jason knocks him the fuck out. The Shoppers gawk at the 
           outburst. Many record it.

                                 SHOPPERS
                        World Star! World Star! World Star!

           Jason side eyes them. Drags O toward the Beater.
           EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT - DOWNTOWN COOLCHITOWN - NIGHT

           The Beater HUMS alone in the lot. Cracks and potholes pepper 
           the concrete. The city stopped fixing the lot years ago. Cold 
           streetlights loom above. They BUZZ and FLICKER.

           INT. O’S BEATER - ABANDONED PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Plastic wrappers and bottles litter the messy Beater.

           Jason sits behind the wheel. Swipes through videos on World 
           Star Hip Hop News. Chuckles as he watches a WHITE GIRL (18) 
           slide across an oily floor in a video. Couple thousand views.

           He spots a video named, “You Got knocked TF Out - Coolchitown 
           Remix.” Jason slugs O in the poorly edited video. Hundreds of 
           thousands of views. Jason exhales. Focuses on O.

                                 JASON
                        O? I didn’t hit you that hard.

           Jason glances back at his phone. RIOTOUS APPLAUSE.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        They took no time with that. Shit.

           O’s eyes snap open. He flails back to life.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Chill, brah. Here’s some ice.

                                 O
                        I oughta smack your ass for that.

           O snatches the pack.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Bein’ shiesty and shit. Spill it.

                                 JASON
                        Leon fired me.

                                 O
                        Damn...hol’ up...

           O starts doing math on his fingers.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        How you get fired on your payday?

                                 JASON
                        Leon can’t pay the bills no more.
           Jason lights a joint. Puffs a few times, then offers it. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I figured that new Hair place has a 
                        line out the ass, commercials, and 
                        stuff. I could make a bag.

                                 O
                        White folks take all the good shit.

           O lovingly watches the blunt’s slow burn.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cept this here stank, of course.

                                 JASON
                        That’s capitalism.

                                 O
                        It’s gentrification, my brother.

                                 JASON
                        You sound like that burglar they 
                        talk about on the news. The...uh--

                                 O
                        The White Flight Bandit.

           O sits back in awe like he’s looking at all his hopes and 
           dreams right outside his windshield.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        That’s a hood hero, right there.

                                 JASON
                        I’m not so sure. 

                                 O
                        The bandit juugs and finesses to 
                        give back to people like us.

                                 JASON
                        I ain’t seen shit, man.

                                 O
                        Lighten up. You wouldn’t say that 
                        if you knew the bandit.

                                 JASON
                        ‘Cause you know the bandit, right?

           O’s nervously quiet. The realization hits Jason.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        You fucking idiot. What are you 
                        involved in now?

                                 O
                        Nothing. Honest to God.
                             (relents)
                        Well...maybe something. The Bandit 
                        has the gangs in a cease fire. 
                        Peace. In the hood. Only your Mom 
                        could do that--

           He’s crossed a line.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        My bad. I didn’t--

           Jason finishes the joint.

                                 JASON
                        Drop me off at Leon’s, yeah?

                                 O
                        Need you to get out my seat, first.

           The Two pop the doors open.

           EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           As they amble around the car, Jason glances at O.

                                 JASON
                        Your eye swollen as shit.

                                 O
                        Believe me, if this shit shuts, 
                        imma be at your door with them 
                        medical bills like my baby mama.

                                 JASON
                        You ain’t have no baby mamas.

                                 O
                        A nigga can dream though.

           Jason sits shotty as O DRUMS on the roof. Smiles.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Then wake in a cold sweat, gahdamn.

           O hops in. Starts the car. SQUEALS off.
           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DOWNTOWN COOLCHITOWN - NIGHT

           With a flashlight in her mouth and completely UNRECOGNIZABLE 
           in ALL BLACK, Meddy tosses a grappling hook on a building.

           It’s Hair.

           She pulls the rope taut. Tests it. Then scales the wall.

           EXT. ROOFTOP OF HAIR - DOWNTOWN COOLCHITOWN - NIGHT

           Meddy’s hand reaches over the ledge. She climbs over, then 
           dusts herself off. She glances ACROSS THE MAIN STREET at the 
           rundown shops. 

           She turns to a small escape door. Tests the knob. But there’s 
           a COMBINATION LOCK around it.

           Meddy puts the flashlight back in her mouth, pulls out a hair 
           pin, then presses one of the prongs into the locking 
           mechanism. She twists the numbers until...CLICK!

           Meddy tries the knob again, but it still won’t work. She 
           checks the keyhole, but it’s weirdly intricate like something 
           out of PAN’S LABYRINTH. 

           Meddy checks both ways, then takes out a lockpick, but,  when 
           she puts it inside the keyhole, she gets a little...SHOCK!

           She yanks her hand back, then turns to see Vultures perched 
           on the roof. Their invasive eyes startle her.

           An alarm BLARES!

                                 MEDDY
                        Dammit.

           Meddy snatches her equipment, then climbs back down her 
           grappling hook.

           EXT. LEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           O’s Beater pulls up to Leon’s well-maintained, grassy yard 
           with a single plastic, pink flamingo on the lawn.

           INT. O’S BEATER - NIGHT

           O puts the car in park. Jason focuses on Leon’s house.
                                 O
                        All I’m sayin’ is, if the job ain’t 
                        cuttin’ it, we got other options.

                                 JASON
                        And I’m saying I’m good. Aight?

           O nods. They dap up.

           Jason opens the passenger door. Hops out.

           EXT. LEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jason saunters to the front door with the mail in one hand. 
           He notices a Vulture above the door ledge. Shoos it away, 
           then watches it fly off. He SIGHS, then reaches for the knob.

           INT. LEON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jason sifts through the mail, then surveys the house.

           On the island, Jason spies a newly covered tupperware of 
           spaghetti, with a note that reads, “With extra oregano on 
           top,” attached.

           He tosses the mail on the island. Grabs the spaghetti.

           Jason spots Leon SNORING on the couch. Beers surround him. 
           Jason grabs a blanket from the couch and covers him, but the 
           remote falls from the blanket and turns the TV on.

           A home movie plays.

           YOUNG LEON (35) smiles brightly with a full head of thick 
           black hair. Plays guitar for a BABY in a high chair. It flips 
           to Theresa. Her smile could bring peace to Chiraq.

           Jason watches Theresa on TV. Mesmerized, then snaps away with 
           a grimace as he glances down to Leon. 

           Beside him, Jason spots the bills. He moves some of the 
           papers around to see their due dates.

           ALL OVERDUE. Payments must be made by the END OF THE WEEK.

           Jason picks up the remote. Turns the TV off. Stands in the 
           darkness by himself for a moment.

           Leon chokes on a SNORE as Jason slips into...
           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jason sets the pasta and his phone on his nightstand next to 
           the empty pill bottle. The photo of Theresa gazes at Leon 
           through the doorway.

           Jason lies down on the bed. Stares at his ceiling. His 
           eyelids...slowly..shut--

           BZZZ! BZZZ! BZZZ!

           Jason groggily turns to his phone. An UNKNOWN PHONE NUMBER.

           BZZZ! BZZZ--

                                 JASON
                        Hello?

           Priscilla’s sultry voice soothes like a phone sex operator. 

                                 PRISCILLA (V.O.)
                        Have I reached Jason Williams?

                                 JASON
                        Speaking.

                                 PRISCILLA (V.O.)
                        I’m Priscilla, the owner of Hair. 
                        Just looked over your application, 
                        and color me impressed.

           Jason checks his alarm clock. It blinks, “1:27am.”

                                 JASON
                        Y’all are open late.

                                 PRISCILLA (V.O.)
                        We squeeze every ounce of juice out 
                        of our staff. Will an 8am, work?

                                 JASON
                        Uh, I think so...

                                 PRISCILLA (V.O.)
                        Great. Don’t be late. Ciao.

           Jason smiles, then looks at a picture of Theresa on his 
           nightstand. Determined. Lies back down.

           Behind him, a lightning strike in the rain illuminates a 
           FIGURE spying on him in his window. 
           That same distant, mysterious bell DING, DING, DINGS though 
           slightly fainter. It’s emanating from OUTSIDE. After another 
           strike hits, the figure’s gone.

           MORNING...

           ALARM BLARES!!!

           Jason snaps up.

           Buckles his belt as tight as he can, but it’s still loose.

           Tightens a tie around his neck, horribly.

           He picks his hair. Breaks the pick. Shrugs. Fuck it.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Jason slips by Leon as he SNORES on the couch. Just as he 
           reaches for the door--

           The wooden floor CREAKS.

           Leon nearly wakes. Jason holds still for a moment until--

           ZZZZ! ZZZZ!

           Leon SNORES again.

           Jason exhales, then leaves out the door.

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Hair disorients Jason with walls cut at sharp angles. 
           Everything is white from the walls to the chairs with black 
           legs to the stone floor tiles. Lots of TV’s.

           A BRONZE BULL STATUE centerpiece demands attention. A moat-
           like fountain surrounds it. Water cascades from its mouth.

           WOMEN (Various), white, with STRAIGHT HAIR sit at beauty 
           stations as STYLISTS (20-40s), Men and Women, white, wash 
           hair with THE SAUCE. They sing a show tune like “FRANK MILLS” 
           from the play Hair. A BLACK FEATHER visible on every Stylist.

           ONLY BLACK MEN are waiting. All of them with similar short 
           crew cuts. All glued to the TVs as the commercial plays. 

           It enamors everyone BUT Jason.

           Jason watches as, with one simple application of the miracle 
           shampoo, their hair snaps to kinky curls EVEN WHILE WET.
           He stares until a Stylist meets his gaze with an invasive 
           glare of her own.

           Jason rips his eyes away. Whistles as he spots a security 
           camera. He takes the broken silver pick out of his pocket. 
           Works through his afro, then gives up. It’s far too tangled.

           He sits back. Eyes the Bull fountain. Enthralled...but 
           something shinier catches his eye out the storefront window.

           Outside, Shoppers, all white, dressed in SPORT’S GEAR like 
           JERSEYS of FAMOUS BLACK ATHLETES. Lebron. Mahomes. Betts.

           Jason eyes the Vultures perched on Leon’s shop.

                                 JASON
                        Weird fucking birds.

           AGATHA BLACK (25), white, the Oracle of Delphi has nothing on 
           this woman, waltzes out. Hot. Knows it. 

           A BLACK FEATHER pinned in her hair behind her ear.

           She raises an eyebrow. Surveys the room. Nothing but lost 
           boys until she meets Jason’s beautifully unique head of hair. 
           Agatha ogles him up, down, left, right. Meat to her.

                                 AGATHA
                        You.

                                 JASON
                        Me? I just got here.

                                 AGATHA
                        And now you’re getting in here. 
                        Remember how easy that was. It’ll 
                        never be that easy again.

           Jason hops up. Ambles past her invasive eyes.

           SNIFF!! Agatha inhales a whiff of his hair as he passes.

                                 AGATHA (CONT’D)
                        You smell of an Athens spring day.

                                 JASON
                        Uh, it’s just some shea butter. 

           Agatha grins slowly, sexually like Herman Cain in one of his 
           2012 election campaign commercials. Jason fights the desire 
           to cringe with a pained smile.
           INT. BACK ROOM - HAIR - DAY

           Another white room. Agatha ushers Jason into a modernist 
           white chair with black legs.

           He faces the back of another chair. Behind the desk looms a 
           large portrait of naked black bodies in various sexual 
           positions. A afro-surrealist’s take on the KAMA SUTRA.

           Agatha passes a piece of paper to SOMEONE in the chair. An 
           arm snatches the paper. Waves Agatha off. Agatha nods. Shoots 
           Jason a wink on her way out the door.

                                 AGATHA
                        Good luck.

           Priscilla rises and sits ON the desk in front of him. A ruler 
           in hand. Stares at his hair for an uncomfortable moment.

           A BLACK FEATHER sticks out from behind her ear, as well.

                                 JASON
                        Hello?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I just--Can I touch it?

           Priscilla steals a pat. She quivers. Jason yanks back.

                                 JASON
                        What? No--Jesus, lady!

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You’ve just got the perfect 4d curl 
                        type. I’ve been looking everywhere 
                        for someone who naturally grows it. 

                                 JASON
                        Well, I’m right here.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You absolutely are. Honestly, your 
                        hair will fit in perfectly here.

                                 JASON
                        My hair..?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You. You will fit in perfectly 
                        here.

           Priscilla leans in. Reveals some cleavage.
                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Tell me. Do you have any strengths?
                             (narrows her eyes)
                        Any deficiencies? 

                                 JASON
                        II-uh--deficiencies? I’m--uh--
                        punctual, if that’s what you--

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Stand up.

           Jason obeys like a boot camp ensign to a drill sergeant.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Turn around...Spread ‘em.

                                 JASON
                        What the--

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Spread. Them.

           Jason spreads his legs. Priscilla takes a moment to 
           appreciate what she sees.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        You may have a seat.

           Jason happily climbs back into his chair.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        You have a certain stock that rubs 
                        me well. Could be a great addition 
                        to Hair’s family. Give me a moment.

           Jason nods uncomfortably. Priscilla sifts through papers.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Seems no one printed out your 
                        resume. It’s...

                                 JASON
                        Jason.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Right. Williams. Be right back.

           Priscilla pops up. Giddily exits.

           MOAN...

           Jason surveys the room. 
           MOAN..

           Spots a door labeled “PRIVATE” in the corner. The MOANS 
           emanate from there.

           He checks over his shoulder. The coast is clear.

           Jason rises. Creeps to the door.

           Closer...closer...closer...

           He reaches out for the doorknob--

           Priscilla snatches his wrist with surprising strength.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Steady that curly head of yours.

                                 JASON
                        I’m sorry. I just--uh, I’m curious.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        No problem. But work hard enough, 
                        and we’ll show you how the Sauce is 
                        made, personally.  

           She passes him a slip of paper.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        I believe you’ll find this amount 
                        to be appropriate. Paid in cash at 
                        the end of each day. You’ll start 
                        tomorrow. 9am. Sharp. Welcome to 
                        the team, Mr. Williams.

                                 JASON
                        But I haven’t--

           Priscilla eyes Jason as he opens the slip. His eyes widen.

           INT. UNCLE LEON'S BARBERSHOP - DAY

           Through the storefront window of his empty shop, Leon watches 
           Yates ease into Hair and hug Priscilla warmly. He raises an 
           eyebrow, then--

           Jason slips out from Hair, then slinks down the sidewalk. 
           Bumps between Shoppers.

           Leon’s appalled. Seethes. Closes the blinds.

                                 O (PRE-LAP)
                        DAAAA--
           INT. LEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           O’s off his rocker excited. Paces in front of the Leon’s TV 
           with the slip of paper in his hands.

           Jason glances at a picture of Theresa on the wall. She’s not 
           so impressed. Frowns. Jason rolls his eyes. He’s pumped, too.

                                 O
                        --AAAAAMMMMMNNNN!!!

                                 JASON
                        Right?

           O laughs at Jason.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 O
                        It’s nothing.

                                 JASON
                        No, what is it?

                                 O
                        It’s just--This is the most excited 
                        I seen you in a while. You could 
                        throw the leftover Leon’s way too.

           Jason stops. Thinks about it. Laughs off the pointed comment.

                                 JASON
                        Fuck outta here with that soft 
                        shit, man. I just need my pills, 
                        but...

           Jason fishes in his pocket. Pulls out a joint.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        ...Celebratory pre-roll?

                                 O
                        Say less--

           Keys JIGGLE in the door. Startled, Jason and O jump. The 
           joint flies in the air. It falls between the couch cushions.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! The pre-roll!

           Leon trudges inside the house with grocery bags in his hands. 
           Perks up at the sight of Jason and O. Sniffs the air. 
                                 LEON
                        So this is what y’all do when I’m 
                        not around, huh?

                                 O
                        What’s good, Mr. Williams?

                                 LEON
                        Not much. Including you, boy. Out. 

                                 JASON
                        Hold up--

                                 LEON
                        Nuh-uh-uh. I may be older but I 
                        know grade-A stank when I smell it. 
                        Ain’t nobody cheefin’ in my house.

                                 O
                        Sounds like a boring house--

                                 LEON
                        Go home, O!

           O reads the room. Nothing good here. He daps Jason. Exits. 
           Jason eases over. Grabs the lock.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        And before you lock it up, grab the 
                        mail. My hands were too full.

           Jason SIGHS. Tightens his jaw. Opens the door.

           EXT. LEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jason opens the mailbox. Sifts through it. An unaddressed 
           letter sticks out. 

           It’s “To Jason Williams, from a friend.”

           Jason scrutinizes the envelope.

                                 JASON
                        Hmm.

           Jason’s stomach GRUMBLES. He looks through a window into the 
           kitchen. Leon’s already hard at work over the stove.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A bucket of CRABS HISS as water boils them alive. One almost 
           escapes before another pulls it back down into the cesspool.
           The door CREAKS open as Leon stirs them into oblivion. Jason 
           quietly shuts the door. Tries to sneak to the fridge--

                                 LEON
                        Love me some crab.

           Jason deflates. Caught.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Y’know, I use crab in my meatballs?

                                 JASON
                        No, can I get a--

                                 LEON
                        Funny thing ‘bout crabs, though. 

                                 JASON
                        Leon, would you just let me--

           Leon SMACKS a firm hand on the counter. Jason freezes.

                                 LEON
                        Scientists say they feel pain. That 
                        hiss ya hear. It’s them screamin’.

           Leon stirs loosely once more, as the HISS GROWS. 

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        That’s not the funny part though. 
                        When they’re gettin’ boiled, and 
                        what not, they try to escape. When 
                        one of ‘em is about to get free, 
                        the rest of ‘em try to latch onto 
                        him. Use him, ya know? But that 
                        extra weight drags the poor fella 
                        back into the water with ‘em.

           He stops stirring. Glances up at the backsplash

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        They kill each other. Call it the 
                        “crabs in a barrel” effect.

           Leon dries his hands. Grabs two plates. Offers one.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Want a plate?

                                 JASON
                        Nah, I’m good. Lost my appetite.

           Jason turns. Ambles to his room. Leon snatches his shoulder.
                                 LEON
                        I seen you over at Hair. 

                                 JASON
                        You told me to--

                                 LEON
                        But there of all places?

                                 JASON
                        We don’t exactly have options in 
                        this bust town. I need the bread.

                                 LEON
                        But your mama wouldn’t want you 
                        gettin’ it workin for them.

                                 JASON
                        You know what else she wouldn’t 
                        want? You running her shop into the 
                        fucking ground, but we don’t get 
                        everything we want, do we? So stop 
                        concerning yourself about where my 
                        paper comes from. 

           Leon grits his teeth. Jason nods, then slips into... 

           INT. JASON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jason drags inside, drops his backpack onto the floor, tosses 
           his shirt into the pile, then hops on his bed as something 
           Black as fuck like “BLACK DYNAMITE” plays on his TV.

           He studies the envelope, then rolls onto his stomach. Glances 
           at the picture of Theresa as she nods, reassuringly.

           He rips the envelope open, unfurls the letter. On it:

           “Suffer for a day; earn a lifetime of bliss. - The Bandit.”

                                 JASON
                        What the fuck?

           Jason glances at Theresa. She shrugs. Doesn’t know. He 
           settles on his back with the letter on his chest. 

           He drifts to sleep as...

           BANG!

           A gunshot fires on TV.

           GLASS CRACKLE!
           INT. THERESA’S CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           YOUNGER JASON (17) climbs into the TAN LEATHER driver’s seat 
           from the passenger’s side. Places his phone on the dashboard.  
           Poses for a photo.

           Jason grabs the phone. Giddily looks at the photo, until--

           Theresa’s BLOODY face SLAMS into the window from the outside.

           Right as Jason HOLLERS IN TERROR--

           INT. JASON'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Jason snaps up in a cold sweat. Pants heavily. He glances to 
           Theresa’s photo. She taps her wrist. Jason checks his clock.

           8:45am. Fuck.

           Jason hops up. Throws some clothes on. Races out the door.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN COOLCHITOWN - DAY

           Jason spots a massive crowd of Shoppers around Hair. 

           They’re all dressed in streetwear like WIFE BEATERS, DURAGS, 
           and CHAINS. They climb over each other to get inside Hair. 
           IT’S ALREADY OPEN. He races over. 

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Stylists sing a show tune such as “GOOD MORNING STARSHINE” 
           from the play Hair in unison as they cut and style. Each 
           chair is at a different stage of the process. Some shampoo, 
           some color, others cut.

           The place is busting at the seams. 

           Shoppers stare at the TVs as the suggestive commercial for 
           the Sauce plays on repeat.

           Priscilla rings up a WOMAN (40s), white, with EXTREMELY CURLY 
           HAIR at the counter. Bags a purple bottle of the Sauce, then 
           passes it to the satisfied customer. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Thank you, come again!

           Jason slips in as the Woman walks out. He notices that she’s 
           hand-in-hand with a BLACK CHILD (8), but when he turns--
           A Stylist is in his face. He jumps back in shock.

                                 STYLIST #1
                        Oh my god! Is that him?

                                 STYLIST #2
                        He’s adorable!

           The Stylists drop their implements. Bum-rush Jason. His eyes 
           widen. They shower him in uncomfortable hugs and kisses. Way 
           too comfortable and touchy-feely.

           Priscilla cuts through the wave of Stylists.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Stylists, please! There will be 
                        plenty of him to go around. Back to 
                        your stations.

           The Stylists snap to. Obedience.

           Priscilla helps Jason up. Lipstick covers him. Somewhat 
           flattened afro. Broken glasses. Priscilla checks her watch.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        9:01. You’re late, pretty boy.

                                 JASON
                        My bad. Got sidetracked.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        That was my first head of the day.
                             (shows Jason a picture)
                        Before...

           Priscilla points at the Woman. Jason notices her curly hair. 
           Compares it to the straight hair in the photo.

           She parades her Child in front of other Shoppers, then yanks 
           the Child away with excessive force when they lose interest.

                                 JASON
                             (hates the whole scene)
                        It’s...nice.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        And you say all the right things.
                             (turns a 180)
                        Follow me.

           Jason hurries behind her.
           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           Priscilla waltzes inside, turns on a dime, and stares at 
           Jason’s worn dickies. Scrutinizes them for a looooooong time.

           Jason surveys the room.

           The surreal Kama Sutra has been replaced by a cubist-style 
           take on “THE OLD PLANTATION.”

           Priscilla circles him. Picks at his clothes.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        These look thuggish.
                             (snap, snap)
                        Dress him properly.

           Agatha and THEA BLACK (22), imagine Aphrodite in an emo phase 
           with GREEN lipstick, damn near teleport to Priscilla’s side.

           A BLACK FEATHER is pinned in Thea’s hair, like her sisters.

           Agatha swipes Jason’s shoulders. Jason ZOOMS into...

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           AT AGATHA’S BEAUTY STATION

           It looks like a bloodbath. Red hair dye blankets her sink. 
           She spins him around to face the mirror.

                                 AGATHA
                        I’ll show you what makes the Sauce 
                        so special.

           Thea passes a purple bottle of the Sauce to Agatha.

                                 JASON
                        Special? Like Mane ‘n Tail?

                                 AGATHA
                        Mane ‘n Tail? Did you hear him, 
                        sister? The Sauce is so much better 
                        than Mane ‘n stinking tail! It’s 
                        magic! It keeps our skin so--

                                 THEA
                        Why don’t you get to the showing 
                        part of orientation, sister?

                                 AGATHA
                        Right, right. Got a little carried 
                        away there. 
                                 THEA
                        You tend to--

                                 AGATHA
                        Shut up, hag.

           Agatha smiles, then squirts the entire bottle on Jason’s 
           afro. Not enough. She grabs another. Agatha massages it in as 
           pleasurable MOANS escape her mouth. Jason cringes. He wants 
           no part in this sexual haircut.

           Agatha dips Jason into the sink to rinse. Brings him up. Dips 
           again. Again. Jason chokes on soapy water.

           Thea wraps his head in a towel. Dries him off. Rotates the 
           chair around for Jason to face the mirror.

           Agatha yanks the towel off. His hair has not changed at all.

                                 AGATHA (CONT’D)
                        Voidaaaaahhhhhh!

           Jason cringes at Agatha in the mirror. She really thinks she 
           did something here, but she clearly has not.

                                 AGATHA (CONT’D)
                        You like?

                                 JASON
                             (unsure how to respond)
                        It’s...great.

                                 AGATHA
                        Chevere!

           Thea swipes Jason’s shoulders. He zooms into...

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           Thea runs a measuring tape across Jason’s arms, legs, and 
           body as Agatha digs through a closet. Jason’s not at all 
           happy with the attention. Priscilla sits at her desk.

                                 THEA
                        He’s a medium.

                                 JASON
                        Stop touching me--

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Nonsense. If you want to be a part 
                        of Hair’s success, you need to look 
                        the part and we need measurements.
           Agatha grabs a pair of sleek BALMAIN jeans and a WHITE tee.

                                 AGATHA
                        Perfect.

           She throws them to Thea. Thea shoves them into Jason’s hands.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Strip.

                                 JASON
                        Are you insane?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Oh, right. Right. Right.
                             (to her Sisters)
                        Girls, if you will.

           Agatha and Thea head for the door. Thea mopes, and Agatha 
           seductively blows a kiss. They shut the door behind them.

           Priscilla rises. Heads back to her desk.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got better things to look for.

           She bends down and rifles through it. Behind her, Jason 
           changes. He notices a LARGE SAFE in the desk’s lower cabinet. 
           Priscilla rises between Jason’s gaze and the safe and 
           scrunches her eyebrows. She barely missed Jason’s sneak peek.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        You have work to do.

           She hands him a tiny broom and a broken metal dustpan.

                                 JASON
                        I can’t possibly clean with these--

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I expect you to.

           Tosses him a pair of WIERD KEYS. Jason scrutinizes them.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        The keys to the shop.
                             (clap, claps)
                        Now, if you need me, don’t hesitate 
                        to shout...
                             (pinches his cheek)
                        ...my little janitor.

           With that, Priscilla slips behind the “Private” door. She 
           gives Jason a snide smirk. CLINK! The door closes and locks.
           Jason exhales. He studies the keys, then glances up to the 
           ceiling like it’s heaven.

                                 JASON
                        You better be right about this one 
                        day of suffering shit.
                             (glances back down)
                        Cuz my psyche won’t do two.

           He forces a CHESHIRE GRIN. Eases out.

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Jason shuts the door, then turns to the Stylists... 

           ...but they’re ALL STARING AT HIM. Frozen in time. All of the 
           Women are getting the SAME KINKY CURLY HAIRCUT. Then back to 
           business as usual. Chopping, dying, styling.

           Jason’s eyes stop on a disheveled BLACK WOMAN (30s) as she 
           eases into the shop. Looks around for an empty chair. The 
           Stylists admonish her Nubian braids.

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        Y’all do braids ‘round here?

                                 AGATHA
                        No, I’m so sorry. You should leave.

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        But my edges--

                                 AGATHA
                        We don’t work with...edges...here.

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        Well, you got any recommendations? 
                        Cuz y’all are poppin’.

                                 AGATHA
                        For someone like you, no. Bye now.

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        What you mean, “someone like me?”

           Agatha pushes the Black Woman out of the shop.

                                 BLACK WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m talkin’ a you--You see 
                        this? You see what they doin’ to 
                        sistas ‘round here--

           Agatha slams the door shut. Cleans her hands.
                                 AGATHA
                        Good riddance.

           Jason stares at Agatha. Nothing about that was okay to him. 
           Agatha cradles his chin with her hand.

                                 AGATHA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I’d never do that to 
                        you. Your mother raised you right. 
                        Unlike that rabble, you’re one of 
                        the good ones.

           Agatha gives a dark smile, then taps his nose playfully.

                                 AGATHA (CONT’D)
                        Such a beautiful big nose. Boop.

           She leaves him be, and heads back to her station. Jason 
           gulps, then sweeps up hair around the Stylists’ feet.

           INT. UNCLE LEON'S BARBERSHOP - DAY

           Leon watches the ruckus at Hair from his chair. A tupperware 
           of spaghetti and meatballs in his lap and fork in his mouth. 
           Spots Jason through the Hair storefront window. 

           Jason smiles brightly as he works hard inside. Leon simmers.

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Jason’s forced smile fades into a stressful grimace as he 
           struggles to keep up with the Stylists. They’re machines. 
           Jason rubs sweat from...

           LATER...

           ...his brow.

           Jason sweeps vigorously. Fast...faster...fastest--

           Cuts his hand on the dented dustpan.

                                 JASON
                        Shit!

           He said that too loud. Looks around as he sucks on the cut. 
           The “Private” door opens for a split second as a black trash 
           bag PLOPS down outside of it.

           Jason SIGHS.
           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           The Vultures watch Jason’s every step through the alley. 
           Jason slings the trash bag over his shoulder. It’s filled to 
           the brim. Gauze on his hand.

           LARGE GREEN METAL DUMPSTERS are ahead of him.

           MOAN...

           He stops. Looks around for the sound. Shrugs. Continues. 
           Jason tosses the bag inside a dumpster, but it RIPS open. 

           LOTS OF BLOOD-COVERED TOWELS.

           He lifts one from the ground. Smells it.

                                 JASON
                        That’s not hair dye.

           MOAN...

           Jason whips his head around. The MOANS escape from below. He 
           peers through an open window and sees Priscilla’s office. 
           Spots the “Private” door slightly ajar. 

           BZZZZ!

           Jason jumps. Surprised by his phone.

           He checks it...as--

           A hand SNATCHES his shoulder.

           Jason flinches. Drops his phone.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Didn’t mean to scare you. Just 
                        wanted to congratulate you on a job 
                        well done. You may last a long time 
                        here with us if you can perform 
                        like that regularly.

                                 JASON
                        Thanks. Do you want the keys back?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Hold onto them. For tomorrow.

           She pulls out some cash. Sifts through it.
                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Here’s today’s pay.

           Jason counts it. Furrows his brow.

                                 JASON
                        This is only half.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Irresponsibility has its 
                        consequences.

           Priscilla eases away, but Jason rushes after her.

                                 JASON
                        No, we agreed--

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You broke that agreement by being 
                        late this morning. 

                                 JASON
                        I worked hard for that money. I 
                        earned it.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You earn what I say you earn. Today 
                        you were late, so you earned less.

           Priscilla chuckles, then presses toward him.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be late tomorrow, or you 
                        won’t be earning much here any 
                        longer. Are we clear?

           Jason nods as Priscilla raises her chin to him.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Good.  

           Priscilla leaves Jason in the alleyway alone.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Have a good night, Mr. Williams.

           He goes back to grab his phone, but a Vultures pecks at the 
           screen and SQUAWKS at him.

                                 JASON
                        That’s my phone, you fucking bird!

           Jason tries to shoo it away but it stands its ground, so he 
           rears back and--
           CRUNCH!

           He kicks the bird into the brick wall of the alleyway 
           breaking its neck.

           Jason snatches his phone, then turns to the twitching 
           Vulture. He peeks into the basement window again. The door is 
           no longer ajar, but he spots the shelf and large safe.

           He pulls out his cellphone. Dials.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. It’s me. We need to talk 
                        about those other options. Now. 

           EXT. THE ARGYLE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           A neon-lined monolith to underground excess. It lords over 
           the surrounding shacks, bandos, and bodegas and commands 
           attention like a stripper on the main stage.

           O’s beater pulls into the fenced-in, sparsely parked lot.

           This place looks like it’s preparing for war...

           INT. O'S BEATER - NIGHT

           O hogs the rearview mirror. Combs his hair. Rubs his brows. 
           Through the windshield, the neon visage of THE ARGYLE 
           pulsates from the low, thumpy BASS PUMPING within.

           Jason’s tense. Through the window, he surveys the outside.

           It’s a sketchy part of town. If you thought downtown was 
           rundown, this place is rubble piled on top of rubble. 

           Jason checks his watch. That same blinking “1:27.”

                                 JASON
                        I think my watch is broken.

                                 O
                        Just one more second, my G. Gotta 
                        look good for the boss lady.

                                 JASON
                        It’s always a girl with you.

                                 O
                        And it’s never with you, Mr. I-
                        can’t-get-hard-cuz-of-my-depression 
                        ass nigga?
           O glares at the plastic bag by Jason’s hip.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        I know dick meds when I see them. 
                             (primps in the mirror)
                        My gran gran’s shit ain’t work 
                        right, since ‘Nam.

           Jason GROANS. Swings the door open. Leaves the bag behind.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        When we’re in there, just follow 
                        me. I’ll do the--

           O breaks his trance with the mirror. Searches for Jason. O 
           spots Jason on his way toward the Argyle without him.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Damn it.

           O gives one last look to the mirror, then runs out after him.

           EXT. THE ARGYLE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Jason marches from O’s Beater as O haphazardly gives chase. 
           Grabs Jason’s wrist.

                                 O
                        Fade back, Knievil. Rush in any 
                        faster, and people might think the 
                        British are coming.

                                 JASON
                        Good. Because the British are 
                        already here. No--

           Jason and O walk into a burly-chested BOUNCER (30s), black.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Watch where you’re...go...ing...

                                 BOUNCER
                        Let’s see some IDs.

           Jason passes his. The Bouncer scrutinizes it.

                                 JASON
                        Oh...well...we’re just here for 
                        the...uh...
                                 BOUNCER
                        This ain’t the place for you, kid.
                             (gives the ID back)
                        Take a hike.

                                 JASON
                        What? I’m twenty-two. Bruh, let me--

           Jason tries to force his way past the Bouncer, but the 
           Bouncer isn’t having it.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Uh-uh. You don’t have the, uh... 
                        Argyle look. 
                             (eyes Jason’s clothes)
                        We’re an...oxford and jeans kinda 
                        joint if you catch my drift. 

           Jason surveys the dilapidated surroundings. The Bouncer is 
           clearly lying to him. O eases by Jason.

                                 O
                        What’s good wit it, big homie?

           O daps up the Bouncer with a complex handshake that ends with 
           a forearm embrace. 

           A SECRET HANDSHAKE.

           The Bouncer scans them. Particularly Jason. O glances from 
           Jason to the Bouncer. The Bouncer nods. He opens the door. 

           Jason’s baffled.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        What did we learn?

                                 JASON
                        You’ll do the talking.

                                 O
                        Damn right.

           O tips the Bouncer a five as they ease past.

           INT. THE ARGYLE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           There’s a bar at the center of the room. Around it small 
           tables of mostly BLACK CLUBGOERS (21+) group up and share 
           Hookah. Some dance as a small JAZZ BAND plays on the stage.

           O races past that straight toward the bar, but Jason surveys 
           the entire space. Awestruck.
                                 JASON
                        This place it’s...so...

                                 O
                        You gotta see this side of town 
                        more, man.

           AT THE BAR

           O waits as the BARTENDER (30s), black, cleans a glass.

           Jason spots some WOMEN on the dance floor. O chuckles.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Take a chill pill. We’re here on 
                        business...this time.

           The Bartender wades over. Eyes them up and down.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What do you want, kid?

                                 O
                        We need to talk to the boss lady.

           The Bartender narrows his eyes. That’s a no-go.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        You know, the HNIC?

           Still a no-go. Jason leans in WHISPERS.

                                 JASON
                        The White Flight Bandit.

           RECORD SCRATCH.

           Everyone and everything stops. Everyone stares at him. The 
           attention makes him uncomfortable.

                                 O
                        It’s okay, y’all, I got him.

           O punches Jason’s shoulder.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Don’t say that ‘round here. She 
                        don’t like it. Nobody does.

                                 MEDDY (O.S.)
                        No, I don’t. Especially from an 
                        unfamiliar voice.
           Meddy slips in from behind a curtain with Alexandre Dumas’ 
           THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO in her hand. She stops in shock at 
           the sight of Jason. Then smiles.

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe a familiar one.

           Jason stiffens. Feeling isn’t mutual. He glares at Meddy.

                                 JASON
                        Nah, unfamiliar. 

           Meddy lets out a faint scoff as CLUBGOER #1 approaches Jason 
           with a hand on his belt.

                                 CLUBGOER #1
                        One word and my guys will waste 
                        this Cinna-Mon-lookin’ ass nigga.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, I get that a lot. Baby face.

           Clubgoer #1 narrows his eyes. Cocks his DESERT EAGLE. Jason 
           grins as Clubgoer #1 sizes him up, but Meddy cuts in.

                                 MEDDY
                        I can take it from here.

           Clubgoer #1 nods at Meddy while he glares at Jason, then 
           backs down. The JAZZ resumes as Meddy smiles at Jason.

                                 JASON (PRE-LAP)
                        You shouldn’t have come back.

           INT. BACK ROOM - THE ARGYLE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           As the place clears out, Meddy eases into a booth. 

                                 MEDDY
                        Well, I did.
                             (recomposes)
                        But enough about spilt milk. Sit.

           Jason and O sit across from Meddy. The Bartender brings them 
           water and two shots of tequila. Meddy doesn’t take her water, 
           but the Bartender sets a glass before Jason and O.

           Jason goes for his, but O cuts him off. Tosses the shot back.

                                 JASON
                        I ordered that!

           O quickly chases it with the second shot, then burps.
                                 O
                        What? I was thirsty!

           Meddy covers her mouth to hide a laugh, but as she reaches up 
           she knocks her purse open just enough for Jason to sneak a 
           peek at an exposed syringe inside.

                                 JASON
                        So you steal for these guys and 
                        they give you dope? Convenient.

                                 MEDDY
                        It’s not like that.

                                 O
                        Little harsh, dog.

                                 JASON
                        I must have developed Alzheimer’s 
                        cause I don’t remember asking you a 
                        question, bro. 

                                 MEDDY
                        You get my letter?  
                             (collects herself)
                        Your Mom kept the peace in this 
                        hood. The day she died--

                                 JASON
                        Don’t ever twist my Mom’s words 
                        like that again. 

                                 MEDDY
                        I was trying to apologize.

                                 JASON
                        Apologize? Is that what this savior 
                        complex is for, college girl? The 
                        hood isn’t your project to just 
                        come back to and protect like you 
                        never left it. The place lives, 
                        loves, mourns without you. 
                             (rises)
                        Let’s go.

                                 MEDDY
                        Then why don’t you?

           Jason stops. Thinks. 

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I heard about Theresa’s.
                                 JASON
                        It’s Uncle Leon’s now.

                                 MEDDY
                        Heard about that too. I also heard 
                        you got a job at Hair. How is it?

           Jason glares at O. O puts his hands up. Surrenders.

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t blame him. I’ve been casing 
                        the place for a couple days, now.

                                 JASON
                        That explains a lot. 

           Jason SIGHS. Relents a bit.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        They pay well, but the owner thinks 
                        she can treat me any way she wants. 
                        Reminds me of you.

           Meddy glances at the ground. Ashamed.

                                 MEDDY
                        So you came here for my help.

                                 JASON
                        I came here for the Bandit’s help. 
                        They’ve got a safe, and I need cash 
                        for some...pills.

                                 O
                        They’re his dick pills.

                                 JASON
                        What the fuck, O?!?

                                 O
                        What?

                                 MEDDY
                        And you call me the dope fiend.

                                 JASON
                        Don’t get it twisted. My shit’s 
                        prescribed. You’re self-medicating. 

                                 MEDDY
                        You were always a blunt instrument, 
                        but it doesn’t matter. The place is 
                        locked down tighter than Fort Knox.
                                 JASON
                        Don’t worry about that.

           Meddy thinks. Long and hard. Then relaxes. He’s won her over.

                                 MEDDY
                        Fine. I’ll get my gear. 

           O smiles at Jason as Meddy slips out the curtain past him. 
           The Bartender narrows his eyes, then grabs their glasses.

           EXT. HAIR - NIGHT

           O parks his beater out front of Hair on the street. Jason and 
           Meddy slip out of the car. All are clad in BLACK. Meddy heads 
           for the trunk, while Jason eases to Hair’s door. O pops the 
           trunk open, then slides out.

                                 O
                        So what’s the plan, boss?

           Meddy scours the trunk. Inside, a cat burglar’s paradise. 
           There’s rope and chain, a grappling hook, flashlights, etc. 

                                 MEDDY
                        Simple. Every shop on the street 
                        has a key-lock on the roof because 
                        the county doesn’t bother to update 
                        them, so we’ll toss the grappling 
                        hook and climb to the roof. 

           O’s excited. 

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        But Hair’s key lock is insanely 
                        intricate, so I’m hoping I can 
                        crack it with--

           Jason opens the front door with his keys.

                                 JASON
                        Or, I can just open the front door.

           He looks back at them. JINGLES the keys. O and Meddy look at 
           him, then to each other, then back again.

                           MEDDY
                                                            O
           That works, too.
                                              Yeah, sure.

           Meddy grabs her backpack and three flashlights, then shuts 
           the trunk. LEAVES THE REST OF HER GEAR INSIDE.
           INT. HAIR - NIGHT

           Jason hits the lights. Everyone GASPS at the sheer weird 
           beauty of the white vaulted walls and BRONZE BULL.

                                 O
                        Whoa.

                                 JASON
                        This is the place.

           Meddy inspects the supplies at one of the stations. Surveys 
           the room. Spots the red light of a security camera. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Just please be careful not to--

           CRASHHHH!

           Jason stares at O as he labors over a fallen glass of 
           barbicide.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Break anything.

                                 O
                        Sorry.

           Jason lets out a frustrated SIGH. Meddy climbs on a station. 

                                 JASON
                        What the Hell are you doing!?! 

           Meddy takes out a small pair of scissors. Reaches behind the 
           camera with them.

                                 MEDDY
                        Almost got it.

           She feels around until--CLICK!

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        There!

           The red light fades to black. It’s dead.

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Now, we’ve got free reign. 
                             (to Jason)
                        Where‘s the safe?

                                 JASON
                        In the back. 
                                 MEDDY
                        I’ll go work on it while you two 
                        loot the register.

                                 JASON
                        Sounds good. The back room is that 
                        way. Just follow the hallway.

           Meddy nods, then turns on her flashlight as she eases down 
           the dark hallway.

           O pilfers every drawer he can find. Nothing’s safe. Jason 
           hits the register. He’s disappointed to find it empty. SLAMS 
           it shut.

           INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           “THE SCREAM” with four different, brightly colored vignettes 
           reminiscent of Andy Warhol replaces “The Old Plantation.”

           Meddy scours the office. Combs through Priscilla’s desk. She 
           opens a lower cabinet on the shelf and...

                                 MEDDY
                        Bingo!

           The large safe hides inside.

           She puts the flashlight in her mouth, swings her backpack 
           around, and opens it. Inside, a safe-cracking kit. She pulls 
           a lock pick out. Manipulates the locking mechanism.

           She feels around for a bit, then--

           CRACK!

           The safe’s door pops open.

           Meddy smirks...until she sees what’s inside.

           INT. HAIR - NIGHT

           O packs a small duffel bag with the little cash he can find, 
           while Jason scrubs up the barbicide. Jason wipes his face. 

                                 JASON
                        That should be enough for the shop.

                                 O
                        Fuck outta here with that, bro. I’m 
                        getting what’s owed. 
                                 JASON
                        I’m not trying--

                                 O
                        Look, man, with all due respect, 
                        this ain’t just about you no more. 
                        I’m getting enough for everybody to 
                        keep eating. We got a whole street 
                        with signs up. 

           Jason thinks, then glances through the storefront window out 
           at a single SHOPPER dressed in PLANTATION ERA garb, across 
           the street, in the shadows.

                                 JASON
                             (am I really seeing this)
                        What the fuck--

                                 MEDDY (O.S.)
                        Jason!

                                 JASON
                        What?

                                 MEDDY (O.S.)
                        You and O need to see this.

           Jason and O look at each other. Concerned.

           INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Meddy hunches over the desk. On it, three passports and lots 
           of cash.

           Jason and O run inside. When Jason sees the pile of money, he 
           stops in his tracks. O’s jaw nearly drops off the hinges.

                                 O
                        Knew this place was loaded! Good 
                        shit, boss!

           Meddy doesn’t share O’s excitement.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MEDDY
                        This place is just a salon, right?

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, and?
                                 MEDDY
                        What would a salon need a hundred 
                        thousand dollars in cash for? It’s 
                        not adding up.

                                 JASON
                        Are those passports?

           Jason slides over opens one to look at the picture inside. 
           It’s Priscilla. But her name’s different here. 

           PEISINOE.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Well that explains the Bull. 
                        They’re from Greece.

                                 MEDDY
                        But what about the cash?

                                 O
                        Who the fuck cares. Just grab as 
                        much as you can carry and let’s go.

           O makes a move toward the pile--

           A LOUD MOAN...

           They crane their heads toward the “Private” door.

                                 MEDDY
                        Y’all hear that?

                                 O
                        It’s coming from the door.

           A LOUDER MOAN...

                                 MEDDY
                        Jason is that normal?

                                 JASON
                        It’s never been this loud before.

                                 O
                        What’s in there?

                                 JASON
                        I’m not exactly sure. I think it’s 
                        their secret ingredient, but they 
                        don’t let me go back there.
                                 O
                        That’s boss code for the best 
                        shit’s this way. Open it up.

           AN EVEN LOUDER MOAN...

           O pushes Jason toward the door.

           Jason hesitates. Glances back.

           Meddy’s unsure. Shrugs.

           Jason gulps...

           ...then twiddles the keys in his hands.

           MOANS grow more energetic, faster as Jason inches over.

           MOAN...MOAN...MOAN...

           The knob quakes until Jason’s steady hand stills it. He puts 
           the key in the knob. Slowly twists.

           CREAK......

                                 AGATHA (V.O.)
                        Your mother raised you right.

           Jason takes one last look at O and Meddy. Both nod.

                                 AGATHA (V.O.)
                        You’re one of the good ones.

           He turns back to the door.

           CLICK!

           It opens, and he steps into...

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

           Shock blankets everyone’s face. 

           Jason claws at his hair as the MOANING grows.

           SERIES OF SHOTS - WHAT THE HELL IS IN HERE?

           A) BLACK and WHITE feet stumble around under hazy lights.

                                 MEDDY
                        What..?

           B) Faces of pleasure. 
                                 O
                        The..?

           C) Black and white bodies writhe and grind on each other.

                                 JASON
                        Fuck!

           Priscilla, wearing an ALL WHITE Doctor’s coat, eases around 
           the orgy, with a metal table. Sharp implements on top of it. 

           She wears a MEDIEVAL BLACK PLAGUE DOCTOR’S MASK. 

           Jason recognizes the orgy’s participants. 

           They’re the MISSING BLACK MEN from the posters.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Oh, good, you brought friends, too.

           Priscilla lifts a SERVANT’S BELL and that same DING. DING. 
           DING RINGS out...but it’s no longer faint. 

           Within a split second, Al leaps out of the orgy. Drags Jason 
           inside with a RECOGNIZABLE WRINKLED HAND. Two other Black Men 
           snatch Meddy and O.

           The Three kick and scream to no avail.

           The door SLAMS behind them.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

           Priscilla CACKLES over the darkness.

           FADE IN:

           INT. JASON’S ROOM - ANTHEMOS SPA - DAY

           Jason lies peacefully on a thick king-sized mattress in the 
           middle of a mahogany furnished room with white walls.

           A STUFFED TAXIDERMY SNOW CRAB is mounted to the wall above 
           his headboard.

           A white ceiling fan rotates slowly above the bed reminiscent 
           of APOCALYPSE NOW.

           Jason’s eyes snap open. He flails to life. 

           ...then Jason GROANS. He has a splitting headache.
                                 JASON
                        What the hell is going on?

           Jason, in a puffy white robe, struggles to raise his body 
           from the thick mattress. 

           Calm ELEVATOR MUSIC accents the Spa.

           He glances to a sign above his door that reads, “Participate 
           to earn more days in the spa. - Management”

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Participate?

           Jason turns to an analog clock.

           13:27pm.

           A small RINGING fills his ears as he works through his 
           confusion. Jason runs his hands through his hair. 

           The RINGING grows until--

           O BURSTS through the door.

                                 O
                        Finally. Get up! Need ya at the top 
                        of your game.

           Jason rises, then holds his head. Collapses back to the bed.

                                 JASON
                        I can barely stand.

           O offers Jason a MURKY WHITE LIQUID COCKTAIL in a paper cup.

                                 O
                        Drink this. It helps.

           Jason eyes O, who wears a toothy smile, then takes the cup.

           He shrugs, then throws the drink back in one gulp.

                                 JASON
                        Tangy.

                                 O
                        You’ll feel better in a second.

           Jason’s pupils dilate and grow in size, then shrink back to 
           normal. His neck and head convulse just a bit.

                                 JASON
                        Whoa.
           O rises. Gives him a helping hand.

                                 O
                        Right? Now get up. We got bread to 
                        chase and chicks to mingle with.

                                 JASON
                        Where’s Meddy?

                                 O
                        Forget about her, bruh. Plenty of 
                        women around here for us both.

                                 JASON
                        I’ve never seen this place before.

                                 O
                        Maybe a tour will remind ya.

           Jason nods. Then walks toward the door.

           O wags a finger.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Nuh, uh, uh. Not without the slips.

           Jason follows O’s finger as he points to a pair of WHITE 
           BUNNY slippers by Jason’s bed.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        They get mad if you don’t wear ‘em.

                                 JASON
                        Who gets mad?

                                 PRISCILLA (O.S.)
                        We do.

           Priscilla’s silhouette looms in the doorway. She steps 
           forward into the light. Reveals a big smile.

           She’s dressed in a sort of sexy headmaster’s outfit taken 
           straight from the 90s porno mag Jason drooled on. Ruler in 
           hand. She’s perky and jubilant in demeanor.

           Since when did Priscilla start smiling? At Jason?

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        And we just wanna make you happy 
                        and comfortable here at Anthemos.

           Jason ogles her. He can’t quite place her. It’s like part of 
           his memory is missing. O drools a bit.
                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Preparing for a tour?

                                 O
                        Yes, we are, Mrs. Priscilla.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Mind if I tag along? Give my two 
                        cents.

           Priscilla scrutinizes Jason. Studying him as he studies her.

                                 O
                        Nobody likes a sausage-fest anyway.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You’ll both find that we’re no 
                        strangers to sausage around here.

           Priscilla holds the door open. Pushes the Boys into...

           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - ANTHEMOS SPA - DAY

           As Jason leaves, he notices a BLANK PICTURE FRAME outside his 
           door. Next door, there’s another.

                                 O
                        That’s my room.

           Jason nods, as they ease down the hallway and pass by MUGSHOT-
           ESQUE PICTURES OF THE MISSING BLACK MEN on the doors. All 
           sport huge CHESHIRE GRINS.

           Jason and O follow as Priscilla ushers them along.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Here at Anthemos, pleasure is our 
                        only concern. Your pleasure. No 
                        matter what that may be. Each room 
                        allows for a different experience. 
                        Whether it’s physical...

           Priscilla opens Al’s door. Jason and O peek inside.

           INT. AL’S ROOM - ANTHEMOS SPA - DAY

           Al and another Missing Black Man have very rough and brutal 
           sex with Agatha. 

           Through the pleasure, Agatha winks at Jason.

           A MOUNTED DOG’S HEAD is perched above the bed’s headboard.
           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - DAY

           Jason cringes while O’s smile grows.

           Priscilla shuts the door.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        ...mental...

           Priscilla opens another door to a Missing Black Man’s room.

           INT. MISSING BLACK MAN'S ROOM - ANTHEMOS SPA - DAY

           A Stylist in black leather brandishes a whip in her hand 
           while another Missing Black Man is handcuffed to the bed and 
           gagged, She raises the whip.

           His eyes widen in terror. His MUFFLED SCREAMS. Genuine.

           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - DAY

           Priscilla closes the door gently.

           Jason’s brow tenses a bit. Worry. Fear.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        ...or fantasy...

           Muffled ROCK MUSIC emanates from behind the door.

           Jason reaches for the knob, but Priscilla stops him.

           She clears her throat. Forces a smile at the two of them.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        As much as like a man eager to 
                        please, this room is invite only.

                                 O
                        You a dog, my nigga.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You’ll get your invitation in time, 
                        but first, we need to know more 
                        about you and your fancy.

                                 JASON
                        How will we know?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You’ll feel it. Like a sudden 
                        uncontrollable urge.
                                 JASON
                        And, if not?

           Priscilla nods, then glances at Jason. O nudges his arm. 
           Jason holds a straight face. Locks eyes with Priscilla.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Feel free to explore.
                             (serious)
                        In fact, it’s required of you.
                             (playful again)
                        You, both, do want your stay to be 
                        comfortable here, right?

           Priscilla slaps her hand with the ruler. 

           O gulps, then nods. Jason glares at her. Unconvinced. 
           Priscilla breaks into a smile.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        O, do you mind showing Jason to the 
                        Mess Hall? 

           O runs ahead of Jason. He turns back.

           Jason finally breaks free from Priscilla’s sanguine smile. He 
           spots that same unnaturally huge smile on O’s face, too.

           Jason turns to the last door again. Contemplates it.

           Almost remembers something.

           Jason lets it go. He takes off after O.

           As they round the corner, Priscilla’s smile drops to a scowl.

           She passes through the last door into...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Priscilla closes the “Private” door. Sports the white coat.

           Thea moves arrhythmically to the tune while she places 
           medical implements on a metal table beside an unconscious 
           Meddy, who is strapped to a second table. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Turn that shit down.

           Thea lowers her radio.
                                 THEA
                        Sorry. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        The boys seem to be settling in 
                        nicely with the rest.

                                 THEA
                        That’s good. 

           Priscilla ambles past Thea to a bound, gagged Meddy. 

           Thea peeks over.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        What of this one?

                                 THEA
                        She’s not taking too well to the 
                        DMT, but I found these.

           Thea shows Meddy’s track marks. Priscilla’s eyes narrow.

           Priscilla rifles through Meddy’s things. Finds the syringe 
           and a small bottle. She reads it.

           “Dimethyltryptamine for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.”

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Poor girl micro-doses for PTSD.
                             (to Thea)
                        Double her dose.

                                 THEA
                        That could kill her.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Do you want to me to send you in 
                        there to give the animals free 
                        blowies and handies?

           Thea shakes her head “no.”

           Agatha eases through the “Private” door with a sensual grin.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        You almost look like you enjoy it.

                                 AGATHA
                        Who doesn’t like giving a hand job?

           She flicks a plastic glove into the trash.
                                 THEA
                        Everyone. Literally everyone.

                                 AGATHA
                        It’s sarcasm, Bitchy Mc-Cunt-Pants. 
                        Those drugged up mules can’t tell 
                        the difference between my hand and 
                        literally any other hole, anyway. 

           Meddy wakes violently. Wrestles with her restraints, breathes 
           heavily through a gag.

           The Sisters loom tall over Meddy as her head darts from 
           Sister to Sister to Sister.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Get me a syringe.

           Thea eyes her. Priscilla meets her gaze exasperated.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Ugh. Fine. Get the chloroform. But 
                        I swear to Zeus, if this doesn’t 
                        shut her up, you’re going in there 
                        next, Thea.

           Thea runs over to the metal tray. Grabs chloroform and a rag. 
           Passes them to Priscilla.

           Meddy’s eyes widen.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Hold her down.

           The tune rises.

           Meddy yanks the restraints. Fights for her life.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Still fighting to live in a world 
                        that steals from you.

           Priscilla pours some of the chloroform on the rag.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        That’s the crisis of this society.   
                        Everyone wants magic they can’t 
                        possess. They’ll kill for it.

           Meddy leers at Thea. Thea smirks.

           Priscilla glances at the colorful rendition of “The Scream.” 
           Waves her hand.
           The portrait morphs before Meddy’s eyes into a painted 
           rendition of “ODYSSEUS AND THE SIRENS.”

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        We were the magic ones once. The 
                        Greeks built amphitheaters just to 
                        hear our songs, but, by sharing our 
                        songs, the Greeks gained the 
                        ability to sing them. Thus making 
                        us causalities of society’s 
                        consumption. Reduced to stealing 
                        magic from others to sustain 
                        ourselves. But, now, they praise 
                        your “black girl magic.” 

           It lasts for a moment, before morphing again into a swirly, 
           oil-painted version of “A PORTRAIT OF A NEGRESS.”

           Meddy’s eyes widen in fear.

           Priscilla turns back to Meddy with the rag in hand.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        But with every strand of hair we 
                        curl, that magic spreads until it 
                        only sustains our family’s lives.

           In a flash, Priscilla covers Meddy’s mouth with it.

           Meddy lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM as her body convulses.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Be quiet, bitch! 

           Slowly, Meddy passes out.

           The Sisters step back from the table. 

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        She, clearly, likes it rough.

           Thea and Agatha LAUGH maniacally.

           INT. MESS HALL - ANTHEMOS SPA - DAY

           MEDDY’S SCREAM ECHOES throughout the white-tiled, drab Mess 
           Hall. Stylists serve food to the Missing Black Men. The 
           Stylists try to place the disembodied echo. 

           None of the Black Men respond to it, except Jason.
           The echo dances into Jason’s ears like a pained RINGING as he 
           and O wait in a conveyor belt, prison-like lunch line. Trays 
           in their hands. Jason rubs his temples.

                                 JASON
                        Do you hear that?

           O doesn’t respond. He focuses on the food like a trance. Dons 
           a huge smile. Jason gets closer to his shoulder.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        O?

           Jason places a hand on his shoulder. Shakes him.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        O!

           O snaps out of it. Shakes his head and blinks his eyes as he 
           looks around the room. Stops when his eyes land on Jason.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        That sound. Did you hear it?

                                 O
                        You trippin’, bruh. Get some grub. 
                        Gotta carb-o-load for these hoes

           Jason watches O. Something’s off. He turns back to the hall.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        They got fire noods ‘round here.

           Jason turns back to O. Furrows his brow.

                                 JASON
                        Nudes?

                                 O
                        Naw, noods.

           Noodles PLOP onto his tray. Marinara meat sauce cascades 
           after the noodles. A CRAB MEATBALL SPLATS on top. 

                                 JASON
                        That looks like Leon’s. Even got 
                        the crab meatballs.

           Jason surveys the Mess Hall. The Black Men gawk at him with 
           cheshire grins. Jason gulps. Plays it cool. O eases off.

           AT A BOOTH

           Jason eases in. O drops into the seat in front of him.
           Jason raises an eyebrow as O massacres his plate of food with 
           his hands and face.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Ease up. Nobody’s gonna take it 
                        from you.

           O lifts up. Marinara sauce drips from his face like blood.

           A Stylist, in a white short skirt and tight top built to 
           expose one thing or two, glides by with a spice shaker. 

                                 STYLIST #1
                        Oregano?

                                 JASON
                        Um, yeah. Sure.

           Jason’s eyes dart away from O and up to the Stylist as she 
           sprinkles oregano on his pasta, but Jason still won’t eat.

           Instead, he watches O eat. Animalistic. It’s gross.

           Jason loses his appetite. Pushes his tray forward, then his 
           splitting headache strikes again. Jason struggles with it.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Shit--Man, I’m not feeling good. 
                        I’m gonna go back to my room--

           O snatches his hand.

                                 O
                        Before sampling the party favors?

           O raises an eyebrow at the Stylist.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Gotta find your fancy, after all.

           Jason looks around at the CHESHIRE GRINS that gawk at him. 
           Gulps. Plays it cool, then spots Al leaving with a Stylist.

                                 JASON
                        Then, hopefully, my fancy is 
                        wandering the halls, too.

           O watches Jason leave after Al. Flares his nostrils.

           INT. LEON'S HOUSE - DAY

           Leon SNORES himself awake on the couch. Surveys the house. 
           Spots his apology spaghetti still on the island. Rises.
           Leon trudges over to Jason’s closed bedroom door.

           KNOCK! KNOCK!

                                 LEON
                        Hey, Jason. Ya in there?

           Leon looks at the back wall. Smiles and nods at the pictures 
           of Theresa. Glances to the bucket. Then SIGHS.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming in.

           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Leon eases into the room.

                                 LEON
                        Specs?

           Leon scratches his bare head.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Huh.

           The picture of Theresa bites its nails.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN COOLCHITOWN - DAY

           The purples, oranges, and pinks of sunrise fill the sky.

           Leon shoves his key into the barbershop’s door. Eases into...

           INT. UNCLE LEON’S BARBERSHOP - DAY

           He sets a coat on the rack. Passes his station.

           Leon looks around. Disappointed.

           One of the lamps won’t turn on. Leon SMACKS it to no avail.

                                 LEON
                        Dammit. Not this thing too.

           Leon grabs a broom.

           Sweeps for a bit, then cleans the mirrors, smiles at his 
           reflection, then spots more grime. Wipes it.

           Leon cleans some trimmers. He drops one. Breaks it. Stares at 
           the broken clippers with a calm anger. Forces a smile.
           He flips the sign to open.

           Leon sits dejected in his chair. Pulls out the tupperware of 
           spaghetti. Munches it while he channel surfs static.

           CHRINNNGG!

           Harold and Percy slip in the door.

                                 HAROLD
                        Sorry we’re late.

           Leon struggles with the busted TV. Gives up on the remote.

                                 LEON
                        Can’t one of y’all fix something? 
                        Damn lamp’s on the fritz now, too.

           Percy stands on his chair. Studies the cords behind the TV.

                                 HAROLD
                        Let me see that.

           Harold takes the remote inspects it. Leon watches them.

                                 LEON
                        Either of y’all seen Specs?

                                 PERCY
                        No, I’m sure he’s all right.

           Percy gives the TV a good smack. “FRIDAY” pops on. Right 
           where it left off.

                                 PERCY (CONT’D)
                        Got it!

           Harold gazes out as Shoppers ease past the window dressed in 
           TWEED JACKETS’ WHITE BLOUSES, TRILBY HATS, LONG FLOWING 
           DRESSES. All from another era. PLANTATION OWNERS.

                                 HAROLD
                        Oh, to have the balls of a cracker.

           Percy nods in agreement, then jumps down from his chair.

           Leon studies Hair’s storefront. Sees Vultures on the roof.

           A Vulture flies down to O’s car parked out front of Hair. 
           Leon watches as the Vulture lands on it. Tenses.

                                 LEON
                        It ain’t like him.
                                 PERCY
                        He’s probably just doing the good 
                        old walk of shame.

                                 LEON
                        Jason? Doin’ a walk of shame? Trust 
                        me, we’d sooner see a pig fry.

                                 HAROLD
                        It’s fly.

                                 LEON
                        What?

                                 HAROLD
                        The phrase. It’s “we’d sooner see a 
                        pig fly.” Like “if pigs could fly?”

                                 LEON
                        Harold, I--just watch the store. 
                        Imma have a word with the 
                        competition.

           Leon walks out the door across the street toward Hair.

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           The Sisters stare at Meddy.

           CHRINGG CHRINGG!

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Shit. 

           Priscilla whips her head around. Checks her watch.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Stay here.

           Thea nods. Agatha WHINES.

                                 AGATHA
                        You always get the first one!

                                 PRISCILLA
                        If father heard your whining, he 
                        wouldn’t be pleased, sister. Now, 
                        get back in there and earn our 
                        immortality.

           Agatha SMACKS a piece of gum as Priscilla slips out.
           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Leon wanders around the shop curiouser and curiouser. The 
           Bronze Bull captures his attention. He gazes into his own 
           reflection in the water beneath it.

           Slowly, Priscilla’s face creeps into the watery reflection.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Ahem.

                                 LEON
                        Nice sculpture ya got here.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        It was a gift from Greece.

           Leon narrows his eyes confused.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Our family formulated the Sauce and 
                        other useful creations there, ages 
                        ago. Some still reside in its 
                        rustic mountains to this day.

                                 LEON
                        And others?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Elsewhere.

                                 LEON
                        Damn, that’s craaaaazy.
                             (clears throat)
                        Well, speaking of family, seen my 
                        nephew around?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Nephew?

                                 LEON
                        He works here. Jason Williams.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Oh, we love Jason.

                                 LEON
                        I’m sure you do.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        But I’m sorry. It’s just us.

                                 LEON
                        Us?
                                 PRISCILLA
                        My sisters and I. And, now, you.

           Leon checks the place out. Tries to look around Priscilla but 
           she counters every move, blocking his vision.

           Leon spots a rack full of the PURPLE SHAMPOO BOTTLES. Eases 
           over past Priscilla. Bumps her shoulder. 

                                 LEON
                        So this is the little bottle that’s 
                        caught the town by storm.

           Leon reaches for a bottle. 

           CRUNCH!!!

           He glances down. 

           A broken shard from the glass jar of Barbicide. 

           Leon’s eyes widen as he notices the blood on the floor and 
           duffel bags full of cash nearby.

           Behind him, Priscilla narrows hers.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        What is--

           In a mad dash, Priscilla puts Leon in a headlock.

           Leon struggles as Priscilla holds his neck. Rips a tuft of 
           her hair from her head.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Fuck!

           Priscilla lets him go.

                                 LEON
                        Been snatchin’ wigs since ‘76, 
                        bitch. Ain’t nothing for me to--

           Leon raises his hand, but the hair isn’t there.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        I coulda sworn I...

           He opens his palm.

           BLACK FEATHERS.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        What the--
           Leon glances up and manages to squeeze a YELP out before 
           Priscilla swings a wicked fast right hook. He’s out cold.

           Priscilla looks to the back room, then to the shimmering 
           Bronze Bull in the morning light.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Thea, drain old Bessie!

           A GROAN reverberates from the back room.

           The water beneath the Bronze Bull GURGLES as it swirls down 
           the fountain’s drain.

           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - DAY

           Jason holds his head as he cautiously eases down the hallway 
           after Al and the Stylist. Traces doorknobs with his hands.

           WHITE LIGHT BEAMS in as the Stylist opens the “Private” door 
           for Al. Offers him a WHITE CLAY MASK shaped like a BULLDOG.

           MOANS...SHRIEKS...DEAFENING SCREAMS...

           Al puts the mask on, then, hesitantly, enters. The Stylist 
           follows. The door SLAMS shut behind them.

           The SCREAMS die down...until silence.

           Jason closes his eyes. Focuses on hearing.

           Down the hall, in a BLANK PICTURE FRAME near the door to AL’s 
           room, Al’s MUGSHOT WITH A CHESHIRE GRIN fades into existence.

           Jason never notices it as his hand pauses mere inches from 
           the doorknob to Hair’s Private Room.

           Jason opens his eyes. His headache subsided. He studies the 
           knob. Almost turns it when--

           FEMININE GIGGLES...

           FEET PATTER on the wood...

                                 JASON
                        Hello.

           More GIGGLES...

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Who’s there?

           Jason whips to a corner of the hallway.
           A HAND slinks around the corner, then it SLAPS firm on the 
           wall. The hand beckons him

           Jason narrows his eyes. Hesitant.

           The hand disappears around the corner.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Wait! 

           Jason runs after it. As he rounds the corner, a door further 
           down the hallway slowly closes.

           More GIGGLES...

           Shut.

           Jason creeps down the hallway. Contemplates the door. 

           Unlike the mugshots, there’s a picture of a Vulture with a 
           TWISTED NECK beside it.

           Reaches for the knob. Thinks twice.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?

                                 MANGLED SIREN (O.S.)
                             (sing-song-ish)
                        That’s my phone...

                                 JASON
                        What?

                                 MANGLED SIREN(O.S.)
                             (louder)
                        That’s my phone...

           Jason pulls away from the door. Studies the knob.

           He reaches for it. Closer...closer...

                                 JASON
                        That’s my phone? Is my--

           O saunters past the corner hand in hand with a Stylist. Eases 
           her into his room.

                                 O
                        Jason. Check it.

           Jason turns to O as O humps the air.
                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Trapped a live one in there?

                                 JASON
                        You know it.

           O closes his door while flicking his tongue between two 
           fingers at Jason.

           Jason EXHALES. Glances down for a moment, then back.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Look, if you’ve got my phone--

                                 MANGLED SIREN
                        That’s my phone!

           In a split second, the door bursts open. 

           A MANGLED SIREN, super thin Stylist with the a body covered 
           in patchy black feathers, scaly feet, a hag’s head, and 
           bloody beak, snatches Jason’s leg from the hallway.

           Shackles CLINK and CLANK into the darkness of the room. They 
           cling to the Mangled Siren’s ankles.

                                 JASON
                        Jesus!

           Jason SCREAMS. Kicks the Mangled Siren as it bites his leg.

                                 THE MANGLED SIREN
                        That’s my phone you fucking bird! 
                        That’s my phone--

           Jason launches a heel into her face. Stuns her.

           He rockets to his feet. SLAMS the door shut.

           Behind it, the Mangled Siren scratches. GRUNTS. Animalistic.

           Jason sees the picture by the door. Something dawns on him.

                                 JASON
                        The vulture from the--it’s a--this 
                        can’t be real.

           Jason gazes down the hallway at the door to Hair’s Private 
           Room. His eyes widen. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        O.

           Jason takes off down the hallway.
           INT. O’S ROOM - ANTHEMOS SPA - DAY

           O’s room is identical to Jason’s in every way. He even has a 
           STUFFED TAXIDERMY SNOW CRAB above his headboard.

           Jason bursts through the door while O smooches the Stylist.

                                 O
                        The fuck, man?

           Jason grabs O’s clothes from the floor. Throws them to him.

                                 JASON
                        Get dressed. We need to go. Now.

                                 O
                        You’re killing the vibe.

                                 JASON
                        Just trust me, we need to go. This 
                        place isn’t right.

           O goes to his nightstand. Grabs a cup of the Murky Liquid.

                                 O
                        Just take another swig--

                                 JASON
                        No, nigga! I just got attacked by a 
                        fucking--a fucking--fuck I don’t 
                        even what to call that shit!

                                 O
                        But the spa--

                                 JASON
                        There’s a bird out there with a 
                        fucking human body! We need to 
                        fucking go!

           The Stylist TWEAKS on the bed. She’s having a seizure.

           Jason glances over, which gives O enough time to slip a BLACK 
           BURLAP BAG from one of his pants’ pockets.

                                 O
                        I’m not leaving. Neither are you.

           As Jason turns back, O throws the bag over Jason’s face. 
           Jason kicks, SCREAMS, and flails to no avail.

           O suplexes Jason onto the ground, then drags him out of the 
           room as Jason struggles. The Stylist smiles. Rises. A ruse.
           INT. JASON'S ROOM - DAY

           O tears the bag from Jason’s head. Cloudy. Out of focus.

           The Stylist binds Jason’s arms and legs to the bedposts.

                                 JASON
                        Let me go!

           The Stylist tightens the knots. Jason’s going nowhere.

           O sits in a chair by Jason’s bed. Watches him.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Get me out of here!

           Jason pulls on the ropes. Tests them. Taut. His breaths 
           heavy, labored. 

                                 O
                        You want to know the secret 
                        ingredient to the Sauce? 
                             (scoffs)
                        You’re about to find out.

                                 JASON
                        Fuck the secret! They’re using us.

                                 O
                        It feels nice to be needed.

           A sanguine smile consumes O’s face.

           BANG! BANG! BANG!

           Methodical. Metallic THUDS blast into the room from the door.

                                 O (CONT’D)
                        Come in.

           CLANK!

           The door to his room swings open.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I hear you’ve been experiencing... 
                        low testosterone, Mr. Williams.

           Priscilla, dressed in her full white trench coat and plague 
           doctor’s mask, saunters into the room. The coat and hood now 
           lightly bloodied.

           She nods to the Stylist. The Stylist leaves the room.
                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Allow me to, cure your affliction.

           The Stylist returns with a blanketed metal tray.

           A WHITE CLAY VULTURE MASK now covers her face. 

           Jason’s eyes widen at the masks. Creepy.

           SCALPELS, CLAMPS, SURGERY/TORTURE ACCOUTREMENT RATTLE 
           underneath the blanket on the metal tray.

           Priscilla swipes a clipboard from the base of the bed. She 
           “tsk, tsk, tsk’s.” RIPS the white blanket from the tray.

                                 JASON
                        Jesus Christ!

           Glass cases surround TWO JUGUM PENIS’, a medieval bear trap 
           for your junk, alongside other implements.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Quite a sick one, here. Strap the 
                        poor “man” up.

           The Stylist ambles to Jason. Holds his legs still as he 
           fights and kicks at the Stylist.

           O’s hand glides over the tray. Lifts a Jugum Penis.

                                 JASON
                        What the fuck is that?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Part of the cure to your...ailment.

                                 JASON
                        Ailment?

           Priscilla takes the contraption.

           O curtsies. Imitates the “ORIGINAL JIM CROW.”

           Jason struggles with the Stylist as Priscilla straps the 
           Jugum Penis around Jason’s waist. Tucks his junk inside of it 
           like cheese in a mousetrap.

           The Stylist backs away as Priscilla rifles through the 
           equipment on the gurney.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I’m perfectly fine. See this whole 
                        thing is just a misunderstanding--
                                 PRISCILLA
                        Low testosterone is nothing to be 
                        ashamed of, but to maximize your 
                        stay and cure you, I need to remove 
                        your sperm glands. A simple surgery 
                        that will only impair your little 
                        buddy for an hour or so.  

           Priscilla pulls out a pair of rubber gloves. 

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        We need your sperm, and your 
                        ailment prevents you from falling 
                        under our spell and giving it 
                        freely. So I’m obliged to take it.

           Jason fights the binds as hard as he can.

           Priscilla “tsk, tsk, tsk’s.”

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        You might set it off.

           His eyes land on the Jugum Penis around his junk.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        The surgery is delicate. Quite 
                        delicate. I need absolute stillness 
                        while I work in your. Regions.

           The Stylist grabs the other Jugum Penis from the tray. Hands 
           it to Priscilla along with a CARROT.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        I must take precautions not to 
                        endanger the patient’s sperm gland. 
                        Move too much and...

           Priscilla inserts the carrot into the larger Jugum Penis. The 
           claw CRUNCHES through the carrot. Absolutely shreds it.

           Jason’s jaw drops as the splintered top part of the carrot 
           falls to the bedroom floor.

           Priscilla glances at O.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        You should leave, my dear boy. Your 
                        services are no longer required. 

           O nods. Eases over to Priscilla. Gives her Jason’s keys.
                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        I hope you’ll find your. Severance 
                        package. Adequate.

                                 JASON
                        Help me, O.

           O leaves. SLAMS the door shut. Jason sheds a fearful tear. 
           Priscilla SNAPS her glove.

           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - DAY

           O eases away from Jason’s door.

           Stylists line the hallway. Each wears a different WHITE CLAY 
           VULTURE MASK. Each one unique to its wearer.

           At the end of the line, Agatha stands between them with a 
           mask of her own, an ORNATE VULTURE with her unmistakable red 
           lipstick. In her hands, she holds another mask. O’s.

           O saunters uneasily up to Agatha. 

                                 AGATHA
                        Our faith in you was well placed.

           She presents the mask to O.

           A WHITE SNOW CRAB.

           O takes it.

                                 AGATHA (CONT’D)
                        Now, please. Enjoy.

           Agatha motions to the “Private” room. Opens the door.

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

           After a FLASH of WHITE LIGHT, the Stylists pull O inside the 
           room. A riptide of debauchery. O grins. This is his peace.

           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - DAY

           Agatha closes the door after them. Grins. She turns down the 
           hall to O’s room.

           A MUGSHOT of O with a CHESHIRE GRIN materializes behind the 
           blank picture frame by his door.

           She turns back to the door to the Private Room. Eases out.
           INT. JASON’S IMMACULATE BEDROOM - DAY

           Priscilla brandishes a syringe. Flicks it.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Now, just a little prick, and we’ll 
                        get started.

           Jason tenses and struggles, then glances at his crotch. He 
           doesn’t want to trip the jugum penis, so he surrenders.

                                 JASON
                        Prick me, and I’ll kill you.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Sweet dreams.

           Priscilla smirks, then injects him. Jason slowly, then 
           rapidly drifts off.

           INT/EXT. THERESA’S CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Younger Jason glances out the driver’s side window. Blood 
           drips on the outside around the crack left by Theresa’s head.

           Outside on the ground, Theresa barely breathes while an 
           OFFICER (30s), white, kneels on her spine. 

                                 YOUNGER JASON
                        Mom?

           Behind him, YOUNGER MEDDY (17) snaps to while sitting shotty.

                                 YOUNGER MEDDY
                        Drive, Jason! We need to--

           CRACK!

           The Officer smashes her face with a baton. A fatal blow. The 
           Officer rises up, then glances to the window.

           Jason shifts the car into gear. Leaves the Officer behind.

           INT. JASON'S IMMACULATE ROOM - DAY

           Jason’s teary eyes open. He surveys the room, while Priscilla 
           cleans her implements at a sink.

           Jason’s locks on a bloody mass of flesh. His SPERM GLANDS.

                                 JASON
                        Go...
           Adrenaline PUMPS through Jason’s veins. He bites onto his 
           blanket. He winces as he dislocates his left thumb. 

           Carefully, Jason snakes his free hand down to his junk. 
           Slides the Jugum Penis off. Unties himself.

           Priscilla finally turns the water off. Pops her coat.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You performed marvelously, Mr. 
                        Williams, as expected.

           Jason stands on top of the bed. Blood trickles down his leg 
           onto the white blanket. Not a lot. He raises the Jugum Penis.

                                 JASON
                        You ain’t seen nothing yet.

           Jason shoves the Jugum Penis into an eye socket of the mask. 
           Priscilla SCREAMS as her eyeball bursts like a tomato. Leaks 
           blood like a trail of spilt marinara sauce.

           Jason snatches the keys of the metal tray. Opens his door.

           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - DAY

           An alarm BLARES as Jason runs as fast as his pained body can.

           From his doorway, Priscilla rises. Brandishes her buzzsaw. 

           RNNNNNNNNNNN!

           Jason turns a corner. Only more doors with mugshots. Turns 
           another corner. The same. It’s a loop. As he plots his next 
           move, Priscilla swings down toward him, but Jason dodges it. 
           He races to O’s room. 

                                 JASON
                        Come on. Come on!

           Jason shoves the key in, then pushes through.

           INT. O’S ROOM - DAY

           O reaches out for an appalled Jason in the doorway.

           He lies in an MEDIEVAL IRON BED with his shins cut in half. 
           Mask still on his face. Blood spurts on the floor.

           Stylists eat his feet.

           The door SLAMS shut.
           INT. LONG WOODED HALLWAY - DAY

           RNNNNNNN!

           Priscilla slashes down.

           Jason collapses to the ground to dodge it. Crab walks 
           backwards until he hits a door.

           He glances up.

           It’s the Mangled Siren’s door. 

           He smirks.

           Priscilla creeps closer...closer..closer--

           Jason BANGS on the door.

           The Mangled Siren throws the door open. Lunges at Jason, but 
           he rolls out of the way just in time for Priscilla to take 
           the brunt of the Mangled Siren’s wanton attack.

           He makes a break for the door to the Private Room while they 
           fight each other.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Get off me! He’ll get away--

           Jason turns back as the Mangled Siren comes to her senses, 
           but she’s too far down the hall to reach him. She SCREECHES, 
           then sprints after him.

                                 JASON
                        Fuck your invitation.

           Jason shoves the key in. Steps into a white light.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

           The white light subsides as Jason breathes heavily, then 
           surveys the room.

           The Missing Black Men have been corralled like cattle to the 
           edges of the room and attached to a piston-like machine on 
           the wall. Pants at their ankles. Lots of SEXUAL MOANING.

           Bowls labeled “THE SAUCE” between their feet.

           Many of the Men are thin and malnourished. Some have 
           collapsed on the floor from exhaustion or death. 
           Others feast on Priscilla.

           SCREAMS. Carnage. Blood. A dog pile of monstrous proportions.

           Stylists dance amongst the orgy unaffected by Priscilla in a 
           drug-fueled trance.

           An analog clock blinks.

           13:27PM.

           Jason glances at his hands hardly able to move his fingers. 
           Slowly, he gains muscle control.

                                 JASON
                        Come on.

           With strain, Jason yanks his junk out of the machine...

           ...then keels over in pain.

           He holds his stomach. Blood seeps down his pant leg.

           Through a grimace, Jason sneaks a peek at the door, then back 
           to the carnage. He looks for O.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get us out of here.

           Jason frantically creeps around the room, careful to avoid 
           the Stylists. He investigates the Men.

           SNAP!

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Give me something.

           Jason snaps his fingers in one Man’s face. No response. Not 
           even from his extremely large and dilated pupils.

           Jason backs away and bumps into a Stylist.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Shit--

           Jason covers his mouth. The Stylist collapses.

           No one responds to Jason. To them, he isn’t there.

           Jason spots O. Races over.

           O has already withered to bones and muscly sinews. Atrophy 
           eats him by the second.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Wake up, O!

           SNAP! SNAP! SNAP!

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Wake the fuck up!

           Jason shakes O.

           CRACK!!!

           O’s spine breaks in half from the pressure.

           Jason jumps back, mortified.

           O’s body crumples and contorts, for a moment, then suddenly--

           His eyes SNAP open to the WHITES.

           O lunges at Jason like a spider.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ!

           They all heard that. On cue, ALL of the Men’s eyes SNAP open 
           to the WHITES.

           Jason hobbles to the door. GROANS. Grits his teeth.

           Stylists grab hold of Jason just before he gets to the door. 
           He fights them off, but their hold is strong.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Let go!

           He breaks away for a second. Sprints unevenly to the door.

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           The lights FLICKER and BUZZ.

           Something DARK and FAST plays such as “PAINT IT BLACK” by The 
           Rolling Stones.

           Agatha sits. Faces away from the door. She watches over Meddy 
           with her headphones on. Swipes through an ESSENCE MAGAZINE. 
           Chews on gum.

           The oil painting of a “Portrait of a Negress” has shifted 
           back to its normal hyperrealistic art style.

           The door behind Agatha swings open.
           Jason struggles in the doorway as Stylists hold him back. He 
           reaches out for something. Anything.

           Agatha blows a bubble. It POPS. She’s disappointed.

           The door SLAMS shut again.

           Agatha takes a headphone off. Turns to the door. Narrows her 
           eyes. Shrugs. Turns back to Meddy and her magazine.

           Agatha’s eyes widen as she flips a page.

                                 AGATHA
                        Oh my.

           She rotates the magazine. A SMALL SLIVER in the center of the 
           page unfolds until it hangs to her knees. 

                                 AGATHA (CONT’D)
                        His blood circulation must be 
                        irregular.

           Meddy’s leg moves a little. Agatha doesn’t notice.

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

           Jason struggles with the Stylists. He swats their arms.

                                 JASON
                        Fuck off!

           CLINK!

           Priscilla’s buzzsaw skitters across the ground. 

           Jason spots it. He stretches.

           Closer...Closer...Closer...

           Got it.

           Jason flicks it on--

           RNNNNNNNNNNN!

           Jason exhales, then saws at the Stylists.

           Stylists SCREECH and crumple as he HACKS through them.

           Blood flies all over Jason and the walls.

           An absolutely gory mess of bodies, innards, and hair.
           Jason glances at Priscilla’s still arm underneath the 
           feasting malnourished Men.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        How’s my stock rubbing you now?

           Jason staggers to the door. Cracks it open.

           THROUGH THE CRACK

           Agatha admires her magazine.

           Meddy is deathly still.

           Jason slowly opens the door.

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           He creeps toward Agatha...

           But she’s disappeared. Just the LONE BLACK FEATHER floats 
           down to where she was sitting.

           Jason stands upright. Confused. 

           He notices a Vulture, now, overlooking Meddy. It cocks its 
           head at him.

                                 JASON
                        What. The.

           He rushes to Meddy, but, as he gets closer, the Vulture 
           swoops down and TRANSFORMS into Agatha, but the only thing 
           recognizable is her red lipstick. 

           Her body has aged decades in seconds. Decrepit. Black 
           feathers protrude from her skin. Long, razor sharp talons 
           extend from her hands. 

           Her TRUE SIREN form.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           Jason jumps out of the way of Agatha’s slash. Barely misses.

           He manages to cut her arm with the buzzsaw...

           ...but it barely affects her.

           CAWWWW!!!!!

           Agatha grabs his throat in her talons. Raises him in the air.
                                 AGATHA
                        Cash cows don’t escape the pen.
                             (brandishes her free claw)
                        Guess I’ll have to--

           Behind Agatha, Meddy rises with a can of hairspray in one 
           hand and a lighter in the other. 

                                 MEDDY
                             (extremely loopy)
                        Somebody request roast bitch?

           Meddy nearly falls as she flicks the lighter and, then sprays 
           the hairspray creating a mini flamethrower.

           Agatha jumps back. Lets go of Jason.

           But she doesn’t avoid the fiery plume. Agatha SCREAMS as 
           she’s, literally, cooked inside and out.

           Jason watches Meddy in awe as Agatha collapses to the ground.  
           Most of her feathers are either scorched or plain melted. 
           She’s dead as fuck though.

           Jason and Meddy look at each other, then back to the body.

                                 JASON
                        That is the weirdest looking 
                        chicken head I’ve ever seen.

           Meddy studies all of the blood covering Jason. 

           Glances past him at the blood trail from the Private Room.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Best not to go in there.

           Meddy’s perplexed gaze falls back on Jason.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        They had us trapped in some sort of 
                        group hallucination.

           Meddy looks over to the metal gurney. The bottle.

                                 MEDDY
                        The DMT. That’s why I’m out here. 
                        I’m too tolerant.

           Jason glances at the track marks on her arm.

                                 JASON
                        That’s what you shoot up with?
           Meddy thinks, then exhales.

                                 MEDDY
                        I don’t shoot up. Mine’s 
                        prescribed, too, asshole.

           Jason studies her.

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        I was diagnosed with PTSD after 
                        your Mom’s...That’s why I couldn’t 
                        come to the funeral. Why I had to 
                        leave. The day your Mom died, I 
                        died, too.

           Jason studies Meddy. He’s sullen. Never considered her pain 
           prior to now.

                                 JASON
                        Then that makes two of us.

           He gently grabs her hand.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t plan on dying with you 
                        a second time.

           Meddy smiles.

           BANG! BANG! BANG!

                                 THEA (O.S.)
                        Just finished loading Old Bessie!

           Jason and Meddy whip to each other.

                                 MEDDY
                        Old Bessie?

                                 JASON
                        Do you still have your phone?

           Meddy checks her pockets. Nothing.

                                 MEDDY
                        They must have taken it.

                                 JASON
                        We need to call for help.

           BANG! BANG! BANG! 
                                 THEA (O.S.)
                        Agatha?

           Slowly, they glance down to Agatha’s body. 

           Jason turns back to Meddy.

                                 MEDDY
                        No.

                                 JASON
                        I mean--

                                 MEDDY
                        I’m not touching that thing.

                                 JASON
                        You killed it.

           Meddy studies the charred body. Gulps.

           Jason watches as Meddy cringes and bends down. 

           She fishes through what must be Agatha’s pockets. Winces. 
           Pulls out a cellphone. Passes it to Jason.

                                 MEDDY
                        How the fuck do we even explain 
                        this to the cops? They’re like--
                        like--actual fucking monsters.

           Jason thinks, then dials a phone number.

           INT. UNCLE LEON'S BARBERSHOP - DAY

           Harold bleeds out on the floor as the shop’s phone RINGS. 

           Percy crawls toward the phone leaving his own blood trail 
           across the linoleum. He reaches for the phone--

           Yates smashes his hand with a CRUNCH under his boot heel, 
           then kicks him across the face. Picks up the phone.

                                 JASON (O.S.)
                        Leon! My boss kidnapped me and held 
                        me captive in Hair. I need help.

           Yates mouths the word “talk” to Percy, but Percy won’t.

           Yates grinds his boot on Percy’s hand. Percy WHINES in pain.

                                 JASON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Leon?
           Yates whips a gun out. Motions for Percy to talk again.

           Percy glances up. Knows he’s facing death.

                                 PERCY
                        Leon’s on his way over, Specs.

                                 JASON (O.S.)
                        Percy?

                                 PERCY
                        Yeah. Everything’s gonna be aight.

           Yates ends the call.

                                 YATES
                        Thanks, darkie.

                                 PERCY
                        Even your racial epithets are bald.

                                 YATES
                             (mockingly)
                        “Your racial epithets are bald.” At 
                        least I got a face, nigger.

           BANG!

           Yates shoots Percy in the face, then pockets his gun, chugs 
           from his jug of water, then eases out of the shop. Whistles 
           to an aged, racist tune.

           Blood leaks from Percy’s obliterated face.

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           Jason glances at the phone.

                                 JASON
                        My uncle’s on his way here.

                                 MEDDY
                        What now?

           Jason glances around the room. His eyes land on a bookshelf.

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Water around the Bull boils. The midsection of the Bull 
           closes down like butterfly doors around an unconscious Leon.

           Thea paces outside the Back Room door.
                                 THEA
                        Agatha, I--

           BZZZZ! BZZZZ! 

           Thea answers her phone.

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Yes, father?

           Thea’s eyes widen.

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           Meddy and Jason brace the door with the bookshelf. Purple 
           bottles of shampoo spill out of it.

                                 THEA (O.S.)
                        Great! Just fucking great!

           They look at each other. Frantically, get back to work.

           CHIKKA! CHIKKA! CHIKKA!

           The door knob twists, but it’s locked.

                                 THEA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Open this door, heathens!

           THUNK!

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           On the other side of the door, Thea, now transformed into her 
           gross decrepit true SIREN form rams the door with a shoulder.

                                 THEA
                        Let me in!

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           THUNK!

           Dust cascades from the door as it cracks. The bookshelf 
           inches further and further away with every strike.

                                 MEDDY
                        This door isn’t gonna hold!

           Jason paces. Thinks. Runs his hands through his hair. Calms. 
           Glances to the shampoo bottles on the floor. Smirks. An idea.

                                 JASON
                        Let her in.

                                 MEDDY
                        You must still be high.

                                 JASON
                        No, I have an idea.

           Jason picks up two shampoo bottles.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Trust me...You watch World Star, 
                        right?

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Thea braces for one last ram.

           3...2...1!

           She races toward the door, but it swings open to...

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           ...a slip n’ slide-esque stream of shampoo lies on the floor.

                                 THEA
                        No, no, no!

           Thea tries to pump the brakes, but it’s too late.

           She glides past Jason and Meddy. Swipes at them but misses. 

           She falls forward. 

           Scorpion slides across the shampoo stream chin first.

           SLOW MOTION: Shampoo ramps up her chin into her mouth.

           CRACK!!!

           BACK TO NORMAL: Thea collides with the back wall. Her neck 
           snaps on impact. Definitely dead.

           Jason grabs Meddy.

                                 JASON
                        Run!
           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

           The gaggle of Missing Men chomp on Priscilla.

           Her still arm twitches.

           She’s VERY MUCH SO ALIVE.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Enough!

           In one powerful YELL, Priscilla EXPLODES up and throws the 
           glorified scavengers all over the small room. She winces as 
           her wounds heal. She waltzes into...

           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           Priscilla surveys the absolute horror. Both of her Sisters. 
           Dead. She leers at the open door.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Ja...

           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Lights FLICKER, SWING, and BUZZ.

                                 PRISCILLA (O.S.)
                        ...son!!!!

           Jason and Meddy run through the hallway into the main room.

           The stomach of the Bull burns a bright red.

           Leon SCREAMS inside of it.

                                 MEDDY
                        Oh my god.

                                 JASON
                        Leon?

                                 LEON (O.S.)
                        Specs? They cookin’ my ass!

           INT. THE BULL - DAY

           Leon boils alive inside the Bull.

                                 LEON
                        I’m never makin’ meatballs again!
           INT. HAIR - DAY

           Jason touches the bull. Rips his hand away.

                                 JASON
                        Fuck!

           Meddy’s antsy.

                                 MEDDY
                        Jason, we gotta--

                                 PRISCILLA (O.S.)
                        You insufferable mortals.

           Jason and Meddy gawk at Priscilla. Blood all over her. A 
           severed head in her hands.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        Sirens are hard to kill. 

                                 JASON
                        Your sisters must have missed that 
                        memo.

           Priscilla’s nostrils flare.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        My sisters were weak.

                                 JASON
                        Shame.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You could have been a great 
                        addition to the Sauce.

                                 JASON
                        You milk black dudes for jizz. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        And none of them complained.

           Meddy’s eyes dart between the both of them.

                                 MEDDY
                        Say what now?

                                 JASON
                        Long story, just get my Uncle out 
                        of that bull.

           Meddy nods. Spots a towel at a Stylist’s station.
           Priscilla whips out her razor sharp talons.

           Jason snatches the shitty broom.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Bring it, you feather-headed bitch.

           Meddy races to the towel

           Priscilla jumps at her. Jason intercepts Priscilla.

           CRACK!

           Jason smacks her across the face with the broom. Breaks it.

           He smirks. Now, he has something sharp, too.

           Priscilla stretches her jaw.

           CAWWW!

           She seemingly flies to strike him with her talons, but he 
           defends with the broom.

           Behind them, Meddy wraps the towel around her hands. A 
           makeshift mitten. Opens the bull.

           Inside, Leon struggles to breathe.

           Jason glances over at Leon with concern, then--

           WHACK!

           Priscilla smacks him across the face with a talon. Draws 
           blood and knocks him to the ground.

           The broom handle flies across the floor.

           Jason and Priscilla both find the broom. Priscilla smirks as 
           Jason attempts to crawl over.

           Priscilla grabs his pants leg. Pulls his pants down. Jason 
           pulls his pants up as Priscilla jumps on top of him. 
           Strangles him.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Shouldn’t have left the pen!

           Priscilla LAUGHS maniacally.

           Jason struggles to breathe. He looks around for something. 
           Anything. He reaches for the broom. It’s too far but...

           ...he looks at his hand, there’s some shampoo on it.
           An idea.

           Jason focuses on Priscilla’s face. Waits for her to open her 
           mouth nice and wide, then SHOVES his hand inside.

           Priscilla chokes. Lets go of Jason for a split second.

           Jason slips away. Grabs the broom.

           SHIKKKK!

           Jason stabs Priscilla, who catches the point with her taloned 
           palm, but the sharp end goes THROUGH her hand.

           Jason forces the broom into Priscilla’s ribs. Pins her hand 
           to her body.

           Priscilla YELPS. Collapses to her knees in agony.

           Meddy tends to Leon. Jason jogs over.

                                 JASON
                        Easy, easy.

                                 MEDDY
                        He’s still breathing.

                                 JASON
                        Good.

           Priscilla rises to her feet on the other side of the Bull.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        That was a clever little trick.

           Jason looks up as Priscilla yanks her hand from her side. 

           She spits up a bit of blood, but her body’s already healing.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        But not enough.

           CRINNNNG!

           Jason and Meddy turn around to see Sheriff Yates.

           Yates trains his gun on Priscilla who raises her hands.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Is everyone okay?

                           JASON
                                                          MEDDY
           Thank God!
                                              Thank God!
                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        This bitch kidnapped us!

                                 JASON
                        Get us out of here!

           Yates freezes. Priscilla laughs, then lowers her hands.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        No, these mortals killed Aglaope 
                        and Thelxiepeia, father.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        What? Dammit, P! How could you let--

           He cuffs Meddy.

                                 MEDDY
                        What the fuck?

           While Yates struggles with the cuffs, Jason faces Priscilla.

                                 JASON
                        Father? You’re their father? 
                        Sirens...the greek shit...you’re--

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Poseidon. Ya no good, spook.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Every girl gets her daddy issues 
                        from someone.

           Jason eyes a jar of barbicide on one of the nearby stalls.

                                 JASON
                        I hope daddy likes acid.

           Jason sprints to the stall. Snatches the barbicide as Yates 
           whips out his pistol.

           BANG!

           Jason rockets the barbicide at Yates’ face while taking the 
           shot to the shoulder.

           The barbicide smashes on Yates’ face. 

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Ahhh! My eyes!

           His face burns from the chemicals.

           Yates drops the gun. Once it hits the ground...
           BANG!

           It blasts another bullet straight into his dick.

                                 SHERIFF YATES (CONT’D)
                        My dick!

           He grabs his crotch, then collapses.

           Meddy grabs the gun. Points it at Priscilla.

           CLICK.

           No bullets.

           Priscilla smirks. She rushes toward Meddy and Jason until--

                                 SHERIFF YATES (CONT’D)
                        Enough!

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Father...

           Yates rockets back up as the sweat on his face grows until 
           he’s covered in a shell-like layer of water until...

           The bubble EXPLODES. Knocks the Trio on their asses.

           Yates, now shirtless with incredible physique, glares at 
           Jason with SEA-FOAM BLUE glowing eyes. His legs are now crab-
           like. A centaur but, instead of a horse, Yates is part SNOW 
           CRAB. POSEIDON’S TRUE FORM.

                                 JASON
                        Holy shit.

                                 MEDDY
                        Jason! The shampoo! We destroy it, 
                        we destroy them--

           As Meddy tosses him the hairspray, Yates SMACKS her across 
           the chest into the wall with one of his legs.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        You’re not destroying anything.

                                 MEDDY
                        Fuck!

                                 JASON
                        Meddy!

           Jason catches the hairspray and pulls out a lighter. He eyes 
           a shelf chock full of the Sauce. Yates keys in on him.
           Right as he’s about to strike him, Jason lights the shelf 
           ablaze with the flamethrower.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        No!

           Yates abandons the attack, in favor of PUKING pure water on 
           the flames to put them out, but Jason races to another shelf. 
           Lights it.

           Once Yates puts the first fire out, he turns to the next, 
           but, by then, Jason’s already lit a third.

                                 JASON
                        Leon, get Meddy outta here, now!

           Leon nods, then races to Meddy. Gets her up, then--

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You have a hell of a right, but 
                        you’re still only a mortal.

           Priscilla, in her TRUE SIREN FORM, slashes Leon with a talon.

                                 LEON
                        Specs!

           Jason turns as Leon falls. Jason watches the light fade from 
           his eyes. Meddy lies still beside his bleeding body. 

           Jason faces down Priscilla as Yates heads to put out the 
           final inferno. He tosses the hairspray in his hand. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Poor, poor Jason. Always the 
                        survivor. The guilt must--

           Jason laughs, manically.

                                 PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JASON
                        It’s just--It’s just--This is gonna 
                        make one massive meatball.

           In a split second, Jason launches the hairspray into the 
           final blaze. Pricilla and Yates’ eyes widen as--

           BOOM!

           The shelf ERUPTS as the can EXPLODES. The entire shop burns.
                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        Priscilla!

           Priscilla SCREAMS bloody murder as the flames overcome her. 
           Yates tries to put the flames out, but they overwhelm him.

           Jason grabs Meddy and Leon, he drapes their arms over his 
           shoulders and carries them out.

           EXT. HAIR - DAY

           As Jason carries Meddy and Leon out--

           Hair EXPLODES. Knocks the Trio onto the sidewalk. Jason turns 
           and watches the flames spiral into the sky before passing out 
           on the sidewalk.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           EXT. HAIR - DAY

           Jason’s ears RING as he zones out. He sits on the end of a 
           gurney. An EMT bandages his arm and leg.

           Shoppers, now dressed in their normal hipster-chique, gawk at 
           the Hair storefront as FIREFIGHTERS put out the final embers. 

           Yellow “Caution” Tape keeps them at bay as OFFICERS and EMTs 
           gurney body after body out of the shop.

           AMBULANCES, FIRETRUCKS, and COP CARS litter the street.

           THE RINGING GROWS.

           Leon sits in the ambulance attached to a respirator. He 
           breathes stronger, deeper with each second. Bandages cover 
           his abdomen.

           THE RINGING PEAKS.

           Officers raid O’s car. They seize Meddy’s equipment.

           Jason watches as EMTs gurney O’s body out. His withered 
           carcass partially hangs out of an unzipped bodybag. 

           The RINGING stops as an EMT ZIPS up the bodybag. 

           CAW!!

           Meddy shudders as she eases up to Jason.
           They glance up to the Vultures perched on top of buildings on 
           the decayed side of the street. 

           One by one, the Vultures fly off except for one. It stays. 
           Unnaturally bends its neck.

                                 MEDDY
                        We should go.

                                 JASON
                        They’re gonna blame all of your 
                        burglaries on him.

                                 MEDDY
                        Then his death meant something.

                                 JASON
                        And what’s that?

                                 MEDDY
                        That we can both move forward with 
                        no baggage dragging us down.

                                 JASON
                        He’d like that.

                                 MEDDY
                        Would he?

                                 JASON
                        I’d like that.

           An EMT gurneys Yates out. Yates’ face is severely burned and 
           disfigured. Part of his skull peeks out.

                                 SHERIFF YATES
                        My girls! The fucking niggers 
                        killed my girls! 

           The EMT places one last bandage on Jason’s shoulder.

                                 EMT
                        Free to go, kid.

           Meddy helps Jason down. They glance back on the street and 
           shops. Linger on Uncle Leon’s Barbershop as Officers surround 
           it with yellow tape.

                                 MEDDY
                        What’ll happen to the barbershop?

                                 JASON
                        Close for a bit, but it’ll reopen. 
                        If not, I’ll start my own shop. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASON (CONT'D)
                        Bring peace to the hood my Mom’s 
                        way. One nappy head at a time.

                                 MEDDY
                        A man with a plan. 

                                 JASON
                        No, more like a man that could use 
                        a change of scenery.

           Jason offers his hand.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Walk me home for old time’s sake?

           Meddy takes his hand.

           EXT. LEON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jason and Meddy saunter down the sidewalk toward the house 
           together. They stop on the porch. Jason listens as Meddy 
           nervously word vomits.

                                 MEDDY
                        There’s so much I have to catch you 
                        up on. Like college or my--

           Jason plants a kiss on her lips. Stuns Meddy.

                                 JASON
                        Thanks.

                                 MEDDY
                        For?

                                 JASON
                        Coming back.

                                 MEDDY
                        I didn’t come back for you, I came 
                        back for me. But I do owe you.

                                 JASON
                        Yeah, because getting kidnapped, 
                        drugged, and almost dying wasn’t 
                        enough. 
                             (laughs)
                        So how you plan on paying me back?

                                 MEDDY
                             (deadpan)
                        With my ass.
           Jason laughs. Thinks she’s joking, but Meddy isn’t. She 
           raises an eyebrow. 

                                 MEDDY (CONT’D)
                        You gonna need any pills?

           Jason stammers for a moment, then glances down. His eyes 
           widen at a massive bulge in his pants. He’s gotten an 
           erection. All on his own.

           INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - DAY

           The nightstand shakes. Theresa’s photo covers its eyes until 
           it falls revealing the unopened pills in a trashcan. 

           Meddy and Jason MOAN as they have the wildest sex the 
           missionary position can offer. His bed RUMBLES.

                                 MEDDY
                        Right there! Keep going!

                                 JASON
                        Almost there! Hold on...

           Meddy faces the heavens as Jason climaxes, then...

           ...the room fades away. One piece of furniture at a time. 

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        What the--

           As Meddy looks down at Jason, her face changes to Priscilla’s 
           hag-like Siren form.

           Priscilla raises a talon, then plunges it toward him.

           He shuts his eyes as a bright WHITE LIGHT overcomes him.

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

           Jason opens his eyes. A euphoric smile blankets his face. 
           MOANS fill Jason’s ears as he hangs from the pump.

           Jason never made it out. 

           His withered body grows more frail with each passing second.

           Beside him, Agatha and Thea drop a drugged Leon’s pants. 
           Strap him in. 
                                 LEON
                             (slurred)
                        Jason? No.

           A COMPLETELY FILLED CONDOM drops into the bowl between 
           Jason’s legs.

           Meddy stands up from underneath him. Wipes her mouth, then 
           eases to the next Man attached to the pump.

           Something NIGHTMARISH plays such as “ACRYLICS” by TNGHT

           On every hit, the screen exponentially divides creating a 
           mosaic of pleasure and pain. From one screen to two, two to 
           four, until THOUSANDS of images create one black mass.

           As we pull out of that black mass, it becomes clear that 
           we’re looking at the screen of the analog digital clock in 
           the Private Room as it blinks. Frozen in time.

           13:27PM

           Priscilla reaches up. Fiddles with the side of it.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Times of bliss come and go, but 
                        your suffering will never end.

           As Priscilla eases away she whistles to the tune of “I’M 
           BLACK” from the play Hair.

           The clock starts again, and a minute passes.

           13:28PM.

           CLICK! An after burn BUZZES.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
