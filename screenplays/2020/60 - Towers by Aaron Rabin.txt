           EXT. SMALL CITY - AMERICA - DAY

           Two towers. One taller than the other. Not by much. An 
           otherwise flat landscape. Strip malls. Wisps of industry. 

           But those towers...

           CLOSER

           One is definitely newer. The taller one. Flush, reflective 
           blue glass. A one-way mirror to success. 

           The other -- not so new. And beige. Concrete grids separate 
           the windows. Easy to see inside. We close in on one of the 
           top floors. Not the top floor. But one of them --

           CLOSER

           -- where JEFF ARMSTRONG (40’s) stands in his corner office, 
           staring through a pair of binoculars. Sights fixed on the top 
           of --

           -- the BLUE BUILDING. 

           BINOCULAR POV

           He can’t see much. There’s a railing. People milling about. 
           Some sort of rooftop club... 

           Jeff steps closer -- as if an extra foot will make a 
           difference. The binoculars CLINK against the window. He peers 
           deeper...

           ...and for the briefest moment, he seems to hear DISTANT 
           LAUGHTER. Mocking him. Producing a RINGING in his ears.

           Jeff rips the binoculars from his eyes. Wipes his brow. 
           Reclaims his breath. He’s about to walk away...

           -- when something occurs to him. He returns to the window. 
           Flips the binoculars around. Stares through the big lenses. 
           The ‘objective’ lenses.

           From this POV, the Blue Building looks a million miles away. 
           Miniature. Myopic. Meaningless...

           He smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. - BUICK REGAL - SMALL CITY - EARLY EVENING

                                 FRANK SINATRA (SONG)
                        Fly me to the moon...

           Jeff drives down the city’s Main Street, listening to Frank 
           Sinatra. There’s a bit of charm to the town. Some decent 
           brickwork. A few restaurants with ambience...

                                 FRANK SINATRA  (SONG) (CONT’D)
                        ...let me see what spring is like, 
                        on Jupiter and Mars...

           The song builds to Jeff’s favorite part. He’s getting into 
           it. Awkwardly moving his head back and forth --

                                 FRANK SINATRA  (SONG) (CONT’D)
                        ...in other words, please be 
                        true...!

           -- when a red light undercuts his momentum. He flinches. 
           Slows down. But it’s all right. He’s still in the groove. 
           Starts singing along -- 

                                 FRANK SINATRA (SONG) (CONT’D)
                        ...in other words, I love -- !!!

           -- BOOM!!!

           Jeff’s car rattles. For a second, he’s disoriented. He can’t 
           hear anything -- BOOM!!!

           -- then he realizes: it’s the souped-up SUBARU next to him. 
           Two MEXICAN KIDS. Sinatra drowns in a sea of bass. 

           Jeff stares at them. They stare back. The light turns green. 
           The Subaru SKIDS away...

           ...and now Jeff can hear Frank again. But the magic is gone. 
           He turns it off. Watches the Subaru disappear around a 
           corner. 

           INT. KITCHEN - SUBURBS - EVENING

           A pre-made LASAGNA on the table. Iceberg lettuce salad. Ranch 
           dressing. Jeff’s daughters -- TARA (15), bleached blonde, 
           wearing a SURFER SHIRT, and MONA (12), skinny, still in 
           soccer uniform -- eat dinner while listening to music and 
           texting. SERENA (40), Jeff’s wife, noticeably overweight, 
           reads the CARDBOARD PACKAGING to the lasagna --
           Over Jeff’s shoulder, the news plays on TV -- muted with 
           CLOSED CAPTIONS. Something about immigrants. Maybe. Hard to 
           tell without his glasses...

                                 SERENA 
                        I’m not sure we should eat this 
                        anymore...

           She hands the packaging to Jeff...

                                 JEFF
                             (absently)
                        What --?

                                 SERENA
                        Look at all this. 

           Serena taps the ingredients list. 

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Look how long it is? 

           Annoyed, Jeff breaks his focus from the news. 

                                 JEFF
                        What am I looking at?

                                 SERENA
                        The ingredients. Look at all those 
                        things.

           He looks closer. 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 SERENA
                        When I make homemade lasagna --

                                 JEFF
                        -- when do you do that?

                                 SERENA
                        The point is, there aren’t all 
                        these ingredients. There are too 
                        many here. 

                                 JEFF
                        Who wrote that fucking rule? 

           The girls both look up. Serena purses her mouth. 
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Sorry -- I’m just...
                             (he gestures to the TV)
                        ...I’m trying to watch this. It’s 
                        important. 

                                 SERENA
                        So is our health. 

                                 JEFF
                        Serena, we’ve been eating this 
                        lasagna for years. We’re all still 
                        here, right? 

           He looks to his daughters. Tara gives him a thumbs up, still 
           listening to music. We hear the faint throb of SURF GUITAR -- 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                             (lowering his voice)
                        I mean, we like the fucking 
                        lasagna, don’t we? 

                                 SERENA
                        What I don’t like is when you talk 
                        that way. 

                                 JEFF
                        I do it to make a point. 

                                 SERENA
                        Which is?

                                 JEFF
                        If we enjoy the lasagna, why does 
                        it need to change?

           Serena sighs. She can see this isn’t going anywhere. 

                                 SERENA
                             (folding the cardboard)
                        I’d just like to be healthy.

                                 JEFF
                        I’d like that for you, too. 

           She shrinks a little. Jeff returns his attention to the 
           news...

                                 NEWS (CLOSE CAPTIONED)
                        ...TO THE...SIX TEENS WHO...RAPED 
                        THE DRIVER...THEIR FOOTAGE IS...

           Jeff sits straight up. 
                                 JEFF
                        Jesus --

                                 SERENA
                             (clasping her heart)
                        -- what?

                                 JEFF
                        Those guys!

           The TV shows a number of SOUPED UP cars, including one 
           vaguely similar to the Subaru Jeff encountered.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I was right next to those guys 
                        today!

                                 SERENA
                        What guys --?

                                 JEFF
                        Those guys in that car! Six of them 
                        raped somebody. 

                                 SERENA
                        Oh no...

                                 JEFF
                             (to his daughters)
                        Girls, watch the TV --

           The girls look from one screen to the next. Tara pulls off 
           her headphones --

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        -- you see those kind of cars?

                                 MONA
                        Those are frogs. 

           It’s true. The news has moved on to a story about frogs. 

                                 JEFF
                        Okay, well you know those kind of 
                        cars that look like maybe, once, 
                        they were normal, but the kids have 
                        turned them into --

                                 TARA
                        -- Stocks?

                                 JEFF
                             (snapping)
                        How do you know that term?
                                 TARA
                        Because lots of kids do that. 

                                 JEFF
                        Kids you know?

                                 TARA
                        Some. 

                                 JEFF
                        Well stay the hell away from them. 
                        They just raped six girls. 

                                 TARA
                        I thought you said six of them 
                        raped a driver. 

                                 JEFF
                        Does it matter how many? Stay. 
                        Away. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JEFF’S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - DAY

           Jeff sits at his desk, fixated on the blue tower...

           An AQUARIUM gurgles nearby. Nothing fancy. A freshwater tank 
           with fish swirling about a motorized decoration -- 

           -- a sunken WWII PLANE, generating sizable BUBBLES. They 
           mushroom toward the surface every few moments. 

           One fish stands out from the rest: a WHITE HALFMOON, with 
           delicate, lacy fins that flow like a ballroom gown... 

           Jeff shifts his focus to the fish. He smiles, admiring her 
           grace -- 

           -- when a harsh ray of light causes the Halfmoon to abruptly 
           change course. 

           Tracing the light back to it source, Jeff realizes it’s the 
           sun -- blasting off the windows of the blue tower. 

                                 JEFF
                        Mother fucker...

           Crossing quickly to the window, Jeff yanks the blinds, 
           cutting off the light. Allowing his fish to swim in peace...

           Jeff returns to his monitor, where he has pulled up various 
           photos of STOCK CARS. A headline: 
                       STOCK RACING BECOMES CITY’S NEWEST FAD

           KNOCKING at the door. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Yes --?

           DANIEL (20’s), a rather effeminate SECRETARY, leans inside.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hi Jeff. Clarence has got --

                                 JEFF
                             (interrupting)
                        Did you open my blinds? 

           A beat. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Your blinds?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t come in here, Jeff. 

                                 JEFF
                        Well, who does? 

                                 DANIEL
                        The janitor.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s his name?

                                 DANIEL
                        Her. 

                                 JEFF
                        Could you tell her not to pull up 
                        the blinds? 

                                 DANIEL
                        No. But you can. 
                             (redirecting)
                        Clarence has ten minutes right now 
                        if you want them. 

                                 JEFF
                        Right now --?

           Jeff’s eyes briefly flit to his desk, where a small plaque 
           reads: TIMING IS EVERYTHING
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                             (calculated)
                        No. 

           Daniel shrugs...

                                 DANIEL
                        Okay.

                                 JEFF
                        But -- 

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes?

                                 JEFF
                        When he’s got fifteen minutes, you 
                        let me know. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m sure if you needed...

                                 JEFF
                        Daniel. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes...?

           The finality intended by using Daniel’s name is lost on 
           Daniel. Jeff tries again. 

                                 JEFF
                        Daniel. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes? 

           They stare at each other.  

                                 JEFF
                        You let me know about those 
                        fifteen.

           INT. CEO’S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

                                 CLARENCE 
                        Armstrong!

           Jeff steps into his CEO’s top-floor, Asian-themed office. A 
           bowl of fortune cookies sits on the desk. CLARENCE O’CONNELL 
           (50’s), indulgent gut, tie to match, waves him inside. 
                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about the wait -- all this 
                        China business -- 

                                 JEFF
                        Of course...

                                 CLARENCE
                        -- and sorry if I don’t make any 
                        goddamned sense. Jet lag from 
                        China. Doesn’t get any easier, you 
                        know. 

                                 JEFF
                        Sure doesn’t. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        China. Anyway, take a seat. 

           Jeff obliges, palming a fortune cookie. He nods to the 
           window...

                                 JEFF
                        Always love the view up here. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Top of the world. 

                                 JEFF
                        Well, used to be.  

           Clarence cocks his head. Jeff sees his opening. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Clarence, I want to talk about 
                        something. 

                                 CLARENCE
                             (sitting down)
                        Sure. 

                                 JEFF
                        I want to talk about a club. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        What club?

                                 JEFF
                        Our club. 

           A beat. 
                                 CLARENCE
                        Sorry, Armstrong...it’s probably 
                        the ol’ Chow Mein brain -- what 
                        club do we have...? 

                                 JEFF
                        We don’t. Not yet. But I think we 
                        need one. And fast. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        For who? 

                                 JEFF
                        For whoever pays the premium. 

                                 CLARENCE
                             (gesturing to the blue 
                              building)
                        You mean something like the Tower 
                        Club...? 

           Jeff visibly shivers at the name. 

                                 JEFF
                        No. Nothing like that. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        So it wouldn’t be on the roof. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes, it would. But it would be 
                        different. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Different how?

                                 JEFF
                        Classy. Old school. Not like 
                        whatever they’ve got up there. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Have you ever been up there?

                                 JEFF
                        Of course not. 
                             (a beat)
                        Have you?

           Clarence opens his mouth -- hesitates...

                                 CLARENCE
                        No. But I’ve seen pictures online. 
                        Need to know the competition... 
                                 JEFF
                        Of course. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        ...and I must say, it would be hard 
                        to top. 

                                 JEFF
                        Respectfully, I disagree. We find a 
                        good chef. A great designer...

                                 CLARENCE
                        ...but I mean literally top. That’s 
                        their whole thing. Tallest building 
                        between LA and San Jose. It even 
                        rhymes. 

                                 JEFF
                        Okay. Let’s take them out of the 
                        equation for a minute. What do we 
                        need. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Profit.

                                 JEFF
                        And how do we increase that profit. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Overseas commerce...
                             (lowering his voice; 
                              putting up a muting hand)
                        ...which is something I’d like to 
                        talk with you about. A possible 
                        development in getting back your 
                        ‘you know what’...

                                 JEFF
                        Sure, sure -- but what can we do 
                        now. Know what I mean? We’ve got 
                        the Blues killing us on the club 
                        level, and that doesn’t look good 
                        to anybody.  

                                 CLARENCE
                        I suppose not, but they’ve got 
                        something different going on --

                                 JEFF
                        Exactly. That’s why we bring back 
                        what this company is really about. 
                        Old. School.

           Clarence stares at Jeff. Finally, he clasps his hands.
                                 CLARENCE
                        I like it. You look at permitting 
                        and such - because I actually don’t 
                        think we’re zoned for that sort of 
                        thing - and in the meantime, ask 
                        yourself this question: would you 
                        ever eat a hundred year-old egg?

                                 JEFF
                        A what?

                                 CLARENCE
                        Exactly. And before you say 
                        anything, know this: the answer is 
                        yes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SPEEDWAY - SMALL CITY - EVENING

           REVVING Engines. Falling light...

           A half-dozen turbo-charged cars line up at the local 
           speedway. Packed attendance. A ROAR as they SPEED away from 
           the starting line!

           Outside, in the parking lot, Jeff gets out of his Buick. He 
           looks around suspiciously. Heads to the front entrance. Near 
           the ticket counter, he notices a POLICEMAN. Jeff ambles over 
           in his direction. 

                                 JEFF
                        Evening, officer. 

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Evening.

                                 JEFF
                        So what’s all this about?

                                 POLICEMAN
                        What?
                             (pointing to the track)
                        This?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah. I heard about the rape. 

                                 POLICEMAN
                             (doubly confused)
                        The what?
           Jeff looks past him, catching a glimpse of the speeding 
           cars...

                                 JEFF
                        Rape. I heard about it. Those six 
                        animals.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about. 

                                 JEFF
                        On the news. Didn’t you see it?

                                 POLICEMAN
                        I guess not. Maybe it was from 
                        somewhere else. 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t think so. 

           An impasse.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        It cost money to go to this thing?

                                 POLICEMAN
                        It does. 

                                 JEFF
                             (laughing)
                        Unbelievable. 

           PARKING LOT

           Jeff returns to his car. He’s about to get inside, when:

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Nice car. 

           Jeff freezes. Across the way, a group of young Mexican men 
           are VAPING beside their TURBO HONDA CIVIC. CARLOS (early 
           20’s), tough, good hair, gestures to Jeff’s Buick.  

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        It’s nice. I dig Regals. 

           Jeff looks for the policeman. He’s gone.  

                                 JEFF
                        Thanks... 
                                 CARLOS
                        No problem, bro. What’d you pay for 
                        it? 

                                 JEFF
                        That’s none of your business. 

           A bunch of “WOAH’S” and LAUGHTER erupt from Carlos’ friends. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Hey man -- I’m not trying to fuck 
                        with you. I like your car. 

                                 JEFF
                        Look, I don’t want any trouble --

                                 CARLOS
                        What trouble?

                                 JEFF
                             (pointing)
                        -- I know the policeman. 

           Frustrated, Carlos crosses to Jeff -- who takes a step back. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Bro. I just asked: how much you 
                        paid for the car. 

                                 JEFF
                        I...I don’t remember. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Okay. You don’t remember. 

                                 JEFF
                        No!

           Jeff jumps into his car, locks the doors, and starts the 
           engine...

           KNOCK! KNOCK! Carlos is standing outside his window. Jeff 
           can’t hear what he’s saying. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                             (shouting)
                        Check the Blue Book!!!

           He screeches away. 
           INT. BEDROOM - SUBURBIA - NIGHT

           Jeff and Serena lie in bed. He’s on a laptop, she’s on a 
           phone. 

                                 JEFF
                        Look at this --
                             (swiveling; photos of a 
                              nightclub)
                        -- this place, Melvyn’s. In Palm 
                        Springs. This was one of Sinatra’s 
                        favorite spots. 

                                 SERENA
                        Very pretty. 

                                 JEFF
                        See how classy it is?

                                 SERENA
                        I do. I like it. 

                                 JEFF
                        Good. Now look at this: 

           He pulls up a new set of photos. A club with a completely 
           different vibe. Modern. Lots of blues. 

                                 SERENA
                        That’s nice, too. 

           A beat. 

                                 JEFF
                        Nice, too?

                                 SERENA
                        Yeah. I mean, it’s different, but 
                        it’s nice. 

                                 JEFF
                        It’s ridiculous! Who wants to have 
                        dinner in a ray gun? 

                                 SERENA
                        A ray gun?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah! A science fiction gun. 

                                 SERENA
                        I don’t know. 
                                 JEFF
                        “Nice, too...”

           He gets rid of the screen. Serena goes back to her cellphone. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 SERENA
                        Calculating. 

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 SERENA
                        Calories. 

           Jeff turns off his light. Serena remains on her phone. After 
           a beat. 

                                 JEFF
                        Serena, would you put that away?

                                 SERENA
                        Why?

                                 JEFF
                        Because you don’t need to be doing 
                        that. 

                                 SERENA
                        But it’s working. I lost a few 
                        pounds this week. 

                                 JEFF
                        You don’t need to lose a few 
                        pounds. 

                                 SERENA
                        I think I do. 

                                 JEFF
                        Why?

                                 SERENA
                        So you might touch me more. 

           Silence. Jeff’s body tightens and recoils. Serena is 
           unperturbed. She simply goes on crunching numbers...

           EXT. ROOF - BEIGE BUILDING - SUNRISE

           A CREAKING door. Shoved open...
           Jeff steps onto the flat roof of the Beige Building. Orange 
           sunrise spreads across his face. A gentle breeze...

           The majority of the roof is taken up by a smaller structure, 
           HUMMING with electricity. The AIR CONDITIONING unit. 

           The rest of the available ‘real estate’ has a somewhat 
           abandoned look. A few sun-bleached CHAIRS. Cigarette butts. 
           Coke cans...

           ...but you wouldn’t know it from Jeff’s expression. He walks 
           to the edge. Hands on his hips. He sees something here. 
           Something the others don’t. Potential. 

           Reaching into his pocket, Jeff produces the FORTUNE COOKIE 
           from Clarence’s office. Holding his breath, Jeff breaks it in 
           half. Pulls out the fortune...

           ...and slowly looks down. The paper flutters between his 
           thumbs. 

                   Everything is possible for one who believes. 

           INT. JEFF'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - MORNING

           An emboldened Jeff picks up his phone. Props his feet 
           confidently on the desk. Dials. Leans back...

           ...winking at his White Halfmoon, gliding through the water. 

                                 JEFF (TELEPHONE)
                        Hello, yes. I’d like to schedule a 
                        preliminary meeting with one of 
                        your planners. What’s his name? 
                             (a beat)
                        Okay, what’s her name?
                             (a beat)
                        I said preliminary. It means 
                        ‘first. How’s Friday?
                             (a beat)
                        Well is this Friday an alternate or 
                        not? 
                             (a beat)
                        Then next Friday. My name is 
                        Armstrong. 
                             (a beat)
                        Arm. Strong.

           Annoyed, Jeff hangs up and presses the intercom. A second 
           later, Daniel enters the office. Before he can speak:

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Can you believe these people?
                                 DANIEL
                        What people --?

                                 JEFF
                        I just got off with the city 
                        planners. They have every other 
                        Friday off. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Lucky them. 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t think you understand what 
                        I’m saying. 

           A beat. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I guess not. 

           Daniel is about to close the door -- 

                                 JEFF
                        One more thing -- 

                                 DANIEL
                             (sighing)
                        What? 

                                 JEFF
                        Where are we with the janitor 
                        thing? 

                                 DANIEL
                        What janitor thing? 

                                 JEFF
                        About the blinds --
                             (gesturing to the tank)
                        -- so my white moon doesn’t get 
                        roasted. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about. 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m talking about my white moon. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Well, I wish you wouldn’t. 

           He leaves. 
           EXT. SOCCER FIELDS - SUBURBIA - NIGHT 

           Shouts from the bleachers. Jeff and Serena sit halfway up, 
           watching a tide of 12 year-old girls race up and down the 
           field...

                                 SERENA
                        Go Mona!!
                             (to Jeff)
                        She’s doing good. 

                                 JEFF
                        Sure is...
                             (pridefully)
                        I was always athletic.

           More shouts of encouragement -- but underneath, Jeff can hear 
           something else. A BOOMING...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Do you hear that --?

           He looks behind the bleachers. Sees a slow moving FORD 
           EXPLORER, bass blaring. BANDA MUSIC floating above...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Those mother fuckers...

                                 SERENA
                             (sharply)
                        Jeff. 

                                 JEFF
                        We’re trying to watch a game. 

           The players rush past -- and Jeff gets to his feet, shouting 
           extra loud. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Yeah!!! Yeah!!!

           Everyone gives him a strange look. Including his wife. 

           LATER

                                 SERENA
                        You. Did. So. Good!

           Walking into the parking lot, Serena has an arm around Mona, 
           who is limping a little bit. Jeff looks for the car.

                                 MONA
                        I got another bruise. Look at 
                        this...
           She runs a finger up her leg. It’s pretty bad. Serena GASPS. 
           Jeff rolls his eyes..

                                 JEFF
                        That’s what competition looks like, 
                        Serena. 

                                 SERENA
                        Does it hurt --?!

                                 MONA
                        Not really...

                                 JEFF
                        Where the hell did we park...?

           They turn to the next row of cars. Only a few there. Not 
           Jeff’s Buick.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        What the hell...?

           He doubles back to the first row. Probably only twenty cars, 
           total. Enough to count. He goes halfway down the row --

           -- and stops at an empty stall. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I swear to God, this is where we 
                        parked. Serena, look --

           He points to a BLUE FLYER, stapled to an electrical pole.  

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        -- you remember that? Remember what 
                        I said about that?

                                 SERENA
                        No...

                                 JEFF
                        I said it looked like litter. 

                                 SERENA
                        You didn’t say that. 

                                 JEFF
                        Well, I thought it. This is where 
                        we parked. This is where we parked!

           Jeff starts blinking erratically. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck is it? 
                                 SERENA
                        Jeff...

                                 JEFF
                        Where is my goddamned car!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - SMALL CITY - NIGHT

                                 JEFF
                        I know who did it. 

           A half-interested policeman, OFFICER MARTINEZ (40) looks up 
           from his paperwork. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        You do? 

           Jeff sits across from him, mouth in a permanent frown. The 
           rest of the station is nearly empty. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. This group of...

           He trails off, staring at the officer’s plaque. Martinez...

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                             (flatly)
                        Were they Latino? 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t know. But they weren’t 
                        American. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Those are two different things. 

                                 JEFF
                        That’s what I’m saying. 

           Officer Martinez sighs. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Who were they?

                                 JEFF
                        How the hell should I know? 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        You said you knew who they were. 
                                 JEFF
                        I do! This group of...kids. 
                        Teenagers. At the speedway. They 
                        liked my car. They told me. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        A group of kids told you they liked 
                        your car. 

                                 JEFF
                        That’s right. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        And this makes you think they stole 
                        it?

                                 JEFF
                        Why else would they say something?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                             (sarcastically)
                        Good point. You do drive a Buick... 

                                 JEFF
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Nothing. Look, Mr. Armstrong, a 
                        group of Latino kids at the 
                        speedway doesn’t give us a lot to 
                        go on. 

                                 JEFF
                        Why?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Because most of the kids who hang 
                        out at the speedway are Latino. 
                        Except for you, apparently. 

                                 JEFF
                        I was just checking it out. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        What for, may I ask?

                                 JEFF
                        I heard about the rape. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        What rape?
                                 JEFF
                        On TV. At the speedway. That stuff 
                        didn’t use to happen around here. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Those things have always happened 
                        around here. But not at the 
                        speedway. 

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll go ahead and trust the news. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        That’s funny. You don’t seem like 
                        the type. 

           INT. JEFF’S GARAGE - SUBURBIA - NIGHT

           Music plays in a dim garage. Familiar music. Sinatra. 

                                 SINATRA
                        ...come fly with me...

           Squinting in the dim light, Serena navigates stacked boxes 
           and bicycle gear...

           ...to find Jeff, sitting under the central light, cleaning 
           his .45. A few empty MILLER HIGH LIFE’s beside him. 

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff -- what are you doing?

                                 JEFF
                        Cleaning my gun --

                                 SERENA
                        It’s midnight...

                                 JEFF
                        Serena -- if the same kids I saw 
                        stole the Buick, that means they 
                        followed me. If they followed me, 
                        they may have come here first. Our 
                        house could be a target. 

           Serena sees the logic. 

                                 SERENA
                        Anyway, Mona isn’t feeling well. 

                                 JEFF
                        The bruise?
                                 SERENA
                        Yes, but something else. She’s very 
                        tired. 

                                 JEFF
                        She just ran a thousand miles. 

                                 SERENA
                        It’s something else. 

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 SERENA
                        I don’t know. She’d like to see 
                        you. 

                                 JEFF
                             (lifting up his soiled 
                              hands)
                        I’m cleaning the pistol. 

                                 SERENA
                        I see what you’re doing. Your 
                        daughter would like to see you. 

           INT. MONA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff pushes into Mona’s room with his knee - hands still 
           covered in grease. He walks into the dark like an awkward 
           monster, both palms held before him. 

                                 JEFF
                        Mona...?

           A rustling in the sheets. Mona rolls over, pained face 
           illuminated by the crease of hallway light. 

                                 MONA
                        Hi dad. 

                                 JEFF
                        What’s going on?

           He kneels down. 

                                 MONA
                        I don’t feel well. 

                                 JEFF
                        What is it?
                                 MONA
                        I don’t know. My body hurts. 

                                 JEFF
                        Is it from the game?

                                 MONA
                        I don’t think so. The start of the 
                        season I get sore. But not now. I 
                        don’t know. 

           She waits for his solution.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, why don’t we wait until 
                        tomorrow. See how you feel then?

                                 MONA
                        But I feel bad now. 

           An open silence. Jeff considers the dilemma. Finally:

                                 JEFF
                        You know what my dad used to tell 
                        me?

                                 MONA
                        What...?

                                 JEFF
                        Everything is possible for one who 
                        believes. 

           Mona stares back, confused. Jeff smiles. Rises up. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Sweet dreams. 

           Keeping his hands vertical, Jeff walks away. Mona sees a DROP 
           of grease fall from his palm. It lands on her carpet. Seeping 
           into the fibers as the door closes...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CITY PLANNERS OFFICE - DAY

           Jeff sits in a waiting room. By himself. Faint music piped 
           overhead. Banda music. He frowns...

           Behind the front desk, the SECRETARY is smiling at something  
           on her cellphone. She giggles...
           Jeff checks his watch. 2:04. Unacceptable. He looks back at 
           the secretary...

           ...who giggles again. She’s texting. Excited by whatever 
           message popped up. Doesn’t she have work to do? 

           The RINGING returns to Jeff’s ears. His scowl transforms into 
           a diabolical sneer...

                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Armstrong --?

           Jeff whips his head around. KATHERINE CHAVEZ (30’s), business 
           suit, toned figure, extends a hand. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Katherine Chavez. City planner. 
                        Sorry I’m late -- I was told the 
                        meeting was at 2:30...
                             (shielding her voice from 
                              the front desk)
                        ...hard to find good help these 
                        days. 

           INT. KATHERINE’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Encouraged by Katherine’s attitude, Jeff takes a seat in her 
           office - and is immediately struck by the decor: Americana. 
           Everywhere. Including a framed AMERICAN FLAG behind her desk 
           with a faded signature. 

                                 JEFF
                             (pointing to the flag)
                        What’s that?

           Katherine looks up from her computer. Smiles. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Reagan’s signature. 

                                 JEFF
                             (eyes bulging)
                        Wow. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        My father came over here first. 
                        Served in the military. He did 
                        something quite brave, and was then 
                        able to bring us over. 

                                 JEFF
                        What did he do?
                                 KATHERINE
                        He doesn’t like us to talk about 
                        it.

           Disappointed, Jeff watches her scan the computer. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        So, you - wow. You work over at...

                                 JEFF
                             (proudly)
                        That’s right. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        And you want to...oh, I see. 

           She blinks. Processing. Slowly, she turns to the window - 
           where the Blue and Beige buildings rise in perpetual 
           standoff. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        ...you mean, build a club just 
                        like...

                                 JEFF
                             (sharply)
                        No. Not like that. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Then...

                                 JEFF
                        ...we’re looking to do something 
                        different. Something that reflects 
                        the values of our company. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Something a bit more -- old school?

           Jeff’s eyes alight. 

                                 JEFF
                        Exactly. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Very ambitious.

                                 JEFF
                        Thank you.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (returning to the screen)
                        ...my only initial concern is the 
                        age of the building. 
                                 JEFF
                        What do you mean?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Well -- your competitor had their 
                        rooftop establishment in mind when 
                        they started construction. 

                                 JEFF
                        So?

                                 KATHERINE
                        So, all the design, physical access 
                        - it’s organic to the structure. In 
                        your case, you would have to 
                        retrofit so it’s accessible to 
                        everyone. 

                                 JEFF
                        What do you mean by ‘everyone’? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        People with disabilities, for 
                        example. Everyone. And then there 
                        are climate regulations. 

                                 JEFF
                        Climate --?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes. Your competitor has already 
                        had to overhaul their club to deal 
                        with the temperature spike. 

                                 JEFF
                        What if I don’t believe in that? 
                        Any way around those regulations? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        There’s no way around the sun, Mr. 
                        Armstrong -- though with a name 
                        like yours, you could certainly 
                        try!

           She laughs. Jeff doesn’t. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        ...anyway, the next step will be 
                        visiting your site.  

                                 JEFF
                        When are you available? 
                                 KATHERINE
                        Let’s see...

           Katherine pulls up her calendar -- then pauses. She looks at 
           Jeff with a shy smile. Even a flicker of attraction...  

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Who do people say you look like? 

                                 JEFF
                        What --?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I mean, who do you get? Who do you 
                        look like? 

           Jeff thinks about it. 

                                 JEFF
                        Nobody. 

                                 KATHERINE
                             (smiling)
                        Never mind. How about next Friday?

                                 JEFF
                             (flatly)
                        Don’t you have next Friday off?

           Katherine draws a hand to her mouth. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        My gosh, you are so right!

           PRELAP SFX: A ROARING ENGINE...

           INT. SPEEDWAY - SMALL CITY - NIGHT

           Stock cars drill down the speedway. Roars from the crowd! 
           Lights blare...

           ...illuminating Jeff in the upper bleachers, watching the 
           cars pass the finish line. A massive LCD SCREEN projects: 
           $100,000 POT! Everyone on their feet --!!

           -- but not Jeff. He eyes the fans suspiciously. Predominately 
           Latino. As the next race sets up, he notices someone 
           familiar. Lifts his binoculars --

           -- to see Carlos, the guy from the parking lot, readying his 
           Honda Civic. The race is about to begin. Carlos revs the 
           engine --
           -- just as Jeff’s CELLPHONE rings. 

                                 JEFF
                             (shouting)
                        Hello --?

           The cars ROAR past -- 

                                 SERENA (TELEPHONE)
                        Where are you --?!

                                 JEFF
                             (shouting)
                        I’m -- nowhere. Where are you?

                                 SERENA
                        ...I’m...

           The crowd JUMPS to its feet again! Carlos has already won - a 
           time projected on the screen. 8.8 seconds. 

                                 JEFF
                        -- where?!

                                 SERENA (TELEPHONE)
                        I’m at the hospital!!

           EXT. HOSPITAL - SMALL CITY - NIGHT

           Mona lies in a hospital bed, IV stretching from her arm. 
           Serena sits beside her, face etched with worry. The door 
           opens --

                                 JEFF
                        Goddamned arrows point both ways --

           -- Jeff stops speaking the second he sees Mona. Serena sucks 
           in the air. 

                                 MONA
                             (looking up)
                        Hi dad. 

           Moving slower, Jeff crouches beside her. Genuinely concerned. 

                                 JEFF
                        What’s wrong, little lady? 

                                 MONA
                        They don’t know...
                                 SERENA
                        The doctor is running blood tests. 

                                 JEFF
                        Why?

                                 SERENA
                        Because she’s sick, Jeff. 

           Suspicion creeps into his eyes... 

                                 JEFF
                        Did they say that...? 

                                 SERENA
                        What do you mean?

                                 JEFF
                        I mean, we don’t know anything yet. 

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff, her bruises aren’t going 
                        away. I went on the internet, and --

           Jeff sighs loudly. Closes his eyes. 

                                 JEFF
                        -- and now we get taken to the 
                        cleaners no matter what. 

                                 MONA
                        Dad, don’t be mad...

                                 JEFF
                        I’m not mad, sweetie. But now 
                        you’re scared, and you don’t need 
                        to be. 

                                 SERENA
                        How do you know? 

           The door opens again. DR. GANDHI (50’s) walks in, heritage 
           self-evident. He smiles at Mona. 

                                 DR. GANDHI
                        Good evening, Mona. How are you 
                        feeling?

                                 MONA
                             (shrugging)
                        I’ve felt better. 
                                 DR. GANDHI
                        We’ll see what we can do about 
                        that. 

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Jeff and Serena sit across from Dr. Gandhi, whose good humor 
           has fallen away. He chooses his words carefully. Jeff scans 
           the walls. PUNCH IN on Gandhi’s degree from Harvard...

                                 DR. GANDHI
                        Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong -- we don’t 
                        have the tests back yet, but I’ve 
                        been doing this a long time, and I 
                        find it’s important to prepare 
                        people for difficult news. 

                                 SERENA
                        What do you mean...?

                                 DR. GANDHI
                        I’m afraid Mona is exhibiting many 
                        symptoms associated with leukemia. 

           Serena GASPS...

                                 DR. GANDHI (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Armstrong - you showed great 
                        foresight bringing Mona in when you 
                        did. Most would chalk this sort of 
                        thing up to sports injuries. 

           Jeff purses his lips. 

                                 DR. GANDHI (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to keep her overnight. At 
                        least, until the tests come back. 
                        If it is indeed leukemia, we’ll 
                        want to start an aggressive 
                        treatment right away. 

                                 JEFF
                        What about a second opinion?

           Both turn to Jeff. 

                                 DR. GANDHI
                        Mr. Armstrong, we don’t yet have a 
                        diagnosis...

                                 JEFF
                        But what if you’re wrong. 
                                 DR. GANDHI
                        You mean, about the diagnosis I 
                        haven’t made? 

                                 JEFF
                        Exactly. 

           Dr. Gandhi squints. 

                                 DR. GANDHI
                        I guess we’ll cross that bridge 
                        when we get there. 

           EXT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Jeff and Serena stand outside Dr. Gandhi’s office, speaking 
           in hushed tones -- 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t like it. 

                                 SERENA
                        Don’t like what?

                                 JEFF
                        This Harvard bullshit. Scaring us 
                        before he knows what he’s talking 
                        about. 

                                 SERENA
                        What if he does know what he’s 
                        talking about? 

                                 JEFF
                        He insulted me to my face. 

                                 SERENA
                        When?!

                                 JEFF
                        Never mind. You stay here. I’ll go 
                        home. God knows what Tara’s into. 

                                 SERENA
                        Don’t -- 

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 SERENA
                        -- don’t tell her about Mona until 
                        we’re sure. 
                                 JEFF
                        Okay. 

                                 SERENA
                        Tell her it was a sprain from 
                        practice. Promise? 

                                 JEFF
                        I promise. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tara sits on the couch, face in her hands, quietly crying. In 
           an adjacent armchair, Jeff nods understandingly. Her tear-
           stained face lifts...

                                 TARA
                        Do they know for sure...? 

                                 JEFF
                        They’re not positive. But the 
                        doctor’s from Harvard, so...

           She wells up again. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Look, your mother didn’t want me to 
                        tell you. Not until we were 
                        certain. But I think it’s important 
                        to prepare people for bad news, 
                        just in case. 

           Tara nods her head...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        The most important thing is you 
                        don’t tell your mother I said 
                        anything. Understand? 

                                 TARA
                        Yeah...

                                 JEFF
                        I’m glad we talked. 

                                 TARA
                        I love you dad.

                                 JEFF
                        Thanks.

           EXT. BEIGE BUILDING - SMALL CITY - MORNING

           An overhead shot. The two buildings, shimmering under 
           oppressive heat...

           Far below, a car turns off the bisecting road, disappearing 
           into the Beige underground lot...

           INT. PARKING LOT - BEIGE BUILDING - MORNING

           A ridiculously small GEO METRO RENTAL CAR parks beneath a 
           Reserved Sign: VICE PRESIDENT - JEFF ARMSTRONG. 

           Jeff grunts as he pulls himself out of the tiny rental. Paler 
           than usual, he heads towards the elevator...

           ...when LAUGHTER echoes through the lot. He pauses. The 
           laughter is familiar - and very close. 

           He approaches a MERCEDES S-CLASS beneath another Reserved 
           Sign: PRESIDENT - CLARENCE O’CONNELL...

                                 JEFF
                        Clarence...?

           Jeff peers through the driver’s window. Inside, Clarence 
           seems to be examining something on his armrest -- as a 
           jeweler might inspect a diamond. 

           Daniel, Jeff’s assistant, giggles in the passenger seat. Then 
           he sees Jeff. No more giggling. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                             (confused)
                        Daniel...?

           Clarence’s head WHIPS up, as he takes a long SNORT. He turns 
           to the window -- vigorously wiping his nose. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Armstrong! Fuck! 

           He reaches violently back, trying to open the rear door. He 
           can’t quite get there. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Come on in --
                                 JEFF
                             (awkwardly)
                        That’s all right. Daniel -- I 
                        need...well, Clarence. If you’ve 
                        got time today. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        I’ve got time now!

                                 JEFF
                        It’s all right. I’ll see you 
                        upstairs.

           Clarence sits at his desk, eyes a bit bloodshot, vigorously 
           tapping the oak finish. Across from him, Jeff is quite 
           somber.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Jesus, Jeff. That is terrible. 

                                 JEFF
                        It is...

                                 CLARENCE
                        First the Buick, now this. 

                                 JEFF
                        I know...

           In a swift motion, Clarence shoves up from the desk. He walks 
           to the window. Hands on his hips...

                                 CLARENCE
                        What do you want to do? 

                                 JEFF
                        Serena wants me to take some time 
                        off. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        I’m sure you’ve got the days...

                                 JEFF
                        I do. But of course, I will 
                        continue with the roof project. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        You will...?
                                 JEFF
                        The inspector comes on Friday. Once 
                        she gives her okay, I start the 
                        budget. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Well, if you feel you have time...

                                 JEFF
                        This is important, Clarence. 

           Clarence makes an odd gesture, acknowledging nothing. Jeff 
           hesitates. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Serena asked about the health plan. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        What health plan?

                                 JEFF
                        Well, exactly. She was wondering if 
                        there was some sort of window, 
                        seeing as it’s only been...

                                 CLARENCE
                        There’s no window. It’s gone. You 
                        voted for that. So did I. 

                                 JEFF
                        I know. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        What plan did you pick up instead?

           A beat. The men stare at each other. Clarence’s eyes widen. 
           If that’s possible. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t...?

                                 JEFF
                        It’s all such a racket, Clarence. I 
                        was still deciding. And with 
                        everything else I put in...

                                 CLARENCE
                        Mother fuck. 

           Clarence SLAMS his hand against the window. To both of their 
           surprise, it results in a small CRACK. Clarence looks at his 
           hand, as if discovering he was superhuman...
                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                             (distantly)
                        Bolivia...

           Jeff shifts uncomfortably in his chair. 

                                 JEFF
                        What about...
                             (lowering his voice)
                        ...my investment? Would it be 
                        possible to -- 

           Clarence’s eyes bulge. He lifts a finger to the ceiling, 
           swirls it around, as if to say: someone is listening.

                                 CLARENCE
                        What investment...? 

           Silence. 

                                 JEFF
                        Nothing, Clarence. I must’ve been 
                        thinking about something else. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JEFF'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - DAY

           Jeff sits dejectedly before his computer. We circle behind 
           him as he types entries into Google...

                           KATHERINE CHAVEZ 

           Results pop up. He clicks on ‘images’. Nobody resembling 
           Katherine. Just a few random women. A couple weird cartoons. 

           Another search:

                        KATHERINE CHAVEZ FATHER WAR HERO

           More of the same -- and more of the cartoons. Jeff is about 
           to click on one...

           ...when a BAND of LIGHT catches his eye. Most of the blinds 
           are closed -- 

           -- but one is still open. Jeff tracks the sunlight, reflected 
           directly from the blue tower --

           -- into the aquarium. Again, threatening his White Halfmoon.

                                 JEFF
                        God. Damnit. 
           INT. JANITOR CLOSET - BEIGE BUILDING - DAY

                                 JEFF
                        Hello --!

           Jeff storms down a long service hallway, headed towards an 
           open janitor closet. A RADIO crackles from inside...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        -- hello?!

           Another step -- 

           -- and a surprisingly young woman pokes her head out. A 
           JANITOR (20s), Mexican, cute as a button -- eating her lunch.

                                 JANITOR
                        Yes? 

           A strange beat. Beyond her innocent appearance, Jeff notices 
           the name on her uniform. 

           Mona...   

           He’s momentarily lost for words. 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m...

                                 JANITOR
                        Mr. Armstrong. From the twelfth 
                        floor.

                                 JEFF
                        Yes...
                             (reasserting)
                        Look. I need you to listen. In my 
                        office -- you keep the blinds 
                        closed. Understand? Otherwise...

                                 JANITOR
                        ...the fish will die. 

           Jeff blinks. 

           The janitor rises, reassuringly, but he takes a cautious step 
           back. 

                                 JANITOR (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Armstrong - I do 
                        close your blinds, for just that 
                        reason. But...
                                 JEFF
                             (snapping)
                        -- but what? 

                                 JANITOR
                        Whenever I come back...they’re open 
                        again.

           A beat. 

                                 JEFF
                        What do you mean? 

                                 JANITOR
                        I mean, I see you...standing there. 
                        For hours.

                                 JEFF
                             (dry swallowing)
                        You’re saying...I open them? 

           The janitor smiles compassionately. 

                                 JANITOR
                        I don’t blame you. The building, 
                        it’s a nice shade of blue...
                             (taking another bite)
                        ...like the ocean.

           INT. JEFF'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - DAY

           Jeff yanks ALL the blinds, twisting the wands, plunging his 
           office into darkness.

           He returns to the glowing computer, where his Google search 
           on Katherine is still up -- yielding the strange cartoons...

           Jeff clicks one of the panels. 

           It depicts a beautiful, BUSTY WOMAN wearing an American flag 
           T-Shirt, sensually touching a man’s face. She looks 
           surprisingly like Katherine...

           The dialogue bubble reads:

                                 KATHERINE (CARTOON)
                        You may only be a man. But you can 
                        still be a hero...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           FADE IN

           EXT. ROOF - BEIGE BUILDING - SUNSET (FANTASY)

           RUMBLING...

           A woman stands at the edge of the roof, hands on her hips -- 
           cup-size generously expanded beneath a scant American flag T-
           Shirt. 

           This is Katherine, converted to look like a Latina Wonder 
           Woman. Her eyes are leveled soberly on the Blue Building. A 
           figure moves behind her --

           -- Jeff, wearing a gray suit, hair slicked back, 50’s style, 
           AK-47 slung over his shoulder. Quite out of place. 

                                 JEFF
                        What is it...?

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                             (pointing)
                        It’s growing.

           Jeff joins her on the ledge. The RUMBLING returns. Then he 
           sees it. The base of the Blue Building, shaking. PUSHING UP. 
           Producing an entirely new floor!

                                 JEFF
                        My God. Can you stop it --?

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        There’s a force field. Only you can 
                        pass through. 

                                 JEFF
                        How...?

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        You already know...

           Katherine squeezes Jeff’s hand, then gestures behind him. He 
           turns --

           INT. BEDROOM - SUBURBIA - EARLY MORNING

                                 JEFF
                        Gahhh --!

           In bed, Jeff grunts as he ejaculates all over Serena’s back. 
           She’s fast asleep. He freezes... 
           Dawn is just breaking through the curtains. Distant bird 
           calls...

           Ever so slowly, Jeff reaches for the tissue box. Sees the 
           clock. 6:01. He finds a tissue. Pulls it out...

           ...and brings it towards Serena. Almost touching her...

           ...when she ROLLS squarely onto her back. Squelch. 

           Jeff sighs. He turns away. Stares at the ceiling...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - SMALL CITY - MORNING

           Mona, decidedly sicker, lies asleep in bed. Another IV runs 
           along her arm, which we follow...

           ...past the concerned faces of Jeff and Serena, Dr. Gandhi 
           standing a few paces behind...

           ...to a bag marked CHEMOTHERAPY...

           DRIP...

           INT. PATIENT FINANCIAL - HOSPITAL - DAY

           Jeff glares at the woman across from him. BRIANNA (30’s) 
           African American. Expensive weave. A piece of lint in her 
           hair -- of which she is unaware. Brianna reads through Mona’s 
           file on her computer...

                                 BRIANNA
                        So, Mona has no insurance...
                             (looking up)
                        ...am I right?

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. 

                                 BRIANNA
                        Are you yourself insured, Mr. 
                        Armstrong? 

                                 JEFF
                        Didn’t I just say no?

                                 BRIANNA
                        No. You said Mona has no insurance. 
                        Sometimes it’s possible to add a 
                        child to work health insurance. 
                                 JEFF
                        Why would my company have 
                        insurance?

           Slightly confused, Brianna glances out the window, where the 
           Beige and Blue towers are clearly visible...

                                 BRIANNA
                        Don’t you work at...

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. 

                                 BRIANNA
                        And they don’t...

                                 JEFF
                        Not anymore. 

           Off Jeff’s seething expression, Brianna moves on -- 

                                 BRIANNA
                        Anyway... 
                             (returning to the monitor)
                        ...there are still one or two 
                        options for children with pre-
                        existing conditions. They are 
                        expensive, but they exist...
                             (looking closer at his 
                              file)
                        ...did Dr. Gandhi speak to you 
                        about the additional treatment?

                                 JEFF
                        What additional treatment? 

                                 BRIANNA
                        He has listed a progressive stem-
                        cell replacement therapy. It’s 
                        quite expensive. 

                                 JEFF
                        He didn’t say anything about that. 

                                 BRIANNA
                        Well, do speak with him.

                                 JEFF
                        He’s the one that should be 
                        speaking to me!

                                 BRIANNA
                        Okay, Mr. Armstrong. Please lower 
                        your voice. 
           Jeff stands up. Points a finger in Brianna’s face. 

                                 JEFF
                        You have lint in your hair.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - HOSPITAL - DAY

           Serena follows briskly behind Jeff, who is checking his 
           watch, irritated. She is compulsively eating a bag of APPLE 
           CHIPS. Despite her anxiety, she’s looking healthier...

                                 SERENA
                        I didn’t say anything because I 
                        knew you’d do this --

                                 JEFF
                        -- do what? 

                                 SERENA
                        Get upset! Dr. Gandhi says this 
                        treatment works 90% of the time!

                                 JEFF
                        I have to meet the inspector.

           They reach Jeff’s Geo Metro. Serena digs her hand into the 
           chip bag. 

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff, we need to do this. 

                                 JEFF
                        Serena, I may be the Vice President 
                        of a highly reputable company, but 
                        sales aren’t...

                                 SERENA
                        Aren’t what?

                                 JEFF
                        The point is, we don’t have the 
                        money. These numbers -- we’ll lose 
                        the house. We’ll lose...

                                 SERENA
                        But this is your daughter!

           She chews furiously. Jeff watches her in disgust. 

                                 JEFF
                        Why are you eating those!
                                 SERENA
                        Because I’m starving!

                                 JEFF
                        Why!!! 

           Jeff’s phone rings. He doesn’t recognize the number. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Mother fucking wrong number! Hello!
                             (a beat)
                        What? 

           In an instant, everything changes. Jeff looks to Serena. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        They found my car. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. POLICE LOT - SMALL CITY - DAY

           The Buick. Parked in front of us. And yet -- not the Buick. 

           Sure, there are traces of Jeff’s old car. But the vehicle 
           before us looks more like a rocket ship. It has been 
           completely transformed...

           ...into a STOCK CAR. 

           Jeff stands a few feet away, bewildered. 

                                 JEFF
                        What happened...?

           Officer Martinez, whom we recognize from the station, shrugs. 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        A bust early this morning. Drugs. A 
                        few guns. And this car. 

                                 JEFF
                        What time was the bust?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Around six.

           Jeff’s eyes widen. Flashing to --

           -- himself in bed, panicked, having just ejaculated on 
           Serena’s back. Reaching for the tissue. The time. 6:01

           This means something. 
                                 JEFF
                             (approaching the car)
                        You’re sure this is mine...?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Found your plates in the apartment. 
                        Same VIN. 

                                 JEFF
                        But...

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                             (smiling)
                        ...they sure did a number on it, 
                        didn’t they? I’d say a good twenty 
                        grand worth of work. 

                                 JEFF
                        My God...

           Officer Martinez hands Jeff the keys...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I can’t drive this thing --

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                             (walking away)
                        Guess you gotta learn. 

                                 JEFF
                        Officer, wait --

           Officer Martinez turns back. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                             (sincerely)
                         -- was it Mexicans? 

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Salvadorans. 

                                 JEFF
                        What’s the difference?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Go fuck yourself, pal. 

           He exits the parking lot. Leaving Jeff with...

           INT. STOCK BUICK - SMALL CITY - DAY

           ...the Stock Buick. 
           Jeff carefully lowers himself behind the wheel. The interior 
           has completely changed. There is now a WELDED ROLL CAGE, 
           DIGITAL CONSOLE, CARBON STEERING WHEEL, and a BUTTON BOX. 

           Fearfully, Jeff sets the key into the ignition. Turns it 
           over. The entire console ALIGHTS! Engine ROARS --

           -- and Jeff instinctively jerks his hands away from the 
           steering wheel. 

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        Don’t be afraid... 

           Stunned, Jeff turns to the passenger seat...

           ...where Superhero Katherine sits in her short-cut American 
           flag T-shirt. 

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        ...this was meant for you. 

           Eyes wild with confusion - and excitement - Jeff returns his 
           hands to the steering wheel. REVS the engine...

           ...and the car SCREECHES out of the parking lot!

           EXT. BEIGE BUILDING - SMALL CITY - AFTERNOON

           The Stock Buick swerves onto the street dividing the two 
           towers...

           As Jeff steers towards his building, the Blue windows reflect 
           across his windshield. He accelerates...

           ...about to enter the underground lot, when he notices 
           Katherine standing near the front doors, clipboard in hand. 
           He jerks the wheel --

           -- coming to a stop right in front of her. Katherine gawks as 
           Jeff steps out. He sizes her up. Not quite the superwoman 
           he’s cultivated in his mind. Still -- 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Good lord, is this your car --?

                                 JEFF
                             (confidently)
                        Who else? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I just didn’t realize...
                                 JEFF
                        What? 

           Katherine smiles. The flicker of attraction returning. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I just didn’t realize. 

           EXT. ROOF - BEIGE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           The pair steps onto the rooftop. It’s an exceptionally hot 
           day. Katherine shields her eyes...

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jesus...

           She puts on her sunglasses. Looks around the space. The 
           cigarette butts and coke cans come into focus. 

                                 JEFF
                        So? What do you think?

           The answer is printed on her face, which she attempts to 
           conceal. Jeff follows behind as Katherine circles the wide 
           area, marking her clipboard...

                                 KATHERINE
                        What do I think...

           They come full circle. Spinning around, Katherine smiles.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        ...I think it’s a challenge.

                                 JEFF
                             (frowning)
                        How so? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Well...how much is your employer 
                        willing to spend? 

                                 JEFF
                        Unclear. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You do realize this rooftop houses 
                        the building’s air conditioner. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        It would have to be moved. The 
                        building rewired. That’s before you 
                        could even think about a new 
                        structure up here. Also, this space 
                        is quite a bit smaller than...

                                 JEFF
                        ...don’t say it.

           Katherine averts her gaze from the Blue Building. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What about just a bar? A simple 
                        outdoor bar -- but classy. 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t think that would cut it. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Why not? 

                                 JEFF
                        We need to compete. 

                                 KATHERINE
                             (feigning ignorance)
                        With who...? 

           Jeff grits his teeth. Finally manages:

                                 JEFF
                        Them. 

           EXT. BEIGE BUILDING - SMALL CITY - AFTERNOON

           Jeff and Katherine pass through the lobby -- unassuming, 
           unimpressive -- and return to the front steps of the 
           building. She summons a bit of optimism. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Okay, first things first. Get 
                        approval to move central air and 
                        zone a new location - most likely 
                        the garage. If that happens, we can 
                        jump right back into this!

                                 JEFF
                        How long will all that take? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Depends. You might have to wait 
                        until fall to turn off the A.C. 
                                 JEFF
                        That seems like a long time. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hey, one small step, am I right? 

           Again, her Armstrong joke falls flat. Katherine sighs. They 
           walk a few more feet to Jeff’s car. It reflects in her 
           eyes... 

           Jeff’s about to get in, when --

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Armstrong. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes --

                                 KATHERINE
                        What are you doing this weekend?

           A beat. 

                                 JEFF
                        What do you mean?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Do you have plans?

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m asking if you will be busy the 
                        whole time. 

                                 JEFF
                        As opposed to doing what? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Having dinner with me. 

           Jeff opens his mouth to respond -- when the message finally 
           clicks...

           He immediately looks around to see if anyone is watching. 
           They aren’t. 

                                 JEFF
                             (lowering his voice)
                        Where...?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SMALL CITY - NIGHT

           A CREAKING door. Light spills into Mona’s hospital room...

           Jeff pokes his head in. Shades are drawn. Serena and Tara are 
           asleep next to the bed...

           ...but Mona is awake. 

           She waves at Jeff. He moves to her side -- accidentally 
           bumping the IV. Mona flinches, but nobody wakes.

                                 MONA
                             (whispering)
                        Hi dad. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hi honey. How are you feeling? 

                                 MONA
                        A little cancery. 

           Jeff smiles; pats her head. Undeniably his favorite.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Dad...

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 MONA
                        What if I don’t get better?

           The question takes him off-guard. For a moment, Jeff has to 
           look away --

           -- then, recovering, he considers a response. 

           Removing his wallet, Jeff produces the fortune from his 
           cookie...

                                 JEFF
                        Remember when I told you my dad’s 
                        advice --?

                                 MONA
                        Yeah. 

                                 JEFF
                        Look what came in my fortune cookie 
                        today.

           He hands her the paper...
                                 MONA
                             (reading)
                        Everything is possible for one who 
                        believes...woah!

                                 JEFF
                        Crazy isn’t it? So crazy it must be 
                        true.

                                 MONA
                        Yeah. 

                                 JEFF
                        Do you believe you will get better?

                                 MONA
                        Yeah. 

                                 JEFF
                        Good. Then you will.

           Jeff sits back. Rubs his face. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Know what else is crazy?

                                 MONA
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                        A bunch of Mexican rapists turned 
                        my car into a goddamned speed 
                        racer. 

                                 MONA
                        A what?

           He takes out his cellphone. Shows her a picture. 

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        That’s your car?

                                 JEFF
                        Sure is. 

           Mona looks back at her dad. Grins. 

                                 MONA
                        Cool. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ROOFTOP - BEIGE BUILDING - NIGHT (FANTASY)

           Echoing music... 

           Jeff and Superhero Katherine are right where we left them - 
           with Katherine pointing to something OFF SCREEN...

           ...only now we see the reason Jeff ‘erupted’ on his wife’s 
           back. Atop the Beige building, flanked by POTTED PALMS, 
           beneath a WHITE AWNING...

           ...is the J-CLUB. SPOTLIGHTS swing about. Sinatra plays from 
           deep inside...

                                 FRANK SINATRA (SONG)
                        ...you make me feel so young...

           In SLO-MOTION, Jeff and Superhero Katherine walk side-by-
           side...

           ...into the stunning J-Club. The place is PACKED. Socialites 
           mingle through palms, banquettes, and along a sparkling bar. 
           Everyone tips their hats as the POWER COUPLE pass through...

           ...including Clarence, seated at the bar with Daniel -- who 
           has a hand on Clarence’s leg. This produces brief confusion 
           in Jeff. He shakes it off...

           ...and steps onto the balcony. He and Katherine approach the 
           railing. We realize the Beige building is much higher than 
           usual. Far below, the faint glow of another...

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        It’s incredible. You can barely see 
                        it...

                                 JEFF
                             (smirking)
                        See what?

           Without looking, he reaches over his shoulder for a martini. 
           Finds one waiting.

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        It was a such a smart idea to make 
                        it bigger.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, I figured while we were down 
                        there...

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        It’s just so...big. 
                                 JEFF
                             (drawing closer)
                        You like it big, don’t you?

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        You know I do --

           PRELAP SFX: KNOCKING!!!

           INT. BATHROOM - HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

                                 SERENA (O.S.)
                        Jeff --?!

           Jeff freezes. He’s crammed inside the small hospital 
           bathroom, jerking off. 

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Jeff, what are you doing in there? 
                        We need to meet with Dr. Gandhi. 

                                 JEFF
                        Coming!!

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Dr. Gandhi leans across his desk. Jeff and Serena stare back 
           at him. 

                                 DR. GANDHI
                        The chemotherapy isn’t working.

           Serena immediately starts crying. She grips Jeff’s hand. 

                                 DR. GANDHI (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Armstrong, this by no means 
                        implies Mona won’t be cured. What 
                        it does mean is we need to explore 
                        those other treatments. I know this 
                        is a financial burden, but the 
                        hospital can put you on a payment 
                        plan -- 

           It takes every fiber of Jeff’s body to speak calmly. 

                                 JEFF
                        What other options do we have? 
                                 DR. GANDHI
                        Simply put, Mr. Armstrong - you 
                        don’t. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. CEO'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           Jeff sits in Clarence’s office. Staring across the desk. 
           Trying to appear patient --

           -- as Clarence attempts to operate a marijuana VAPORIZER.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Goddamnit...

           He shoves the weed deeper. Presses one of the buttons. Sucks 
           on a tube. Holds in a breath. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how to work these 
                        things --?

                                 JEFF
                        No...
                             (making sure the door is 
                              closed)
                        ...are you sure you should be doing 
                        this?

                                 CLARENCE
                             (exhaling)
                        It’s legal. 

                                 JEFF
                        Sure, but...

                                 CLARENCE
                        This is the new martini lunch. 

                                 JEFF
                        Right...

                                 CLARENCE
                        ...though it’s easier to tell if a 
                        martini’s working...

                                 JEFF
                        Clarence - did you have time to 
                        consider moving central air? 

           A long pause. Clarence stares back at him. 
                                 CLARENCE
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                        Central air. Moving it to the 
                        basement. I know we’d lose some 
                        parking spaces...

           Clarence nods...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        ...but there’s plenty above ground, 
                        and new units take up less space. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Sure...

                                 JEFF
                        ...sure, yes?

           Now Clarence is shaking his head. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        No. 

                                 JEFF
                        No?

                                 CLARENCE
                             (blinking)
                        Armstrong, I love the initiative. 
                        But I thought you were talking 
                        about one of those things...

                                 JEFF
                        What things?

           Clarence starts opening his hands, in a ‘bursting’ motion. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        ...what do they call them? 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t know...

           A smile spreads across Clarence’s lips. He starts to giggle.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Me neither. 

                                 JEFF
                        Are you saying I should give this 
                        up? 
           Disappointment ripples through his voice. Clarence can feel 
           the vibrations. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        No. No, Armstrong. Don’t give up.

                                 JEFF
                        Okay...

                                 CLARENCE
                        Just let me crunch a few more 
                        numbers. 

           Not wanting to push it further, Jeff gets up and heads to the 
           door. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Hey Armstrong --

           He turns back. Clarence grins. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        -- it’s definitely working. 

           INT. ACCOUNTING - BEIGE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           Footsteps down a linoleum hallway...

           Jeff reaches a door labeled: ACCOUNTING. He lifts a fist, 
           then pauses. Curses under his breath. KNOCKS...

                                 KIM LEE (O.S.)
                        Come in!

           EXT. ACCOUNTING - BEIGE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           The wide room is a sea of papers, stacked floor to ceiling. 
           In the center sits KIM LEE (60’s), Chinese, spectacled, 
           perched behind a MACINTOSH CLASSIC. Rubber-band stacks of 
           FLOPPY DISKS form a cityscape across his desk. 

                                 KIM LEE
                        Yes --?

                                 JEFF
                        Kim, I’d like to talk. 

                                 KIM LEE
                        About what? 
                                 JEFF
                             (lowering his voice)
                        About...the investment.

           Silence. Kim’s face twists into deep concern...

           ...eyes drawing Jeff’s attention to a MAN (40’s) in a NAVY 
           BLUE SUIT - previously unseen - sifting through files. Kim 
           narrows his brow.

                                 KIM LEE
                             (charged)
                        What investment?

           Blue Suit is now staring straight at them.

                                 JEFF
                        Did I say investment? 

                                 KIM LEE
                        I’m not sure what you said. 

                                 JEFF
                        Neither am I. 

           Jeff backs out of the room. Blue Suit watches...

           ...as Jeff enters the hallway. Walking away. Faster and 
           faster. The linoleum floor blurs beneath him...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT./INT. STOCK BUICK - FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

           Asphalt flies beneath the Stock Buick. The road is empty, 
           surrounded by dry, golden hills. Not a cloud in the sky.   

           Inside the car, the new digital console streams with 
           information:

                     WATER: 84.5 - P OIL - 3.4 - LAP 1:18

           Completely mystified, Jeff reaches for the CD Player. No 
           longer there. In its place: a brand-new stereo with no 
           discernible buttons. He taps the blank screen. 

                                 JEFF
                             (frustrated)
                        Turn on. 

           That does it -- voice activation. 
                                 STEREO (VOICE)
                        Connected. Searching. For. Phone.

                                 JEFF
                        What...?

           He notices his phone LIGHT UP on the passenger seat. 

                                 STEREO (VOICE)
                        Found. Playing. Playlist. For. Dad. 

           Jeff lifts his hands in confusion -- 

           -- when the first HARPSICHORD notes of “You Still Believe in 
           Me” by The Beach Boys comes into the car...

                                 THE BEACH BOYS (SONG)
                        I know perfectly well I’m not where 
                        I should be...

           Body tense with protest, Jeff stares at the stereo...

                                 THE BEACH BOYS (SONG) (CONT’D)
                        ...I’ve been very aware you’ve been 
                        patient with me...

           ...but slowly, the muscles loosen. He likes this song. 
           Lowering the window, breeze circulates the car. He sits 
           back...

           ...and we rise above the Buick, higher and higher, until we 
           can see, far beyond the rolling hills, the SPARKLING SEA...

           EXT. SEASIDE TOWN - SUNSET

           Seagull cries. Lapping waves. Distant BARKING...

           Jeff gets out of his car, face painted with the falling 
           light. He takes a SHOPPING BAG from the backseat, then moves 
           towards an idyllic view...

           ...a quiet COVE, with a pier stretching into the blue water. 
           A RESTAURANT perched at the end. Under the posts, lazy SEALS 
           bark their complaints...

           Jeff walks down a rocky outcropping to the edge of the surf. 
           He takes in a deep breath of salty air...

           Down below, a few families enjoy the beach. One in 
           particular...
           ...a MOTHER and FATHER, sitting beneath a striped umbrella. 
           Swimwear oddly outdated. The husband is passed out, beer in 
           hand... 

           ...while the mother, sunglasses on, watches her only SON play 
           in the surf. He splashes about, LAUGHING at his freedom...

           The ocean SPARKLES. The mother smiles at her son, lovingly... 

           ...her white swimsuit lacy as the Halfmoon. Hint of a BRUISE 
           behind her sunglasses...

           A strange look comes over Jeff. He focuses again on the pier. 
           Squints. 

           He’s been here before...

           INT. THE OLD INN RESTAURANT - PIER - SUNSET

                                 KATHERINE
                        What do you think --?

           Jeff and Katherine sit at a table, next to windows 
           overlooking the water. She wears a green summer dress, 
           complimenting her slender shoulders -- but Jeff isn’t looking 
           at her. He’s transfixed by the waves...

                                 JEFF
                             (absently)
                        It’s nice. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        There’s something in your eye...

           Confused, Jeff lifts the back of his spoon to inspect. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                             (chuckling)
                        No, I mean -- like you’re thinking 
                        about something. 

                                 JEFF
                        Oh...

           He returns to the view. Shakes his head...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        It’s the strangest thing...

                                 KATHERINE
                        What --?
                                 WAITER (O.S.)
                        Good evening, you two!

           The WAITER (40’s) steps forward, interrupting the moment. 

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Can I start you off with sparkling, 
                        flat, or tap? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Oh, geez. I wouldn’t mind -- 

                                 JEFF
                        Tap. 

           A bit disappointed, the waiter walks away. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        You were saying...? 

                                 JEFF
                        Forget it. 
                             (eyeing the waiter)
                        These fuckers try to get you at 
                        every turn, don’t they? 

           Katherine smiles. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I figured out who you reminded me 
                        of. All your little ticks. 

                                 JEFF
                        Who?

           She lowers her voice, as if betraying a dirty secret. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        My dad. 

                                 JEFF
                        The war hero? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes. 

           Jeff shrugs approvingly.  

                                 JEFF
                        My grandfather, he flew in WWII.
                             (a beat)
                        What was he like...?
                                 KATHERINE
                        My dad? 

           She runs through a list of adjectives. Settles on:

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Confusing. A good heart, but talked 
                        one way and acted another. What do 
                        you think is more important?

                                 JEFF
                        Which?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Words or actions?

                                 JEFF
                        I think you should say what you 
                        mean. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What if you don’t know what you 
                        mean?

                                 JEFF
                        Then how the fuck can you know 
                        anything at all? 

           Jeff picks up the menu. Scans the prices. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. 

           LATER

           Night has fallen. White lights glitter across the water. The 
           waiter reaches down to take plates --

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Hold on a damn second --

           Jeff grabs a piece of bread, sopping up the rest of his steak 
           juices. The Waiter tries to conceal his distaste, while 
           Katherine watches with amusement. Another of those ticks --  

           After permission is granted, the waiter disappears and Jeff 
           returns his attention to the water -- consternation 
           reappearing...

                                 KATHERINE
                        What’s the matter, Jeff...?

                                 JEFF
                        Why did you pick this place? 
                                 KATHERINE
                        I don’t know. It’s far away...

           She reaches over. Places a hand upon his. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        So. Are you going to ask me? 

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Why I brought you here. 

           Jeff stares back at her. For a long time...

                                 JEFF
                        You know I’m married. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I do. 

                                 JEFF
                        That doesn’t bother you?

                                 KATHERINE
                        It does. 

           They continue to look at each other...

           ...until Jeff reaches under the table -- and produces the 
           SHOPPING BAG. Hands it to Katherine. 

           Surprised, she lifts out something wrapped in tissue paper. 
           Opens it up.

           A wry smile moves across her lips...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. SEASIDE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Wearing a tight AMERICAN FLAG T-SHIRT, Katherine lies on the 
           motel bed, knees to her chest, with Jeff on top of her -- 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes...do it...!!

           Jeff grunts. Eyes blinking. In front of him, above the 
           headboard, is a rather odd painting...

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        ...for your country...!
           ...of a TREE filled with FURRY CREATURES. Sharp little teeth. 
           It displeases Jeff. He hears a strange CHATTERING  -- 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        What...is it...?

           Jeff looks back down. Katherine coming in and out of focus...

                                 JEFF
                        I was just...wondering...

                                 KATHERINE
                        ...yes...

           THRUST...

                                 JEFF
                        ...what did...your father do...

                                 KATHERINE
                             (confused)
                        ...yes?!

           THRUST...

                                 JEFF
                        ...in the military...?

                                 KATHERINE
                        He doesn’t...like to...

           THRUST...

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        ...talk about it!!!

           They both CLIMAX simultaneously!

           PRELAP MUSIC: “Pipeline” by The Chantays...

           EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

           Reverb-drenched SURF GUITAR cascades like a waterfall as Jeff 
           PEELS onto the freeway. The MOTEL SIGN fades from sight...

           He’s feeling good. Real good. Speeding through the night, the 
           console of TURBO BUTTONS illuminates his face...

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        Do you see...?

           Jeff looks over --
           -- to find Superhero Katherine sitting in the passenger seat, 
           still sweaty from the sex. She PRESSES down on his leg, 
           causing him to accelerate...

                                 JEFF
                        See what --?

           Superhero Katherine runs her hand over a BRIGHT RED BUTTON...

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        Push it...

                                 JEFF
                        Are you sure --?

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        Push it, fag!

           Alarmed, he obeys -- and is instantly THRUST back! A BOOSTER 
           explodes, and the Buick ZOOMS past 100 MPH! 

                                 JEFF
                        Son of a bitch --!!

           Jeff can barely handle the turns, but wildness has returned 
           to his eyes! 

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                             (pointing)
                        Look...

           -- and now he sees it. Hanging in the sky: the gigantic 
           SPEEDWAY SCREEN. It reads -- $100,000 TO THE WINNER!!! 

           Now the dots connect. Jeff gets it! He grips Superhero 
           Katherine’s hand -- so tightly she tries to pull it away --

                                 JEFF
                        I see!!!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - JEFF’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Birds chirping. Aerosol cans spraying...

           In morning sweatpants, Tara steps curiously onto the front 
           porch. She walks towards the Stock Buick, parked in the 
           driveway. 

                                 TARA
                        Dad...?
           She finds Jeff on his knees, spray-painting letters through a 
           STENCIL. We can’t quite make out the word...

                                 JEFF
                             (looking up)
                        Good morning, surfer girl. 

                                 TARA
                        What are you doing?

           Jeff lifts up his phone. 

                                 JEFF
                        Did you put music on here for me?

                                 TARA
                        Like, two years ago. 

                                 JEFF
                        I like it. 

                                 TARA
                             (shrugging)
                        Cool. 

           She goes back inside. Wiping off his hands, Jeff gets up to 
           admire his handiwork. The door opens again...

           ...and this time, it’s Serena, in workout clothes. She’s 
           looking quite fit. A BOOK tucked under her arm. 

           The Medical Bill Survival Guide...

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff...

                                 JEFF
                             (absently)
                        -- what?

                                 SERENA
                        Did you even come home last night? 

                                 JEFF
                        Of course I did. Slept on the sofa. 
                        Didn’t want to wake you. 

                                 SERENA
                        What kept you so late? 

                                 JEFF
                        Serena, I’m trying to make money 
                        for this family. 
                                 SERENA
                        So am I --
                             (tapping the book)
                        -- turns out there’s all sorts of 
                        subsidies that can help with -- 

                                 JEFF
                             (interrupting)
                        That’s great. But we don’t need 
                        help. We need action. 

                                 SERENA
                        Action. Is that what you were 
                        getting at two in the morning? 

                                 JEFF
                        No.
                             (reconsidering)
                        I mean -- yes. And you know what? I 
                        succeeded. 

           He ushers her over, proudly gesturing to the new name: MONA. 

                                 SERENA
                        What am I looking at?

                                 JEFF
                        Do you see it?

                                 SERENA
                        I see our daughter’s name on a 
                        ridiculous car...

           Now she realizes...

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        ...you’re going to sell it! That’s 
                        so smart! I’m sure you could get --

                                 JEFF
                             (cutting her off)
                        I’m not going to sell it. 

                                 SERENA
                        What, then? 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m going to race it. 

           A long pause. Serena stares at her husband. 

                                 SERENA
                        You’re a fucking idiot. 
           She goes back inside. 

                                 JEFF
                             (calling after)
                        I don’t like that language!

           EXT. SPEEDWAY - SMALL CITY - AFTERNOON

           Smoking. Vaping. Brown bagging...

           It’s early, but clumps of fans are already hanging out in the 
           speedway parking lot -- when the grumbling of a RESTLESS 
           ENGINE draws attention. Everyone turns their heads...  

           ...and their jaws drop. WHISTLES and SHOUTS!!!

           Jeff nervously drives his Stock Buick down the aisle, pulling 
           into the spot from his previous visit. Cutting the engine, he 
           checks the rearview --

           -- making sure the Police Officer is still posted in front of 
           the track. Then he shifts focus to the parking lot. Just as 
           he’d hoped --

           -- the same group of Latinos, led by Carlos, are hanging 
           beside their souped-up Civic. 

           Jeff steps out. He’s wearing a vintage BOMBER JACKET and 
           AVIATORS. Probably his grandfather’s. His version of tough. 

           Walking cautiously towards Carlos, Jeff keeps looking over 
           his shoulder. Carlos stares back, agape...

                                 CARLOS
                        Bro...

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t want any trouble --
                             (pointing)
                        -- I know the cop, remember? 

                                 CARLOS
                        So do we. He protects us.

                                 JEFF
                        From who? 

                                 CARLOS
                             (of Jeff’s clothes)
                        From weird fucking zombie test 
                        pilots. 

           Jeff gives him a flat look. 
                                 JEFF
                        Do you remember me? 

                                 CARLOS
                        Sure, I remember you...
                             (glancing at the Buick)
                        ...but I don’t remember that. 

           As the boys swarm around the Buick, Jeff steps closer to 
           Carlos, lowering his voice...

                                 JEFF
                        Look, I need something. I need...

                                 CARLOS
                        Help --?

           Jeff winces at the word. He places $20 in Carlos’ hand....

                                 JEFF
                        I need to know what I’m driving - 
                        and how to drive it. 

           Carlos, a quick study, glances down at the bill. 

                                 CARLOS
                        That’s not a lot of money, bro. 

           Jeff’s eyes dim. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The family sits around the dinner table, eating LASAGNA. Mona 
           lifts a bite to her mouth. Due to the chemo, all of her hair 
           is gone. The food is about to reach her mouth --

           -- when her hand starts shaking. She drops the food back onto 
           her plate, splattering a little on the tablecloth. 

                                 MONA
                        Sorry...

                                 SERENA
                        Don’t be sorry, sweetie.

                                 JEFF
                        You need some help?

                                 TARA
                        I’ve got it --
           Tara slides over, lifting a bite to Mona’s lips - who smiles 
           and chews. Serena clutches Jeff’s hand under the table. 

                                 SERENA
                        Feel good to be home, love? 

                                 MONA
                        Smells better.
                             (chewing)
                        Lasagna tastes different... 

                                 SERENA
                        It’s homemade! 

           Jeff starts to chew a little slower. Mona smiles at him. 

                                 MONA
                        Dad...?

                                 JEFF
                             (distracted)
                        Yes?

                                 MONA
                        How come my name is on your car?

                                 JEFF
                        Because, I’ve found a way to help 
                        you feel better --
                             (to Serena)
                        -- I knew this tasted different. 

                                 MONA
                        How?

                                 JEFF
                        Something about the noodles.

                                 MONA
                        No, how will you help me feel 
                        better?

                                 JEFF
                        By winning the race, of course!

                                 SERENA
                        It doesn’t taste different. It 
                        tastes better. 

                                 MONA
                        Really?!

                                 JEFF
                        Different does not mean better.
                                 TARA
                        Dad -- how are you gonna win a 
                        race? You don’t know how. 

                                 JEFF
                        I found an expert. Been at the 
                        track forever. 

                                 SERENA
                        And there’s money in this? 

                                 JEFF
                        It isn’t all about money, Serena. 

                                 SERENA
                        I thought that’s exactly what this  
                        is about. 

                                 JEFF
                        And I thought lasagna was supposed 
                        to taste like lasagna. 

                                 SERENA
                        If you’ve only had frozen lasagna, 
                        then you don’t know what it tastes 
                        like!

                                 MONA
                        Dad, can I come to the races?

                                 JEFF
                        Of course!

                                 MONA
                        But what if I’m too sick...? 

                                 JEFF
                        You won’t be. 

                                 MONA
                        How do you know? 

                                 JEFF
                        Same way I know what real lasagna 
                        tastes like. 

                                 SERENA
                        And that is?

                                 JEFF
                        Because I know. 
           INT. BEDROOM - JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff...?

           Lying in bed, Jeff’s face is illuminated by his phone. Serena 
           looks at him from the her side. 

                                 JEFF
                             (absently)
                        What --?

                                 SERENA
                        I’m afraid. 

                                 JEFF
                        Of what?

                                 SERENA
                        What if the new treatment doesn’t 
                        work? 

                                 JEFF
                        Muhammad said it works over 90% of 
                        the time. 

                                 SERENA
                        Gandhi --
                             (Jeff rolls his eyes)
                        -- and that’s still not 100%. You 
                        don’t seem very worried, Jeff. 

                                 JEFF
                        Excuse me? 

                                 SERENA
                        You don’t! You crack jokes like 
                        it’s nothing.

                                 JEFF
                        You mean, I don’t break down crying 
                        every time Mona speaks? One of us 
                        has to be strong, Serena. 

                                 SERENA
                        Yes, but -- 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m more concerned about making 
                        sure we still have a home for Mona 
                        when she does get better. 
                                 SERENA
                        But didn’t you talk to Clarence 
                        about the investment --?

                                 JEFF
                             (finger to his lips)
                        Shhh...

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff -- who do you think is 
                        listening? 

                                 JEFF
                        You never know. 

                                 SERENA
                        What are you talking about? 

           Setting aside his cellphone, Jeff shuffles closer. Whispers 
           into Serena’s ears. 

                                 JEFF
                        I think the company’s being 
                        audited...

                                 SERENA
                        So...?

                                 JEFF
                        So...there are things I haven’t 
                        told you about the you-know-what. 

                                 SERENA
                        What kind of things...?

                                 JEFF
                        A plan. Clarence and I came up with 
                        it. And a couple other guys. That’s 
                        why we’re strapped. But if it works 
                        out -- this cancer won’t mean a 
                        damn thing. 

                                 SERENA
                        It won’t? 

                                 JEFF
                        No. It won’t. 

                                 SERENA
                        But is what you’re doing - is it...
                                 JEFF
                        Serena, what do you think those 
                        bastards across the street are 
                        doing every day? It’s war out there 
                        -- and if we’re going to stay 
                        afloat, we have to take risks. 

           A beat. Serena realizes she’s closer to Jeff, at least in 
           proximity, than she’s been in months. 

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff...

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 SERENA
                        Do you notice anything different 
                        about me? 

                                 JEFF
                        It’s dark. 

                                 SERENA
                        But recently -- anything? 

                                 JEFF
                        Well, I know this hasn’t been easy 
                        for you...

           She lifts a gentle hand to his face. 

                                 SERENA
                        No. But I figure, if you can do 
                        something difficult during hard 
                        times, then you can do it anytime. 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t know what you mean...

                                 SERENA
                        I got through to CHIP. It’s this 
                        government program. Took twenty 
                        calls, but it looks like they might 
                        help bridge the gap. Also...
                             (a beat)
                        ...I’ve lost over fifteen pounds. I 
                        weigh as much as on our honeymoon!

                                 JEFF
                        Really?
                                 SERENA
                        Yes, really. I was thinking about 
                        that the other day. The beach where 
                        we stayed...

           Jeff tightens up.

                                 JEFF
                        What about it? 

                                 SERENA
                        Remember those paintings in the 
                        hotel? Of those weird creatures in 
                        the trees...?

                                 JEFF
                        No...

           The RINGING slowly returns to his ears...

                                 SERENA
                        ...you don’t? I do. They were so 
                        crazy. Little puffballs with sharp 
                        teeth. What were those things?

           That’s enough. Jeff rolls back to his corner. 

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        What --?

                                 JEFF
                        Nothing. 

           He picks his phone back up. 

                                 SERENA
                        What did I say? 

                                 JEFF
                        You didn’t say anything. I’m just 
                        tired. 

           Serena’s hope for romance lingers, then evaporates. She 
           returns to her side, eyes glistening under the moonlight...

           Jeff discreetly flips through his phone -- the CARTOONS that 
           inspired SUPERHERO KATHERINE. In impossibly short shorts. 
           Flying through the air...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. CLIFFS - SMALL CITY - SUNSET (FANTASY)

           ...Superhero Katherine lands on a cliff top. In front of her: 
           Jeff’s silhouette, AK-47 slung over his shoulder, staring 
           beyond the edge. The ground TREMBLES...

           Drawing closer, Superhero Katherine sees what he’s looking 
           at...

           ...the two towers, shimmering against heat waves. There are 
           no other buildings. No roads. No cars. Just the towers 
           amongst a wasteland...

                                 JEFF
                        It’s growing again... 

           More TREMBLING. Superhero Katherine sees the Blue Building 
           burst from the ground, sprouting until it’s the tallest, once 
           again. 

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        If it’s always growing, how can we 
                        stop it? 

           Jeff’s about to answer -- when he sees Katherine’s exposed 
           legs. 

                                 JEFF
                        Nice shorts... 

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        Thanks. 

                                 JEFF
                        Where’d you get them? 

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE
                        I’m not really sure...

           Jeff returns his focus to the towers.

                                 JEFF
                        There’s only one way we can stop 
                        them now...

           PRELAP SFX: Sound of a POWERFUL ENGINE...

           EXT. ABANDONED TRACK - DAY

           -- as the exhaust pipe KICKS OUT! 
           Beneath a cloudless sky, on an abandoned track outside of 
           town, Carlos sits behind the wheel of the Stock Buick. Jeff 
           is beside him...

           ...watching curiously as Carlos leans against the steering 
           wheel, feeling the hum of horsepower...

                                 CARLOS
                        Nice, bro. Very nice...

           He cuts the engine. Takes a long pull on his VAPORIZER, 
           exhaling a cloud that envelops Jeff’s entire body. 

                                 JEFF
                        Thanks. 

           Carlos emerges from the haze. 

                                 CARLOS
                        They chopped this thing up pro-
                        style. This’ll get you an 8.5, no 
                        problem.
                             (off Jeff’s expression)
                        That’s a drag race time. Eight 
                        point five seconds. Very good. 

                                 JEFF
                        Good enough to get me the hundred 
                        grand?

                                 CARLOS
                        What hundred grand?

                                 JEFF
                        A hundred grand -- isn’t that what 
                        you win for a race?

           Carlos starts laughing. Loud enough to COUGH on his 
           vaporizer. He disappears in the cloud...

           ...and reemerges, still laughing.

                                 CARLOS
                        Bro, you don’t get paid to race. 
                        You pay to race. 

                                 JEFF
                        The hell are you talking about? I 
                        saw the screen! $100,000 jackpot!

                                 CARLOS
                        That’s just some bullshit casino 
                        ad.
                                 JEFF
                        What casino?

                                 CARLOS
                        The one built by those blue 
                        building guys. 

           Jeff looks at him in horror...

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        You want a money race -- you gotta 
                        find dudes with money. Those are 
                        bad dudes. Probably the same ones 
                        who took your ride in the first 
                        place!

                                 JEFF
                        You know how to find them? 

                                 CARLOS
                        Why...?

                                 JEFF
                        I need the money - and I think I 
                        could win. 

                                 CARLOS
                        What the fuck makes you think that?

                                 JEFF
                        Because, Carlos -- I believe in 
                        myself, and everything is possible 
                        for someone who believes. 

                                 CARLOS
                        You sound like a goddamned fortune 
                        cookie. 

                                 JEFF
                        Just show me what the fuck to do. 

           Carlos shrugs. Turns the key. REVS the engine --!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CITY PLANNERS OFFICE - SMALL CITY - DAY

           Invigorated, Jeff speeds the Stock Buick down the freeway...

                                 BEACH BOYS (SONG)
                        ...wouldn’t it be nice if we were 
                        older...
           Taking the next exit, he circles into a Business Park...

           ...parking before the City Planners office. He grab’s a new 
           SHOPPING BAG from the backseat, about to get out...

           -- when he sees Katherine exiting the front door. Jeff 
           smiles, excited to see her. Then he realizes --

           -- she isn’t alone. She’s walking beside someone. Someone 
           Jeff recognizes...

           The man in the blue suit. 

                                 JEFF
                        What the fuck...?

           He slides behind the wheel - as if the Buick didn’t stand out 
           enough. Luckily, the pair heads the opposite direction, 
           pulling out in a Blue Mercedes. 

           Jeff pursues... 

           EXT. BLUE BUILDING - SMALL CITY - DAY

           The Mercedes enters the turn-around of the Blue Building, 
           shimmering brilliantly in the sunlight. Katherine and Blue 
           Suit get out, hand the keys to a valet, and enter...

           Jeff parks a good distance from the entrance -- absolutely 
           speechless. He is torn. He doesn’t want to go inside. 

           But he has no choice...

           INT. LOBBY - THE BLUE BUILDING - DAY

           It’s spectacular...

           The lobby hums with the cheerful rhythms of steady commerce. 
           No apathetic staff at the front desk. No wood-paneled walls. 
           In fact -- no walls at all. Just massive LCD SCREENS, 
           projecting ENVIRONMENTS that shift every few minutes...

           A tropical beach. An evergreen forest. A European hillside... 

                                 DOORMAN (O.S.)
                        Here for the club, sir?

           Jeff wheels around. A pleasant MEXICAN MAN (50s) smiles back 
           at him. 

                                 JEFF
                        What --?
                                 DOORMAN
                        The club. Are you here for lunch? 
                        The elevator is right over there. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - THE BLUE BUILDING - DAY

           The spacious elevator shoots up. Only one button: TOWER CLUB. 
           It’s nicer than most apartments. But that’s not the worst 
           part. The worst part is the music playing overhead...

                                 FRANK SINATRA (SONG)
                        ...you make me feel so young. You 
                        make me feel so Spring has 
                        sprung...

           Blood drains from Jeff’s face...

           INT. TOWER CLUB - THE BLUE BUILDING - DAY

           The doors open. Jeff steps out...

           ...and can’t believe his eyes. 

           This is not the club he saw online. To the contrary. It looks 
           nearly identical to the ‘J CLUB’ from his dreams! Potted 
           palms. Beautiful woodwork. And goddamned FRANK SINATRA, 
           continuing to play...

                                 FRANK SINATRA (SONG)
                        ...you and I are just like a couple 
                        of tots, running across the 
                        meadow...

           A panoramic window spreads to his right, displaying the 
           entire city. Horrified, Jeff walks towards it. Gets within an 
           inch of the glass...

           ...and there it is. Far below: the Beige Building. Innocuous. 
           Insignificant. Inferior...

                                 JEFF
                        My God...

           Pale and disoriented, Jeff tries to get back to the elevator, 
           but is intercepted by a BLONDE HOSTESS (20’s), smartly 
           dressed, piercing BLUE EYES --

                                 HOSTESS
                        Welcome to the Tower Club, sir! 
                        First time? 
                                 JEFF
                        How do you know that...? 

           He slams his hand against the elevator button. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        We know our members -- but you’ve 
                        got that prospective look. Care for 
                        an application?

                                 JEFF
                             (repeatedly pressing the 
                              button)
                        This place -- it’s not supposed to 
                        look like this...

                                 HOSTESS
                        We recently renovated. Decided to 
                        take a more classical approach.

                                 JEFF
                        Classical...?

                                 HOSTESS
                        Yes. Modern can scare some people 
                        away. Better to keep it a bit -- 
                        what’s the expression? Old school. 

           DING! The elevator doors open, and Jeff throws himself 
           inside, gasping for breath. Just before the doors close --

           -- he sees someone coming from the bathroom. Stopping before 
           him. Katherine. Her face painted with shock and surprise. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jeff...?

           The doors close. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. CEO'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

                                 JEFF
                        Something is going the fuck on, 
                        Clarence. 

           Jeff is pacing back and forth in Clarence’s office. Behind 
           his desk, Clarence appears concerned -- at least, for a man 
           who’s drinking scotch at 1 p.m. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        What’s the problem, pal...? 
                                 JEFF
                        That woman - the city planner who I 
                        brought up here. She’s eating with 
                        the blue man right now. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Who --?

           Behind Jeff, Clarence can see Daniel peaking inside -- 
           concerned. Clarence winks, waving him away...

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Who is the blue man --?

           Jeff stops pacing. Gets closer to the desk. 

                                 JEFF
                        The one going through Kim’s papers 
                        in accounting. Are we being 
                        audited, Clarence? Are we being -- 

                                 CLARENCE
                        What were you doing in accounting?

                                 JEFF
                             (defensively)
                        I wanted to make sure there wasn’t 
                        some sort of company loan plan. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Company loan? 

                                 JEFF
                        To bridge the goddamned gap! I’ve 
                        got nothing, Clarence! My kid’s 
                        sick, and the only hope I have is 
                        pulling a 2.0 in 8.6.
                             (off Clarence’s confusion)
                        It’s a racing term. Forget it. 

           Clarence rises from his desk. He pours two glasses of scotch. 
           Hands one to Jeff, then leads him over to the window...

           ...where they both look upon the Blue Building. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Look at that building, Jeff. What 
                        do you see?

                                 JEFF
                        You know what I see. 
                                 CLARENCE
                        That’s good. That’s the right 
                        instinct. And yet, if you were to 
                        look closer. If you were to get 
                        right up close to those windows, 
                        what would you see...?

                                 JEFF
                        Them. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        No, Armstrong. The glass is 
                        reflective. 

                                 JEFF
                             (deducing)
                        Myself...?

                                 CLARENCE
                        Exactly. 

           Clarence downs his scotch. Let’s out a gasp of pleasure. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Scotland...
                             (turning to Jeff)
                        Armstrong, when I asked you to risk 
                        everything on our ‘deal’, I told 
                        you not to ask too many questions, 
                        didn’t I? 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        And why did you agree? 

           Jeff starts to answer, then realizes: he’s not quite sure. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell you why. Because you and 
                        I made the same mistakes. Married 
                        too young. Had kids because we 
                        thought we should. Now we stand 
                        here trying to figure a goddamned 
                        way out. And there is only one way 
                        out. 

                                 JEFF
                        War?

                                 CLARENCE
                             (smiling)
                        Money. 
           Noticing Jeff hasn’t taken a sip, Clarence obliges - draining 
           the second glass. 

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Hold on a little longer. This is 
                        all going to work out. Not in the 
                        way you think. But it’s going to 
                        work out...

           INT. JEFF'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           GLUG...GLUG...

           Oxygen bubbles rise in Jeff’s fish thank, originating from 
           the WWII plane. They break upon the surface...

           Distraught, Jeff shoves into his dark office. Grabs a bottle 
           of water. Gulps it down. Wipes his brow. Only to notice...

           ...one of his metal blinds is bent - producing a peephole to 
           the blue tower. 

           Allowing a single beam of light to penetrate the aquarium....

           ...where two DEAD FISH now float on the surface.

                                 JEFF
                        No...

           Jeff rushes over, scanning the rest of the tank. He lets out 
           a sigh of relief. 

           The White Halfmoon is still alive, albeit worse for wear. Her 
           fin is oddly shredded. As if something has taken a bite...

           GLUG...GLUG...

           The familiar RINGING rises in Jeff’s ears...

           Placing the dead fish in the trash, Jeff finds himself 
           crouching behind the aquarium. 

           Eyeing the blue tower through its watery filter...

           GLUG...GLUG...

           ...watching as the next air bubble MUSHROOMS up. Perfectly 
           aligned with the blue building. To his surprise, it takes on 
           the form...

           ...of a nuclear explosion. 
           Jeff cocks his head. He waits for another bubble to rise, 
           enveloping the Blue Building in a beautiful atomic cloud...

           He smiles. 

           PRELAP SFX: EXPLOSIONS -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABANDONED TRACK - DAY

           Jeff REVS the engine...

           The Stock Buick is back on the abandoned track. This time, 
           Jeff is behind the wheel. Carlos watches nervously from the 
           passenger seat, lips hovering above his Vaporizer. 

                                 CARLOS
                        All right. Now remember what I 
                        said. First, we...

           SCREECH!!! 

           Jeff floors the gas! Carlos is knocked back, as Jeff zooms 
           towards a distant pair of CONES. He reaches for the RED 
           BUTTON --

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        -- don’t!

           He presses it. The booster sends them straight past the 
           cones, towards a sharp turn. Strangling the wheel...

           ...Jeff slams the breaks - but turns too quickly. The car 
           goes into a spin! Both men shout at the top of their lungs!!!

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Carlos sits beside the steaming car, shaking his head. Jeff 
           looks at him with a bit of adolescent shame...

                                 JEFF
                        Sorry...

                                 CARLOS
                        Why am I here?

                                 JEFF
                        I wanted to show you what I could 
                        do...
                                 CARLOS
                        You don’t know what you can do. 
                        This shit’s dangerous, man. And 
                        it’s not all about going fast. You 
                        can lose by going too fast. 

                                 JEFF
                        That doesn’t make any sense. 

           Carlos spits. 

                                 CARLOS
                        I got a trick for you. It’s easy to 
                        remember. You ready?

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. 

                                 CARLOS
                        If you listen when someone is 
                        talking, it helps you understand 
                        what the fuck they’re saying. 

           Carlos gets up. Leans against the car. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        Now. Let’s talk about racing...

           Reaching into his pocket, he produces a notepad full of 
           chicken scratch. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        I wrote down some notes...

                                 JEFF
                        Really?

                                 CARLOS
                        You’re paying me, aren’t you? Here 
                        it goes. Drag racing...it’s about 
                        going against your instincts. 

                                 JEFF
                        Okay...

                                 CARLOS
                             (reading)
                        You want to grab the wheel tight, 
                        but you gotta keep it light... 

                                 JEFF
                        Nice rhyme. 

           Carlos shoves the pad back in his pocket. 
                                 CARLOS
                        -- fuck it, the point is, you turn 
                        too far left, you want to correct 
                        hard right. Right? But you can’t. 

                                 JEFF
                        Why not --?

                                 CARLOS
                        Because this shit’s about control. 
                        You overreact, you’re done. A drag 
                        race is one choice stretched over a 
                        quarter mile. So you gotta be...I 
                        don’t know. Centered. In control.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m in control. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Really? Seems like you’re going 
                        through all kinds of midlife shit. 
                        What’s the plural for crisis?

                                 JEFF
                        Crises. 

                                 CARLOS
                        That’s you. Anyway, once it’s in 
                        motion, that’s when you’re making 
                        split-second decisions. You’re 
                        adjusting, but in small ways. You 
                        also gotta watch how the other 
                        guy’s driving. 

                                 JEFF
                        Why? I’m in my lane, he’s in his. 

                                 CARLOS
                        You hope. We’re crossing lines all 
                        the time. Maybe you’d like to think 
                        there’s a barrier, but there isn’t. 
                        Just paint on the concrete. 

           Jeff stares at Carlos. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        All right. Let’s start over. 

           INT. BEDROOM - JEFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jeff lies in bed, looking at his cellphone. Circling towards 
           the screen, we expect to see something Katherine-related...
           ...but instead, we see photos of RALLY CARS. Jeff is looking 
           at stats. Drive times. 

                                 SERENA (O.S.)
                        Ow --!

           Jeff glances at the bathroom door. A seam of light 
           underneath. 

                                 JEFF
                        What are you doing in there?

           No response. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Serena? You’ve been in there --

           The door opens. Serena steps out...

           ...wearing BLACK LINGERIE. Garters. Tassels. The whole thing. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Jesus -- 

           Jeff sits up. Completely surprised. She grins, pleased at his 
           response. She walks over to his side of the bed, running a 
           hand over the lower sheets. 

                                 SERENA
                        What do you think...? 

                                 JEFF
                        I...

           Turning off the overhead light, Serena slides into bed next 
           to him. Puts her arm across his chest. 

                                 SERENA
                        Do you like it?

                                 JEFF
                        Yes...

                                 SERENA
                        Do you want to --

           -- BEEP!!!

           Both of them freeze...

           A dull light illuminates Jeff’s side table. Not wanting to 
           ruin the mood, Serena offers a sexy wink, reaches to turn off 
           the phone --
           -- then notices something odd.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Who’s Katherine --?

           A beat.

                                 JEFF
                        Who? 

                                 SERENA
                        Katherine. And why does she ‘need 
                        to see you’?

           Jeff takes the phone. Panic. 

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, shoot. I forgot...

           He swings his legs out of bed...

                                 SERENA
                        Forgot what --?

           ...goes to the closet.

                                 JEFF
                        She’s an employee, Serena. I 
                        promised I’d help her. 

                                 SERENA
                        At ten p.m.?!

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t talk about it. It’s got to 
                        do with business. 

           Jeff flips on the light. Serena squints, quickly drawing up 
           the covers...

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff -- 

                                 JEFF
                             (turning)
                        What?

           Her lips tremble. 

                                 SERENA
                        You can’t leave. Not now. 

           Jeff hesitates. To his surprise, he really doesn’t want to. 
                                 JEFF
                        I’m sorry.
                             (a beat)
                        You look beautiful. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           It’s late. 

           Bleary eyed, Jeff sits in a dimly lit Mexican restaurant. The 
           place is nearly empty, save for a few SPANISH COUPLES seated 
           beside a small STAGE. A sign hangs above:

                                Mariachi Mondays!

           The front door JINGLES. Jeff watches Katherine maneuver 
           towards him. She takes a seat, offering a vulnerable smile. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hi. 

           Jeff looks suspiciously behind her, making sure nobody 
           followed. 

                                 JEFF
                        Where’s your friend?

                                 KATHERINE
                        What friend? 

                                 JEFF
                             (leaning closer)
                        The man in blue. 

           Katherine stiffens a bit. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jeff, I’m a city planner. I don’t 
                        get to choose who I see. 

                                 JEFF
                        Bullshit. I saw him in accounting. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What does that mean? 

                                 JEFF
                        That something is up. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Nothing is up.
                                 JEFF
                        Everything is up. 

           Jeff sits back in his chair. Dips a chip into salsa. Crosses 
           his arms. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        You wanted to talk with me? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I have something to tell you... 

                                 JEFF
                        Like you’ve been sneaking around?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jeff - we are the ones who’ve been 
                        sneaking around. 

           Katherine sighs. She’s about to go on -- when she notices him 
           staring at the table...

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                        Let me see that...

           He points to her knife. Awkwardly, she hands it over. Jeff 
           picks up his own knife. Holds them side by side. His is 
           significantly shorter. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        What the hell...?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jeff --

           He snaps out of it. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        -- I’m pregnant. 

           A suspended moment...

           ...they stare at each other. 

                                 RESTAURANT OWNER (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen. Los Hermanos 
                        Felix!!!

           Scattered APPLAUSE. In a state of shock, Jeff can’t help 
           looking to the stage --
           -- where a pair of elderly MEXICAN BROTHERS (70’s), tan 
           riverbed skin, sit down with acoustic guitars...

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jeff...

           The brothers start playing in haunting, soft strokes...

                                 THE FELIX BROTHERS
                             (singing)
                        Acerquense hermanos dondequiera que 
                        esten...

           Jeff feels Katherine’s hand upon his. He turns back...

                                 KATHERINE
                        Say something...

                                 THE FELIX BROTHERS
                             (singing)
                        ...aguas siguen creciendo forman 
                        inundacion...

           Avoiding eye contact, Jeff stares at the tablecloth. A 
           skeleton pattern from Dia de Muertos...

                                 JEFF
                        What are you going to do...? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        Well I can’t keep it. 

                                 JEFF
                        You can’t? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        No...
                             (a confused beat)
                        ...I mean, unless you want me to. 

                                 THE FELIX BROTHERS
                             (singing; in Spanish)
                        ...y te ahogas ahi mismo,
                        una piedra en el mar...

           The RINGING returns to Jeff’s ears. He flinches...

                                 JEFF
                        What the hell are they singing...?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Jeff, look at me. 

           She snaps her fingers. He returns focus. 
                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?

           It’s all too much. Surreality crashes down. Jeff pushes back 
           his chair and rushes out of the restaurant...

           ...leaving Katherine alone at the table. 

           With a direct line of sight to the Felix Brothers, she 
           watches in resignation as the men croon in perfect harmony...

                                 THE FELIX BROTHERS
                             (singing)
                        ...el que sale perdiendo, un dia 
                        ganara. Los tiempos van cambiando.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - SMALL CITY - DAY

           Pale and tired, Jeff sits in Mona’s hospital room. She sleeps 
           peacefully...

           Serena is beside her, arms crossed, purposefully avoiding eye 
           contact with Jeff...

           Still in a daze, Jeff notices his left hand is clenched...

           ...and drops of BLOOD are falling onto the carpet. Loosening 
           his fingers, Jeff reveals...

           ...his CAR KEYS. He blinks...

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll be back...

           Serena doesn’t bother watching him go.

           EXT. ABANDONED TRACK - DAY

           VROOM!!! VROOM!!!

           Jeff grips the steering wheel...

           At the other end of the track, Carlos eyes his STOPWATCH. He 
           exhales vape, lifts a flag...

           -- and brings it down!

           SCREECH!!!

           The Rally Buick bursts to life! It flies down the track. 
           Inside, Jeff grips tighter. The outside world turns to a 
           blur...

                                 SUPERHERO KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Easy...

           ...Superhero Katherine sits in the passenger seat, pointing 
           to his hands. Against his instincts...

           ...he loosens his palms. 

           The car ZOOMS past Carlos - who clicks his watch...

           EXT. RIDGE - ABANDONED TRACK - DAY

                                 CARLOS
                        Not bad...

           Jeff and Carlos stand on a ridge above the track. The city 
           skyline hovers in the distance...

           ...both towers clearly visible. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        ...another couple months, you might 
                        be competitive. 

                                 JEFF
                             (focused on the towers)
                        That’s too long. Did you talk to 
                        your guys?

           Carlos inhales his vape. 

                                 CARLOS
                        I told you. You don’t want to get 
                        mixed up with them. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes I do. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Don’t be stupid, man. You lose, 
                        your shit is fucked. You win, your 
                        shit might also be fucked. Plus you 
                        don’t have any money. 
                                 JEFF
                        I’ll bet the car. 

           A beat. Carlos takes a drag...

                                 CARLOS
                        Guess that could work. 

           -- BEEP!!

           Jeff draws out his cellphone. Reads the screen...

                                 JEFF
                        Christ...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - SEASIDE TOWN - DAY

           Jeff and Katherine sit in a blue, sterile waiting room. A 
           SEAGULL swoops past the window. From the muffled seals 
           BARKING, we know they’re back in the seaside town...

                                 KATHERINE
                        Thanks for coming. 

           He nods, staring blankly ahead...

           A PAINTING hangs on the opposite wall. It depicts a vast 
           forest, spreading into darkness. Oddly, it seems to be the 
           same artist from the motel...

           ...only this time, there are no strange creatures. Just empty 
           woods. Jeff leans forward. Searching the painted trees. He 
           can almost hear the CHATTERING. See the gleaming sharp 
           teeth...

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I heard how you got your car. 

                                 JEFF
                             (turning)
                        What --?

           For the first time, he sees a bit of anger in Katherine’s 
           eyes. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I know a few cops in town. I heard 
                        them talking about some ‘asshole’ 
                        whose car got stolen, and when they 
                        found it, someone had turned it 
                        into a street racer. 
                                 JEFF
                        Asshole --?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who are you, Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        What do you mean? 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I mean - what are you doing? Do you 
                        have a plan, other than building 
                        that ridiculous bar on top of your 
                        prehistoric building? 

                                 JEFF
                        As a matter of fact, I do. 

           Katherine raises an eyebrow. Waiting. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to race my car at the 
                        speedway on Sunday. I bet a Mexican 
                        gang $50,000. If I win, I can pay 
                        for my daughter’s treatment. If 
                        they win, they keep my car. 

           A beat.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Are you insane? 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        What makes you think you can win? 

                                 JEFF
                             (sharply)
                        Because I’ve put my mind to it. 

           Katherine stares back in disbelief...

                                 KATHERINE
                        My God...

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 KATHERINE
                        You want to know something? You 
                        want to know why my dad got his 
                        medal? 
                                 JEFF
                        Why?

                                 KATHERINE
                        A mistake.

                                 DOCTOR
                        -- Ms. Chavez?

           A DOCTOR (40’s) stands in the doorway. Katherine holds up a 
           finger. Leans closer to Jeff. 

                                 JEFF
                        You said he didn’t like to talk 
                        about it...

                                 KATHERINE
                        He didn’t like to talk about it, 
                        because he didn’t do it! It was 
                        some other soldier who died - but 
                        my dad took the credit. After a 
                        while, he started believing what he 
                        said - and from then on, we had to 
                        treat him like a war hero. 

                                 JEFF
                        Why are you telling me this?

           Katherine FLICKS Jeff’s forehead. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

                                 KATHERINE
                        These things in your mind, Jeff - 
                        they aren’t real. Even if you want 
                        them to be. Do you understand?

           Realizing he doesn’t, she places his hand on her belly. 

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        This. This is real. Not the racing. 
                        Not the buildings. This. Do you 
                        understand?

           Jeff looks deep into Katherine’s eyes. For the briefest 
           moment, he sees his own reflection...

                                 JEFF
                        Maybe. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JEFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tara and Mona sit together, eating an unusual dish for the 
           Armstrong household: VEGETABLES and QUINOA...

           Jeff watches his daughters from across the table. Tara 
           listens to her headphones, sharing an earbud with Mona, who 
           balances the grains on her fork. He smiles affectionately...

                                 SERENA 
                        You don’t like it --?

           He breaks from his trance. Serena is frowning at his full 
           plate. 

                                 JEFF
                        I haven’t tried it yet. 

           She reaches to take it away...

           ...but Jeff stays her hand. He takes a bite. Offers a 
           pleasant nod. 

           INT. KITCHEN - JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Serena washes dishes. Jeff leans against the counter, looking 
           out the window. Through his neighbor’s backyard, he can see a 
           sliver of downtown...

                                 SERENA
                        So? How did it all turn out? 

                                 JEFF
                             (absently)
                        What...?

           She stops washing. 

                                 SERENA
                        The employee who needed your ‘help’ 
                        the other night. 

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, that. It was fine. 

                                 SERENA
                        I still don’t think it’s 
                        appropriate. 

                                 JEFF
                        I told her. She won’t contact me 
                        again. She just...
                                 SERENA
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                             (looking back)
                        Didn’t have anyone else to talk to. 

           Serena stares at him. Bitterness on her lips. 

                                 SERENA
                        You know what I remembered this 
                        morning --?

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 SERENA
                        Senior year. Those Spanish exchange 
                        students. Everyone thought they 
                        were so hot - especially the guy 
                        who liked me. Remember? 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t. 

                                 SERENA
                        Sure you do. We were all down at 
                        the beach, and he splashed water on 
                        me after I told him not to. You ran 
                        at him like a maniac. Tackled him, 
                        right in the ocean. 

                                 JEFF
                        Oh yeah...

                                 SERENA
                        Would you do that for me now? 

           A beat. 

                                 JEFF
                        Tackle a guy if he splashed water 
                        on you?

                                 SERENA
                        Yeah. 

           Jeff thinks about it. Smiles faintly.

                                 JEFF
                        Of course I would. 

           Serena turns back to the dishes. A slight nod. Jeff’s about 
           to leave the room...
           ...when he pauses in the archway. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        The big race is on Sunday...

           Serena shakes her head, washing a colander. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        ...maybe I don’t know what I’m 
                        doing, but I’m doing it for us. I’d 
                        like you and the girls to be there, 
                        if you can. 

           She places the colander on the dry rack. Sighs. 

                                 SERENA
                        Okay. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SPEEDWAY - SMALL CITY - MORNING

           Sun rises above the city...

           ...drawing out the SHADOWS of the towers. They spread across 
           the smaller buildings...

           ...shade from the Beige Tower stops near the edge of 
           downtown...

           ...but the Blue Tower continues, reaching all the way to the 
           Speedway. 

           Standing on the track, somehow able to sense its looming 
           presence...

           ...Jeff looks up from beside his Stock Buick. Squints at the 
           sky. A cloud of VAPE passes over him...

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Jeff --? 

           Carlos stands a few yards away -- along with a couple of his 
           buddies. Other STOCK CARS pull onto the track for open 
           practice...

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        We gonna do this? 

                                 JEFF
                             (nodding)
                        Let’s.
           A BEAT LATER

           In a side-bay, Carlos’ crew descends on the Stock Buick. Jeff 
           watches in fascination as they check tires, fill fluids, etc. 

                                 CARLOS 
                        The boys are fixing a coolant leak. 
                        Also, we’re gonna take out your 
                        subwoofers. Make you a little 
                        lighter...

                                 JEFF 
                        No music?

                                 CARLOS 
                        You’re gonna make your own music. 

           Carlos and Jeff step off the track...

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        After you’re done, take a few laps. 
                        Get yourself loose. See that --

           He points to a DODGE CHALLENGER, surrounded by an 
           intimidating group of Mexicans. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        -- that’s who you’re racing. I’ll 
                        introduce you soon. Don’t say shit.  

           Jeff observes the group. Sees the tattoos. The cigarettes. 
           His brow narrows...

                                 JEFF
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 CARLOS
                        Sure...

                                 JEFF
                        What happened with the rape?

                                 CARLOS
                        The what?

                                 JEFF
                        I saw it on TV. Something about six 
                        guys. 

           Carlos stares at him...

           ...and starts to laugh. 
                                 CARLOS
                        Oh, bro - you saw that?

                                 JEFF
                             (somberly)
                        Yeah, I did. Got me into this whole 
                        thing. 

                                 CARLOS
                             (still laughing)
                        You must’ve been watching it on 
                        mute, right? What do you call them? 
                        The words on the --

                                 JEFF
                        Closed captions. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Closed captions! Yeah, man. My 
                        buddies were making a documentary 
                        about this chick racer. Guess they 
                        typed it wrong on the TV. ‘Tape’ 
                        not ‘Rape’. They got a call 
                        apologizing. 

           Jeff slowly turns to Carlos. 

                                 JEFF
                        Are you kidding me...? 

                                 CARLOS
                             (slapping Jeff’s back)
                        No, man. But that is some funny 
                        shit. 

           EXT. STANDS - SPEEDWAY - AFTERNOON

           Footsteps ECHO as Tara and Mona hurry through a concrete 
           tunnel, followed briskly by Selena...

           They emerge in the stands, under the afternoon sun. Seats are 
           filling up. Despite Mona’s pale features, she smiles...

           ...at the CARS below, speeding along the track. So does Tara. 

                                 MONA AND TARA
                        Cool. 

           They navigate their way to the bottom. Peering across the 
           track, Serena tries to locate Jeff’s car. She takes out her 
           cellphone, about to call -- 
                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Serena --?

           Carlos is walking towards her. 

                                 SERENA
                             (confused)
                        Yes?

                                 CARLOS
                        I’m Carlos. Guy who’s teaching your 
                        husband to do this crazy shit --

           He sees the two girls -- and immediately claps a hand over 
           his mouth. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry...

                                 SERENA
                        It’s all right --

           She’s taking in Carlos’ rugged good looks. Smooth brown skin. 
           Tattoos...

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        -- you’re not what I expected. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Thinking I was more of a crusty old 
                        white guy? 

                                 SERENA
                        Yes. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Not surprised. Jeff’s just about to 
                        take his car out for a spin. There 
                        he is --

           He points across the track --

           -- now Mona sees him, wearing his tone-deaf leather jacket. 
           He waves, then gets into the car. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                             (scribbling on paper)
                        Here’s my number - in case he 
                        doesn’t pick up. 

           She nods appreciatively. The attraction lingering...

           INSIDE THE BUICK
           Sitting down, Jeff sets his new DRIVING GLOVES upon the 
           wheel. He turns the key --

           -- and the engine ROARS to life. He looks once more to his 
           family against the rails, watching eagerly. 

           A few cars whizz past. Jeff waits for his entry point...

                                 JEFF
                        Okay...

           He slams on the gas --

           STANDS

           -- as “Pipeline” spills into Tara’s ears. Wearing her 
           headphones, she nods to the surf tune --

           -- while Jeff whizzes around the track, flying past the 
           girls, who wave furiously! Serena waves too, glancing over at 
           Carlos --

           -- who smiles. Digging her curves. 

           -- another lap, and Jeff finds himself next to the 
           Challenger. He can almost make out the driver --

           -- when a punch of gas sends it scorching ahead, kicking up a 
           cloud of rubber and exhaust. The crowd CHEERS!!

                                                       SOUND BRIDGE TO:

           EXT. STANDS - SPEEDWAY - NIGHT

           The crowd continues to SHOUT -- stands now completely filled!

           Two STOCK CARS line up beside each other, SCREECHING past the 
           starting line! They fly down the track -- a giant DIGITAL 
           CLOCK tracking their time --

           -- and just as quickly, the race is over!

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        And the winner is ROSIE THE 
                        RIVETER!!!

           More CHEERS!!! 

           Under the stadium lights, Serena and the girls sit near the 
           front, eating popcorn, enjoying the spectacle...
           Pulling away from the Armstrongs, we move towards the 
           entrance...

           ...and find someone else familiar. Katherine. Leaning against 
           a concrete wall, watching the family... 

           ...not with malice or intent, but curiosity - as if they 
           couldn’t possibly exist. She turns her attention to the 
           track. To Jeff’s car...

           Worried...

           EXT. TRACK - SPEEDWAY - NIGHT

                                 CARLOS
                        Jeff Armstrong, this is Rafael 
                        Recinos. 

           Jeff stands before the Challenger - his Buick parked a few 
           feet away. An entourage of GANG MEMBERS leans against the 
           car. In front: RAFAEL RECINOS (30’s), stringy, tattooed from 
           head to foot, steps forward. Jeff extends his hand...

           ...but Rafael ignores the gesture, walking past him to the 
           Buick. He runs his hand along the hood. 

                                 RAFAEL
                        Mikey did a good job with this - 
                        before he got popped. Be careful 
                        with it...
                             (turning to Jeff)
                        ...I don’t want you to fuck up my 
                        car. 

           A few chuckles from the group. Carlos sucks nervously on his 
           vaporizer.

                                 JEFF
                        With all due respect, Mr. Recinos, 
                        I have to win tonight. 

                                 RAFAEL
                        What did you say --?

           Carlos coughs. Turns away...

                                 JEFF
                        I said...I have to win. And Carlos 
                        told me if I do, you still might 
                        not pay me. 

           Rafael looks to Carlos, who vigorously shakes his head. 
                                 RAFAEL
                        Carlos didn’t say that. 

                                 JEFF
                        He didn’t?

                                 RAFAEL
                        No. Because that would mean he 
                        thinks I can lose, which I can’t. 

                                 JEFF
                        What if you do? 

                                 RAFAEL
                        What if I don’t? 

           A beat. 

                                 JEFF
                        My daughter’s life depends on it, 
                        Mr. Recinos. 

           Another beat. Rafael breathes through his nose, then returns 
           to his posse. Carlos pulls Jeff aside...

                                 CARLOS
                        Remember that listening trick I 
                        told you about --?! 

                                 JEFF
                        No...

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --!!!

           Carlos checks his watch. One minute until 8:00 p.m. 

                                 CARLOS
                        It’s go time. 

           THE STANDS

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...on the left, you have Jeff 
                        Armstrong, driving Mooooona!!!

           Mona’s eyes brighten! She stands up, cheering! Serena looks 
           around. Only a few other chaste claps...

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        ...and on the right, Rafael 
                        Recinos, driving La Bestia!
           Nearly the entire crowd rises to its feet! Rafael steps in 
           front of his car, blows a kiss to the stands, then gets 
           behind the wheel...

           ...eye-level with Jeff, who keeps his focus straight ahead. 
           Carlos taps the window. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Remember. Don’t overreact. Just 
                        make a choice. Then, small 
                        adjustments...

                                 JEFF
                        Right...

                                 CARLOS
                        ...small adjustments, bro.  

           Rafael REVS his engine. Jeff turns over the ignition. He 
           looks from Rafael...

           ...to his family across the track...

           ...to the road ahead of him...

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Get ready...

           In the shadows, Katherine clasps her hands together, closing 
           her eyes...

                                 KATHERINE
                             (under her breath)
                        One small step...

           ...as Jeff watches the STAGING LIGHTS move up the tower 
           towards GREEN -- SCREECH!!!

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        -- and they’re off!!!

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN

           EXT. PARKING LOT - BEIGE BUILDING - MORNING

           We drift high above both towers. The faint DIN of traffic 
           sounds...

           ...and a dot moving far below...
           ...the GEO METRO RENTAL CAR. Disappearing into the bowels of 
           the Beige Building. 

           INT. JEFF'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - MORNING

           Jeff sits at his desk. Dark circles under his eyes. The 
           blinds are fully closed. 

           He stares at his computer screen. Turned off. Nothing but his 
           odd reflection. Floating in blackness...

           KNOCKING at the door. 

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        Jeff --?

           No response. 

                                 DANIEL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (muffled)
                        Clarence wants to see you. It’s 
                        important. 

           Jeff hesitates. He reaches forward, pulling a drawer halfway 
           open. He stares at what’s inside --

           -- but we do not see its contents.

           Deciding against it, Jeff pushes the drawer back in. 

           EXT. HALLWAY - CLARENCE’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Jeff walks towards Clarence’s office. Before he gets to the 
           door, the handle turns...

           ...and someone steps out. Jeff freezes. 

           The man in the BLUE SUIT. 

           Blue Suit smiles. He closes the gap and offers his hand. 

                                 BLUE SUIT
                        Armstrong, right --? 

           No reaction. Jeff can’t move. 

                                 BLUE SUIT (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done good work, pal. Wanted 
                        to tell you that. 
           He winks, then continues on, disappearing around the 
           corner...

           INT. CEO'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - MORNING

           Clarence stands beside his window, surprisingly sober. He 
           looks across the flat city. Expression: unreadable. 

           Entering the office, Jeff takes a cautious seat at the desk. 
           He notices a signed CONTRACT on the table. 

           Hearing the squelch of leather, Clarence abandons his view. 
           Sees Jeff...

                                 JEFF
                        What is it, Clarence? What’s 
                        happened?

           Clarence rolls the answer around his mouth. Finally:

                                 CLARENCE
                        Breakthrough...

           Pushing away from the window...

           ...Clarence kneels beside Jeff -- unable to keep a grin from 
           spreading...

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        It worked, Armstrong. 

                                 JEFF
                        What worked...?

                                 CLARENCE
                        Our investment. 

           Jeff blinks. 

                                 JEFF
                        It did? 

                                 CLARENCE
                        China, Armstrong. I told you. 

                                 JEFF
                        You made the sale? 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Yes. But not to them. 
                                 JEFF
                             (leaning forward)
                        To who...?

           Clarence raises an eyebrow. Getting up, he retrieves a BLUE 
           PEN sitting upon the contract. Hands it to Jeff. An 
           inscription on the pen reads: Tower Club. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        I ran into them in Beijing. We ate 
                        hundred year old eggs. I tell you -- 
                        sometimes it takes going halfway 
                        around the world to find your own 
                        backyard. 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t understand...

                                 CLARENCE
                        They’ve bought us out, Armstrong. 
                        The whole damn thing. 

           A horrible, deafening silence...

                                 JEFF
                        No...

                                 CLARENCE
                        Yes. And far above asking. Millions 
                        of stories higher!

           He is now shaking with excitement...

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        They see the value. They see both 
                        sides. They want to keep us as we 
                        are. Even better -- they want to 
                        use your idea! 

           Jeff is speechless...

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        The club! The roof! They pay for 
                        everything! Move ‘old school’ class 
                        over here, push the future over 
                        there! 

           The RINGING has returned to Jeff’s ears...

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you understand? You and I 
                        don’t have to do a damn thing for 
                        the rest of our lives!
           Jeff twitches. Clarence reframes his enthusiasm...

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m sorry I kept you in the 
                        dark. I know how you feel about... 
                        them. But with all that’s happened, 
                        you must see -- this is the only 
                        way!

           A beat...

           Jeff gets up from the chair. His lips part. About to say 
           something...

           Instead, he walks out of the room. 

           INT. JEFF'S OFFICE - BEIGE BUILDING - DAY

           Jeff slowly reenters his office. Moves towards the blinds. 
           Finds the plastic wand. Twists --

           Light FLOODS the room. He shields his eyes. Vision adjusts...

           ...and there it is. Rising before him. Glinting in the sun. 
           His new employer. 

           Turning away from the awful sight...

           ...he sees SUPERHERO KATHERINE. But she’s not looking at 
           him...

           ...she’s looking at the aquarium, where the White Halfmoon 
           floats upon the surface. 

           Dead. 

           Jeff slowly crosses to the tank. Dipping his hand into the 
           water...

           ...he gently cradles the delicate fish. It’s tail is entirely 
           gone -- a set of strange TEETH MARKS clearly defined. 

           Jeff peers into its lifeless eyes. 

                                 JEFF
                        My mother used to keep fish...

           He tries to contain his emotions...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        She loved the ocean. How blue it 
                        was.
           Jeff turns bitterly to Superhero Katherine. Rather than 
           answer...

           ...she guides his focus back to the desk. To the drawer...

           ...and a familiar sound rises. CHATTERING. Like the creatures 
           from the painting. 

           A RUSTLE in the darkness...

           EXT. BEIGE BUILDING - SMALL CITY - DAY

           Jeff exits the Beige Building. He wears a jacket -- odd for 
           such warm weather. He descends a few steps...

           ...then takes out his cellphone. Dials. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SMALL CITY - DAY

                                 SERENA
                        Hello?

           Serena sits beside Mona, who is receiving her treatment. 
           Looking rosier...

                                 JEFF (TELEPHONE)
                        How’s she feeling?

                                 SERENA
                        Why don’t you ask her yourself?

           She hands the phone to Mona. 

                                 MONA
                        Hi dad. 

                                 JEFF (TELEPHONE)
                        How do you feel, sweetie?

                                 MONA
                        Okay. Good. The doctor came. 

                                 JEFF
                        And --? 

                                 MONA
                        He said I’m going to be okay. 

           ON JEFF

           Jeff holds the phone away - a sob catching in his throat. 
                                 MONA (TELEPHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Dad...?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m here.

                                 MONA (TELEPHONE)
                             (a beat)
                        Sorry you lost the race. 

                                 JEFF 
                        It’s okay. 

                                 MONA (TELEPHONE)
                        And the car. 

                                 JEFF 
                        Yeah. 

                                 MONA (TELEPHONE)
                        Do you think they’ll keep my name 
                        on it?

                                 JEFF 
                        Probably not. 

                                 MONA (TELEPHONE)
                        Yeah. 

           BEEP --!

           ON MONA

           Mona hands the phone to Serena --

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Someone else is calling...

           Serena checks the screen. We see the name: CARLOS. 

           A flicker of a smile. Serena sends the call to voicemail. 

                                 SERENA
                        Jeff, I should probably go. But...

                                 JEFF (TELEPHONE)
                        ...but what? 

                                 SERENA
                        We need to talk about things when 
                        you get back. 

                                 JEFF (TELEPHONE)
                        What kind of things? 
           She smiles at Mona, then turns away. Lowers her voice. 

                                 SERENA
                        Us things.

           ON JEFF

           He closes his eyes...

                                 JEFF 
                        Okay.
                             (a beat)
                        Just wanted to let you know...we 
                        have the money. 

                                 SERENA (TELEPHONE)
                        What?

                                 JEFF 
                        For Mona. For everything. We have 
                        it. 

                                 SERENA (TELEPHONE)
                        Wait -- but, how? What are you 
                        talking about? 

           Jeff sits on the steps, looking squarely at the Blue 
           Building...

                                 JEFF
                        What was that food you made the 
                        other night? 

                                 SERENA (TELEPHONE)
                        Jeff --?

                                 JEFF
                        The little grains. Kind of like 
                        rice. 

                                 SERENA (TELEPHONE)
                        You mean -- quinoa?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah. Quinoa. 
                             (smiling)
                        I liked it. 

           He hangs up. 

           Reaching into his pocket...

           ...Jeff removes a PISTOL. The .45 from his garage. 
           He turns it in his palm. Sun glints off the steel -- causing 
           him to squint.

           Rising up, Jeff walks towards the blue tower... 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
