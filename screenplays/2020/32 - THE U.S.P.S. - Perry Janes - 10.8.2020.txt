       WRIT LARGE / Bash Naran
           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Early morning in Metro Detroit. Tree-lined roads, families 
           out with strollers, more than a few classic cars in the 
           driveways as--

           --a POSTWOMAN comes walking down the sidewalk. Meet DIANE 
           GRIFFITHS: black, mid 40’s, oozing Midwestern affability.

                                 DIANE
                        Morning!

           She WAVES hello to the neighbors as she DEPOSITS MAIL before 
           climbing inside her MAIL VAN (known forthwith as a GRUMMAN 
           LLV), putting the car in gear, and pulling away. 

           INT. GRUMMAN LLV - DAY

           Diane taps her fingers to “How Long Do I Have to Wait For 
           You” by Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings as she turns onto the--

           HIGHWAY

           From overhead, traffic flows around her pillbox truck.

           EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

           A rural tract lined with trees. Diane approaches a--

           RAMSHACKLE HOUSE

           Rotted wood siding. Dirty windows. Not exactly inviting. She 
           kills the engine. The MUSIC CUTS. Silence presses in.

           Diane scales the porch, pulls a PARCEL from her satchel, 
           finds the mailbox SMASHED on the threshold. She PEERS through 
           the windows, searching for signs of life. Then--

           --SHE TRIES THE DOOR HANDLE. Locked. She peers left, right. 
           She rounds the back of the house, cautious, to the--

           REAR ENTRY

           --which HANGS AJAR. She SLIPS INSIDE.

           INT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Dark. Cobwebs everywhere. And a faint CLICKING noise whirring 
           in the background, incessant, drawing her toward-- 

           --a BLUEISH GLOW coming from a nearby--
           BEDROOM

           ANGLE ON: A MASSIVE FUCKING BANK OF COMPUTER MONITORS. 
           Completely incongruous with their surroundings. Diane creeps 
           forward when--

           --a loud CREAK breaks the silence. She SPINS as--

                                 GOON (O.S.)
                        You’re not supposed to be in here.

           --a GOON GRABS HER. 

           What happens next, happens fast.

           Diane ELBOWS the goon in the gut, RETREATS into the--

           DINING ROOM

           --where she grabs a vintage CLOCK from the sideboard and 
           SMASHES IT into her assailant’s face. He goes down. Hard.

           Whatever else she is, Diane’s a damn good fighter.

           But no sooner is one goon down, then ANOTHER APPEARS. 

           Spotting his wounded comrade, he swings into action as--

           --A FULL BLOWN MELEE breaks out. This is not your artfully 
           choreographed action sequence. Simultaneously absurd and 
           brutal, both fighters use every possible prop within reach. 
           The goon SLASHES her arm with a broken LIGHTBULB. Diane 
           SMAHES him in the face with a DISH RACK FULL OF DISHES. 
           Finally Diane reaches for her SATCHEL. She CINCHES its strap 
           around the goon’s NECK and LEAPS onto the dining table--

           --HEAVING the strap over her shoulder, LIFTING the goon’s 
           legs off the floor as he SCRABBLES for breath, grim 
           determination mingled with victory on Diane’s face, when--

           --A BLADE THRUSTS THROUGH HER NECK. Diane drops her satchel 
           with surprise, falls to the ground into a POOL OF LIGHT as--

           --BOTH GOONS loom above her, peering down.

                                 GOON #2
                        God damn. 

                                 GOON #1
                        Who is she?

                                 GOON #2
                        The postwoman. You killed the 
                        fucking postwoman. 
           And as Diane GOES STILL there, on the floor, we PUSH IN on--

           --HER UNIFORM, the name GRIFFITHS embroidered in blue thread, 
           which she PRESSES, like a BUTTON, with her last gasp, as we--

                                                              SMASH TO:

           TITLE CARDS

           A LETTER falls from an automated CONVEYOR BELT into a 
           CYLINDRICAL CONTAINER which is immediately sucked up into--

           --A LABYRINTH OF PNEUMATIC TUBES. It shuttles left, right, 
           up, down, through a SUBTERRENEAN EXPRESS, covering more 
           ground with more speed than seems usual, before finally-- 

           --HALTING to DEPOSIT its letter in a small kiosk. 

           CLOSE ON: A letter addressed to MIKE GRIFFITHS as we-- 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - EVENING

           CLOSE ON: A plastic name tag pinned to a SECURITY UNIFORM 
           reads Hi, my name is MICHAEL. 

           Meet MICHAEL GRIFFITHS: black, mid-20’s, good hearted with a 
           smart mouth and charm to spare, the kind of guy that can’t 
           take two steps forward without getting in his own way.

           CHYRON UP: Metro Detroit, Michigan. 48230.

           He stands in a darkened CORRIDOR next to a pair of double 
           doors. He fidgets, glancing this way and that. He checks his 
           watch when he hears a KNOCK. He parts open the doors where--

           --FIVE TEENAGE GIRLS holding basketballs wait outside.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Anybody see you?

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Yeah. We passed a stake out on the 
                        way over.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Shut up and get in here.

           He waves the girls inside.
           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - DARKENED GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael ushers the girls onto a dark basketball court. One 
           teenage girl BOUNCES her basketball. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Keep it down a sec.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        You act like we’re about to rob the 
                        place.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You ever met the words thank you? 

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Alright, mom.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re gonna get creamed on Sunday.

           There’s an affectionate quality to their banter. They swap 
           SMILES when a CLATTER breaks the silence. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                             (quiet)
                        Did you close the door behind you?

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Isn’t that your job?

           He holds a finger to his lips for hush, waves the girls into 
           a crouch. He pulls a HANDHELD TASER from his belt and creeps 
           across the room, barely TUCKING OUT OF SIGHT as--

           --a DOOR OPENS and a SHADOWY FIGURE enters the gym. Michael 
           approaches from behind and TASES HIM. The man goes down.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s right! Security, bitch! Bet 
                        you thought you could run up in 
                        here and take whatever you-- 

                                 CARL
                        Goddammit Michael. 

           A look of horror crosses Michael’s face. He HITS THE LIGHTS. 
           On the floor is Michael’s MISERABLE BOSS CARL.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Ohhhhh. Bus-ted.
           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - EVENING

           Michael’s boss CARL holds the door while he ushers Michael 
           and the teenage girls from the club. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Listen, Carl, I need this job.

                                 CARL
                        You assaulted your superior. That’s 
                        me. I’m your superior.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t get points for stealth? 

                                 CARL
                        You’re paid to keep watch, not comp 
                        the Raggedy Anne basketball squad. 

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Who you calling raggedy, you two-
                        polo-wearing-son-of-a--

                                 MICHAEL
                             (over)
                        They just need a place to practice! 
                        No one’s using the gym after hours.

                                 MISERABLE BOSS
                        Hand over the name tag.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What, you gonna reuse it?

                                 MISERABLE BOSS
                        More than one Michael in the world.

           Michael begrudgingly hands it over.

                                 MISERABLE BOSS (CONT'D)
                        Shirt too. 

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Damn. That’s cold.

           Michael fumes. With all the dignity he can muster--

                                 MICHAEL
                        Go home, girls. 

           --he unbuttons his shirt.
           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

           Mike parks a truly appalling DODGE NEON outside a nondescript 
           building where A MAN TOSSES FURNITURE and BOXES from the 
           balcony onto the front lawn.

           Michael hurries from the car. He HOPS up and down.

                                 MICHAEL
                        BARRY! That’s my stuff man! What’s 
                        going on?

                                 BARRY
                        Your thirty days are up Michael! 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, I was on my way to the bank 
                        now! I just came to grab--

                                 BARRY
                        A shirt? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        If you got it, flaunt it, right?
                             (then)
                        C’mon man, if you’d just--DON’T--

           Barry TOSSES a FRAMED PHOTO into the yard. It SMASHES. 

                                 BARRY
                        It’s already done. 

           Barry moves off and SLAMS the door behind him. Michael sighs. 
           He picks up a capsized DINING CHAIR and SITS in the wreckage 
           of his belongings. An ordinary looking POSTWOMAN shuffles by: 
           mid 40’s, distinguished only by an OLD FASHIONED POSTAL CAP. 

                                 POSTWOMAN
                        Evening.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Just, you know, taking the air. 

           She nods, sure, and moves off. Michael sighs. He leans down 
           to retrieve the FRAMED PHOTO from the lawn.

           ANGLE ON: a younger Michael on the lap of a younger Diane. 
           (Yes, that Diane.) Big smiles, lots of warmth, it’s the kind 
           of image that immortalizes someone. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        My bad, ma.
           INT. DODGE NEON - NIGHT

           Michael’s car overflows with his belongings. He holds his 
           cell phone to his ear. It rings through to--

                                 VOICEMAIL RECORDING
                        You’ve reached Diane Griffiths. 
                        Leave a message after the--. 

           BEEP.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, ma. I, um... I was callin’ 
                        because, you know, I just...
                             (deep breath)
                        Just wanted to check in! And I 
                        thought... I might drop in later, 
                        if you’re around. So... 
                             (then)
                        Love you.

           He hangs up. Not his finest hour.

           EXT. ROYAL OAK - GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           Michael parks outside a QUAINT CRAFTSMAN HOME. Two bedrooms, 
           with vinyl siding that’s seen better days, it still retains 
           its charm: a creep of bougainvillea on the eaves, a beer 
           bottle wind chime. 

           Michael exits the car. He PICKS a small bouquet of flowers 
           from the GARDEN NEXT DOOR. He glances up and down the street 
           before hopping the fence for his mother’s--

           BACKYARD

           He rummages in the bushes when--

                                 RONNIE (O.S.)
                        MOVE EVEN A LITTLE AND I’LL HAVE 
                        YOUR ASS FOR DINNER.

           Michael FREEZES. Turns.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ll have my ass for dinner?

           Standing in the driveway, meet RONNIE TALBOT: mid-20’s, 
           white, perpetually grease stained from his job as a mechanic, 
           a lot of workingman swag. He lowers a HANDGUN.
                                 RONNIE
                        Michael? Shit, I almost called the 
                        cops on you! What’re you doing 
                        here?

           Ronnie moves into the lawn, EMBRACES Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s good Ronnie. I’m looking for 
                        the spare. She usually keeps it--

                                 RONNIE
                        I’ve got it. Everything alright?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Man, my supervisor’s tripping--

                                 RONNIE
                        Wow. That must be a land speed 
                        record. You just got that job!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I was trying to help the youth! 
                        Couple kids, needed some place to 
                        run drills. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Your apartment?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s just a couple nights...

                                 RONNIE
                        Whew boy. At least you brought 
                        flowers.
                             (closer look)
                        You picked those from my garden. 
                        Those are my flowers.

           Ronnie shakes his head and produces a key ring as-- 

           --A POLICE CRUISER pulls into the drive.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You actually called!?

                                 RONNIE
                        I didn’t! 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We gotta have that talk about white 
                        privilege again.
           Ronnie hurriedly CHUCKS his gun into the bushes, raises his 
           hands in the air as TWO POLICE OFFICERS step onto the lawn.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Evening, officers.

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Which one of you is Michael 
                        Griffiths?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, look, if Barry called it in, 
                        I’m gonna get him his rent, I am.

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Who’s Barry? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ah man, it was the club? Look, yes, 
                        I used the taser, but I thought--

                                 OFFICER #2
                        Hang on. You assaulted somebody...  

           You can just see the gears turning in Michael’s skull.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay rewind. What’s this about?

                                 OFFICER #1 
                        You seem to have a few ideas. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Nope. He’s got no ideas. Not one. 

           Ronnie side-eyes Michael. Shut. Up. Officer #2 heaves a sigh.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        I’m afraid we have some bad news. 
                        It’s your mother. 

           They hand him an ENVELOPE addressed to MICHAEL GRIFFITHS.

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           If you grew up in a working class household, you’ll recognize 
           the decor: clear plastic covers on the couch, ceramic angels 
           lined on the windowsill, and a yard sale painting of a bald 
           eagle hanging above the fireplace.

           Michael and Ronnie sit drinking tea, somber. The ENVELOPE 
           sits on the table between them.
                                 RONNIE
                        Open it.

           Michael opens the letter and slowly begins to read.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (quiet)
                        Dearest Michael. Dearest? 
                             (recovering)
                        If you’re reading this, chances are 
                        you have an abundance of questions. 
                        I wish I could answer those for 
                        you, but the truth is, it isn’t up 
                        to me. All I know, all I can say, 
                        is I’m proud of you. You’re going 
                        to do great things. I love you, 
                        from now til forever.

                                 RONNIE
                        That makes it sound like she knew?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t put it past my mom to be 
                        prepared for something like this.

                                 RONNIE
                        They won’t tell you how?

                                 MICHAEL
                        They just said it was accident.

                                 RONNIE
                        When do you see the body?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t think there’s much to see.

           Ronnie WINCES.

                                 RONNIE
                        Got damn.
                             (beat)
                        I mean, sorry. Look, we’re gonna 
                        get you through this. I’ve been 
                        your neighbor and best friend since 
                        we were five. I’m gonna Mr. Rogers 
                        the shit outta you this week. I’ll 
                        buy the sweater and everything. 

           Ronnie reaches out and takes Michael’s hand as they lapse 
           into a moment of silence. There’s real love here. 
           INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           Michael stands before a CASKET in a somber black suit. 

           Michael steps forward. He OPENS THE LID. Hold.

           ANGLE ON: A small CYLINDER OF ASHES inside the casket. 

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           Ronnie hangs his suit jacket on a coat rack. He wipes a layer 
           of DUST from the stairwell railing.  

                                 RONNIE
                        We’re cleaning this place.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hold up, we?

                                 RONNIE
                        Y’know what dust is made of? Tiny 
                        insects. With teeth.

           Michael gives him a look: ugh. He pauses, looks around, 
           taking in the magnitude of his new life.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What am I gonna do with a whole 
                        house? I can barely keep a pair of 
                        sunglasses. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Maybe this is your mom’s way of 
                        saying: don’t fuck it up. 

           Ronnie hands over a set of KEYS. Michael TAKES THEM. 

           EXT. WELLS FARGO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           CHYRON UP: San Francisco, California. 90017.

           The iconic Crocker Street Branch, a monolith of stone pillars 
           and classic architecture. Pedestrians flow past the entry as--

           --a WOMAN in a brown TRENCH COAT, with a black HARNESS 
           strapped on top, vaguely military in a vintage kind of way, 
           steps from the swirl into the--

           BANK ATRIUM

           Marble floors. A familiar hush. In the quiet, we now notice 
           the woman is SINGING Les Miserables beneath her breath.
                                 WOMAN
                        Do you hear the people sing? 
                        Singing the song of angry men. It 
                        is a music of a people who will not 
                        be slaves again...

           She catches a few dirty glances. Behind, a group of six men 
           stumble inside, laughing. They wear similarly bulky 
           OVERCOATS. Her singing grows LOUDER as--

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        When the beating of your heart 
                        echoes the beating of the drums, 
                        there is a life about to start when 
                        tomorrow comes. 

           --ALL SIX MEN toss off their coats. Several of the men hold 
           large GUNS. Among them, we clock two men in particular.

           BUMPER (30s, military) wears a PARTIAL EXOSUIT*: a roughly 
           welded steel skeleton asymmetrically lining his left leg and 
           right arm with piping, hydraulics, and one large RETRACTABLE 
           BLADE. If we’re looking closely, we’ll see this suit is 
           screwed into his body... and it’s gross. We recognize him as 
           THE SAME MAN WHO KILLED MICHAEL’S MOTHER DIANE. 

           Next to him is JEREMIAH (20s, skinny), with subtle but 
           grotesque BODY MODIFICATIONS: a split tongue, blackened eyes. 
           With magnets implanted in his fingertips, he casually dangles 
           FIVE KNIVES from one hand, each knifepoint magnetized to a 
           different finger. He’s heavily inked with various hate icons, 
           including a large BLACK SUN. In fact, there’s a whiff of 
           white nationalism coming from this entire crew. 

           They take the room fast. They disarm the security guard, 
           corral the customers into a corner. Meanwhile--

           --THE WOMAN CALMLY CROSSES THE ROOM to a nearby--

           OFFICE

           --where she POINTS A GUN at a trembling BANKER. She gestures 
           to the corner. Sit. He does. She takes a seat at his desk, 
           and we get a good look at her for the first time.

           Meet BONNIE JO BOONE: late 30s, white, radiating confidence, 
           elegant despite a hint of grunge about her. Oil on her 
           knuckles, tactical boots stained with mud.

           She begins to TYPE. She never stops SINGING. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Will you join in our crusade? Who 
                        will be strong and stand with me? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Beyond the barricade is there a 
                        world you long to see? Then join in 
                        the fight. That will give you the 
                        right to be free.

           The BANKER watches her, terrified, while in the--

           ATRIUM

           --Bumper oversees the emptying of each cash register.

                                 BUMPER
                        Jeremiah!

           He jerks his head toward the massive SAFE. Jeremiah nods, 
           yeah yeah, very devil-may-care. He places one hand against 
           the safe door while he TURNS THE DIAL with the other. 

           CLOSE ON: His fingers TREMOR, betraying a faint CLICK.

           He grins, turns the dial back the other way. Soon--

           --the safe door OPENS. The men rush inside to fill their bags 
           with MASSIVE PALLETS OF CASH. Back in the--

           OFFICE

           --Bonnie squints at the computer screen. Come on. 

           ANGLE ON: An alert on-screen reads FILES TRANSFERRED.

                                 BONNIE
                        Will you give all you can give so 
                        that our banner may advance. Some 
                        will fall and some will live. Will 
                        you stand and take your chance? 

           She grins, stands, exits as--

                                 BUMPER
                        That’s the alarm! 

           Bonnie pauses, turns back. 

           ANGLE ON: The banker at his desk, finger still on the ALARM.

           Bonnie walks up, composed, still singing. 

                                 BONNIE
                        The blood of the martyrs will water 
                        the meadows of--

           In one fluid motion she RAISES A GUN AND FIRES. The banker 
           falls to the floor, DEAD.
                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                             (no longer singing)
                        --the world. 

                                 BUMPER (O.S.)
                        Boss! Let’s go! 

           Bonnie turns and rejoins her crew. They hurriedly change into 
           CONSTRUCTION costumes. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Any word on that postwoman?

                                 BUMPER
                        None. She’s not FBI, CIA, NSA. 

                                 BONNIE
                        She’s someone. Find out. 

           Bumper NODS. Reveal a WIRE hanging down from the CEILING. 
           Bonnie casually attaches the wire to her HARNESS. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        After you Bump. 

           Bumper PRESSES a button and the wire JERKS him upward. Next 
           goes JEREMIAH as one by one the crew soar up, up, toward the 
           rafters and a DOOR to the roof. Bonnie gazes around her as--

           --she FLIES upward, out of reach.

           EXT. PENTAGON - DAY

           CHYRON UP: Fort Belvoir, Virginia. 22060.

           A mail van comes TEARING into the parking lot. 

           INT. PENTAGON - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A dozen sets of POLISHED BLACK OXFORDS marching 
           down a marble hall. Behind them, one very out of place pair 
           of NEW BALANCE SNEAKERS bobs and weaves through the traffic.

                                 OTTO (O.S.)
                        Excuse me. Pardon me. Move it.

           INT. PENTAGON - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A pointed RECEPTIONIST looks up as Postmaster General OTTO 
           WILSON comes huffing into the room. 50’s, nonthreatening, he 
           is the closest thing we have to an avatar for the USPS 
           itself: earnest, hardworking, a little ragged at the edges. 
           He sweats profusely.
                                 OTTO
                        Otto Wilson, here to see Colonel 
                        Peterson and Richard Dickman.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        They’re waiting for you.

           He nods and enters a--

           BRIEFING ROOM

           Two men sit at a conference table flanked by SCREENS. 
           Presiding over the room is COLONEL PETERSON: 60’s, in 
           uniform, Head of National Security, with a brusque manner 
           bordering on unfriendly. Next to him is RICHARD DICKMAN: 
           50’s, longtime FBI Director, obsequious to the core, 
           compulsively clad in the most expensive, well, everything. 

                                 PETERSON
                        Postmaster. Glad you could join us.

                                 RICHARD
                        A mailman? Late? That’s unusual.

                                 OTTO
                        Colonel. Dick Dick.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ve heard the jokes, thanks.

           Otto takes his seat. He WIPES HIS FACE on his tie. 

                                 OTTO
                        Is this the Bonnie Jo material?

                                 PETERSON
                        We had another robbery yesterday. 
                        That’s the fifth multinational bank 
                        in as many months.

                        Due respect, when did bank robbers 
                        become a matter of National 
                        Security?

                                 BONNIE
                        To the United States Government: 
                        the financial institutions of the 
                        world have terrorized society for 
                        decades. As the sons and daughters 
                        of millworkers and linemen, of 
                        clerks and cashiers, we will no 
                        longer accept subjugation. The 
                        wealthy one percent must relinquish 
                        their excess. We demand the 
                        immediate transfer of 5 trillion 
                        dollars into an account of our 
                        providing, for redistribution to 
                        the people it was stolen from. 
                        Should you fail to comply, we will 
                        destroy the very meaning of 
                        “wealth” as you have come to 
                        understand it. Revolution is 
                        inevitable. You have two weeks.  

           The video cuts to black.

                                 RICHARD
                        Charming. What’s her profile?

           MILITARY APPAREL. 

                                 PETERSON
                        Bonnie Jo Boone. 38, ex-NSA, she 
                        spent six years in cyber warfare 
                        before asking her way into the 
                        field. She spent an additional 
                        three years monitoring local 
                        dictatorships... and here’s where 
                        the train jumps the rails. Bonnie 
                        was directly agitating for armed 
                        uprisings. She executed twelve 
                        Venezuelan protestors for failing 
                        to support her revolution.

                        After discharge, she became a loud 
                        presence on dark web chat rooms, 
                        where she presented herself as a 
                        student of the French Revolution 
                        and an acolyte of Maximilien 
                        Robespierre.

                             (continuing)
                        She became known for her radical 
                        body modifications, insisting she 
                        could build the world’s most 
                        dangerous militia. You can see how 
                        well her test cases turned out.

                                 PETERSON
                        What they always mean. A bomb, we 
                        think. Aimed at the Fed.

                                 OTTO
                        Then why rob banks? It doesn’t fit 
                        her profile. It’s too... small.

                                 RICHARD

                        Gentlemen. She’s a terrorist, plain 
                        and simple. We’re moving Ms. Boone 
                        to the top of the pile. 

           Peterson sits, eyes Richard and Otto. Severe.

                                 RICHARD
                        If I may, sir, the FBI is self-
                        sufficient in this regard--

                                 PETERSON
                        Thanks Rich. But I’m hoping Otto’s 
                        team can pitch in, too.
                                 RICHARD
                        Didn’t he just lose an agent to 
                        this woman? 

                                 OTTO
                        We’re extremely motivated, sir.

                                 PETERSON
                        Motivation’s good. Results are 
                        better. 

           Peterson nods: Dismissed. 

           EXT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           Michael and Ronnie load Ronnie’s Subaru Impreza with 
           CARDBOARD BOXES full of DIANE’S BELONGINGS.

                                 RONNIE
                        That’s everything for Goodwill?

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is it.

           Ronnie goes to shut the trunk. Michael STOPS him.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Hold on.

           Michael removes a box labeled WORK.

                                 RONNIE
                        I know it isn’t easy, but, you 
                        don’t need this stuff anymore. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        She loved that job, you know?

           Ronnie nods. Alright then. He closes the trunk.

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           Michael opens the cardboard box, lovingly sorts through his 
           mother’s old belongings: a BOOK OF STAMPS, a WHISTLE. Then--

           He pulls out an old BRASS KEY with the label P.O. Box 444. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                        Huh.

           EXT. ROYAL OAK POST OFFICE - DAY

           A small town post office. Visibly old. Michael enters. 
           INT. ROYAL OAK POST OFFICE - DAY

           Michael locates and opens P.O. Box 444. He retrieves a small 
           PARCEL. This is it? He opens it. Inside is...

           ...A book of VINTAGE STAMPS, a BALLPOINT PEN with its 
           SECURITY CHAIN STILL ATTACHED, and a HANDHELD LABEL PRINTER*.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cool, mom, free labels... 

           But when he picks up the printer, something strange happens. 
           It BEEPS and COMES TO LIFE, unprompted. 

           ANGLE ON: A LABEL slowly prints the words-- 

                               USER NOT RECOGNIZED 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Alright. What???

           ANGLE ON: A new message appears--

                                 VOICE ID ACCEPTED. 

                           WELCOME MICHAEL GRIFFITHS. 

                FOR INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE PROCEED TO WINDOW 5 
                                 AND ASK FOR SINDA. 

           Michael gently RIPS the strip of paper and--

           --THE WORDS DISAPPEAR FROM THE LABEL. Michael struggles to 
           process this. In a daze, he continues over to--

           --WINDOW #5. A teller (tired, overworked, name tag SHIRLEY) 
           greets him.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Sorry sir, window’s closed.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Look, this label maker just 
                        told me... I’m looking for Sinda? 

                                 SHIRLEY
                        May I inquire who’s asking?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Michael Griffiths.
                                 SHIRLEY
                        I’m sorry Michael, Sinda’s out on 
                        route right now. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah but--

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Thanks for coming, love. 

           Shirley turns, steps through a nearby DOORWAY into the--

           MAIL ROOM

           --where a POSTWOMAN, familiar from Michael’s apartment 
           complex, leans against the doorway LISTENING IN. 

           Shirley and Postwoman exchange significant looks. 

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           Michael paces the kitchen. Ronnie watches with concern.

                                 RONNIE
                        Waitwaitwait, you’re saying, what? 
                        The label maker talked to you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It didn’t talk. It... typed.

                                 RONNIE
                        No. Nuh-uh. Even if I believed this 
                        was real and not some projection of 
                        grief--you gonna trust a device 
                        that just starts talking to you? On 
                        some ouija board shit?

                                 RONNIE
                        We paid for those. If you open your 
                        fridge, and a disembodied voice 
                        tells you to step into traffic, you 
                        gonna do that shit? Your mama 
                        raised you better.

           Off Michael: Yeah, maybe...

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - BEDROOM - LATER

           Michael climbs into bed. He holds his mother’s LABEL PRINTER. 
           Then, almost nervously, he lifts it to his mouth.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Hello? This is Michael?

           Nothing. Stupid. He tosses it on the bed stand where--

                        Sorry. Sinda’s out on route.

           2. HOME: Michael holds his mother’s BOOK OF VINTAGE STAMPS. 
           He pulls one out, GASPS as it SLICES his thumb. 

           ANGLE ON: What appears to be a STRAIGHT RAZOR in the stamp.

                        What even is this stuff?

           He picks up the BALLPOINT PEN with its ANTI-THEFT CHAIN still 
           attached. Really? He tosses it on the couch behind him. 

           IN BG: the chain INSTANTLY WINDS AROUND A COUCH CUSHION, 
           squeezing the living shit out of it.

           5. POST OFFICE: Shirley waves him away before he arrives.

                        You sure Sinda is a real person?

           6. STREET: Michael drinks a latté. A POSTAL CARRIER walks by. 
           Michael gives them serious side-eye. 

           7. HOME: Michael struggles to unknot the constricted CHAIN 
           from his throw pillow.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        How did this get so knotted?

                        Listen Shirley. You can wave me off 
                        every day from now to eternity and 
                        I’ll keep. Coming. Back. Or, you 
                        could earn your customer 
                        satisfaction rating for the day by 
                        telling me who this Sinda person 
                        is, and where I can find her. 

           Shirley props a NEXT WINDOW PLEASE sign in her kiosk. 

           Off Michael: So, that’s how it’s going to be.

           INT. THE GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dark. Michael sleeps when a CLAMOR sounds from downstairs. 

           He sits up, alarmed. More SHUFFLING NOISES. He grabs a 
           BASEBALL BAT from beneath the bed.

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael CREEPS into the room where--

           Michael squads up, gripping his bat.

                                 MICHAEL
                        HEY SHITHEAD!!!

           Michael HITS THE LIGHTS. The intruder TURNS. And we see--

           --A FUCKING MASSIVE GOON. The intruder POINTS, and we see--

                                 INTRUDER
                        Are you Michael?

           CLOSE ON: An honest-to-god BAYONET drilled into his forearm.

           Michael clocks this. Processes. Then...

           THE INTRUDER LUNGES. Michael BOOKS IT into the--

           KITCHEN

           --upending CHAIRS, TABLES, PANS as he goes, narrowly missing

           --WHEN... everything goes quiet.

           HALL

           --peering left, right, inching toward the front door when--

           --the INTRUDER LOOMS UP BEHIND HIM. Michael just catches his 
           SHADOW on the wall. He HURLS himself sideways as--

           --THE BAYONET COMES DOWN, where it SLICES Michael’s arm and 
           STICKS into the floor, PINNING HIM THERE by the shirtsleeve.

           Michael reacts instinctually. Face-to-face, the two men 
           exchange a series of CLOSE RANGE BLOWS. Michael SMASHES an 
           elbow into the intruders face and KNEES him in the ribs. We 
           get a sense of just how skilled a fighter he really is.... 
           But the intruder’s better. He GRABS Michael by the hair with 
           his free hand when--

           --there’s a KNOCK AT THE DOOR. The intruder places a hand 
           over Michael’s mouth and leans low. Shhhhh. Michael sniffs. 
           Ugh. Halitosis. Then--

           --the SOUND of a KEY ENTERING THE LOCK. The door OPENS. And 
           there in the entry--

           --IS THAT SAME MYSTERIOUS POSTWOMAN. She has one hand on a 
           RICKETY PUSHCART full of mail. She takes in the scene. 

                                 POSTWOMAN
                        Is everything okay in here?

           A stunned beat. The intruder recovers first. He SLAMS 
           Michael’s head on the floor, WRENCHES free his bayonet, and 
           LUNGES for the postwoman--

           --who grabs her pushcart’s DUCT TAPED HANDLE--

           --AND UNSHEATHS A SWORD. She swings into action, parrying and 
           dueling the bayonets every swipe, graceful, strong, before 
           pivoting to SLICE OFF THE MAN’S FOREARM and placing the blade 
           point to his neck. 

                                 POSTWOMAN (CONT'D)
                        That’s enough.

                                 INTRUDER
                             (resigned)
                        Yeah. I s’pose so. 

           The intruder STEPS FORWARD, driving the blade into his neck. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        JEE-ZUS CHRIST! 

           The postwoman makes an unhappy face. She pulls her sword 
           free. The intruder’s body DROPS. Michael gets to his feet.

                                 POSTWOMAN
                        You must be Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who the hell are you? 

           At long last, meet--

                                 SINDA
                        Sinda Lasko. 

           --40’s, still in her USPS shorts, now splashed with blood. 
           Her lips are fixed in a permanent customer service smile that 
           conceals a shortage of patience and calculated mind. Stocky, 
           with a layer of fat that hides the muscle underneath, you 
           underestimate her at your peril. 

           She opens the front door, surveys the street. 

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t you invite me in for tea? 
                        They’ll be here soon.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who? More of them? 

                                 SINDA
                        The clean up crew. 

           Michael just nods. Sure. Yeah. Of course.

           EXT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Michael PACES, frenetic, while Sinda sits. In BG: a clean up 
           crew carts the intruder’s corpse from the house. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Who was that 
                        guy? And who’re you? I mean...
                             (re: pushcart)
                        They make those with swords now?

                                 SINDA
                        This is old tech. 1980’s. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Right. Of course. 
                                 SINDA
                        Let’s start with basics. What 
                        should I call you? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Michael.

                                 SINDA
                        No nicknames? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not me.

                                 SINDA
                        Mike? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Michael.

                                 SINDA
                        Michael is the fourth most populous 
                        name in the continental United 
                        States. Mike G?

                                 MICHAEL
                        We can’t all be Sindas.

           A confrontational beat. Finally--

                                 SINDA
                        Listen. I’m going to tell you this 
                        once, and not ‘cause I want to. 
                        Your mother was an intelligence 
                        agent tracking a group of 
                        sophisticated bank thieves across 
                        the country. Last week, she 
                        received some new information, but 
                        I’m afraid that...  
                             (clears her throat)
                        ...never got back to us. The man 
                        you saw tonight suggests they want 
                        to tie up loose ends. 

           Michael struggles to process this information.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you saying my mother was 
                        murdered?

                                 SINDA
                        I’m afraid so, yes. 

           Michael sits, suddenly somber. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        So she was, what, FBI?

                                 SINDA
                             (utmost loathing)
                        Absolutely not.

                                 MICHAEL
                        CIA? Secret service? 

           Sinda gives him a curious look.

                                 SINDA
                        How’d you know to ask for me?

                                 MICHAEL
                        This’ll sound crazy, but I found 
                        a... label maker?

                                 SINDA
                        That makes sense. Diane was always 
                        good at trade craft. 

           Sinda give Michael an appraising look.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Let me ask you something. You 
                        graduated Oberlin, with honors. 
                        Enrolled in police academy, top of 
                        your class... and washed out. Three 
                        years and a dozen jobs later--
                        what’re you doing Michael? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re spying on me?

                                 SINDA
                        We have this dossier called 
                        LinkedIn.

           Michael rolls his eyes. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I dunno. I always wanted to be of 
                        service, I guess. My mother was so 
                        driven. But nothing I tried ever 
                        made sense to me.

                                 SINDA
                        You could’ve been a firefighter.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t do fire.
                                 SINDA
                        You know your mother left some 
                        awfully big shoes to fill. The way 
                        I see it: you’re looking for a job. 
                        And I’m looking for her killers. If 
                        that interests you, report to the 
                        post office tomorrow morning.

           Sinda stands, grabs her pushcart, and turns to go.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey.

           She turns back.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        You gonna catch these guys? 

                                 SINDA
                        Yeah. I am. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What time tomorrow?

                                 SINDA
                        Four am.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hold up, four?

           But Sinda just heads for the door. Michael watches her go.

           INT. GRUMMAN LLV - NIGHT

           Sinda parks her car in its dock. She squints and--

           REVERSE ON: Through her windshield OTTO WILSON waits for her.

           EXT. POST OFFICE - AUTO BAY - NIGHT

           Otto offers Sinda a cigar. 

                                 SINDA
                        Those things’ll kill ya. 

                                 OTTO
                        What won’t?

           In the sodium vapor lighting, Otto looks pale. Tired. 

                                 SINDA
                        So how come you’re slumming it down 
                        here? This is flyover country.
                                 OTTO
                        Heard you had an incident, baby 
                        sitting the Griffiths kid. He OK?

                                 SINDA
                        I invited him in tomorrow.

           He gives her a look. Really?

                                 OTTO
                        You’re gettin’ soft.

                                 SINDA
                        This one was all Diane.

                                 OTTO
                        Well, that’s why I’m here. 
                             (then)
                        I need you on the Bonnie Jo case. 

                                 SINDA
                        Officially?

                                 OTTO
                        The FBI wants it to themselves. And 
                        I don’t have to tell you Washington 
                        doesn’t have the most faith in us 
                        right now. This might be the last 
                        real shot we get. I need my best. 

                                 SINDA
                        Resources?

                                 OTTO
                        You’ll have what I have. 

                                 SINDA
                        So not much. Team?

                                 OTTO
                        You pick. Anyone you want. 

           Off Sinda: Anyone? 

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           CLOSE ON: Michael’s iPhone in the dark as the clock hits 3:30 
           and the ALARM SOUNDS. Michael KNOCKS the phone off the table. 

           TWELVE MINUTES LATER

           The ALARM SOUNDS AGAIN. 3:42. Michael reaches down, grabs the 
           phone from the floor, and HURLS IT through the bedroom door.
           TWELVE MINUTES LATER

           The ALARM SOUNDS AGAIN. This time firmly out of reach. 
           Michael stumbles out of bed, retrieves it, looks at the time. 
           3:54. Michael finally comes-to.

                                 MICHAEL
                        SHIT. 

           EXT. POST OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

           Sinda waits on the front steps as--

           --MICHAEL’S DODGE NEON COMES TEARING DOWN THE STREET. He 
           parks haphazard along the curb, falls out of the door, rushes 
           up the steps. Deep breath. Sinda consults her watch.

                                 SINDA
                        Four-oh-one. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Your clock’s a minute fast.

           Sinda’s look could bleach car paint.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Fine. My clock’s a minute slow. 

                                 SINDA
                        Lesson number one: a Postman always 
                        meets his timetable.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wait, a Postman? I thought--

                                 SINDA
                        Michael, if you walk through these 
                        doors, you exit your old life 
                        altogether. You’ll be strictly 
                        forbidden from brooking mention--

                                 MICHAEL
                             (mouthing)
                        “Brooking...”

                                 SINDA
                        --of what you see, learn, or do 
                        here with anyone. Ever. Understand? 

           Michael considers this. He sort of shrugs. Sure. 

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        I need you to answer in the 
                        affirmative.
           He gives it another think.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (firmly)
                        Fuck it.

                                 SINDA
                        That’ll do.

           INT. POST OFFICE - MAIL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           A shabby room made shabbier by old fluorescent lights. 

           POSTAL CARRIERS sort mail into bins for delivery. They GLANCE 
           UP at Michael’s arrival. Sinda nods to them as they pass.

           Sinda leads them to a GIANT MAIL CHUTE. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s that for? Mini vans?

           Sinda OPENS the chute. She CLIMBS IN, pauses, and--

                                 SINDA
                        Watch your head.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re not serious.

           --DROPS OUT OF SIGHT. The door FLIES shut. Michael stands 
           there, fucking gaping. He looks around. The postal carriers 
           sort their mail, uninterested. He pulls down the door, 
           awkwardly clambers inside. He PUSHES FORWARD and drops into--

           THE PERSONNEL CHUTE

           --a METAL TUNNEL full of WINDING CURVES, dimly lit by 
           embedded LEDs along the way, as he HURLS downward, BANGING 
           his head, elbows, flailing for support, when he DROPS into--

           SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS

           --A MASSIVE FOAM PIT. He scrambles out. God his head hurts.

                                 SINDA
                        I should have warned you. Arms and 
                        legs together at all times.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What the hell...

           And only now does he LOOK UP where--
           ANGLE ON: Michael and Sinda stand on a RAISED PLATFORM 
           overlooking a SPRAWLING UNDERGROUND COMPOUND. Stately WHITE 
           PILLARS line a MARBLE TILED FLOOR like an underground 
           Monticello. Enclosed in ORNATELY CURTAINED CUBICLES are 
           massive COMPUTER BANKS. Busy postal employees push carts full 
           of MAIL to-and-fro. Despite its grandeur, it is VISIBLY 
           DECREPIT. DUCT TAPE covers CRACKS in the pillars and tile. 
           Meanwhile, overhead, blanketing the ceiling is--

           --A VAST LABYRINTH OF PNEUMATIC TUBES. Cylinders shuttle to-
           and-fro with velocity.

                                 SINDA
                        Welcome, to the USPS.

           ANGLE ON: A painting of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN above a large SIGN.

                     THE UNITED STATES PROGRAM OF SPIES

           Neither snow nor rain nor gloom of night, nor threat of suffering and death, 
                     stays these agents from the swift completion of their mission.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Pick up your chin and follow me. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sinda leads Michael through the compound. They pass a series 
           of HOLOGRAMS projecting life size images of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN 
           as he spouts popular quotations. Despite the sophisticated 
           technology, the holograms FLICKER. The voice DEEPENS and 
           SQUEAKS at random intervals. Michael eyes them with a mixture 
           of awe and annoyance. 

                                 BEN FRANLKIN HOLOGRAM
                        Three may keep a secret, if two of 
                        them are dead!

                                 SINDA
                        From this point forward, everything 
                        that follows will be judged as part 
                        of your interview evaluation. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Interview? Aren’t I, what do you 
                        call it, a legacy hire? 

                                 BEN FRANKLIN HOLOGRAM
                        By failing to prepare, you are 
                        preparing to fail!
                                 SINDA
                        The USPS is the most selective 
                        intelligence agency in American 
                        history. Of course you have to 
                        interview.

                                 BEN FRANKLIN HOLOGRAM
                        Instead of cursing the darkness--
                        light a candle! 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alright. Where we do we start?

                                                               SLAM TO:

           Sinda hands him a MASSIVE LIABILITY WAIVER.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        This thing must be...

                                 SINDA
                        Four-hundred-and-twenty-two pages. 
                        In summary--
                             (rote, from memory)
                        You, Michael Griffiths, do so 
                        knowingly acknowledge and accept 
                        the risks of the USPS employee 
                        evaluation process, including but 
                        not limited to: damage and-or loss 
                        of bodily appendage, higher 
                        cognitive thought, mortal life, 
                        etcetera. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s a long etcetera.

                                 SINDA
                        You’re welcome to read it yourself.

           But Michael just takes a pen and SIGNS.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sinda marches him back across the compound. Michael eyes the 
           pneumatic tubes overhead. They make him uneasy. 

                                 SINDA
                        You’ll be asked to pass a series of 
                        diagnostic assessments, after which 
                        you will be assigned a probationary 
                        period with a senior agent, who 
                        will sign off on your stamp of 
                        approval.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Are dad jokes part of the gig?

                                 SINDA
                        It’s a real stamp.

           She waves him into a cramped--

           SCREENING ROOM

           --where a mix of old recliner chairs face a pulldown 
           projector screen. Populating the seats are TWO RECRUITS. 

                                 SINDA
                        This is where I leave you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hang on. There are others?

           Michael suddenly becomes very aware of his PAJAMAS. 

                                 SINDA
                        You didn’t think you’d be the only 
                        one, did you? 

           She pats him firmly on the shoulder and departs. He sits.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (sotto)
                        God, this looks like my high school 
                        classroom. 

           The young woman just ahead turns in her seat.

                                 RECRUIT #1
                        Your high school classroom was 
                        almost certainly better funded.

           Meet TIANA PARK: 30’s, Asian-American, strong willed. 

                                 TIANA
                        Tiana. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Michael. 

                                 TIANA
                        How’d they rope you in then?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s a family thing, I guess. You?

                                 TIANA
                        Navy SEALs. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        Got it...

                                 RECRUIT #2
                             (eyeing Michael’s clothes)
                        You planning for a slumber party? 

           Meet EDWARD HARUTINIAN: 30’s, Armenian-American, chippy. 

                                 TIANA
                        Ignore Edward. I’ve never met an 
                        analyst who knew how to talk to 
                        people. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You know each other?

                                 TIANA
                        We went through round one together.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Round one?

                                 TIANA
                        Full physical, written exam?

                                 EDWARD
                        God don’t tell me they just picked 
                        you off the street.

           Michael’s on the cusp of a rejoinder when THE LIGHTS DIM. 

                                 TIANA
                        Showtime. 

           She turns around in her seat. Michael settles in as--

           ON SCREEN: An OLD CARTOON begins to play on the projector, 
           laughably out of date, the same style as SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK. 
           Out zooms AN ANIMATED LETTER... a talking letter of course.

                                 JOHN THE TALKING LETTER
                        Recruits! Welcome! You can address 
                        me Dear, John. It’s my job to make 
                        sure you know our noble history... 
                        right down to the letter. 

           ANGLE ON: Michael, gobsmacked. 

           ON SCREEN: As the lesson plays out, John wanders through a 
           kaleidoscope of American history: Benjamin Franklin’s kite is 
           struck by lightning, when a THOUGHT BUBBLE with a LIGHT BULB 
           appears above his head; red coats are CHASED OFF THE MAP into 
           the sea.
                                 JOHN THE TALKING LETTER (CONT'D)
                        Established in 1775 by the Second 
                        Continental Congress, the USPS was 
                        the brainchild of our first 
                        Postmaster General: Benjamin 
                        Franklin. Following the 
                        Revolutionary War, the fragile 
                        American Union was in need of 
                        protection--to stamp out treason 
                        and sedition. 

           ON SCREEN: John SQUASHES a cartoon VILLAIN.

                        This presented a unique problem: 
                        how to be in all places at once, 
                        from Washington to the Western 
                        Frontier... and everywhere in 
                        between. Thusly, a federalized mail 
                        organization was born--as a 
                        convenience, sure, but more 
                        importantly as a cover. 

           ON SCREEN: John hops into a PNEUMATIC TUBE, whizzing across 
           the vast expanse of the entire American map.

                        In the centuries since, the Postal 
                        Office has risen to great heights, 
                        with Postmaster General elevated to 
                        a cabinet level position in 1872--
                        but as with all great institutions, 
                        the USPS has seen its role steadily 
                        diminished. 

           ON SCREEN: John sits outside Capitol Hill in the RAIN.

                        Following the Postal Reorganization 
                        Act of 1970, the agency was 
                        mandated to “pay for itself” and 
                        has since reduced in size. What we 
                        lack in scope, however, we make up 
                        for in spirit. 

           ON SCREEN: The clouds part. The sun shines down as--

           ANGLE ON: Several CYLINDERS whiz into the pneumatic tubes 
           above the room. They STOP. Michael glances up.

                        we’re on the beat, making sure you, 
                        your neighbors, and your community 
                        receive their mail. Safe and sound.

           ON SCREEN: John turns to look out at the audience.

                                 JOHN THE TALKING LETTER (CONT'D)
                        This is the journey ahead of you: 
                        to join the most storied American 
                        institution there is. Which leaves 
                        me with only four words: good luck, 
                        and god speed. 

           Suddenly THE VIDEO CUTS. The pneumatic tubes above OPEN, 
           dropping THREE CYLINDERS to the floor, where they release a 
           NOXIOUS GAS. All three recruits begin to COUGH. 

           Edward wastes no time lunging for the door: locked.

           Tiana nobly DROPS on top of one canister, suppressing it with 
           her body. Meanwhile--

           --Michael acts on instinct. He removes his pajama shirt and 
           ties it swiftly around his face. He crosses the room for the 
           SNACK TABLE where he grabs a small PITCHER OF WATER and 
           DOUSES the first of three canisters. 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (to Tiana)
                        GET UP!

           Michael grabs a second canister and SHOVES IT deep into the 
           cushions of the recliner chair. Its gas continues to leak 
           out, but slowly. Tiana follows his lead. 

           Meanwhile, Edward just HAMMERS on the door: stubborn.

           Michael takes a beat, assessing their options. He spots a 
           VENT overhead. The entry is small. He waves Tiana over.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        You get help.

                                 TIANA
                        Get help? This is a test.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You got a better idea?

           Well... no. Michael gives Tiana a BOOST. She RIPS the vent 
           grate free and CRAWLS inside. Michael rushes over to Edward.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Get low, head to the floor.

                                 EDWARD
                        We’ve got to get out!

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’re not getting out. You’ve got 
                        to keep the gas away from your 
                        eyes. Get low.

           Michael forces them into a crouch when--

           --THE SPRINKLERS ACTIVATE, dousing the fumes, and the 
           PROJECTOR SCREEN RISES into the ceiling, revealing--

           --A HIDDEN ROOM. Sinda, Otto, and a BURLY MAN look out. Tiana 
           stands beside them beneath a broken vent grate.

                                 CHEF 
                        Recruits, fall in.

           Meet GIL CARTER aka CHEF: 40’s, with a grizzled beard and 
           potbelly, he’s our resident Quartermaster. More Action 
           Bronson or Killer Mike than Ben Whishaw, with perpetually 
           grease stained hands, he sounds like a hard ass but can’t 
           conceal a quick-trigger smile and jovial sense of humor.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations on passing your 
                        first test! Michael--nice job. 
                             (little nod)
                        My name is Chef, and I’ll be the 
                        bane of your existence for the next 
                        two weeks of your life... if it 
                        lasts that long. I’m acting 
                        Quartermaster for the USPS Midwest 
                        Division, and if you think I’m 
                        anything like that British asshole 
                        from the movies, you’ve got another 
                        thing coming. Before we continue, 
                        I’m legally bound to ask one more 
                        time: do any of you want to fuck 
                        off back where you came from?

           A quiet beat. Michael, Tiana, and Edward stand pat.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Good. Let’s get started. 

           MONTAGE: USPS BOOT CAMP

           Michael’s training gets underway along with Sinda’s 
           investigation.
           1. STEALTH TRAINING: All three recruits are given BLUE POLOS 
           and TROUSERS with BELLS STITCHED to the seams. They’re waved 
           into a FAKE CUL-DE-SAC. This is where new Postmen are made.

                                 CHEF
                        Stealth is paramount to a Postman. 
                        The uniform will fool most of the 
                        world to your purpose, but some 
                        enemies always know. It is your 
                        task to deliver this letter-- 

           Chef hands them all an ENVELOPE. 

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        --to that house--

           Chef points to a CLAPBOARD HOUSE at the end of the street.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        --without ringing a single bell.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What kind of enemies? 

           Chef GRINS.

                                 CHEF
                        Thanks for volunteering, Michael. 
                        You go first.

           Michael shrugs.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Watch and learn.

           He steps into the street, moving slowly, when... 

           RING.

           Immediately THREE LARGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS come BARRELING into 
           the road, BARKING and SNARLING. Michael RUNS FOR SAFETY.

           2. GADGET TRAINING: A cinderblock room lined with shelves 
           of... ordinary looking postal equipment. Chef demonstrates to 
           the recruits how to TAPE SHUT a cardboard package.

                                 CHEF
                        Easy now. Assume every package is 
                        fragile. And keep a close eye on 
                        your devices at all times.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Afraid our tape’ll fall into the 
                        wrong hands? 
           Chef GINGERLY LIFTS Michael’s package from the table.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        That one’s empty, you know.

                                 CHEF
                        There’ll come a time you have to 
                        toss secrecy out the window.

           Chef crosses the room to a FREESTANDING DOOR incongruously 
           stationed in the middle of the room. He sets Michael’s 
           package delicately on the doorstep.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        You might be detained by an enemy 
                        agent. You might be in imminent 
                        danger. You might just need to get 
                        through a door. 

           Chef walks back to the huddled recruits. He grabs Michael’s 
           roll of tape, clicks a BUTTON on its handle, and...

           THE PACKAGE EXPLODES, BLASTING THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES. 

           Michael DUCKS. Tiana and Edward stand firm. 

           From behind a two-way mirror, SINDA WATCHES.

           3. SITUATION ROOM: SINDA video chats with her FRENCH 
           COUNTERPART ABELARD. He sits in front of a logo for LA POSTE.

                                 SINDA
                        Abe--

                                 ABELARD
                        Abelard, s’il vous plait.

                                 SINDA
                        --what can you tell me?

                                 ABELARD
                        We arrived at Crédit Agricole just 
                        as Bonnie was escaping. My 
                        impression was... how do you say? 
                        “Scorched earth.” She abducted cinq 
                        bank tellers and threw them from 
                        the auto during our pursuit. 

                                 SINDA
                        And what did she take, exactly?

                                 ABELARD
                        De l’argent! Money! What else? 
           Off Sinda, skeptical.

           4. HUNTINGTON BANK HQ: A nondescript bank on a relatively 
           quiet city street. 

           BOOM. The glass windows ERUPT with a sudden EXPLOSION. 

           Bonnie and her crew step calmly onto the street. Bumper drags 
           a BANK TELLER by the HAIR.

                                 BONNIE
                        When they ask, tell them what 
                        happened to your colleagues. Tell 
                        them: those who work for the 
                        oppressors are complicit.

           5. HOME: Night. Michael falls into bed, exhausted. 

           6. HOME: Morning. Still dark. Michael rushes out of bed.

           7. PERSONNEL CHUTE: Michael SMASHES his head climbing in.

           8. HEADQUARTERS: Michael stops Sinda in the halls. He BLEEDS 
           from his forehead.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sinda. Look, this training thing is 
                        cool and all, but I came here to 
                        work on my mom’s case. I can help. 

                                 SINDA
                        You’ve got to walk before you run.
                             (re: blood)
                        You’ve got something.

           She moves off. Michael watches her go, frustrated.

           9. COMBAT TRAINING: The recruits gather in a padded room. 

                                 CHEF
                        Hand-to-hand combat is the last 
                        line of defense, but a crucial 
                        skill. Pair up. 

           Tiana turns to face Michael. Edward uneasily faces Chef. 

           Tiana SWEEPS his legs out from under him and KICKS him in the 
           face. Edward snickers but FLINCHES as Chef advances on him. 

           10. MAIL DELIVERY TRAINING: Chef drives a Grumman LLV around 
           a quaint suburban neighborhood. He drops the recruits on a 
           STREET CORNER. 
                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Deliver the mail and meet at the 
                        rendezvous when you’re finished.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Just... deliver the mail?

                                 CHEF
                        All part of the job.

           Chef grins and pulls off.

           11. STEALTH TRAINING: Edward stands on the ROOF of a parked 
           car while GERMAN SHEPHERDS lunge at his feet. 

           Chef steps into the road and WHISTLES the dogs off. 

           12. GADGET TRAINING: Chef wheels out a postal PUSH CART.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh I know what this one does.

                                 CHEF
                        Do you?

           Chef wheels the pushcart around to face a MANNEQUIN at the 
           far end of the room. He presses a button on the handle and...

           A SPOUT APPEARS from the end of the push cart GEYSERING 
           FLAME. When it’s over, the mannequin is, alas, no more.

           12. HOME: Night. Michael sits with a BOTTLE OF BOURBON. He 
           pores over his mother’s belongings. 

           13. HOME: Michael stumbles out of bed, the EMPTY BOTTLE OF 
           BOURBON on his nightstand. Hungover.

           14. PERSONNEL CHUTE: Michael VOMITS in the tunnel.

           15. HEADQUARTERS: Michael stops Sinda again.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sinda, listen, I’m ready--

                                 SINDA
                        Not now Michael.

           She gives a SNIFF. Ugh. She moves off. Michael fumes.

           16. RURAL SUBDIVISION: Sinda KNOCKS on a quaint bungalow. An 
           ELDERLY LADY answers the door.
                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Afternoon. I have a package for
                        Bonnie Jo Boone? 

                                 ELDERLY LADY
                        Oh dear, I haven’t seen Bonnie in, 
                        it must be going on ten years. 

                                 SINDA
                        Alright then. Have a nice day now!

           She moves off, frustrated. 

           17. COMBAT TRAINING: Michael faces Edward. Edward SNIFFS. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Is that vomit?

           Michael exploits the moment of hesitation. He locks Edward in 
           a headlock and drops to the floor. Michael HEAVES, the strain 
           getting to him. Then... 

           He VOMITS all over Edward’s head. Edward TAPS OUT. 

                                 CHEF
                        My man Michael. Unconventional, but 
                        effective.

           Michael rushes to the nearest trash can to vomit again.

           18. GADGET TRAINING: Chef pulls out a BOOK OF STAMPS.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Each logo in our Forever stamps 
                        collection signals a different 
                        device. 
                             (pointing)
                        The Bald Eagle is our button 
                        camera. The Liberty Bell is a 
                        surveillance microphone. The 
                        American Flag is a GPS tracker. 

           Off Michael: No shit.

           19. HOME: Michael investigates the STAMPS on his CHILDHOOD 
           BEDROOM DOOR. One EAGLE and one LIBERTY BELL flank the name 
           Michael. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Damn ma, really?

           20. MAIL DELIVERY TRAINING: Tiana and Edward stuff mailboxes 
           SWIFTLY, ROBOTICALLY, while--
           Michael STROLLS down the street. He WAVES to NEIGHBOR PHIL.

                                 PHIL
                        Michael! You look like death.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Long week Phil. What’s your excuse?

                                 PHIL
                        Nervous for the game tonight! You 
                        watching?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh yeah.

           Michael stops to CHAT. Tiana and Edward ROLL THEIR EYES. 

           21. STEALTH TRAINING: Michael moves at a COMICALLY SLOW PACE 
           across the course. He SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERS his letter.

           SINDA WATCHES from the doorway.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Sinda video chats with Otto on screen. She looks exhausted. 
           She eyes a COUNTDOWN CLOCK on the screen.

           ANGLE ON: 04 days, 08 hours, 24 minutes, 42 seconds.

                                 SINDA
                        She’s a ghost, Otto. 

                                 OTTO
                        You’ll smoke her out. 

                                 SINDA
                        What about Diane? Any forensics on 
                        the crime scene?

                                 OTTO
                        Nothing helpful.  

                                 SINDA
                        I’d like to take another look.

           Off Otto: Suit yourself.

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Michael, Tiana, Edward, and Chef sit in a circular formation 
           of folding chairs, vaguely reminiscent of group therapy.
                                 CHEF
                        We’ve exercised your physical 
                        abilities. In Michael’s case, we’ve 
                        measured his gag reflex. Now, we’ve 
                        got to test your emotional IQ. 

           Michael shifts in his seat, uncomfortable.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        I’d like you each to share a moment 
                        where you faced a personal 
                        hardship, and how that hardship 
                        affected you. Tiana?  

                                 TIANA
                             (no hesitation)
                        When I was six years old, my sister 
                        was killed in a car collision with 
                        a drunk driver. I carried a lot of 
                        guilt about that as a kid. I guess 
                        that’s something I still carry 
                        today, wanting to honor her memory.

           Michael fidgets, completely thrown by this shift in tone.

                                 CHEF
                        That’s thoughtful, thanks for 
                        sharing. Edward? 

                                 EDWARD
                        My father struggles with addiction. 
                        He left the family when I was 
                        twelve. I’ve been providing for my 
                        family ever since, and it’s that 
                        same sense of service that 
                        propelled me to intelligence.

           Michael SNORTS.

                                 CHEF
                        Something funny Michael? If you 
                        need to blow chunks, please God, 
                        find a trash can. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m good.

                                 CHEF
                        It’s your turn.

                                 MICHAEL
                        When I was twelve, my neighbor 
                        Ronnie... he, y’know, he... hid a 
                        dead spider in my pizza toppings.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Pepperoni hasn’t been the same for 
                        me ever since.

                                 CHEF
                        You always resort to sarcasm when 
                        you’re feeling vulnerable?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are we done?

           Chef just makes a NOTE on his clipboard.

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Michael heads home for the evening when he PAUSES outside an 
           open door. The BLUE LIGHT of computer screens leaks out. He 
           peers around and creeps inside the--

           SITUATION ROOM

           --where he confronts the image before him. 

           ON SCREEN: A photo of DIANE at the SCENE OF HER MURDER. Her 
           body, a pool of blood. Michael stares when--

                                 SINDA (O.S.)
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s how you found her?

           Sinda POWERS OFF the screen.

                                 SINDA
                        You’re not cleared to see this. 

           Michael stares at Sinda, fuming. He stalks off.

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael stalks toward the PERSONNEL CHUTE when-- 

                                 EDWARD (O.S.)
                        You wouldn’t have beaten me the 
                        other day if you didn’t yack all 
                        over my fucking uniform.

           Michael turns. Edward swaggers up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ve had that stick up your ass 
                        so long, you can’t even remember 
                        who put it there.
                                 EDWARD
                        I spent ten years at NSA waiting 
                        for an opportunity like this. What 
                        have you done? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Look, I’ve got skin in the game 
                        here. I’m just trying my best.

                                 EDWARD
                        So was your mother, but from what I 
                        hear, she couldn’t hack it either. 

           Michael SNAPS. He HITS Edward in the nose. Hard. But Edward 
           gives as good as he gets. An UGLY FIGHT breaks out. Holograms 
           of Ben Franklin FLICKER and SQUEAL as they tussle past.

                                 CHEF 
                        FALL OUT!

           CHEF BREAKS THEM APART.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        What the hell’s going on? 

                                 BEN FRANKLIN HOLOGRAM
                        Whatever is begun in anger, ends in 
                        shame!

                                 EDWARD
                        He fucking hit me. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s twice in one week. I don’t 
                        get extra credit? 

           Sinda comes striding up. 

                                 SINDA
                        I’ll take it from here. 

           Chef nods. He shepherds Edward away. 

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Michael, go home.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Headed there now.

                                 SINDA
                        Officially. I’m benching you. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What? Sinda. My bad, but--
                                 BEN FRANKLIN HOLOGRAM
                        Never ruin an apology with an 
                        excuse!

                                 MICHAEL
                        --SHUT! UP!

           Michael STOMPS on the hologram’s floor projector. It FREEZES.

                                 SINDA
                        I made a mistake throwing you into 
                        this. You’re too emotionally 
                        involved. 
                             (softening)
                        Take some time. We can revisit your 
                        application once the case is 
                        closed.

           She turns and heads off. Michael watches her go. 

           EXT. POST OFFICE - AUTO BAY - DAY

           Sinda starts her Grumman LLV. She SIGHS. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           A familiar rural road.

           EXT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - DAY

           The site of Diane’s murder. Sinda approaches. 

                                 SINDA
                        Post office!

           No answer. She rounds the back of the house. She spots 
           several jerry rigged CABLE LINES. That’s interesting. 

           INT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - DAY

           Sinda kneels by a baseboard where SEVERAL CUT CABLES jut out 
           from a drilled hole in the wall. She pulls out her PACKAGE 
           SCANNER, points, and--

           --OTTO’S HOLOGRAM APPEARS IN THE ROOM... upside down.

                                 OTTO 
                        Well?

                                 SINDA
                        One second. The damn image...

           She SWIVELS the scanner. Otto’s image faces her--before 
           FLIPPING UPSIDE DOWN AGAIN.
                                 OTTO
                        What is it?

                                 SINDA
                        We’ve got to upgrade our gear.

                                 OTTO
                        Just talk to me.

           Sinda bends into a crouch. This is awkward.

                                 SINDA
                        I want a track and trace of cable 
                        lines countrywide. Any place 
                        derelict, remote, or just plain 
                        strange, we inspect.

                                 OTTO
                        What’s the angle?

                                 SINDA
                        Bonnie’s robbing banks alright, but 
                        she’s not just crashing a few 
                        safes. The real action’s happening 
                        on a computer somewhere. 

                                 OTTO
                        So ordered.

           Sinda nods. Good. 

           EXT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - DAY

           Sinda gets in her Grumman LLV. From the nearby TREELINE--

           --JEREMIAH WATCHES. 

           EXT. RURAL FACTORY - DAY

           A sprawling, derelict warehouse. Overgrowing with weeds.

           INT. RURAL FACTORY - DAY

           A vast and gloomy assembly line. We CRANE DOWN through the 
           murk to find JEREMIAH as he enters the factory, WHISTLING, 
           still playing with his knives, as he crosses the seemingly 
           deserted warehouse. He arrives outside a FURNACE...

           Only it isn’t a furnace. He SLIDES the massive piece of 
           machinery on its hidden track to reveal a SECRET ENTRY. He 
           descends the steps. Welcome to Bonnie Jo Boone’s-- 
           VILLAIN’S LAIR

           Rows and rows of SERVERS flank a central COMPUTER CONSOLE. 

           ON SCREEN: Monetary sums scroll beneath the word downloading.

           In a back corner of the high tech compound, find BONNIE 
           leaning above what looks like the remnants of an old 
           DENTIST’S CHAIR. A shirtless GOON is STRAPPED to the seat. 
           Bumper stands nearby, watching.  

                                 BONNIE
                        Little pinch.

           Bonnie INJECTS the shirtless goon with a needle.

                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        That ought to take the edge off.

           Jeremiah approaches. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Boss.

                                 BONNIE
                        Well? What’ve you got for me?

                                 JEREMIAH
                        You were right. Another postwoman 
                        turned up, poking around. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Mm.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I could have handled her for you.

                                 BONNIE
                        No. You can kill one cockroach, but 
                        until you find the nest, they’ll 
                        keep coming back. 

           Bonnie busies herself with the project in front of her. She 
           grabs a welded METAL VEST, lays it on top of the shirtless 
           goon the way a tailor sizes up a suit. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Maybe.

                                 BUMPER
                        What would you like to see happen?
                                 JEREMIAH
                        Turn us loose. We could have half 
                        this country’s aristocracy dead by 
                        tomorrow afternoon. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Too short sighted. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        That’s not revolutionary enough?

                                 BONNIE
                        The wealthy aren’t the problem. You 
                        can’t fairly expect them to act 
                        against self interest. It’s the 
                        rest of them. The ordinary, the 
                        oppressed, that are holding back 
                        change. They lack resolve to do 
                        what’s necessary. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        And you’re going to give them that?

                                 BONNIE
                        Do you know what changes the world? 
                        Productive suffering. Move people 
                        out of stasis, into action. 

           Bonnie grabs a POWER DRILL. She leans down and--

                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re damn right I’m gonna give it 
                        to them.

           --DRILLS HER BREASPLATE INTO THE RESTRAINED GOON’S SHOULDER.

           INT. THE GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           Michael and Ronnie sit on the living room couch watching 
           basketball. Michael SLOUCHES, visibly lethargic. Ronnie eats 
           from a Chinese food takeout box.

                                 RONNIE
                        You wanna get up in this lo mein?

           Michael shakes his head.

                        Hey what’s going on with you? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Nothing. I’m watching the game.

           Ronnie sets his container down.

                        Look, I don’t need the whole story, 
                        but these past few weeks, you’ve 
                        been a different dude. Focused. I 
                        might even say... happy? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah well, I had a job opportunity.

                                 RONNIE
                        With who?

                                 MICHAEL
                        The USPS actually.

                                 RONNIE
                        Okay. Okay! Your label maker tell 
                        you to apply?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Something like that.

                                 RONNIE
                        Watch. You’re gonna wind up in some 
                        secret society. Some Freemason, 
                        Illuminati type shit. 

           Ronnie misses Michael’s face: if you only knew.

                        So what’s the status?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Man, my supervisor--

                                 RONNIE
                        No. No! I don’t want to hear that 
                        shit. I say this with love, but 
                        Michael, get out of your own way. 
                        You want this job?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. I do.

                                 RONNIE
                        Tell me why.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What?

                        Why do you want it? 
                                 MICHAEL
                        When my mom died, I didn’t just 
                        lose her. I lost the chance to get 
                        to know her better. And now that I 
                        have... access to who she was, what 
                        was important to her, I feel like I 
                        can see her clearer. 
                             (then)
                        I don’t want that to stop. 

           Off Ronnie: proud.

           EXT. POST OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

           Still dark. Michael takes the front steps two at a time.

           INT. POST OFFICE - MAIL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Michael waves to SHIRLEY.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s good Shirley.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        You’re early today.

                                 MICHAEL
                        If you’re not early, you’re late.

           Michael climbs into the personnel chute. 

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael DROPS into frame, finds his feet, and--

           ANGLE ON: A CRUSH OF MOVEMENT in the room. 

           Michel frowns, what’s going on? He moves into the chaos. He 
           finds EDWARD and TIANA lurking on the outskirts.

                                 EDWARD
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Taking my exam. What’s going on?

                                 TIANA
                        We don’t know. 

           Sinda, Chef, and Otto approach the recruits.
                                 SINDA
                        Michael?

           Before she can send him home, Michael steps forward.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Before you say anything: you were 
                        right to come down on me. But my 
                        mom gave her life for this. I don’t 
                        think I appreciated what that meant 
                        at first, but I get it now. I’m not 
                        asking for special treatment. I’m 
                        just asking you give me one more 
                        chance to show you what I’ve got.

                                 SINDA
                        What do you think Chef?

           Chef claps Michael on the shoulder so hard his knees buckle.

                                 CHEF
                        God knows I love a tearjerker. 

           Sinda NODS. Michael steps back into line.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Listen up. Due to fuckery beyond 
                        our control, we’ve got to speed up 
                        the selection process. Normally I’d 
                        take special pleasure in putting 
                        you each through hell, but today, 
                        Sinda here will administer an 
                        abbreviated exam.  

           Chef steps back. Sinda steps forward.

                                 SINDA
                        Edward, what can you tell us about 
                        the family living at 453 Sycamore? 

           Off Edward: huh? 

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        They fall on your mail route, is 
                        that correct?

                                 EDWARD
                        That’s correct.

                                 SINDA
                        Anything will do.

                                 EDWARD
                        They have... brown fencing?
                                 SINDA
                        Right. Tiana, what about the couple 
                        on 236 Oakwood?

                                 TIANA
                        I’m sorry. I don’t recall.

                        cameraman for Channel 4. They’re 
                        great, but I dunno about their kid. 
                        Chuck. He’s got them Adderal eyes. 
                        I’m pretty sure he’s using. 

                                 SINDA
                        And what about our colleagues on 
                        the ground floor? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Shirley and Brenda work the front. 
                        Shirley’s cool, but don’t catch 
                        Brenda in the morning. If she ever 
                        adjusted to these hours, you 
                        couldn’t tell. 

           Sinda exchanges a glance with Otto and Chef behind her. Otto 
           NODS. Chef SHRUGS. Good enough for Sinda. 

                                 SINDA
                             (to Michael)
                        Come with me. 

           She turns and heads off. He follows.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I got the job!?

                                 SINDA
                        You’re, and I can’t stress this 
                        enough, on a probationary period.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can do probation! What about the 
                        others? You gonna wipe their minds? 
                        Turn ‘em into vegetables?
                                 SINDA
                        Tiana will be assigned to Otto’s 
                        security detail. Edward will work 
                        with Chef. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Shame.

           Sinda rolls her eyes. She halts outside a closed door.

                                 SINDA
                        You ready to suit up? 

           Off Michael: Is he ever.

           LATER

           Sinda hands him a UNIFORM with his NAME embroidered on front.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t get like, a tailor or 
                        something?

                                 SINDA
                        You get a brand new uniform.
                             (then)
                        Well, not brand new.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about a code name?

                                 SINDA
                        This isn’t a cover you can take on 
                        or off. This is a cover you live. 
                        Now get a move on. We’ve got a 
                        plane to catch.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where we going?

           Off Sinda: you’ll see...

                        We now believe Bonnie is hacking 
                        the world’s largest banking 
                        mainframes. Her heists are pure 
                        theater, used as a distraction. 
           INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY

           Michael and Sinda ride between crates of MAIL. Sinda shouts 
           to be heard as they fly over--

           CHYRON UP: New York, New York. 10017.

                                 SINDA 
                        She’s methodical. To date, Bonnie 
                        has hit nine of the world’s ten 
                        largest banks.

                        Which leaves one obvious target.

           ANGLE ON: THE TOWERING JP MORGAN CHASE SKYSCRAPER.

           A jammed street, including one mail van stuck in traffic.

           INT. GRUMMAN LLV - DAY

           Sinda drives, at a standstill. Michael picks at a peeling 
           piece of VINYL on the dashboard.

                                 MICHAEL
                        They couldn’t have given you a 
                        loaner for this gig?

                                 SINDA
                        Keep an eye on the sidewalks. 

           Michael stares out the window. He eyes the crowds. He glances 
           up again at that looming edifice when HE FREEZES. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Holy shit.

           ANGLE ON: A DISTANT JEREMIAH SCALES THE BUILDING EXTERIOR. 
           Bare feet, bare hands, head down, crawling along the 
           structure like SPIDERMAN. 

                                 SINDA
                        We’re late.

           Sinda HONKS. Michael OPENS the car door.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll be faster on foot.
           He hesitates, one foot out the door, waiting for the OK. 
           Sinda hands him a SURGICAL MASK.

                                 SINDA
                        Use your coms.
                             (off Michael’s nod)
                        And hey. Don’t get killed on your 
                        first day.

           Michael heads out on foot.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - STREET - DAY

           Michael power walks through the crowd. He puts on his 
           SURGICAL MASK while--

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sinda, do you read?

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        Welcome to the service kid.

           --Jeremiah CUTS THROUGH a glass window and crawls inside--

           JP MORGAN CHASE HQ - EMPTY OFFICE

           Jeremiah scrambles behind the door. He flips a KNIFE between 
           his fingers. He checks his watch as THE DOOR OPENS. A BANKER 
           walks inside. Spots the open window. FREEZES as-- 

           --JEREMIAH COMES UPON HIM FROM BEHIND. We don’t need to see 
           what happens next.

           INT. JP MORGAN CHASE HQ - HALLWAY - LATER

           Jeremiah exits the banker’s office wearing his SUIT. He POPS 
           the lapel to cover a spray of BLOOD at his collar’s nape.

           He plays with a SECURITY BADGE. Meanwhile, on the--

           STREET

           Michael arrives outside the banking compound. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m outside.

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        Before going in, read the street. 
                        Do you see anything?

           He pauses to survey the SWIRL OF HUMANITY around him.
                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t know...

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        Take a breath. 

           Deep inhale. Michael steadies. He surveys the crowded 
           sidewalk. All appears normal until...

           He spots a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS enter the building. 

           CLOSE ON: A woman with a long braid and COMBAT BOOTS.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I might have something.

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        Tread lightly. I’m on my way.

           Michael slips into the--

           LOBBY

           --an absolute behemoth of corporate America. Suits 
           everywhere. Michael watches the group of construction workers 
           approach the security kiosk. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can’t be sure.

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        We need a positive ID.

                                 MICHAEL
                        If it’s her?

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        Don’t do anything. Wait for me.

           Michael approaches the security kiosk. He takes his place 
           RIGHT NEXT to the huddle of construction workers. 

                                 SECURITY #1
                        Hello sir, can I help you? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, I have a package here...

           Michael “accidentally” SPILLS his satchel on the floor. 
           Envelopes go everywhere.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Dammit.
           He kneels and casts a glance up when--

           --the CONSTRUCTION CREW kneel to help. Friendly, civilians.

                                 CONSTRUCTION #1
                        It’s a lot to lug around.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thanks.

           The crew nods and moves off. Michael heaves a sigh of relief 
           when...

           A SECOND CONSTRUCTION CREW arrives at the kiosk behind him. 
           Michael casts a sidelong glance, FREEZES.

                                 SECURITY #2
                        Can I help you?

                                 BONNIE
                        Good morning. We have a work order 
                        here from a Mr. Powers. 
                        Maintenance, top floor. 

           Michael tries to play it cool. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                             (whisper)
                        Positive ID. I repeat, positive ID.

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        Stand down. I’m nearly there.

                                 SECURITY #1
                        I’m sorry sir?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh, just talking to myself! Y’know.

                                 SECURITY #1
                        I’ll take that package.

           A nearby ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS. JEREMIAH exits. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                             (calling over)
                        They’re with me! 

                                 MICHAEL 
                             (whispering)
                        She’s going to get away.

           Security #1 eyes him suspiciously. He RISES as--
                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        STAND DOWN. 

           Jeremiah badges open the gate. Bonnie and the crew move off. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You know, I think the person I’m 
                        looking for is just here.
                             (turning)
                        Bonnie Jo Boone?

           Everything GOES STILL. The crew HALTS. Michael WATCHES. Then--

                                 BONNIE
                             (without turning)
                        Is that you, Michael? 

                                 SINDA (V.O.)
                        Fucking hell.

           --CHAOS ERUPTS. Several things happen, all at once.

           Bonnie NODS before CONTINUING ON uninterrupted. A GIANT GOON 
           PIVOTS. Raises a GUN.

           Security #1 is quick on the draw. He pulls his pistol on the 
           GIANT GOON.

           A Grumman LLV LEAPS the curb, SCATTERING pedestrians outside, 
           before SHATTERING the lobby’s window. 

           Michael LEAPS for cover. Massive Goon FIRES, missing him by 
           inches.

           Security #1 OPENS FIRE, striking Massive Goon in the chest...

           But Massive Goon simply turns, aims, SHOOTS both security 
           guards. He TOSSES OFF his construction jacket revealing A 
           FULL-SCALE EXOSUIT welded to his body. Clearly festering in 
           places, the pain causes him to move haltingly.

           Sinda rolls her PUSHCART from the van. She aims and opens 
           MACHINE GUN FIRE on the elevator bank--

           --forcing Bonnie and her crew to RETREAT for cover. 

                                 BUMPER
                        We’re blown boss.

           Bonnie looks furious. Even so, she starts to SING.

                                 BONNIE
                             (singing)
                        One day to a new beginning.
           The Massive Goon pivots, FIRES at Sinda, who RETURNS FIRE, 
           each bullet pinging off his armor. She DUCKS for cover. 

                                 SINDA
                        We’ve got to take down the big guy!

                                 BONNIE
                             (singing)
                        Every man will be a king.

           Bonnie pulls out a FLASH BANG GRENADE while--

           --Michael pulls out his PACKAGE SCANNER. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cover me.

                                 BONNIE
                             (singing)
                        There’s a new world for the 
                        winning.

           Sinda OPENS FIRE. Michael STANDS. He TASES the Massive Goon--

           --and the electric charge CONDUCTS ACROSS HIS METAL ARMOR. It 
           isn’t a pretty sight. He FALLS with a THUD as--

                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Do you hear the people sing?

           Bonnie LOBS two GRENADES into the lobby. One rolls RIGHT TO 
           MICHAEL’S FEET. He barely has time to react.

                              BANG
                                         BANG

           Michael FALLS. His ears begin to RING. 

           MICHAEL’S POV: All smoke, moving shapes, no clarity, until 
           SINDA comes swimming into focus.

                                 SINDA 
                             (as though a long way off)
                        Up. Get up. 

           Sinda HEAVES him to his feet, STEERS him toward the car as--

           ANGLE ON: Bonnie and her crew hop inside TWO SUVs. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We lost ‘em.
                                 SINDA
                        You clearly haven’t seen me drive.

           She DUMPS him in the passenger seat, climbs in.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’re not gonna catch ‘em in this!

           Sinda spares a little GRIN. She puts the car in GEAR...

           Which is when it happens. THE GRUMMAN LLV TRANSFORMS*. Old 
           SPEEDOMETERS are replaced with DIGITAL SCREENS including a 
           CROSSHAIR angle of the street. The DASHBOARD OPENS revealing 
           a SECOND CONSOLE full of LEVERS and JOYSTICKS. The engine 
           REVS, more the sound of a Ferrari than an old Postal Van. The 
           tires SMOKE as they find their traction--

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        No shit.

           --and rocket off the sidewalk in pursuit. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - STREET - DAY

           What follows is a full blown car chase through the crowded 
           streets of Manhattan. In the--

           GRUMMAN LLV

           --Sinda WHIPS between cars. 

                                 SINDA
                        Come on you motherfucker...

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re gaining on ‘em! 

           It’s true. The LLV is only two cars back when--

           --TWO BLACK SEDANS SWERVE INTO THE LANE. 

                                 SINDA
                        FUCKING DICK MEN.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who? 

                                 SINDA
                        FBI. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We don’t like them?
                                 SINDA
                        They’re attention sucking gas bags 
                        who never miss the chance to blow 
                        an operation. 

           Sinda REVS and SLINGSHOTS around the nearby sedan while--

           INT. BONNIE’S SUV - SAME TIME

           --Bonnie calmly watches the chaos behind.

                                 BONNIE
                        Interesting. 
                             (to Bumper)
                        Bump, you’re up. 

           Bumper nods. The MOON ROOF opens. He STANDS and--

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - STREET - SAME TIME

           --fires a MACHINE GUN at their pursuers. In the--

           LLV

           --Sinda SWERVES to avoid fire even as--

           --the nearby sedan takes a HIT and FALLS BEHIND.

                                 SINDA
                        HA HA!

                                 MICHAEL
                        We really don’t like them.

                                 SINDA
                        Take the firing lever!

           Michael looks at the dashboard, lost.

                                 MICHAEL
                        The what?

                                 SINDA
                        The joystick! 

           Sure enough, Michael grabs a joystick. Sinda FLOORS it, fast, 
           as she ZIG ZAGS through traffic to avoid Bumper’s fire. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Now might not be a great time to 
                        mention this but--
                                 SINDA
                        If you throw up so help me god I 
                        will leave you on the curb.

           Michael GULPS as the SWAYING of the van INCREASES.

           ANGLE ON: THE CROSSHAIRS on Sinda’s dashboard. She continues 
           to weave left, right, left, right, then--

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        FIRE.

           Michael PULLS the lever as outside on the--

           STREET

           --the LLV’s headlights OPEN and TWO CANNONS protrude. They 
           FIRE what appear to be...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are those packing peanuts? 

           FOAM PELLETS STRAFE the nearest SUV, only these aren’t your 
           average packing peanuts. They STICK to the wheel, like 
           chewing gum, where they gradually EXPAND in size, gumming the 
           machinery, GRINDING THE SUV TO A HALT as Sinda--

           --HITS the e-brake, sending the LLV into a DRIFT, ENCIRCLING 
           the SUV, firing more FOAM PELLETS at the doors, the windows--

           --the foamy substance SEALING THE SUV AND ITS OCCUPANTS 
           INSIDE. Without missing a beat, the LLV regains its course 
           and PELTS off after--

           BONNIE’S SUV

                                 BONNIE
                        Very interesting.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Nearly there.

                                 BONNIE
                        Do it.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - STREET - SAME TIME

           Bumper continues his assault on the LLV and remaining sedan 
           as all three vehicles approach--

           THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

           --gunning it down the BIKE PATH, LLV behind sedan behind SUV, 
           forced to drive single file, when--
           --the SUV TRUNK OPENS. Jeremiah dangles TEN GRENADES from his 
           magnetic fingers. He FLUORISHES his hands like a MAGICIAN.

           SLOW MO: The pins RIP free, stuck to his fingertips, as all 
           ten grenades ARC gracefully into the air, falling, falling, 
           below the wheels of the black sedan, when--

                                             B-R-R-ROOOOOM! 

           THEY EXPLODE. In the--

           LLV

           --Sinda SLAMS on the breaks, trapped. She and Michael leap 
           out on foot to--

           THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

           --SPRINTING past the fire... but it’s too late.

           FIVE FIGURES LEAP from the bridge, PLUMMETING toward the 
           water, when they pull PARACHUTES, navigating down onto a 
           SPEEDBOAT, where they pull away, into the distance. Fuck.

           EXT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - LATER

           Michael and Sinda are tended to by a team of paramedics 
           beneath the shadow of the USPS cargo plane. 

           Several VEHICLES enter the hangar, including a MINI VAN and a 
           TOW TRUCK carrying the FOAM SEALED COCCOON of Bonnie’s SUV. 

           Otto emerges from the mini van. 

                                 OTTO
                        Sinda. Absolutely superb work. 

                                 SINDA
                        We would’ve had them if the FBI 
                        hadn’t gotten in the way.

                                 OTTO
                        We might still have them. 

           A team of men HACKSAW their way through the foam encasement. 
           They draw their weapons and OPEN the SUV doors where--

           ANGLE ON: FOUR GOONS surrender with their hands in the air. 

                                 OTTO (CONT'D)
                        Out. Slowly.

           They step from the car one by one, but as they do...
           A BEEPING NOISE grows louder as each goon’s EXOSUIT BEGINS TO 
           MOVE. Otto, Sinda, Michael and the team FALL BACK as the 
           goons SCREAM and--

           --THE EXOSUITS RIP THEM APART. Grisly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        OHHH! NOOO! 

                                 OTTO
                        I wonder if she warns her acolytes 
                        these body mods double as suicide 
                        machines?

           A task force of men comb the vehicle.

                                 AGENT #1
                        We’ve got something!

           He removes a PELICAN CASE, opens it. Inside is a 
           sophisticated MOBILE COMPUTING set up.

                                 OTTO
                        I want this decrypted and 
                        downloaded. Yesterday.

                                 SINDA
                        Where do you want us?

                                 OTTO
                        Get home. With any luck, this is 
                        the break we need. 

           Sinda nods. Michael doesn’t look so sure. 

           INT. USPS CARGO PLANE - NIGHT

           A dark cargo hold. Michael and Sinda shout over the din.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You don’t think it’s strange?!

                                 SINDA
                        What?!

                                 MICHAEL
                        She’s this precision operator, 
                        right?! If we took her by surprise, 
                        threw her off her game, how is it 
                        her escape was planned down to the 
                        second?! 
                                 SINDA
                        Don’t overthink it! You had one 
                        hell of a first day! 

           Michael nods. Sure. 

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Michael and Sinda DROP out of the personnel chute.

           As they stand, APPLAUSE breaks out. The team greets them.

                                 CHEF
                        All hail the conquering heroes!

           Chef WRAPS Sinda and Michael into one big embrace: his arms 
           are that large.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        You two idiots really did it!

                                 SINDA
                        Did we? 

                                 CHEF
                        That computer told us everything we 
                        needed. CEOs, politicians, 
                        corporate lobbyists--she was 
                        hacking the biggest and richest. 
                        Who needs a bomb when you can 
                        detonate the world’s wealth with 
                        the stroke of a key? We froze those 
                        accounts. She can’t touch ‘em now. 

           Michael FROWNS at this information. Edward lurks into view.

                                 EDWARD
                             (”fuck you”)
                        Congratulations.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Bonnie’s still out there.

                                 SINDA
                        About that. Michael, you’ll need to 
                        stay here on base for a while. Just 
                        until we bring her in.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m sleeping here?

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

           Chef hits the lights. They BLINKER on.
                                 CHEF
                        Five stars on Yelp!

           Cold steel, white sheets. Chef waves him in.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Make yourself at home.

           Chef exits, closing the door behind him. Michael takes in his 
           bleak surroundings.

           EXT. OLD FARM - NIGHT

           Bonnie stalk through a CORNFIELD toward an old SILO. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Databases functioning?

                                 BUMPER
                        Checks completed. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I hate these hick towns. 

                                 BONNIE
                        This is the forgotten arm of 
                        America’s long dead proletariat! 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Is that supposed to be noble?

                                 BONNIE
                        Best place to hide in plain sight. 
                        Besides. I’m fond of irony.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        What’s the irony? 

                                 BONNIE
                        You’ve never heard the term server 
                        farm?

           Bonnie throws open the silo’s entry. Inside--

           ANGLE ON: HUNDREDS OF SERVERS RISE INTO THE DARK. 

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

           Sinda knocks, opens the door to Michael’s holding cell. She 
           carries two COFFEES.

                                 SINDA
                        Morning killer--
           But the room is EMPTY. 

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Son of a...

           Sinda hurries through the compound, checking offices and 
           cubicles. Chef appears wheeling a crate of gear. 

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Chef! You seen the kid? 

           Chef nods at a small OFFICE across the compound. 

           ANGLE ON: Michael, poring over a table strewn with notes.

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sinda places Michael’s coffee in the middle of the mess. 

                                 SINDA
                        What’s all this?

           ANGLE ON: Photos and files for Bonnie Jo Boone.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It doesn’t add up.

                                 SINDA
                        What doesn’t?

                                 MICHAEL
                        That mobile rig for starters. If 
                        Bonnie’s as good as we think, how’d 
                        Chef crack it in two hours flat?

                                 SINDA
                        Chef’s good, too.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about the lobby in New York? 
                        Why gate crash? Her other heists 
                        were a diversion, to distract from 
                        the hack. She didn’t need that in 
                        New York. She already had her man 
                        on the inside. 

           Sinda regards Michael, torn between exasperation and pride.

                                 SINDA
                        Well you’re right about one thing.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I am?
                                 SINDA
                        She’s got a man on the inside. 

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

           Michael, Sinda, and Chef sit in the Situation Room. OTTO 
           briefs from a nearby screen.

                                 OTTO
                        Thanks to your work yesterday, we 
                        were able to locate a series of 
                        encrypted communiqués between 
                        Bonnie and an unknown person or 
                        persons. We now believe she was 
                        tipped off to your arrival by an 
                        inside source. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who?

           ON SCREEN: A photo of FBI DIRECTOR RICHARD DICKMAN appears.

                                 CHEF
                        The FBI’s presence in yesterday’s 
                        operation was odd, to say the 
                        least. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We gotta go against the feds?

                                 SINDA
                        Richard’s hosting a fundraiser for 
                        his wife’s charity this evening. 
                        He’ll have a who’s who guest list, 
                        all prepared to wire large sums of 
                        money over his private network. 
                        This would give Bonnie a second 
                        chance at hacking their accounts. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        But what’s his angle...

                                 CHEF
                        Never trust a careerist. All they 
                        want is power. 

                                 OTTO
                        This is uncharted territory. 
                        Officially? We’re a rogue 
                        operation. 

                                 SINDA
                        When’s the next flight out?
                                 OTTO
                        I don’t want you on a public 
                        manifest. Chef has arranged... 
                        alternate modes of transportation.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So how’re we gettin’ there?

           EXT. PRIVATE RUNWAY - NIGHT

           Sinda, Michael, and Chef approach a PRIVATE JET idling on the 
           runway. Michael looks elated.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Now we’re talking.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Michael’s like a kid in a candy shop. He examines the mini 
           bar, the TV screens, the toilet.

                                 MICHAEL
                        They got a bidet in here!

                                 CHEF
                        I wouldn’t touch that.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why? Does it shoot darts at your 
                        sphincter or somethin’?

                                 CHEF
                        Give it a test drive.

           Michael eyes the toilet with misgivings. Chef WINKS at Sinda. 
           He pulls two GARMENT BAGS from a nearby closet.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        I got costumes.

           Michael unzips the bag to reveal a THREE PIECE SUIT. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Look at this. It fits?

                                 CHEF
                        I scanned your BMI, blood pressure, 
                        and body measurements the second 
                        you dropped into headquarters. Of 
                        course it fits.  

           Sinda opens her own garment bag to reveal a BURGUNDY DRESS.
                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        It looks good on the hanger but--
                        and this is gonna blow your mind--
                        it’s actually meant to be worn.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Michael regards his REFLECTION in the mirror. Navy Merino 
           wool, with a houndstooth pattern, matching vest, and french 
           cuff button front shirt, he finally looks the part. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Never owned a suit before.

           Michael likes what he sees. He TURNS to check his profile... 
           But struggles against the cut of his suit. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Sort of stiff... 

                                 SINDA
                        At least you won’t trip over yours.

           Sinda emerges looking stunning in her gown.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wow, Sinda. I mean--

                                 SINDA
                        Yeah, yeah.
                             (to Chef)
                        How about the extras?

           Chef opens a SUITCASE.

                                 CHEF
                        Tie bars and wingtips aren’t really 
                        my bag, but I can’t send you in 
                        with a roll of packing tape, can I? 

           Chef hands Sinda a covert earpiece. He hands Michael two 
           COLLAR POINTS and a HEARING AID.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Audio transmitters.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How come I get the hearing aid?

                                 CHEF
                        Short hair. You want a weave? 
                        ‘Cause I can arrange that.

           Next: a pair of CUFF LINKS and a pair of EARRINGS.
                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Defibrillators. And listen. These 
                        are beta. I can’t stress that 
                        enough. They’re just as likely to 
                        kill you as save you. So y’know. 
                        Exercise caution.

                                 SINDA
                        Weapons?

           Chef gives Sinda them each a RING.

                                 CHEF
                        Rotate counter clockwise and...

           A small NEEDLE ejects. 

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Tranquilizer. Doubles as your GPS.

           Michael slides the ring on his finger. 

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        You two going to be okay? Couple 
                        working stiffs in a black tie gala? 

                                 SINDA
                        Get some rest. We’ll be there soon.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER

           Dim lights. Midair. Chef sleeps in his seat, slumped over. 

           Michael stares out the window, looking dapper. Sinda reads.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You always do this much traveling?

                                 SINDA
                        Hardly. Ninety percent of this job 
                        is exactly as advertised: push 
                        mail, be neighborly.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        You mean, boring.

                                 SINDA
                        Do you know the most important 
                        quality we look for in a postman?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Rigorous attention.
                                 SINDA
                             (surprised)
                        Where’d you hear that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where do you think? 

                                 SINDA
                        Sounds like Diane. That woman could 
                        find a lesson in anything.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Did you know her well? 

                                 SINDA
                        We had what I would call a friendly 
                        rivalry. But as we got older, 
                        she... softened a little. Probably 
                        around the time she had you. 

           Sinda looks at Michael, genuine affection in her eyes.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Look, I’m not saying we were inner 
                        circle or anything, but I knew her 
                        well enough to know -- she loved 
                        two things in this world: you, and 
                        the job. If she could see you now, 
                        she’d fucking burst. 

           Michael nods. Thanks. The overhead P.A. dings. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Prepare for landing.

           Sinda gives Michael a significant look.

                                 SINDA
                        Here we go.

           EXT. RICHARD DICKMAN’S PRIVATE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           CHYRON UP: Charleston, South Carolina. 29412. 

           A new money MANSION off the South Carolina coast.  

           Michael and Sinda exit a BLACK JEEP driven by CHEF. They 
           ascend the front walk surrounded by glamorous BENEFACTORS.  

           INT. RICHARD DICKMAN’S PRIVATE RESIDENCE - PARTY - NIGHT

           Sinda and Michael enter a grand FOYER. Vaulted windows with 
           French doors. Candelabras on the end tables. For Michael, 
           this might as well be a different planet altogether.
                                 MICHAEL
                        If I knew the FBI paid this well...

           INT. JEEP - SAME TIME

           Chef parks the Jeep. He awkwardly CLIMBS OVER the front seat 
           toward a mobile COMPUTING RIG in back.

                                 CHEF 
                        Richard’s a silver spoon. He grew 
                        up milking champagne at the teet.

           INT. RICHARD DICKMAN'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE - PARTY - SAME TIME

           A server carrying a tray of CRAB CAKES swans by. Michael 
           grabs for one. Sinda yanks him back.

                                 SINDA
                        Can we focus? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        They have crab cakes...

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Pocket me a few, will ya?

           Sinda grabs Michael and steers him through the party.

                                 SINDA
                        Interesting.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What?

                                 SINDA
                        That’s the Secretary of 
                        Agriculture...

                                 MICHAEL
                        The Secretary of Agriculture is 
                        interesting? 

                                 SINDA
                        There are only fifteen members of a 
                        presidential cabinet. You have to 
                        ask yourself how many members might 
                        be knowingly involved?   

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 SINDA
                        Just act like you belong.
                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Fat chance with me in your ear. God 
                        I hate these snobby--

                                 SINDA
                             (loud)
                        It’s such a lovely home, don’t you 
                        agree?
                             (quiet)
                        We need to find out where they’re 
                        taking transactions. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You really think Bonnie’s here? 

                                 SINDA
                        I don’t know. It might all fall to--
                             (sudden smile)
                        Richard!

           Richard Dickman walks past, halts.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m sorry, have we met? Terribly 
                        embarassing, but I seem to have 
                        forgotten your name.

                                 SINDA
                        Miriam Wicker. We met at the White 
                        House two, three years back.

                                 RICHARD
                        Miriam, of course. Thank you for 
                        coming.

                                 SINDA
                        Now listen, my bank account’s a 
                        little heavy. I was hoping you 
                        could help me unburden myself. How 
                        would you like our contribution?

                                 RICHARD
                        Well you’re right to business, 
                        aren’t you? I’ll have my assistant 
                        find you when the time is right.

           Richard swans off. Sinda and Michael continue on. 

                                 SINDA
                        He’s hedging.

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        You weren’t exactly subtle.
                                 SINDA
                        I’m out of my element, alright?

           Michael REACHES for another tray of crab cakes but his suit 
           jacket LIMITS his range of motion.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Chef-- 

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Pulling up the floor plans now... 
                        According to what I see, the most 
                        secure room in the building is--

                                 SINDA
                        There.

           ANGLE ON: A BENEFACTOR reentering the party through a rear 
           door. He shakes a CLANDESTINE MAN’S hand. Both move off.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Michael. Keep eyes on that door and 
                        let me know if anyone approaches. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Copy.

           Michael takes his position in a far corner of the room as 
           Sinda cuts across the glamorous crowd and SLIPS into the--

           BACK OFFICE

           She scans the room. She spots a COMPUTING RIG. 

                                 SINDA
                        I might have something.
                             (no response)
                        Chef? Michael? Come in.
                             (nothing)
                        Shit...

           Sinda slides behind the desk, plugs a DEVICE into the CPU.

           ON SCREEN: A message reads DUPLICATING.

           INT. RICHARD DICKMAN'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE - PARTY - SAME TIME

           Michael sips his champagne. He watches the door. All clear. A 
           SERVER passes by carrying a tray of CRAB CAKES. Michael 
           glances at the door. No sign of trouble. He turns to chase 
           the crab cakes. Meanwhile in the--
           BACK OFFICE

           --Sinda waits for the device to finish copying when--

                                 SINDA
                        Hurry up...

           --THE DOOR OPENS and RICHARD ENTERS.

                                 RICHARD
                             (little chuckle)
                        That eager to donate, huh? 

                                 SINDA
                        What can I say. I admire the cause!

                                 RICHARD
                        Well, I admire your interest. I’m 
                        terribly embarrassed to do this 
                        again, but give me your name, one 
                        more time?

                                 SINDA
                        It’s Miriam. Miriam Wicker.

           Richard goes for the shake. She extends her arm when--

           --quick as a flash he GRABS her hand, ROTATES her ring, 
           EJECTING the needle, and STABBING IT into her own shoulder. 
           Sinda barely has time to look stunned before FALLING TO THE 
           FLOOR. Meanwhile in the--

           PARTY

           --Michael returns to his post with a PLATEFUL OF CRAB CAKES. 
           He eyes the door. Still clear. 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (through a mouthful)
                        Err-thing good?  

           No response.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Sinda. Come in. 

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        If the room’s secure, they may be 
                        jamming her signal. I’m not showing 
                        any change in vitals.

           Michael spots RICHARD exiting the room, conferring with a 
           huddle of CLANDESTINE MEN before moving off.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Something’s up. 

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Hold your position.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Something’s definitely up.

           Michael moves into the crowd, heading for the back room.

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Goddammit, hold until we--

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        And you must be Mr. Griffiths?

           Michael TURNS. Richard lurks behind him. Smooth.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Mr. Dickman.

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Oh shit.

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t think we’ve been formally 
                        introduced. Call me Richard.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Anyone ever call you Dick Dick?

           Richard SMILES. He goes for the shake. Michael hesitates. He 
           holds up his PLATE OF CRAB CAKES: full hands. 

                                 RICHARD
                        So what brings you here Mike?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I prefer Michael actually.

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Sinda’s on the move.

           Michael glances SHARPLY at the rear door.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What? 

                                                       CHEF (V.O.)
                          RICHARD
           I said how long have you and 
           Miriam been co-conspirators, 
           as it were--
                                              Rear exit. 
                                              Move. 
                                              Now.
           Michael pushes past Richard. Richard WATCHES INTENTLY as 
           Michael beelines out for the--

           PATIO

           --past a huddle of smokers, into the darkened yard where a 
           GUARD steps into his walking path. 

                                 GUARD
                        Excuse me sir. I have to ask you to 
                        step back inside.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Just taking my evening, uh, 
                        constitutional.

                                 GUARD
                        Sir--

           The guard lays a hand on Michael’s shoulder. Michael SWINGS 
           into action, ELBOWING the guard in the neck. Hard. A melee 
           breaks out, but as the struggle intensifies, Michael finds 
           his suit RESTRICTING. Each blow he lands is HELD BACK in some 
           way by his outfit. Finally--

           --he TOSSES off his suit jacket. Freed at last, he grapples 
           with the Guard and WINS. 

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        She’s approaching the perimeter.

           Michael begins to SPRINT... but he’s held back. Again. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s this suit made of?!

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        Premium wool. Only the best.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How does anybody move in these 
                        things? 

                                 CHEF
                        Very little stretch in good wool.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Bond movies are a goddamn lie...

           Michael PELTS AWKWARDLY across the lawn when a PAIR OF 
           HEADLIGHTS catch him full in the face. An SUV ROARS out of 
           the garage. Michael hurriedly SHUCKS his trousers. Wearing 
           only his boxers and dress shirt he SPRINTS after the SUV as--
                                 GUARD #2
                        OVER THERE!

           --A CADRÉ OF GUARDS spot Michael and MAKE PURSUIT.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need transport!

                                 CHEF (V.O.)
                        On my way. 

           GUNFIRE sounds out from behind as BULLETS WHIZZ by.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where do I go?!

                                 CHEF
                        Left at the road.

           Michael runs like he’s never run in his life. He SCALES the 
           perimeter fence onto the long-- 

           DRIVEWAY

           --where a SECOND ATTACHÉ OF GUARDS approaches from ahead, 
           forcing him into the nighttime--

           WOODS

           --vaulting downed TREES, the sounds of SHOUTING VOICES 
           growing nearer as Michael SCRAMBLES for the--

           ROAD

           --where a black Jeep speeds by and SKIDS to a halt. Chef 
           opens the door. Michael LEAPS inside as--

           --a SWARM OF GUARDS emerges from the tree line, FIRING after 
           the Jeep as Chef kicks the car in gear--

           --and speeds off.

           INT. JEEP - NIGHT

           Chef floors it. Michael catches his breath.

                                 CHEF
                        That was an expensive suit.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where is she?

                                 CHEF
                        Two miles ahead. We’re closing.
           Michael eyes the TRACKER. Sure enough, they’re getting close.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hurry.

                                 CHEF
                        I’m doing ninety-five.

           The Jeep TEARS through the nighttime roads, swiftly closing 
           in on Sinda’s GPS locator...

           ...PASSING IT. Chef hits the breaks. That’s weird. He kicks 
           it in reverse. Their signals are now OVERLAPPING. Chef and 
           Michael emerge from the car where, on the road, SINDA’S GOLD 
           RING LAYS DISCARDED ON THE ASPHALT. 

           INT. JEEP - LATER

           Michael places Sinda’s ring next to his own.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We have to raise Otto.

                                 CHEF
                        If they’re monitoring his phone, 
                        his computer--

                                 MICHAEL
                        How can we reach him? 

           Off Chef: Well...

           EXT. RURAL SUBDIVISION - DAY

           CHYRON UP: Dover, Delware. 19902.

           Chef’s Jeep pulls down a cul-de-sac surrounded by farmland to 
           arrive outside--

           OTTO’S HOUSE

           Large, but falling into disrepair, with tarps over unfinished 
           roofing and--

           CLOSE ON: A broken doorbell. Michael KNOCKS. Finally--

           Otto answers, wearing only his bathrobe. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Delivery, sir.

           Otto’s brow furrows. Michael gestures: follow me.
           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Michael, Chef, and Otto stand in a nighttime meadow. Otto 
           looks deeply troubled.

                                 OTTO
                        And you’re sure Richard made you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh yeah.

                                 OTTO
                        This is a disaster...

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you want us to do?

                                 OTTO
                        Nothing. Do nothing. Get home and 
                        await further instructions.

                                 CHEF
                        But boss--

                                 OTTO
                        This is above you now. I’ve got to 
                        try and clean this up. Go home.

           Otto stalks off. Michael wears his frustration on his face.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           The allures of the private jet have thoroughly worn off. 
           Michael slouches, spinning his RINGS anxiously on his finger.

           INT. GRUMMAN LLV - NIGHT

           Chef drives them back to base. He receives a CALL.

           Replacing his SPEEDOMETER a digital image of EDWARD swims 
           into view. The feed is STATICKY, full of noise.

                                 EDWARD
                        Chef. There’s been--

           The feed GARBLES.

                                 CHEF
                        Edward? Come in Edward.

                                 EDWARD
                        ...an incident. 

           Chef looks at Michael. He FLOORS IT.
           EXT. POST OFFICE - NIGHT

           They smell it before they see it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Smoke.

           ANGLE ON: THE FIERY WRECKAGE OF THE POST OFFICE comes into 
           view. It looks like a BOMB has gone off.

                                 CHEF
                        No no no...

           Chef throws the car in park. He and Michael hop out but are 
           HELD AT BAY by first responders. 

                                 FIRST RESPONDER
                        Sir I have to ask you to--

                                 CHEF
                        Were there casualties? Were there? 

                                 FIRST RESPONDER
                        None identified as yet--

                                 CHEF
                        EDWARD.

           Edward pushes through the CROWD OF LOOKIE LOOS.

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        What happened?

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m fine, thanks. 

                                 CHEF
                        What happened? 

                                 EDWARD
                        I wasn’t here, but from the way 
                        things sound, someone torched it. 
                        Underground and all.

                                 CHEF
                        Is everyone OK?

           Edward nods. Chef and Michael just stand, dumbfounded. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What now?

                                 CHEF
                        We wait for Otto.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Bonnie’s been two steps ahead, this 
                        entire time.

                                 CHEF
                        We don’t know for certain--

           And just then, something strange happens. 

           A SHRILL BEEPING RINGS OUT. MANY LAYERED. 

           For those of us with cell phones, we may recognize this as 
           the dulcet tones of an AMBER ALERT. Only this isn’t an Amber 
           Alert... Michael, Chef, and the crowd of Lookie Loos pull 
           their phones from their pocket, one by one by one, where--

           ON SCREEN: A peculiar notification appears.

                                   BONNIE ALERT!

                            Please swipe up for more info.

           Michael hesitates before SWIPING UP.

           ON SCREEN: A VIDEO OF BONNIE JO BOONE fills the frame. As 
           before, she speaks straight into the camera, as though to 
           Michael, and us, directly. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Greetings fellow citizens. I am 
                        here today to inform you the 
                        revolution has begun, and you are 
                        enlisted. Congratulations! You may 
                        recognize me from news footage 
                        chronicling my bank robbing 
                        exploits. As a result of those 
                        efforts, our most respected 
                        financial institutions have acted 
                        predictably: by taking 
                        extraordinary measures to protect 
                        their own. 

           Michael, Chef, and Edward stare, horrified, at their screens. 
           But this is not a local phenomenon. As Bonnie’s monologue 
           continues, we GO TO--

           EXT. LONDON - SUBWAY - NIGHT

           Travelers on the iconic tube check their phones.
                                 BONNIE (V.O.)
                        We stand at a crossroads. One 
                        percent of the world’s population 
                        holds as much wealth as the 
                        remaining ninety-nine percent 
                        combined.

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO - FAVELA - NIGHT

           An alleyway, kids huddling around a few lit screens.

                                 BONNIE (V.O.)
                        But the people you’ve trusted with 
                        your money, the leaders and 
                        institutions you worship, have left 
                        you staggeringly vulnerable to 
                        attack.

           EXT. BEIJING - HIGH RISE - NIGHT

           We CRANE DOWN past multiple WINDOWS, each family absorbed in 
           their devices.

                                 BONNIE (V.O.)
                        This should come as no surprise. 
                        And so, as of midnight Eastern 
                        Daylight Time tonight, I have 
                        emptied your bank accounts, zeroed 
                        your savings, and frozen your 
                        credit.

           EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

           Every computer in the cafe is filled with Bonnie’s face.

                                 BONNIE (V.O.)
                        If there is to be lasting change in 
                        the world, it must come from the 
                        root and soil and salt of the 
                        earth. Look around and ask 
                         yourselves: Are these your leaders? 
                        Your neighbors? Your friends? 

           EXT. MARRAKECH - MEDINA - NIGHT

           The busy souk is at a STANDSTILL as attentive listeners stare 
           at their cell phones.

                                 BONNIE (V.O.)
                        If you are to earn your way in the 
                        new civilization, it is with the 
                        currency of uprising.

                        I invite you to take up arms--to 
                        slay our oppressors, those who 
                        support them, and those who simply 
                        can’t be bothered. 

           Back outside the--

           POST OFFICE

           --Michael LOOKS UP at Chef, aghast.

                                 BONNIE (V.O.)

                        push, I’ve sent ambassadors of the 
                        movement into your streets. Good 
                        luck, and God bless the revolution. 

           Michael glances at the growing UNREST around them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let’s get out of here. 

           Michael drags Chef and Edward to the LLV. They drive off.

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - MORNING

           Michael, Chef, and Edward watch the NEWS. 

           ON SCREEN: A very anxious news anchor addresses the nation. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        News of the breach has sent local 
                        and federal government into a 
                        tailspin. Meanwhile, in cities 
                        across the globe, militants have 
                        erected executioner squares, where 
                        stockades of local citizens, 
                        detained without due process, await 
                        mob justice.

           ON SCREEN: A reel of SOCIAL MEDIA FOOTAGE. In one clip, a 
           group of young men holding their phones aloft GATE CRASH a 
           suburban home and DRAG the family outside. In another, a 
           fearful man records an EXECUTIONER SQUARE in (where else?) 
           TIMES SQUARE. A group of POLICEMEN close in when INFIGHTING 
           BREAKS OUT between officers, a chaotic firefight as militant 
           police KILL AND DETAIN their colleagues.

           Michael shuts off the television.
                                 MICHAEL
                        How long are we supposed to wait?

                                 CHEF
                        We’ll hear soon.

                                 EDWARD
                        The amount of infrastructure this 
                        must take... 

                                 MICHAEL
                        This was her plan all along--it was 
                        never a bomb. 

                                 CHEF
                        We had her wrong from the start. 
                        She doesn’t want power to the 
                        people. When she says, “Are these 
                        your neighbors,” who do you think 
                        she’s talking to? She’s dog 
                        whistling, and handing out treats 
                        for carnage. It isn’t revolution. 
                        It’s a global coup d’etat. 

           Just then Michael’s PACKAGE CARRIER begins to ring. He grabs 
           it, presses SCAN. OTTO’S HOLOGRAM appears in the room.

                                 OTTO
                        Gentlemen.

                                 CHEF
                        Sir, have you--

                                 MICHAEL
                        Any word on Sinda?

           Otto regards Michael with icy distaste.

                                 OTTO
                        You left your post while a senior 
                        agent was engaged in a high risk, 
                        covert operation. 

           Michael clams up.

                                 OTTO (CONT'D)
                        Worse, we now have reason to 
                        suspect it was Sinda working with 
                        Bonnie all along.

           A stunned silence.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s not possible, sir.
                                 OTTO
                        Maybe not. But Richard’s on the war 
                        path, and she’s the obvious target.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s bullshit--

                                 OTTO
                        She steered every step of this 
                        investigation, which means she’s 
                        steered us straight into Bonnie’s 
                        trap.

           Michael goes to interject. Otto holds up a hand for SILENCE.

                                 OTTO (CONT'D)
                        It’s out of our hands now. The 
                        Joint Chiefs have suspended our 
                        operation while the FBI takes over. 
                        Chef, Edward, go home and wait for 
                        further instruction.

                                 CHEF
                        Yes sir.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about me? 

                                 OTTO
                        I’m sorry, but we’ve decided to go 
                        in a different direction.

           Silence settles on the room. 

                                 OTTO (CONT'D)
                        That’ll be all.

           Click. Otto vanishes. Chef pats Michael on the shoulder. Even 
           Edward looks uncomfortable. 

                                 CHEF
                        Sorry, kid. 

           Michael just nods. Chef and Edward head for the door. 

                                 CHEF (CONT'D)
                        Stay safe. 

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - LATER

           Michael paces, unable to settle. Finally--

           --he grabs his satchel and departs.
           EXT. POST OFFICE - DAY

           Michael finds the crime scene unattended. He slips past a 
           line of CAUTION TAPE and steps into the BURNT HUSK of the 
           post office facilities.

           INT. SUBTERRENEAN USPS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Michael FALLS from the personnel chute, raising an almighty 
           CLOUD OF ASH. He stands, dusts himself off, and regards--

           --THE CHARRED REMAINS OF HEADQUARTERS. Silent. Still. 
           Lampblack ASH FLOATS through the dimly lit atrium. 

           All that remains are smoke-scarred pillars flanking the room 
           and one, lone HOLOGRAM of Benjamin Franklin FLICKERING and 
           SPEAKING SILENTLY into the gloom, like a ghost.

           Michael rummages in his satchel, produces his MOTHER’S LABEL 
           MAKER. This is where it all started. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        This was some slick shit, mom, have 
                        to hand it to you. Almost thought 
                        you were talking to me from, you 
                        know... 
                             (beat)
                        This is stupid.
                             (then)
                        You prob’ly can’t hear this, but I 
                        really tried this time. I thought 
                        for a minute, I could do what you 
                        did. Make you proud. But I screwed 
                        it up. I screwed it all up.  

           Michael snorts at his own foolishness. He sets the label 
           maker into the ash when...

           THE DEVICE COMES TO LIFE. It prints a LABEL.

                           DISTRESS SIGNAL RECOGNIZED.

           ANGLE ON: A beat before a new message appears.

                                    Report home.

           Michael CLIPS the label. The words DISAPPEAR. Then--

           --THE HOLOGRAM BEHIND HIM BEGINS TO SPEAK. Michael turns.
                                 BEN FRANKLIN HOLOGRAM
                             (glitching)
                        Whi-while we MAY NOT- may not- b-b-
                        be able to control all that HAPPENS 
                        TO US, we-e-e-e-e can control what 
                        h-h-happens inside-inside us.

           Michael considers the empty label held in his hands.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (sotto)
                        Report home...

           INT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - BEDROOM - DAY

           Michael unboxes his mother’s things while calling...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Chef. Are you with Edward? I need 
                        to meet, and I need a favor. In her 
                        videos, Bonnie uses the phrase, the 
                        sons and daughters of millworkers. 
                        I need deep background on her 
                        childhood. Can you get that? 

           Michael gears up with a roll of PACKING TAPE, his mother’s 
           WINDBREAKER, a collection of vintage STAMPS, and more.  

           INT. DODGE NEON - DAY

           Michael turns the ignition in his car... nothing. Tries 
           again. The car won’t start. He HITS the dash. Shit.

           EXT. RONNIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Michael KNOCKS. Almost immediately the door FLIES open. 
           Ronnie appears brandishing a BASEBALL BAT. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Goddamn Michael! That’s the second 
                        time I almost killed your ass. You 
                        can’t just go knocking on doors in 
                        the apocalypse! You seen the news?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need your help.

                                 RONNIE
                        You feel safe with me. I get it. We 
                        can bunker in the basement--

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m looking for a ride, actually. 
           INT. RONNIE’S JEEP - DAY

           Ronnie drives through the streets. He WHITE KNUCKLES IT even 
           at 25mph. He turns a corner and finds a roving group of 
           AGITATORS DRAGGING a man and woman out of the house. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Stop the car.

                                 RONNIE
                        For that shit? No way. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Pull over.

           Ronnie GROANS and reluctantly SWERVES to the curb.

           EXT. SUBURBAN DETROIT - CONTINUOUS

           Michael’s out of the car and onto the lawn in no time. We 
           recognize NEIGHBOR PHIL detained next to his wife and son.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alright there Shira? Phil?

           The agitators freeze. Michael doesn’t break stride. 

                                 SHIRA
                        Michael... What’re you--

                                 MICHAEL
                        Just delivering the mail!
                             (to Lead Agitator)
                        I need you to sign for a package.

                                 LEAD AGITATOR
                        Who. Me?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t worry. I’ve got a pen.

           Michael tosses the Lead Agitator a familiar BALLPOINT PEN 
           with its SECURITY CHAIN still attached. He CATCHES it and--

           --THE CHAIN WHIPS AROUND HIS WRISTS AND ARMS, BINDING THEM. 

           Before the others know what’s hit them, well, Michael’s hit 
           them. Ronnie watches from the car, mouth hanging open.

           The agitators quickly disband in retreat. Michael frees Phil, 
           Shira, and Chuck.

                                 PHIL
                        How did you--
                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t have time. Grab whoever you 
                        trust and hunker down. Your house, 
                        theirs, doesn’t matter. Look after 
                        one another.

           They nod assent. Michael turns to go.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                             (to Chuck)
                        And hey, easy on the pills, yeah?

           Chuck watches, agog, as Michael makes for the car.

           INT. RONNIE’S JEEP - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael buckles his seatbelt. Ronnie just stares.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Go!

                                 RONNIE
                        I knew you were on some Illuminati 
                        type shit! Iknewit Iknewit Iknewit.

           Ronnie pulls away. 

           EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY

           Ronnie pulls into a sprawling SCRAPYARD. CHEF and EDWARD 
           greet them out front.

                                 CHEF
                        Who’s this?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ronnie, this is Chef, that’s 
                        Edward. We used to work together.

                                 CHEF
                        What’re you doing here Michael?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Chef, does any of this feel right 
                        to you? Sitting on the bench?

                                 CHEF
                        I know Otto ripped you a new one--

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s not about that. It’s... 
                             (gathering his thoughts)
                        It’s our job to keep people 
                        connected.

                        We hold this country together with

                        world has all these agencies and 
                        authorities, but the people this 
                        hurts most, the linemen and 
                        cashiers and janitors and letter 
                        carriers humping a mail route? 
                        They’ve got us. And we’ve got to 
                        show up for them.

           A profound silence follows this stirring speech. Then...

                                 EDWARD
                        So, do you have a plan? 

           Michael takes a deep, calming breath. Dead eyes Edward.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ve got a start. But, and I never 
                        thought I’d say this, I need your 
                        help.

                                 CHEF
                        What’d you have in mind? 

           SERIES OF SHOTS: THE GANG GETS TO WORK

           What follows is kinetic, fast, full of camera movement.

           --Michael leans over Edward’s laptop.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Did you find her?

                                 EDWARD
                             (”back up”)
                        Well she’s not in my laptop.
                             (Michael steps back)
                        Alright. Bonnie Jo, daughter of 
                        Millford and Anne, both factory 
                        workers. When she was ten, the 
                        factory suffered a small explosion, 
                        killing both parents. Her aunt and 
                        uncle sued for restitution, but 
                        went bankrupt in the legal battle.

           --Michael and the gang pore over a local map.

                                 MICHAEL
                        When do they start executions?

                                 RONNIE
                             (grim)
                        They’ve already started.
                                 CHEF
                        We need to take down that square. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        How many postmen in the workforce?

                                 CHEF
                        About 500,000.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can you raise ‘em? 

                                 RONNIE
                        Awwwww hell yeah. Y’all are riding 
                        out on some Return of the King 
                        shit. Last Stand of the 300. I’m 
                        here for it.

           Off Chef: Yeah... 

           --Back with Edward on his laptop. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can you find the factory?

                                 EDWARD
                        One sec... Got it. Gary Indiana. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You said she’d need infrastructure. 
                        Can we trace the power going to 
                        that building? 

                                 EDWARD
                        I can’t see the usage, but it says 
                        utilities are billed to some 
                        company... Theta Make Elect? What 
                        kind of name is that?

                                 RONNIE
                        It’s an anagram.
                             (off their surprise)
                        What? I like word puzzles.

                                 CHEF
                        Anagram for what?

                                 RONNIE
                        “Let them eat cake.”

                                 EDWARD
                        God. Really?

           --Back with the gang and their map.
                                 MICHAEL
                        We split up. I’m going after 
                        Bonnie. Chef, I need you to keep 
                        this city together, long as you 
                        can. Ronnie, go home and--

                                 RONNIE
                        Fuck that! I’m with Chef.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah?

                                 RONNIE
                        I’ve lived here all my life. I’m 
                        not letting it go to the dogs.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, I’m going to need someone 
                        good with computers... 

           Michael and Edward regard one another. 

                                 CHEF
                        Jesus Christ you two--

                                 EDWARD
                        Alright, alright. 

                                 CHEF
                        Shake it out.

           Michael extends for the shake. Edward TAKES IT. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - NON-DESCRIPT ROOM - DAY

           Find SINDA ZIP TIED to a chair, unconscious. She STIRS, and 
           as she does, a gentle HAND extends her a glass of water with 
           a STRAW. She sips, hungrily. When she opens her eyes--

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Those tranqs are dehydrating.

           Sinda looks up to find OTTO LEANING OVER HER.

                                 SINDA
                        Hey, Otto.

           Otto pulls up a chair.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        So. You and Bonnie, huh?

                                 OTTO
                        Seems that way.
                                 SINDA
                        You wanna tell me why?

                                 OTTO
                        You’ve been with the agency for 
                        years. All that time, we’ve been 
                        overlooked, defunded, disrespected. 
                        Aren’t you tired of it?

                                 SINDA
                        Whatever Bonnie’s promised, you’re 
                        an idiot to believe her.

                                 OTTO
                        As far as I’m concerned, this was 
                        always a win-win. If you had 
                        managed to bring Bonnie down, we’d 
                        have scored a major victory for the 
                        organization. If not, I’ve secured 
                        us a place in the new world order.

                                 SINDA
                        Spoken like a true bureaucrat. 

                                 OTTO
                        But you, you made things difficult. 
                        You weren’t supposed to know Bonnie 
                        had someone inside. I had to work 
                        quick, to throw suspicion off of me 
                        and onto Richard. That wasn’t hard 
                        at first, but I knew it wouldn’t 
                        stick. I needed someone else.

                                 SINDA
                        You gave me up.

                                 OTTO
                        I’m sorry to say you’re under 
                        arrest for treason. Richard has 
                        kindly allowed me to handle your 
                        interrogation. You know, in house. 

           Sinda takes in her surroundings. 

                                 SINDA
                        This doesn’t look like a cell.

                                 OTTO
                        It’s a safe house. Secure. Remote.

                                 SINDA
                        What happens now?
                                 OTTO
                        Oh I think you know. 

           A bead of SWEAT drips down Sinda’s face. She glances at the 
           nearby GLASS OF WATER.

                                 OTTO (CONT'D)
                        It’s tragic, really. Poison pills: 
                        what a cliché. 

                                 SINDA
                        Is it fast at least?

                                 OTTO
                        No.

           Otto opens the door to exit.

                                 OTTO (CONT'D)
                        You were a model employee. I’m 
                        sorry it ends this way.

           He exits. Sinda considers her predicament. 

                                 SINDA
                             (sotto)
                        Goddamn right I’m tired.

           She begins to STRUGGLE against her bonds. 

           INT. RONNIE’S JEEP - SAME TIME

           Michael TEARS down the highway through RURAL INDIANA. Edward 
           has his laptop open in the passenger seat.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How much farther?

                                 EDWARD
                        Left ahead.

           Michael turns down a SERVICE ROAD before arriving outside a 
           RURAL FACTORY. It looks, for all the world, like an abandoned 
           shit hole. Michael parks. All is QUIET. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You ready for this?

                                 EDWARD
                        Hell no. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Me neither.
           Edward opens the door. Michael stops him. He POINTS.

           Behind the fence: no less than FIVE ROTTWEILERS roam free.

           EXT. RURAL FACTORY - DAY

           Michael and Edward carefully CUT A HOLE in the fence. They 
           CREEP SILENTLY past the dogs, toward the factory. They’re 
           nearly there when EDWARD TRIPS and FALLS into a PILE OF 
           REBAR, raising an almighty RUCKUS. 

           The dogs GUN IT right for them. Michael and Edward just 
           manage to make it inside and shut the door. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Okay, that was my bad. 

           Michael takes a deep breath. They continue on.

           EXT. DETROIT - HART PLAZA - DAY

           The camera DESCENDS from overhead on a makeshift 
           EXECUTIONER’S DAIS in the very center of Detroit. 

           BOUND MEN AND WOMEN watch with fear as a large GOON leads a 
           man to the center of the square where JEREMIAH presides over 
           the scene. As with all of Bonnie’s army, the goons here sport 
           various BODY MODIFICATIONS, only now they appear FAR MORE 
           SOPHISTICATED: FULL BLOWN EXOSUITS made of steel and 
           hydraulics, retrofitted with weaponry*.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Colin Carson, as a traitor to the 
                        revolution, I sentence you to 
                        death. 

           The large goon raises a gun when--

                                 JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
                        Hold on.

           Jeremiah cocks an ear to the air. 

                                 JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
                        You hear that?

           The camera PULLS BACK, soaring up, away from the scene, 
           TURNING, to skim over--

           --A FUCKING ARMY OF POSTAL WORKERS FLOWING DOWN THE STREET. 
           200 strong, at least. They wear their USPS blues. They wheel 
           PUSHCARTS and carry PACKAGES. Find SHIRLEY at the vanguard.
                                 JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
                        Excellent.

           He NODS to the nearby goons. They move into FORMATION. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - NON-DESCRIPT ROOM - SAME TIME

           Sinda’s doused in sweat now, still lashed to the chair.

           With great effort, she ROCKS forward onto her feet and LEAPS 
           BACKWARDS. The chair BREAKS. 

           Massive, awkwardly sized CHUNKS OF FURNITURE remain tied to 
           her wrists and ankles, but she doesn’t have time to remove 
           them. She FUMBLES with her EARRINGS--

           --REMOVING them, STICKING the miniature defibrillators to her 
           chest. Deep breath.

                                 SINDA
                        Come on come on come on.

           She SQUEEZES the earring’s LATCH BACK in her fingers and--

           --FALLS BACK AS THOUGH KICKED. She hits the ground. Out. 

           A long beat until SHE COMES-TO. Gasping. Jittery as hell. 

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Fuck you Chef. 

           INT. RURAL FACTORY - SAME TIME

           Dark. Dank. Derelict. Old machinery hulks through the gloom. 
           Michael carries Sinda’s DUCT TAPED SWORD in its sheath.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You sure this is the right place?

                                 EDWARD
                        Look.

           ANGLE ON: A scuffed walking path in the grimy floor, leading 
           straight to A GIANT FURNACE. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT'D)
                        You don’t think...

           They tug at the furnace. It barely budges. They put their 
           weight into it. It slides open to reveal a hidden stairwell. 
           Edward begins his descent when--
           --THE FACTORY’S MACHINES WHIRR TO LIFE. Assembly lines CHURN 
           into motion. Stamping machines SLAM like giant steel fists. 
           Michael SPINS... not a moment too soon. Because behind him--

           --BUMPER LURCHES OUT OF THE GLOOM. He FIRES a GUN, narrowly 
           MISSING Michael, who ducks for cover. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Go!

           Edward pelts down the stairs as Michael DRAWS his sword and 
           SWINGS IT... right into Bumper’s exosuit. Bumper KNOCKS the 
           sword from Michael’s grip, takes aim, FIRES. 

           Michael takes FIVE SHOTS to the chest. He REELS BACK and 
           drops to his knees in pain... but we see his windbreaker is 
           BULLET PROOF. Bumper sees, too. He FIRES again--

           --but he’s out of bullets. Michael considers his good luck.

                                 BUMPER
                        You’re a real pain in the ass. 
                             (then)
                        Just like your mother.

           Michael gets to his feet. Bumper tosses away his gun.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re goddamned right. 

           Bumper and Michael COLLIDE. What follows plays out like the 
           world’s most brutal BOXING MATCH. 

           Bumper SWINGS. Michael DUCKS, STOMPS on Bumper’s ankle. 
           ELBOWS him in the balls. Bumper grunts, staggering back. 

           Meanwhile in Bonnie’s-- 

           VILLAIN'S LAIR

           --Edward reaches the bottom of the steps. He takes in the 
           VAST EXPANSE OF SERVERS before beelining for a COMPUTING 
           CONSOLE. He can just make out the sounds of STRUGGLE 
           upstairs.

                                 EDWARD
                        Alright, Bonnie. Let’s see how good 
                        you really are.

           Edward gets to work on the computers. In his focus, he 
           doesn’t make out--
           --BONNIE’S REFLECTION APPROACHING BEHIND HIM. He notices a 
           moment too late. Bonnie GARROTES him with a LINK CHAIN. He 
           FALLS from his chair. Bonnie TWISTS.

                                 BONNIE
                        It isn’t your fault. The state 
                        always sacrifices their children 
                        first. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - NON-DESCRIPT ROOM - SAME TIME

           Meanwhile, Sinda undergoes a transformation. She RIPS her 
           satin gown down the middle, tucking each half into the ZIP 
           TIES still around her ankles, creating a makeshift jumpsuit. 

           She stands back, runs FULL TILT toward the door, THROWS her 
           weight against it, and BURSTS into the--

           HALLWAY

           --where she finds TIANA STANDING GUARD OUTSIDE. 

           Behind her Otto monitors a LIVE FEED of the anarchy playing 
           out across the world. He SPINS at the noise. Seeing Sinda, he 
           MAKES A BREAK FOR IT.  

                                 SINDA
                        Tiana, thank god. Otto’s betrayed 
                        the service. We need to--

           Sinda moves to continue on. Tiana BLOCKS her path.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        You didn’t swallow that horse shit 
                        about me being treasonous, did you? 

                                 TIANA
                        I don’t know what to think.

                                 SINDA
                        There’s really no time for this. 

                                 TIANA
                        Sinda--

           Sinda SWEEPS Tiana’s feet from underneath her. Not missing a 
           beat, Tiana SWIVELS, like a breakdancer, BACK onto her feet. 
           What follows plays out like a martial arts scene, brutal but 
           choreographed. They exchange BLOWS, each woman well and truly 
           BLOODIED by the other when Sinda finally FLIPS Tiana, 
           BREAKING her leg.

           Tiana clutches the wound in pain. Sinda kneels, TEARS Tiana’s 
           pant leg and TIES a tourniquet. 
                                 SINDA
                        Keep pressure on.

           Tiana considers her thoughtfully.

                                 TIANA
                        Go. 

           Sinda nods. Thank you. She takes off in pursuit. And as she 
           does, she passes Otto’s computer, where--

           ON SCREEN: The live feed continues to play, as we GO TO--

           EXT. PARIS - THE LOUVRE - DAY

           A MOB SMASHES the windows of the iconic museum.

           EXT. SAMOA - ISLAND RESORT - DAY

           A messy STRUGGLE spreads out across the sand. 

           Red waves of BLOOD stretch into the water, from shore.

           EXT. TOKYO - SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT

           An executioner’s scaffold atop a TALL BUILDING where a 
           BUSINESSMAN is THROWN over the edge. We come back in on--

           EXT. DETROIT - HART PLAZA - SAME TIME

           --as the postal army approaches executioner’s square. 

           Jeremiah stands surrounded by a MOB of his own. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        The enemies of revolution have 
                        offered themselves up! Those who 
                        stand behind the movement will be 
                        handsomely rewarded. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s you! 

           The MOB MOVES FORWARD to meet the POSTAL WORKERS, both masses 
           surging toward one another, closer and closer, until--

                                 RONNIE (O.S.)
                        LET’S GOOOOO.

           A SQUADRON OF GRUMMAN LLVS AND VINTAGE POSTAL VANS COMES 
           TEARING DOWN THE ROAD, flying past the foot soldiers on both 
           flanks. Inside-- 

           --CHEF and RONNIE lead the charge. 
                                 CHEF
                        Fire!

           Ronnie presses a BUTTON on his steering wheel. Two small 
           MUZZLES emerge from the grate of his Jeep. They FIRE a 
           familiar FOAMY SUBSTANCE at the mob, STICKING THEM IN PLACE. 

                                 RONNIE
                        THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME.

           Same time: the postal foot soldiers FORM RANKS. Their 
           pushcarts SPEW FIRE, forcing the remaining mob farther back. 
           Jeremiah reacts quick. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Shoot the tires!

           The GOONS fire on the Grumman LLVs. They’re not a good shot. 
           Jeremiah STALKS forward. When he’s still several feet from 
           the nearest goon--

           --he HOLDS OUT HIS HAND and MAGNETICALLY RIPS THE GUN from 
           his comrade’s grip. He takes aim, FIRES--

           --AND HITS HIS TARGET. Ronnie CAREENS to a halt. 

                                 JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
                        Kill them.

           Ronnie takes a knee, draws his gun, and OPENS FIRE. Chef 
           WHEELS his vehicle around, SCATTERING more goons.

                                 JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
                        If you want a job done right...

           Jeremiah removes his jacket to reveal a VEST ABSOLUTELY FULL 
           OF DAGGERS. Twenty, at least. 

           He SPRINTS down the sidewalk, FLANKING Ronnie when--

           --he LURCHES forward. Using his magnetic fingertips he PULLS 
           the clip from Ronnie’s gun. In one fluid movement he drags a 
           hand across his vest, MAGNETIZES a KNIFE from its sheath--

           --TWIRLS it like a GLOBE TROTTER--

           --and PLUNGES it into Ronnie’s thigh.  

           If we didn’t know already, Jeremiah’s formidable.

           Grabbing Ronnie’s gun, he pivots and SHOOTS Chef’s tires out. 
           Chef’s Grumman LLV rolls to a stop. The door opens. He steps 
           from the vehicle. Wreathed in smoke and exhaust fumes, we 
           really clock his size for the first time.

           All around, the battle devolves into chaos. Postal workers 
           DRAW SWORDS and engage GOONS in MELEE COMBAT. Other postal 
           workers TOSS PACKAGES that EXPLODE behind enemy lines. And as 
           the fracas plays out...

           CHEF STALKS TOWARD JEREMIAH. 

           INT. RURAL FACTORY - SAME TIME

           Bumper THROWS Michael into the STAMPING MACHINE. He only 
           barely ROLLS CLEAR as the massive anvil comes down.

           Michael scrabbles at his pockets, pulling out a roll of 
           PACKING TAPE, and as Bumper advances... 

           Michael SPINS, evading Bumper’s wild swings as he WRAPS the 
           large goon in packing tape, legs, arms, neck, before 
           BACKPEDALING away, out of reach--

                                 BUMPER
                        You can’t be serious.

           --Bumper RIPPING free of his bonds--

           --Michael AIMING the tape dispenser, like a remote--

           --Bumper ADVANCING again when...

                                                                      ...CLICK. 

           THE PACKING TAPE EXPLODES. 

           So, too, does Bumper. 

           Down in Bonnie’s--

           VILLAIN’S LAIR

           --the EXPLOSION overhead draws Bonnie’s attention. Edward 
           seizes the moment. He KICKS the nearby desk chair beneath him 
           into Bonnie’s knees. She loses her balance...

           ...and her grip. Edward lurches forward, gasping. 

                                 BONNIE
                        Well struck. 

           Edward draws his gun. Bonnie KNOCKS it clear. She’s fast. 
                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        No guns. You understand.
                             (gesturing to her servers)
                        Fragile cargo. 

           Edward grabs a nearby length of PIPE.

                                 EDWARD
                        C’mon then. 

                                 BONNIE
                        A moment. There’s ritual to 
                        observe.

           Bonnie very calmly paces toward a nearby COAT RACK. She 
           removes her signature trench coat, and as she does...

           WE SEE A STATE-OF-THE-ART EXOSUIT ATTACHED TO HER BODY.

           Unlike the industrial gear of her goon army, Bonnie’s suit is 
           slim, chrome, sleek. Her scars are neatly stitched and 
           healed. She unfolds TWO LONG BLADES from her forearms. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Now then.

           Bonnie’s closes the gap in no time at all--

           --SLICES Edward’s pipe in two--

           --WHEELS around for the killing blow--

           --WHEN MICHAEL PARRIES THE STRIKE WITH HIS SWORD. 

           Edward scrambles clear.

                                 EDWARD
                        Fuck this field agent shit.

                                 BONNIE
                        Michael. I thought our paths might 
                        cross again. 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (to Edward)
                        The computers! 

           Edward hurries off. Michael squares up for the duel.

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Sinda sprints through the open front door onto the lawn. 
           Pauses. All is QUIET. Sinda holds absolutely still, attentive 
           to any sign of movement. Then--
           --A MINI-VAN GOES TEARING PAST HER DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.

           Sinda CHASES after it, fast as she can, lurching to close the 
           gap as the van SLIDES into a hairpin turn at the--

           ROAD

           --where Sinda GRABS the van’s door handle. The AUTOMATIC 
           DOORS SLIDE OPEN. She LEAPS inside--

           OTTO’S VAN

           --but before she can gain her footing--

           --Otto JACK KNIFES the vehicle, nearly PITCHING Sinda through 
           the open doors. She holds tight, climbs her way into the 
           front. Otto continues to SWERVE as they STRUGGLE for control 
           of the car. Thinking fast--

           --Sinda RECLINES Otto’s seat ALL THE WAY BACK. He struggles 
           to sit upright as she HITS him and HITS him again. Then--

           --Sinda PULLS THE PARKING BREAK--

           --GRABS THE WHEEL and SPINS the car 180 degrees--

           --managing to FASTEN HER OWN SEAT BELT as--

           --THE VAN FLIES INTO A TREE, TRUNK FIRST. The momentum YANKS 
           Otto’s body from his lay flat seat--

           --as he FLIES into the backseat with a CRUNCH.

           Everything goes still. Sinda catches her breath. 

                                 SINDA
                        Otto? You alive back there? 

           Behind her, Otto GROANS.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Good. 

           Sinda gingerly exits the vehicle. 

           EXT. DETROIT - HART PLAZA - SAME TIME

           Chef and Jeremiah circle one another. 

           Chef FEINTS. Jeremiah SKITTERS back, HURLING A KNIFE at 
           Chef’s foot. It bounces harmlessly off Chef’s boot.

                                 CHEF
                        Steel toes.
                                 JEREMIAH
                        Oh yeah?

           Jeremiah KICKS OFF HIS SHOES. 

                                 CHEF
                        Suit yourself.

           Chef pulls a BALLPOINT PEN from his pocket. He CLICKS it 
           ominously in his fist. Something about the way he does this 
           is inexplicably, unpredictably, bad ass. 

           Jeremiah turns and SPRINTS in the other direction. Chef MAKES 
           CHASE, lumbering after him. Jeremiah reaches the nearby FLAG 
           POLE. He JUMPS--

           --CLIMBS spider-like up its BASE before KICKING OFF--

           --ARCING over Chef, HURLING knives down to STRIKE CHEF IN THE 
           SHOULDER. Nearby-- 

           --Ronnie HIDES beneath a car where he WATCHES Chef pull the 
           knife from his body. Ronnie cradles his injured leg, takes a 
           deep breath, and STAGGERS OUT back into the fray. Meanwhile--

           --Jeremiah SPRINTS toward Chef. This time, Chef’s ready.

           He KNEELS. He CLICKS his pen. A STREAM OF NOXIOUS GAS FIRES 
           from the cartridge INTO JEREMIAH’S FACE. Jeremiah WRETCHES. 

           Chef closes in. They’re hand-to-hand now. Chef’s hits are 
           thunderous, but Jeremiah maintains his speed. 

           Chef STRIKES him in the jaw.

           Jeremiah STABS HIM in the arm.

           Chef SOCKS him in the ribs.

           Jeremiah SLICES him across the chest.

           And as Chef winds up for the crushing blow...

           JEREMIAH THRUSTS A KNIFE UP AND INTO CHEF’S JAW. 

           A LONG BEAT. Chef staggers back. He seems to CHUCKLE, huh, as 
           though surprised, as though this can’t possibly be happening, 
           and as Jeremiah watches on, gratified by his work--

           CHEF FALLS TO THE GROUND. Still. At that exact moment--

           --A POSTAL VAN comes CAREENING across the plaza, bare wheels 
           SPARKING on concrete, where it CRASHES into Jeremiah...
           ...who once again uses those fucking magnets to keep from 
           falling beneath the vehicle, climbing onto the hood where--

           ANGLE ON: RONNIE IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT. He pulls a GUN and 
           FIRES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. Jeremiah goes down--

           --dead before he even falls beneath the tires. The vehicle 
           rolls to a stop.

                                 RONNIE
                        I’m not gonna be right after this. 

           IN THE BATTLE: The postal workers close in on victory.

           INT. RURAL FACTORY - VILLAIN’S LAIR - SAME TIME

           Michael and Bonnie CLASH SWORDS. Michael’s no match for 
           Bonnie, so he uses his wits, DODGING and DUCKING.

           SAME TIME: Edward frantically punches keys on Bonnie’s 
           computing console. 

           Michael TALKS to distract her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You don’t have to die here.

                        I don’t intend to. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Was that why you chose this place? 
                        Your parents?  

                                 BONNIE
                             (surprised)
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know I’d like to kill you for 
                        what you did to my mother.

                                 BONNIE
                        Your mother was a sympathizer who 
                        wasted her life working for the 
                        republic. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        She worked for the people.

                                 BONNIE
                        The people are the problem.
                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re a real populist.

           SAME TIME: Edward BYPASSES Bonnie’s security. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Now we’re cookin’ with gas!

           Bonnie HEARS. She GLANCES back, and as she does--

           --MICHAEL darts forward. He SLICES her forearm open. 

           Bonnie considers the BLOOD dripping down her hand.

                                 BONNIE
                        Thank you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        For what?

                                 BONNIE
                        I’ve shed blood for the cause. 

           She PULLS a nearby LEVER and THE COMPUTER SERVERS BEGIN TO 
           PULSE FORWARD on CONVEYOR BELTS toward a FURNACE.

                                 EDWARD
                        DON’T LET THEM BURN! If they burn 
                        it’s irreversible! 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (eyeing the flames)
                        I hate fire.

           Bonnie and Michael CLASH BLADES once more. Michael STRUGGLES 
           against the better swordsman, all while awkwardly KICKING 
           servers from their conveyor belt--

           --straying dangerously close to the FURNACE--

           --working to keep his footing against the moving OBSTACLES. 

           He TRIPS. Bonnie BEARS DOWN.

                                 EDWARD
                        I DID IT!

           She turns, a momentary lapse. With her back turned, Michael 
           THRUSTS his sword through her FOOT, LODGING her to the 
           conveyor belt.

           Bonnie HOWLS. Michael rolls free as Bonnie is drawn 
           inexorably toward the furnace. She TUGS at the sword...
           BUT ITS DUCT TAPED HANDLE RIPS FREE, leaving nothing to grip, 
           nothing to tug on. 

           Seeing this, Michael sprints for the LEVER. 

           A calmness comes over Bonnie. She faces the furnace and--

                                 BONNIE
                             (singing, sotto)
                        I dreamed a dream...

           --TIPS INTO THE FLAMES. 

           Michael throws the lever. The belts roll to a halt. He stares 
           at the furnace’s open mouth. A long beat. Edward walks up.

                                 EDWARD
                        She died a martyr, and if you think 
                        that isn’t what she wanted, you’re 
                        kidding yourself. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You really did it? 

                                 EDWARD
                        God, no. It’ll take hours to unfuck 
                        this mess. But you needed the 
                        diversion.

           Michael considers Edward in a new light. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thanks.

           EXT. RICHARD DICKMAN'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE - SAME TIME

           Richard drives his black MERCEDES toward a glamorous front 
           GATE. The gate OPENS. Richard nods to a cadré of ARMED GUARDS 
           outside a security kiosk and continues on when--

           --OTTO’S MINI VAN LURCHES into view and SLAMS to a halt, 
           blocking his path. The guards DRAW THEIR WEAPONS. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Otto?

                                 ARMED GUARD #1
                        Exit the vehicle and declare 
                        yourself!

           A beat. The door opens. SINDA EXITS. The guards take AIM. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Hold!
           Richard opens the driver side door, steps out.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Sinda. Or should I call you Miriam?

                                 SINDA
                        Hey, Dick. I’d like to make that 
                        charitable contribution after all.

           Moving slowly, Sinda DRAGS OTTO from the vehicle. Richard 
           watches, the wheels beginning to turn, and we GO TO--

           PNEUMATIC TUBES

           --as another LETTER addressed to Michael zooms its way 
           through the depths of the USPS--

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...after forty-eight hours of 
                        chaos, the carnage was contained 
                        when United States intelligence 
                        officials successfully located and 
                        reversed the hack...

                        somber new moment in our history...

           --before arriving in a small receptacle at--

           INT. UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           CHYRON UP: Washington D.C. 20260.

           Bureaucrats and USPS employees bustle past a windowed--

           BOARD ROOM

           Sitting around the table, find Michael, Sinda, Edward, Tiana, 
           and Ronnie. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Place needs a facelift...

                                 MICHAEL
                        You don’t know the half of it.

           The door OPENS. In walks RICHARD and COLONEL PETERSON holding 
           an ENVELOPE.

                                 PETERSON
                        Thank you all for coming. 

           Peterson and Richard take their seats.
                                 PETERSON (CONT'D)
                        I’d like to say a few words, before 
                        we get down to business. 
                             (beat)
                        I wanted to acknowledge here, in 
                        this room, the monumental 
                        contribution each of you have made 
                        to the safety of this nation and 
                        its people. It occurs to me a great 
                        deal in this country has been 
                        broken--and not just in the last 
                        few weeks. It will require the 
                        continued heroism of everyday 
                        Americans, like you, to see us 
                        through.
                             (to Ronnie)
                        I understand you aren’t a member of 
                        the service. You bear the 
                        responsibility of keeping what you 
                        know a secret. More importantly, 
                        it’s my hope you’ll continue to 
                        support our agents in the field. 
                        It’s going to take more than our 
                        modest numbers to set things right.
                             (to the others)
                        As you already know, Otto has been 
                        removed as Postmaster General and 
                        remanded into custody. We’ve asked 
                        Richard here to... fill in, for the 
                        time being. 

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s an honor.  

                                 PETERSON
                        Now: the main event.

           Peterson UNSEALS the envelope.

                                 PETERSON (CONT'D)
                        Michael Griffiths. I have here your 
                        certification as a sworn member of 
                        the USPS. It is with great pleasure 
                        I award you the Stamp of Approval. 

           Peterson STAMPS the paperwork. APPROVED. 

           MOMENTS LATER 

           The gang filters out of the boardroom when--

                                 RICHARD
                        Sinda. A moment? 
           Sinda hangs back. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        I wanted to thank you. And 
                        apologize. If it weren’t for you, 
                        Otto--

                                 SINDA
                        --would still be too stupid to get 
                        away clean. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m going to need to rely on you, 
                        going forward. I can handle the 
                        politics, but I’ll be honest: I 
                        don’t know the first thing about 
                        delivering mail. 

                                 SINDA
                        After the FBI, I wouldn’t worry. 
                        It’s only slightly more complex.

           Richard betrays a little smile: Sinda’s brash. He likes that.

                                 RICHARD
                        I was actually hoping you’d come on 
                        board as deputy.

           Sinda looks momentarily taken aback. She considers this.

                                 SINDA
                        Thanks, but I’m a field agent. 

           Richard nods. Okay then. He goes for the shake.

                                 SINDA (CONT'D)
                        Last time we shook hands didn’t 
                        turn out so hot for me.

                                 RICHARD
                        Here’s to a clean start. 

           They SHAKE. 

           EXT. PRIVATE RUNWAY - PRIVATE JET - DAY

           The gang deplanes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Nice of Richard to let us keep the 
                        jet.

                                 RONNIE
                        Did anyone else try that bidet?
                                 SINDA
                        Nice my ass. He owes us. 

                                 BRITISH VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’s going to be insufferable 
                        working for him, you know that.

           ANGLE ON: CHEF SITS IN A WHEELCHAIR on the tarmac. He has a 
           BANDAGED NECK and an electronic VOICE BOX taped to it.

                                 SINDA
                        Chef! Thank god. 

           She embraces him. Michael merely looks amused.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What happened to your voice?

                                 CHEF
                        Now I sound like a proper British 
                        asshole.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Very posh. 

           EXT. GRIFFITHS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           Michael hosts a COOKOUT. Ronnie, Chef, Sinda, Edward, and 
           Tiana gather around a back patio table. Beers all around. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Now you can really send a message 
                        to tyranny.

                                 CHEF
                        I can’t wait to see you deliver 
                        justice for the people.

                                 SINDA
                        You really are the total package. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        So dad jokes are part of the job.

           They laugh. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Hey. You conscripted me into a life 
                        of secrecy. This is the price

           Michael grabs the empty bottles and heads in for the--
           KITCHEN

           He drops the empties in the sink. He pauses.

           ANGLE ON: A familiar framed PHOTO of a younger Michael and 
           Diane. He lingers on the image.

                                 RONNIE (O.S.)
                        It’s a nice photo. 

           Michael turns. Ronnie stands in the door.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You believe in, y’know, after?

                                 RONNIE
                        This is the same woman who kept a 
                        spy cam in your high school 
                        bedroom. If anyone’s watching down 
                        on you, it’s Diane. 

           Michael snorts. Too true. 

                                 RONNIE (CONT'D)
                        C’mon back outside.
