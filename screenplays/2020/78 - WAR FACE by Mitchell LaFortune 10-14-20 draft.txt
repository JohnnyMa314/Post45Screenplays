                                  October 14, 2020.
                                                                     ii.
                                                                     ii.

          For thousands of years, foreign armies have attempted to conquer 
          Afghanistan. From Alexander the Great, Ghengis Khan, Indian and 
          British Empires, to the Soviet Union and United States.

          To this day not one has been able to rule the northern mountains 
          of the Hindu Kush, where Pashtun culture collides with Pagan 
          idols, forming the land of the non-believers. 

          Running through the heart of it is the valley of death, the 
          Korengal. Generation upon generation of Soldier has called it "The 
          most dangerous place on earth." In 2010, the U.S. Army and its 
          allies abandoned all but one OutPost.

          It is here where the supernatural still reigns supreme, lording 
          over its graveyard of fallen empires... 
           FADE IN:

           Pure inky black. Like a night that’s never met the moon. 

           As a simple gas lantern catches, its flames reveal a set of 
           working hands, craggy and worn with age. They thread a needle 
           through severed, burned skin.

           FROM ABOVE:

           We follow a brittle piece of lumber. Three rusted nails. Two 
           boards of rotting wood hammered together. Plank on plank on 
           plank, creating a framework for the resting of a head.

           Two long timbers make the sides. A smaller one for the 
           bottom. We pull back slowly to reveal a COFFIN. Then a 
           second, and a third, all lying next to each other. Each, 
           unusually small.

           INT. PREPARATION ROOM - FROM ABOVE

           In the main room of a traditional Afghan house, the bodies of 
           THREE HUMANOID CREATURES lie blackened by fire. They look 
           like children- save for their orbital deformities and narrow, 
           stick-shaped limbs. 

           Two ELDERS take turns cleaning them gently, covering their 
           slender frames with white shrouds. 

           EXT. ROAD - FROM ABOVE - DUSK

           An orange glow washes over a funeral procession of 
           NURISTANIS. Men with red beards and dirty white shawls. Women 
           dressed traditionally in blue burqas. 

           Each with their hands raised skyward to help carry the 
           coffins down a narrow road. We HEAR screams, sobs, chants. 
           Unchecked pain and anger.

           EXT. BURIAL GROUND - FROM ABOVE - DUSK

           The caskets are lowered into the ground. Scoops of dirt THUD 
           and CRACK against the wood. 

           -- WE PULL BACK FURTHER REVEALING --

           Hundreds of markers line a riverside. A new grave, freshly 
           filled with volcanic rocks instead of soil, catches our eye. 
           It’s at least 20 feet long.
           INT. B-HUT - NIGHT

           A makeshift hooch for soldiers partitioned by plywood for a 
           sense of privacy. We float over one wall- down past PHOTOS of 
           friends and family. A golden retriever. Bachelorette party. 
           Bubbly smiles. Handwritten letters. A child’s drawing. 

           The photos pulse and flutter with the THUD of an impact in 
           the far distance. One picture shakes loose, falling like a 
           feather to the floor. It lands next to a pair of combat 
           boots. A hand reaches out and takes it.

           CLOSE UP: A beautiful couple on top of a mountain. Happy and 
           in love. A young daughter between them.

           -- A RUMBLE LIKE THUNDER --

           AMELIA YATES, 40s, the same woman from the photo but world-
           weary now, studies the image. There’s sadness in her eyes. 
           Longing. Maybe even guilt. 

           A LOUD THUMP. The WHISTLE of a rocket as it soars high 
           above...

           She turns away from the photo and stares up at the ceiling. 
           Her eyes trace a white wire that runs to a single light bulb.

           The earth GROWLS. The ceiling SHAKES. Someone else stirs in 
           the sleeping quarters.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        That was a close one.

           Amelia rolls out of bed, wearing nothing but a Yale 
           sweatshirt and a pair of boxers. She lets out a yawn and ties 
           her hair into a ponytail.

           She drops to the floor and stretches. Downward dog. Cobra 
           pose. Amelia cracks her neck and transitions into a push-up 
           routine. Fast. Strong.

           In between each rep, we get a sense of her room. An M4 
           Carbine rifle lies on a stack of ACUs, the gray-green 
           camouflage of the U.S. Army.

           Below her bed, a collection of pirated DVDs and several books 
           on the history of Afghanistan. An iPod. Noise-canceling 
           headphones.

           The light turns on. Someone lets out a groan.

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
                        Mary. It’s just a fuckin’ rocket 
                        attack. Turn off the lights.
                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        They’re going to make the 
                        announcement. 

           Another VIBRATION, followed by a smashing, sickening IMPACT. 

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER #1
                        Mary, turn off the lights. I swear 
                        to God. 

           A stack of M4 magazines scatter. One round pops loose and 
           rolls beneath Amelia. She scoops it up with one hand, 
           finishing the push-up with the other.

                                 LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.)
                             (Monotone, pre-recorded)
                        The base is under attack. I repeat, 
                        the base is under attack. Take 
                        shelter. Take shelter. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Told you. It’s raining lead.

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
                        Don’t even start. I need a dip. 
                        Who’s got a can? 

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        What kind of girl smokes and dips?

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
                        This bitch.

           LAUGHTER breaks out as Amelia dawns the ACU bottoms. She 
           removes the Yale sweatshirt and replaces it with a black bra, 
           tan shirt, and an ACU cover. The rank of MAJOR. She unbundles 
           a pair of green socks. Laces up her boots. 

           Amelia’s cell phone RINGS.

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        This is Major Yates.

           She looks at her watch.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be there in five.

           Amelia pulls her interceptor body armor over her head, 
           ratcheting down the velcro. She loads her magazine pouches, 
           slaps one in her rifle. Checks the selector switch: Weapon on 
           safe. She dawns her brain bucket, cat eyes, and rank 
           reflected back at us. 
           Finally, she places a custom combat KNIFE in the heel of her 
           left boot. 

           Commotion as she opens the door. Five FEMALE SOLDIERS, all 
           dressed in varying degrees of readiness, armed with rifles 
           and wearing their helmets, walk forward. One yawns. 

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER #2
                        Damn, Major Yates, you goin’ to win 
                        this war by yourself?

                                 AMELIA
                        Official recall.

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER #2
                        You know, you’re not supposed to be 
                        walking out there alone. Not after 
                        what happened.

                                 AMELIA
                        Good thing I’ve got my rifle.

           EXT. B-HUT - NIGHT

           A distant rumble followed by a close THUMP puts a spring in 
           everyone’s step. 

           Amelia walks past a bomb shelter filled with SOLDIERS wearing 
           mismatched uniforms and personal items of clothing. Joking 
           about. Trying to stay warm. Smoking cigarettes.

                                 LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.)
                        The base is under attack. I repeat, 
                        the base is under attack. Take 
                        shelter. Take shelter.

           EXT. BAGRAM AIRFIELD - NIGHT

           Tracer rounds snap and streak through the sky like horizontal 
           lightning as Amelia walks down the side of a dirt road.

           Somewhere a siren wails. Attack helicopters roar up and over 
           the perimeter, hunting an unseen enemy beyond the wire.

           Amelia passes Bagram’s PX, a large retail store that’s 
           essentially a Walmart for the deployed... There’s even a 
           Dairy Queen, the “DQ” lit up in neon light. Followed by a 
           knock-off version of Starbucks. A little taste of America. 
           But the harder they try, the further it away it feels...
           INT. AIR HANGER - NIGHT

           Sitting beneath the colossal frame of a Soviet air hanger, a 
           small compound of conex boxes cut up and welded together to 
           form offices.

           Amelia enters the hanger, crossing the cavernous hall to an 
           office door with a complicated cipher and dial lock. A 
           thunderous ECHO in the rafters far above rattles her nerves. 

           It takes her three times to get the code right. RUMBLE. 
           Finally, she pulls open the heavy door.

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Three unoccupied desks. The only light spilling from a CID 
           badge (Criminal Investigation Division) screen saver. 

           Small wooden crosses stand unused, meant for holding a 
           weapon, IBA and helmet. Amelia places her gear onto the 
           cross, creating a mini-soldier, and sits down behind a desk. 

           She removes her CID badge and sidearm, a black M9 Beretta. 
           She checks the chamber.

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Why are you sitting in the dark?

           SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JACKSON, 30s, snaps on the overhead 
           lights. Amelia shields her eyes; the fluorescents harshly 
           illuminate the cramped office. Walls covered in details from 
           investigations. Pictures of CRIME SCENES.

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s the only way I can get off. 

           Jackson just smiles and shakes his head-

                                 JACKSON
                        I’ve known you for too long.

                                 AMELIA
                        Way too long. 

                                 JACKSON
                        Colonel Williams wants to see you.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Why?

                                 JACKSON
                        He’s sending you to the Korengal. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Korengal. COP Halloran. Isn’t that 
                        an all-male unit?

           INT. XO’S OFFICE  - NIGHT

           A chilly office in another Soviet-era building. This one’s 
           painted in docile green. A picture of Ahmad Shah Massoud 
           hangs next to a dusty framed photo of the former Afghan king, 
           Mohammad Zahir Shah. 

           Amelia sits on a folding chair. Army propaganda on the wall 
           behind her. Pamphlets about reenlisting while being deployed 
           for large bonuses. STDs. Alcoholism. Suicide prevention 
           training. 

           Somewhere a clock ticks. 

           COLONEL CAMPBELL, 50s, comes in signaling for Amelia to stay 
           seated. Campbell’s soft around the edges. Head shaved. Deep 
           circles trap his eyes. You get the sense he hasn’t slept much 
           on this deployment. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Major Yates. Sorry to disturb you 
                        so late. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I was up. The rocket attack-

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Rocket attack? I didn’t even hear 
                        it.

                                 AMELIA
                        You might need some R&R, Sir.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No, I just need to retire.

           Campbell sits, then takes a minute, sizing up Amelia.

                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        An interpreter’s gone missing up at 
                        COP Halloran. You know anything 
                        about the Korengal? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah, they say it’s the most 
                        dangerous place on earth. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It is.
           Campbell points to the MAP behind his desk: We see northern 
           Afghanistan’s topography. Endless mountain ranges, 
           impenetrable forests. 

                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        Halloran is our last remaining 
                        OutPost in the region. It’s become 
                        too dangerous to even resupply. Our 
                        helos get hit on every trip. We’ve 
                        never been able to control it.

           Colonel Campbell picks a FOLDER up from his desk and hands it 
           to Amelia... 

                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        The unit stationed there faces 
                        complex attacks three times a week. 
                        Mortared every night. Right now, 
                        their unit’s manning is at 50%, 
                        something we haven’t seen since 
                        Vietnam. The Pentagon’s worried COP 
                        Halloran could fall to the enemy. 
                        And now we’ve got this mess- I need 
                        a quick investigation. Just clear 
                        it off the books.

           She opens the file.

           CLOSE UP - DOCUMENTS

           We SEE a picture of the translator, ISMAIL, 20s. Information 
           on the unit. TICs (Troops in Contact) reports, behavioral 
           reprimands. A single, partially REDACTED sheet in black 
           catches her attention. Just the crest of the Central 
           Intelligence Agency, watermarked in the corner.

                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        Wheeler was supposed to fly there 
                        tomorrow. But he had a family 
                        emergency. I was wondering if you 
                        would go instead.

                                 AMELIA
                        A missing translator? Why involve 
                        CID? 

           Campbell points to the document Amelia’s holding.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I’ve seen the classified version. 
                        CIA’s accusing someone at Halloran

                        The term they used was war crime,

                        they won’t release the name.

                        Halloran’s an all-male unit.

           Campbell nods-

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That’s why I wanted Wheeler to do 
                        it. The Army will look the other 
                        way on this one. They just want it 
                        buried. No more bad news plastered

                        I’m in.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Good. Thank you. 

           Amelia stands and salutes.

                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        Major, one more thing. Remember, 
                        those men have been up there for 15 
                        months. Under constant threat, day 
                        and night. Most of them haven’t 
                        been home to see their wives, 
                        girlfriends, children. It might be 
                        hard to separate the fact from 
                        fiction. Keep your head down.

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes, Sir.

           EXT. DISNEY DRIVE - NIGHT

           The long, straight road of Bagram Airfield. Amelia walks in 
           the dark, distant impacts rumbling. The SCREECH of a fighter 
           jet as it accelerates down the tarmac... 
           The noise claws at our ears, growing LOUDER and LOUDER before 
           disappearing completely.  

           She lights a cigarette, illuminating her breath in the chilly 
           air. Her boots echo off the rocks as she passes Bagram’s old 
           prison, the BTIF, infamous for its legacy of enhanced 
           interrogation.

           A MILITARY POLICE (MP) GUARD from the tower CAT CALLS in her 
           direction, then salutes when he notices her rank... She gives 
           him the finger without breaking stride.

           INT. BAGRAM DINING FACILITY - NIGHT

           The DFAC’s nearly deserted this late. Hot chow smolders in 
           large metal tubs. Half the lights are out. Drab.

           Amelia clears her weapon and scans her ID card. 

           She tries to make a salad out of a variety of leftovers but 
           finds the lettuce rotten. She gives up, settling for a box of 
           Cheerios and almond milk.

           Amelia sits at a table by herself. The manilla folder marked 
           “Halloran” in front of her. 

           In the background, a LOCAL NATIONAL mops the floor, while the 
           TV plays coverage of Barack Obama giving a speech that places 
           the date of events on November 8th, 2010. (NOTE: This EXACT 
           timeline is important for the ending.) The quality sucks, 
           static lines snapping back and forth. 

           She’s about to open the file when ELI REEVES, 40s, sporting a 
           dark beard and holstered Sig Sauer, sits down across from 
           her. He bites into a red delicious. 

                                 ELI
                        Major Yates. 

           In the dim lights of the DFAC, Eli’s a handsome man. But he 
           wears the shit-eating grin of someone from the beltway.

                                 AMELIA
                        Eli. CIA slumming at an Army DFAC? 
                        What, did you run out of caviar? 

           Eli raises a finger and whispers-

                                 ELI
                        Careful. No one’s supposed to know 
                        about the caviar.

           Another crunch of the apple.
                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        How long has it been? Three months? 
                        Helmand? I miss seeing you 
                        around... 

           He smiles. 

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        I meant to ask if you ever solved 
                        that case. Burning of the Korans. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Sent three soldiers home.  

                                 ELI
                        Three? Never made sense to me. War 
                        crimes. What do you expect some 18-
                        year-old to do? Best friend gets 
                        killed by a roadside bomb. Who 
                        cares if he desecrated a book or 
                        two-

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t need the ethics lesson, 
                        Eli. I’m too tired. And I head out 
                        to the Korengal first thing.

                                 ELI
                        Korengal? Really?

           Eli glances at the folder on the table... Amelia slides it 
           out of his reach.

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        Heavy shit up there.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’ve been outside the wire. 

                                 ELI
                        There’s outside the wire, Yates... 
                        And then there’s outside the wire. 
                        You know what I mean? 

                                 AMELIA
                        No. I don’t. 

                                 ELI
                        Is this about the translator?

                                 AMELIA
                        How do you know? (A beat) Can you 
                        tell me why it’s classified?
                                 ELI
                        Major, you might be in over your 
                        head.

                        If you’re not going to help-

           Amelia rises with her tray. Eli grabs her-

                                 ELI
                        From one friend to another. Be 
                        careful out there. And in here. 
                        That poor contractor from KBR. 
                        Raped and strangled to death in a 
                        bomb shelter. You’d think a base as 
                        big as Bagram would be safe. All 
                        that wire keeping the wolves out. 
                        Or maybe, it’s keeping them in...

                                 AMELIA
                        Goodnight, Eli.

                        Goodnight.

           INT. MWR BUILDING - NIGHT

           SOLDIERS play video games and pool. Some read in the small 
           library made up of paperbacks and used comics.

           We find Amelia in a private phone booth making a morale call. 
           The phone rings and rings. Finally, connects to voicemail.

                                 TRENT (O.S.)
                        Hi, you’ve reached Trent Yates. I 
                        can’t come to the phone right now, 
                        but if you leave a message-

           Amelia opens up a combat pouch on her uniform and removes a 
           wedding band. She rotates it between her fingers-

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Trent, it’s me. I’m going out for a 
                        while. Few days. I’m not sure if 
                        I’ll be able to reach you. I love 
                        you. Just checking in. Hope Leah’s 
                        okay. Let me know how the 
                        appointment with her went. And I’ll 
                        try to call before the first day of 
                        school.  

           Amelia hangs up. Then dials another number.
                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Hey, Dad. It’s me. 

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Amelia. I’m so glad to hear your 
                        voice. How’s it going over there? 
                        You got the Taliban on the run?

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Not exactly. 

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Well. At least it’s not Vietnam. 

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah, yeah. How could I forget? You 
                        had one pair of socks for three 
                        weeks, and you never even got 
                        trench foot.

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        I’m only teasing you. I’m proud. 

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        I know. 

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        How are you, really?

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m tired. And I miss my girl. 

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Leah. She’s fine, she’s fine. Trent 
                        takes such good care of her. And 
                        Mom’s spoiling her rotten.

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Oh yeah? 

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Bought her some robotic dog-

           Amelia laughs-

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Robotic dog? 

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        She can talk her grandmother into 
                        anything.
                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        How’s mom?

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        She’s... 

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Still upset that I’m over here.

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        She loves you, that’s all. Tough 
                        for a mother to think her baby girl 
                        could be at war.

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        I was never going to be a lawyer.

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        She knows that. Deep down. 

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        I wished she had said it. (A beat) 
                        Okay, Dad. I better go.

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Come home safe.

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Bye, dad.

           Click.

           EXT. B-HUT VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Hundreds of B-huts stand organized in rows like a refugee 
           camp for soldiers. Amelia walks between them, face lit by the 
           cherry of her cigarette. The RUMBLE of artillery in the 
           distance.

           Amelia stops. Listening to the gravel CRUNCH behind her. She 
           turns: There’s no one there...

           She continues on, walking through the maze of plywood houses, 
           slipping in between the shadows. Headed for her own when-

           She stops again... The FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE.

                                 AMELIA
                        Who’s there?
           Amelia stubs out the cigarette. Waiting. Listening. She 
           continues on-

           But behind her, the BOOTS grow closer... Moving with more 
           speed-

           Amelia extracts her combat knife, pure instinct taking over-

           SHE SPINS AND BURIES THE KNIFE IN SOMEONE’S THROAT...

           The person stumbles back, collapsing to the ground. Gurgling. 
           Sucking sounds. Hands to the wound... The image becomes 
           clearer as the shape pulls out a cell phone. Light 
           illuminating the face. Eli.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God. Eli.

           Amelia drops to the ground, trying to help him... Dark blood 
           pours over her own hands as she tries to apply pressure.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        I thought- I thought-

                                 ELI
                        Help. Please. Amelia. Help- 

           INT. JACKSON’S B-HUT - LATER - NIGHT

           Frantic KNOCKS on the door.

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        It’s Major Yates.

                                 JACKSON
                        Go away.

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        Jackson, open the door. Now.

           Jackson sighs, throws the covers off his bed and climbs out. 

                                 JACKSON
                        This better be fuckin’-

           He pulls open the door. Eyes wide as he sees Amelia standing 
           there... Her uniform stained in blood. She’s in a state of 
           complete shock.

                                 JACKSON (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck happened?
                                 AMELIA
                        I... was attacked.

                                 JACKSON
                        Attacked? By who?

                                 AMELIA
                        Eli. Eli Graves. I killed him. 
                        Please. Oh, God. Please. Let me in.

           Jackson ushers Amelia to his bed, locking the door behind 
           him. He sits down. Jackson can’t help but stare- She’s a 
           disheveled mess. Blood on her uniform, face, and hair. 
           Cracked fingernails-

                                 JACKSON
                        You should go to the MPs. Right 
                        now. It was only self defense. 

           Amelia nods her head... Tears cascade down her cheeks.

                                 AMELIA
                             (Barely a whisper)
                        But... What if it wasn’t?

                                 JACKSON
                        You said he attacked you.

           Her voice quivers as she tries to explain-

                                 AMELIA
                        I-I heard someone coming. The 
                        contractor... Found in the bunker, 
                        I-I-I couldn’t stop thinking... I 
                        spun... It happened so fast. Fuck, 
                        they’re going to court marshal me! 
                        Throw me out of the Army!

                                 JACKSON
                        Amelia, you’ve got nothing to-

                                 AMELIA
                        They’ll take away my benefits. My 
                        daughter’s healthcare. Oh my God, 
                        Jackson. What am I going to do?!? 
                        What the FUCK DO I DO?!? 

           A beat.

                                 JACKSON
                        Get rid of your clothes. Shower.  
                        Where’s the knife?
           Amelia, trembling, takes it out of her pocket. The blade’s 
           slick and red. 

                                 JACKSON (CONT'D)
                        Get rid of that too. If they don’t 
                        have the weapon, and they don’t 
                        have a witness, they’ll think it 
                        was the same perp from the last 
                        attack. You’re a good person, 
                        Amelia. And a good officer. We can 
                        make this go away.

                                 AMELIA
                        Promise. Please. Promise.

                                 JACKSON
                        Yes. But you need to move- Now-

           INT. SHOWER TRAILER - NIGHT

           An old conex box that’s been converted into a bay of shower 
           stalls. Steam and exposed plumbing... We HEAR moaning. 

           BEHIND A CURTAIN:

           Amelia showers, sobbing... Scrubbing her body hard. Blood 
           rinses off of her hands and swirls down the drain.

           -- MOMENTS LATER --

           Toweled off, she takes her ruined uniform, removes her name 
           tag, rank, and buries the rest at the bottom of a trash can.

           TITLE OVER: 

                                         WAR FACE

           I/E. HELICOPTER - FIRST LIGHT

           Blades spin, thumping, contorting the air. Through the open 
           door of a Black Hawk, we watch Amelia cross the tarmac in 
           full battle rattle. She heaves her overstuffed rucksack onto 
           the helo’s floor and climbs in.

           The helicopter is empty save for the DOOR GUNNER and PILOTS. 
           She places a pair of headphones on, and the engine noise 
           disappears, replaced by an electric-sounding whine.

           Behind her, a large pallet of resupplies. Wooden crates 
           marked by ammunition calibers and explosive types. 
           The Black Hawk shudders back and forth, the vibrations 
           growing with a rush of fuel to the engine. The helicopter 
           moves up and off the ground, rotating for the mountains.

           The Gunner FIRES warning shots from his .249. Leans out the 
           door watching the terrain rush by below. 

           The helo levels off and Amelia settles back into her chair.

           EXT. AFGHANISTAN - DAWN

           The Black Hawk moves north, passing lush green farm fields 
           irrigated by canals. Villages clustered around newly paved 
           roads. Mosques. Intricate blue minarets. Brick factories. 
           Slums. Roving caravans of nomads.

           But the colossal mountains begin to suffocate the plains, 
           forcing farmers and livestock closer to the water... 

           We soar over their jagged mountain tops, passing abandoned 
           OutPosts of war, unclaimed on the peaks like rotting 
           steeples.

           The Black Hawk labors with the altitude. It pitches and haws 
           before swooping down to finally REVEAL:

           A timeless valley full of permanent shadows. The Korengal. An 
           emerald green river slices between the slopes and the trees. 

           A scattering of stone-age houses built on the sides of the 
           mountains look like mushrooms growing from the trunk of tall 
           oaks. 

           INT. HELICOPTER - LATER - DAY

                                 GUNNER (OVER RADIO)
                        Wake up!

           Amelia lurches from a deep sleep. Eyes spring open. Unsure 
           where she is... The Gunner FIRES a three-round burst from his 
           machine gun.

           Through the open door, Amelia watches as the Black Hawk 
           circles the rocky crest of a mountain. We see an impassible 
           pinnacle to the north. Valley to the south. Linking the two, 
           an unfinished road that stops prematurely up the ridge.

           On the very top:

           Mud, brick, and hesco barriers have been lashed together with 
           rebar and concertina wire. 
           This is Combat OutPost (COP) Halloran. Balancing a thousand 
           feet above the valley below. Just an avalanche away from 
           never existing at all. 

           The helicopter swoops down, fighting against the wind shear. 
           Amelia reaches out to stabilize herself. 

                                 GUNNER (OVER RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        We’re not landing. You’re going to 
                        have to climb down and jump out.

           Amelia fumbles with the headset.

                                 AMELIA (OVER RADIO)
                        What?

                                 GUNNER (OVER RADIO)
                        We can’t land here! It’s too hot. 
                        We’re just dropping and picking up. 
                        Supplies first.

           The second Gunner leaves his seat. He pushes the pallet for 
           the door. With two swift kicks, the supplies tumbles out of 
           frame.

                                 GUNNER (CONT'D)
                        Okay. You’re next. Go!

           Amelia unbuckles herself from the seat, struggling to sling 
           her weapon and mount her pack at the same time. The Gunner 
           shakes his head. He grabs her backpack, ripping it from her 
           and throws it out the door-

                                 GUNNER (OVER RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        Ma’am, take your tampon out and get 
                        off my damn bird!

           Amelia buries her pride and climbs forward. Below her:

           Two Soldiers carry a BODY BAG, waiting with their heads 
           lowered to avoid the rotor wash, five feet under the skids.

           Amelia jumps- Landing hard with her rifle. The Gunner watches 
           as she collects her pack. 

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN  - DAY

           The two soldiers push the body up, lifting it to the height 
           of the Black Hawk. The Gunners grapple with the weight of the 
           body... 

           Finally loaded in, the helicopter hovers for a second more 
           before diving for the valley below. 
           For a moment, everything becomes quiet... Until the Black 
           Hawk returns, rotors thumping, steady now, headed off for the 
           horizon.

                                 REED (O.S.)
                        I hope you like it here, Ma’am 
                        because that was the last bus out 
                        for a week.

           Amelia turns to see CAPTAIN REED, 30s, African American. He 
           salutes her. Reed has a kind smile and a shaved head. He 
           skips the mandatory undershirt, letting a gold crucifix hang 
           down on his chest.

           He extends a hand.

                                 REED
                        Nice to meet you, Major Yates. 
                        Welcome to COP Halloran. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           The COP is not much more than a collection of small 
           buildings. Four sagging guard towers mark the corners, giving 
           it a dilapidated, castle-like appearance. Concertina wire 
           runs triple-stacked around the perimeter. A rats’ nest of 
           metal.  

           The mountains completely surround the OutPost, equal parts 
           stunning and claustrophobic.

                                 AMELIA
                        Does the snow last through summer?

                                 REED
                        Only on the highest peaks. Serves 
                        as a reminder.

                                 AMELIA
                        Of what?

                                 REED
                        How bad the winter here can be. 
                        Come on, let’s get you settled.

           Amelia hefts up her pack and follows him, boots squishing in 
           the soft, mid-day mud.
           He points at the Tactical Operations Command (TOC) building.

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        That’s the TOC. Twenty four hour 
                        watch. Seven days a week. Open 365 
                        a year. Radio. Comms. Sat link if 
                        you need it.

                                 AMELIA
                        Do cell phones work up here?

           Reed laughs.

                                 REED
                        Hell no.

           Bundles of multi-colored wire run through plywood walls, 
           spooling over green sandbags. The top of the building is 
           covered by a variety of communication devices. Satellite 
           dishes, VHF frequency extenders. 

           A long, slender pole runs 20 feet up into the air. An 
           American flag, tattered, snaps in the wind.

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        DFAC’s over there. Specialist James 
                        can cook up almost anything if he’s 
                        got somethin’ to work with. Which 
                        usually ain’t much.

           The Dining Facility (DFAC) is a barn-like structure with a 
           skull and bone painting above the doorway. Two Soldiers sit 
           outside, tops off, playing cards. 

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        Me and First Sergeant are in there.

           Reed nods at a sandbag and mud-caked bunker. 

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        Rest of the grunts live over here.

           INT. BARRACKS - DAY

           A dozen or so bunk beds are jammed together, looking like the 
           inside of a submarine. Soldiers have done their best to make 
           it home. The walls covered with lude pin-ups, photos of 
           family. Christmas lights. 

                                 REED
                        We’ve got you in the weapons room.
                                 AMELIA
                        Where is everyone?

                                 REED
                        Scattered to the wind. It’s a down 
                        day.

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - DAY

           Lockers full of different weapon systems line the walls. M9 
           Berettas, shotguns, M4s, RPGs, and claymore mines. An insane 
           amount of firepower for such a small base.  

           PRIVATE FIRST CLASS DUFFY, 25, stands behind a desk cleaning 
           a light machine gun and smoking a cigarette. Duffy’s an ink 
           head, arms covered in tattoos. The infantry crest. His 
           mother’s name. Probably a few ex-girlfriends.

                                 REED
                        Duffy, put that shit out. You know 
                        the rules.

           He turns, not seeming them come in-

                                 DUFFY
                        Shit. Sorry, Sir. 

           He stubs the cigarette out on the desk, leaving a black 
           circle.

                                 REED
                        This is Major Yates. She’s with

                        Ismail.

           Duffy looks up. There’s something off about Duffy. Like he’s 
           high.

                                 DUFFY
                        What’s CID?

           Duffy smiles. Half his teeth have been kicked in.

                                 DUFFY
                        I’ve never met a Special Agent. 
                        Hell, I barely qualified to carry

                        That ain’t combat, ma’am. 

           Duffy brutally strips the .249 down in seconds, demonstrating 
           his proficiency. He’s built like a single piece of muscle. 
           Reptilian, sinewy.  

           Amelia drops her pack on a small green cot set up in the 
           corner.

                        to stir the shit. I was just

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - DAY

           Captain Reed leads Amelia around the perimeter. Towering 
           above them: hesco barriers shoved so full of concrete and 
           dirt that they’ve begun to rupture at the seams.

                                 AMELIA

                        was a replacement. Last CO ate his

                        Mac!

           MASTER SERGEANT KINNEY, 50s, is feeding three IED-sniffing

                        Good boys.

           He finishes with a pat on the head. Kinney’s a former 7th 
           Special Forces Green Beret. His hair, just within regulation. 
           A large gash on his neck from mortar shrapnel. He dusts off 
           his hand and offers it to Amelia.

           Amelia looks down at the Korengal: An oasis of green 
           surrounded by jagged, unending mountains. Rich, black soil. 
           Tall spidery pines. And a cold, clear river running through

           Kinney pulls a dip bottle out of his ACU cargo pouch. 

                                 KINNEY
                        We sit up here. Watch the valley. 
                        Get attacked. Brass tells us to go

           EXT. ISMAIL’S TRAILER - AFTERNOON

           Kinney shuffles up the steps and unlocks the door.

                                 KINNEY
                        Don’t think you’ll find much, 
                        Ma’am. Besides the usual Haji shit.

           INT. ISMAIL'S TRAILER - AFTERNOON

           A small room with a single bed and a prayer rug. Nothing on 
           the walls. No sense of his personality. Kinney tries the 
           lights. They don’t turn on.

                                 KINNEY
                        Huh, must be a short.

           Amelia steps into the dark. She opens a drawer. Moves her 
           hand through his clothes. Then looks under his bed... 

           There’s an unusual SYMBOL carved into the cheap linoleum. She 
           takes a BIC out of her pocket and flicks it. The flame 
           catches, revealing an intricate PATTERN. A house with seven 
           snakes...

           Two narrow boards act as seats. Sandbags stacked around the 
           outside.

                        If it mortars stay in here. No 
                        reason to go anywhere else. Rumor 
                        has it this used to lead to the old 
                        Mujahidden tunnels.

           Mac unclips a FLASHLIGHT from his belt and shines it in... 
           Illuminating the back. Thick concrete.

                        They’re all over the mountains. The 
                        tunnels. But I wouldn’t go into 
                        one.

                                 AMELIA
                        Why?

                                 KINNEY
                        Booby traps leftover from the Cold 
                        War. 

           EXT. PERIMETER - DUSK

           Amelia follows Kinney and Reed through the narrow passage 
           that separates the officers’ quarters from the DFAC. They 
           cross planks over puddles of mud. 

           A series of lookouts have been cut into the side of the COP’s 
           perimeter, allowing the platoon a way to return fire.

                                 KINNEY
                        If there’s an assault on base or 
                        fire from one of the ridgelines, 
                        come here. We’ve got Corporal 
                        Schlaack assigned to watch out for 
                        you. Smart kid. Handles the intel.

           Amelia peers through a slit: 

           There’s a mystical quality to the light as it slowly 
           disappears below. The rays of sun seem separated somehow, 
           like beacons, bouncing off the mountains.  

                                 AMELIA
                        I can handle myself. 

                                 REED
                        We don’t doubt you can, Major 
                        Yates. But things can get a bit 
                        confusing during a firefight.

           Amelia looks out the slit again. No sign of any life. 
           Kinney’s watch beeps.
                                 KINNEY
                        Time to get our chow on.

                                 AMELIA
                        Already? I feel like I just 
                        arrived.

                                 REED
                        Time seems to run faster out here.

                                 AMELIA
                        Usually you hear soldiers 
                        complaining about the opposite. 

                                 REED
                        Daytime that is. The night’s last 
                        forever.

           INT. DFAC - DUSK

           Homey. A large beam splits the ceiling. Three communal 
           tables. A refrigerator for bottled water. Another for 
           Gatorade, near beer and soda.

           SOLDIERS sit scattered, eating dinner. They all stop when 
           they see Amelia enter with Kinney and Reed.   

           SPECIALIST JAMES, 25, kind of soft looking for a kid in the 
           infantry, works behind the counter. He wears Coke-bottle 
           glasses. He scoops steaming pasta and sauce onto Amelia’s 
           plate. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What’s the meat?

                                 JAMES
                        A chef never tells.

                                 AMELIA
                        Do you have any greens?

                                 JAMES
                        We haven’t had lettuce in six 
                        months. We’ve got some apples, 
                        though from the village below. 

           James points to a collection of fruit. The apples are 
           bruised. The fruit, rotting... 

                                 AMELIA
                        Thanks.
           Amelia works her way over to Kinney and Reed, already seated 
           at a table.

           Soldiers glance as Amelia passes. She sets her plate down.

                                 KINNEY
                        This your first deployment, Major? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes. Yours?

                                 KINNEY
                        Fifth. First with a regular unit 
                        since 2003.

                                 REED
                        I’m on my second. Iraq last year.

           From behind, we hear someone say, “I can smell that peach. 
           Fuckin’ ripe, bro.” LAUGHTER breaks out. “Dude, shut up. 
           She’s a Major.” 

           Amelia turns red. Looks down at her food, trying not to 
           engage. But Kinney’s pissed...

                                 KINNEY
                        Who said that? Who the fuck just 
                        said that? Y’all want to be 
                        collecting shells ‘til midnight? 

                                 PRIVATE
                        Come on, Top. She’s the first piece 
                        of ass I’ve seen in a year that 
                        ain’t digital!

           More laughter. CORPORAL SCHLAACK, 28, stands... Walking over 
           to the Private.

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Get up! Get up now! 

                                 PRIVATE
                        What?

           Schlaack violently kicks the soldier’s chair back... Hoisting 
           him by the arms.

                                 SCHLAACK
                        I’m going to smoke the shit out of 
                        you.

           HOOTS and HOLLERS as the unit delights in the drama. Reed 
           bangs his fist down on the table.
                                 REED
                        Alright, listen up! This is Major 
                        Yates from CID. The Major is here 
                        to help us find out what happened 
                        to Ismail. 

           Amelia’s eyes wander around the DFAC, settling in on a table 
           of soldiers. PRIVATE GRADY, 20s, already a freak of nature, 
           stares back. The type of guy who’s attracted to the military 
           for all the wrong reasons.

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        And she out ranks me. So you treat 
                        her with the respect she commands. 
                        Hooah?

                                 SOLDIERS IN UNISON
                             (Cultish)
                        Hooah.

                                 GRADY 
                        Ismail’s dead. 

           The SCRAPING sounds of chairs and plates stop. The DFAC 
           becomes tense and silent.

                                 KINNEY
                        Grady, what-

                                 GRADY
                        I’m only saying what everyone else 
                        is thinking. He’s been gone a week. 
                        No one makes it out there- not on 
                        their own.

                                 KINNEY
                        GI party tonight. Grady, you 
                        fuckin’ lead it. 

           Groans all around.

                        Everyone up! Let’s go! Let’s go! I 
                        want to be eating off the barracks 
                        floor! It better be spotless!

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - NIGHT

           A mishmash of gear, pelican cases, laptops, and rolled maps. 
           There’s a table covered in RADIO EQUIPMENT. 
           IMAGERY products line the walls; black and white photos of 
           target compounds complete with military analysis. Arrows 
           pointing to potential bunker and cache locations.

           Corporal Schlaack stands in front of Reed, Kinney, and 
           Amelia, pointing to a satellite PHOTO of the Afghan-Pakistan 
           border.

                                 SCHLAACK
                        This was taken the day of Ismail’s 
                        last known mission. 

           Schlaack uses a laser pointer. The HEAT BLOOM is pixelated, 
           the shapes undefined. But you can see the outline of a small 
           unit crossing the border into the Tribal Areas.

                                 SCHLAACK (CONT'D)
                        It’s an Omega team. CIA-led Afghan 
                        unit. Allows infiltration into 
                        Pakistan without an executive order 
                        from the President. We lost contact 
                        72 hours later.

                                 AMELIA
                        You lost contact with the unit? 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Correct. 

                                 AMELIA
                        So an entire unit is missing, not 
                        just Ismail?

                                 KINNEY
                        At first we thought it was a comms 
                        issue. Nothing fuckin’ works up 
                        here. Push-to-talk. VHF. Sat 
                        phones. We’ve added extra 
                        repeaters. Raised the tower. Tried 
                        different freaks.

           Amelia spies the table covered in COMMS gear; a radio humming 
           lightly.

                                 REED
                        This valley. I’ve never experienced 
                        anything like it. Friday it took us 
                        three calls to get through to 
                        Bagram Airfield for Close Air 
                        Support.
                                 SCHLAACK
                        The night before they left, CIA 
                        radioed us. Said FSB Ullman was 
                        under attack. Asked for our help.

                                 REED
                        But it wasn’t. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What do you mean?

                                 REED
                        Rico and James were on watch. The 
                        mountain was quiet.

                                 AMELIA
                        Is it possible they couldn’t have 
                        seen it?

                                 KINNEY
                        From those guard towers, you could 
                        see two fireflies fuckin’ a mile 
                        away. Not a chance. And the last 
                        time Ullman got hit- sounded like 
                        the 4th of July. Shit, I almost 
                        broke out the sparklers.

           Kinney throws Reed his dip can. 

                                 REED
                        We rucked over the morning after 
                        and we found the base deserted.

                                 KINNEY
                        Total ghost town.

           Reed points back at the HEAT BLOOM.

                                 REED
                        That’s when Schlaack requested 
                        imagery from Bagram. They just 
                        vanished. Over the border. Left 
                        their weapons, radios. Everything. 

                                 KINNEY
                        Then we lost Morrison. Haven’t been 
                        back since.

                                 AMELIA
                        We have a DUSTWUN situation. They 
                        could be in the hands of the 
                        Taliban. This is not something for 
                        CID alone- I need to call HQ.
                                 REED
                        We already did. Requested air 
                        assets, drone coverage. But Colonel 
                        Campbell said the unit and mission 
                        was classified. That it had to be 
                        handled by CIA. He referred us to 
                        someone- But we haven’t been able 
                        to reach him... Mac, what was his 
                        name again? 

                                 KINNEY
                        I think I’ve got his card around 
                        here somewhere. 

           Kinney shuffles through his wallet. Pulls out a card and 
           holds it out for Amelia. 

           CLOSE UP: Eli Reeves. OGA. GS-15.

           Amelia just stares at the card.

                                 KINNEY (CONT'D)
                        Amelia?

                        What?

                                 KINNEY
                        You’re shaking.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m just-

           After a beat, Kinney takes the card and returns it to his 
           wallet. Amelia snaps out of it-

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        I need to interview the rest of the

                                 REED
                        Of course.

                                 AMELIA
                        And I’ll need to go to Firebase 
                        Ullman. 

           Kinney and Reed share a look.

                        We can’t.

                                 AMELIA
                        Why?

                                 REED
                        It’s too dangerous for someone 
                        without combat experience. We can’t 
                        let you outside the wire.

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - LATER - MONTAGE

           Amelia interviews each of the soldiers on the missing 
           translator. They all look bored, dejected, or interested in 
           something else.   

                                 AMELIA
                        Did you ever witness or participate 
                        in any inhuman or degrading 
                        treatment of your translator, 
                        Ismail Haqqani?

           Soldiers shake their heads. Sign brief written statements.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Have you ever participated in 
                        anything that you think may have 
                        been in violation of the Law of 
                        War? 

           GRADY just leers at her. Eyes drifting down her face towards 
           her blouse. Amelia holds her ground...

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Do you understand the question, 
                        Private Grady?
                                 GRADY
                        They smell like dogs. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Who smells like dogs?

                                 GRADY
                        Wet... Dogs.

                                 AMELIA
                        Did you ever feel that your orders 
                        were unclear or that your chain of 
                        command was dehumanizing towards 
                        Ismail?

                                 GRADY
                        Can I go now? My rifle doesn’t 
                        clean itself. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I need you to write a statement 
                        first. 

           Amelia slides a piece of paper and a pen over to Grady. He 
           writes a single line and signs his name.

           Amelia looks down: Fuck off. 

                                 GRADY
                        We good?

           Grady stands. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Private Grady, earlier this evening 
                        you said that no one could make it 
                        out there on their own. Why?

                                 GRADY
                        Because whatever is out there- 
                        ain’t natural.

           Grady exits the TOC. Amelia watches the door close then 
           sighs... Perplexed by his response.

           She collects the handwritten statements, takes out her 
           laptop, and types up her report.

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - LATER - NIGHT

           Captain Reed comes back in with a knock. He has a cup of 
           coffee for Amelia.
                                 REED
                        How’s it going? The guys 
                        cooperating?

           She takes the coffee. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Mostly. Thanks.

                        Don’t take it personally, Amelia. 
                        Everyone is wired tight. Especially 
                        after Morrison. 

           Reed manipulates one of the radios.  

                                 AMELIA
                        I still need statements from

           Reed looks at his watch.

                                 REED
                        Rico’s on guard. Sure he wouldn’t 
                        mind the company.

                                 AMELIA

                        Still in the kitchen.

                        Major Yates approaching.

           Amelia climbs up the stairs. PFC RICO, 26, Puerto Rican, is 
           behind the .50 CAL. He’s smoking a joint... When he sees her, 
           he flicks it over the edge.

                                 RICO
                        Evening, Ma’am. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Was that pot?

           Rico is a small, compact kid. He looks overmatched for the 
           large weapon he’s handling. He nods.
                                 RICO
                        They don’t test our urine anymore. 
                        Do you care?

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s your career, Rico. Not mine. 

                                 RICO
                        I’m getting out next summer. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Mind if I sit down? The CO said I 
                        could get a statement from you. 

                                 RICO
                        Sure.

           Rico moves his jacket and Night Vision Goggles out of the way 
           so Amelia can sit. She takes out a red filter and snaps it 
           onto her flashlight. Then pulls out her notebook.

                                 AMELIA
                        Quiet night.

                                 RICO
                        So far.

           Amelia looks out and over the sandbags. The valley is 
           completely dark, but even so, we can still make out the 
           shadow of the village...

                                 AMELIA
                        How often do you go down there? 

                                 RICO
                        We used to go every week. For the 
                        loya jirga. That’s when all the 
                        elders would sit around in a circle 
                        and share bread. Tell us how bad we 
                        were doing. But lately, no one 
                        wants to do much of anything. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Why?

                                 RICO
                        They call us double-digit midgets. 
                        Sixty seven days and a wake up. No 
                        one wants to get shot. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I see... Rico, where are you from?

                                 AMELIA
                        Actually, it’s-

           A SCREECHING SOUND AS SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE GUARD TOWER...   
           Amelia GASPS as a BAT SLAMS INTO THE ROOF... Then bounces off 
           the floor... 

           Rico kicks at it until the creature flies free... Silence 
           returning. 

                                 RICO
                        Shit. It was just a bat. You okay?

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m fine. 

           Amelia adjusts her uniform... Breathing out a nervous sigh of 
           relief-

                                 RICO
                        Can I ask you a question? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Sure.

                                 RICO
                        What’s it like- You know- Being a 
                        female in the military?

                                 AMELIA
                        Same as being a male I assume.  

                                 RICO
                        I mean, was your basic training 
                        easier? I heard they give out 
                        stress cards to the females.

                                 AMELIA
                        Private Rico. I went through the 
                        same exact training as you. Shot 
                        the same weapons. Climbed through 
                        the same obstacle courses. Have to 
                        wear the same uniform. Follow the 
                        same rules. And the Officer’s 
                        course is no joke. 
                                 RICO
                        I didn’t mean to be disrespectful. 
                        We just don’t see many. You know, 
                        being infantry and all. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank you, Rico.

           Rico nods and shifts his attention back to the .50 Cal’s 
           sights.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Did you work with Ismail?

                                 RICO
                        Oh yeah. Plenty of times. He gave 
                        me this-

           Rico pulls a small, worn BOOK from his ACU pocket. The 
           writing is in Pashtun.

                                 RICO (CONT'D)
                        Means “Tribes and Customs of 
                        Kafiristan.” I carry it around now, 
                        kind of like a good luck charm. 
                        Ever since I’ve had it- Well. I’m 
                        still here, right? 

           CLOSE UP: Using her red lens, Amelia examines the pages. 
           There are PENTAGRAMS, PRISMS, and other SYMBOLS that look 
           like swastikas. Then, crude hand-drawn STICK FIGURES.

                                 RICO (CONT'D)
                        We’ve come across these in the 
                        village. Even swastikas. I thought 
                        they were Nazis at first. But here 
                        it keeps the evil spirits away.

                                 AMELIA
                        What’s Kafiristan?

                                 RICO
                        Means “Non-believer.” The locals 
                        here rejected Islam for thousands 
                        of years. The rest of the country 
                        thinks they’re kind of backwards.

           Rico puts the book carefully back in his pocket.

                                 AMELIA
                        Rico, did you ever witness any 
                        harassment directed at Ismail? 
                        Maybe from someone in the platoon 
                        who didn’t like him?
                                 RICO
                        Do I need a lawyer? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Do you think you need a lawyer, 
                        Private Rico?

                                 RICO
                        I didn’t see anything.

                                 AMELIA
                        Captain Reed told me you were on 
                        guard duty the night before Ismail 
                        disappeared. 

                                 RICO
                        Yeah, Ullman’s right over there.

           Rico picks up his Night Vision Goggles and passes them to 
           Amelia.

                        Ten O'clock.

           Amelia rises, leaning her body against the sandbags. She 
           looks out-

           P.O.V. - NIGHT VISION

           The ridge is lit up in green. She sweeps down the hill coming 
           across the firebase. No signs of life.

                                 AMELIA
                        He said you didn’t see the attack. 

                                 RICO
                        It’s not that I didn’t see it, 
                        Ma’am. It didn’t happen. We heard 
                        them on the radio. Firing their 
                        weapons. Screaming. Calling us for 
                        help. But I was up here the whole 
                        time. Not a light. And it was 
                        completely quiet when you turned 
                        the radio off. It was like a play.

                                 AMELIA
                        A play?

                                 RICO
                        My grandma told me a story about 
                        how one day she was listening to 
                        the radio. And this news reporter 
                        came on and said there was an alien 
                        invasion. Her whole town panicked.

                        Turned out it was a play. War of 
                        the Worlds. Anyways, it was like 
                        they were performing for us. But 
                        the strangest thing- They were 
                        terrified. It sounded real- Just... 
                        It wasn’t. 

           A beat.

                                 RICO (CONT'D)
                        Things happen up here, Ma’am. 
                        Things we can’t understand. Or 
                        maybe don’t want to.

                        Rico believes in magic.

           Grady comes up the stairs, slamming his gear down. Rico steps 
           back from the .50 CAL removing his helmet.

                                 RICO
                        You’re late.

                                 GRADY
                        So?

           Grady playfully tackles Rico, trying to put him in a 
           chokehold. Rico fights back, but Grady is just too powerful. 
           He taps out.

                                 RICO
                        Fuckin’ punto. 

                                 GRADY
                        What’d I tell you about using those 
                        beaner words around me? You know my 
                        granddaddy scalped your kind for 
                        fun.

           Rico shoves him back.

                                 AMELIA
                        Rico, I’ll need you to sign a 
                        statement. You can drop it off to 
                        me in the morning.

           Amelia walks down the steps-

                                 GRADY (O.S.)
                        You sleep well, Ma’am, ya hear? 
                        Pull that woobie down tight, close 
                        your eyes, and try to block out the 
                        sounds of grown men crying.
           INT. DFAC - NIGHT

           It’s dark as Amelia enters the dining facility. The tables 
           clean. Floor freshly mopped. She follows a single light still 
           on in the kitchen. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Specialist James?

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           An immaculate place. A bottle of bleach and a mop bucket half-
           filled on the floor. Someone’s WHISPERING inside the large 
           walk-in freezer. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Hello?

           Specialist James is facing away from Amelia as she listens, 
           trying to figure out who exactly he’s talking to. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        James?

           INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - NIGHT

           She passes hanging meat. Frozen goods.

                                 AMELIA
                        Specialist James.

           She taps him on the shoulder. 

           FLASH: A slithering BLACK EEL crawls on the back of James’ 
           ACUs. Disappearing down his neck. As if MERGING with his 
           skin.

           James spins- Amelia’s so startled she falls backward, 
           slipping on the floor and crashing to the ground.

                                 JAMES
                        Shit, Ma’am. You okay?

           James pulls his earphones out. Amelia can’t help but stare up 
           at him as if waiting for the eel to reappear.

                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t hear you commin’ in. Let 
                        me help you up.
           INT. DFAC - LATER - NIGHT

           James brings Amelia over a steaming cup of tea.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Thanks.

           She curls her hands around it. On the backside of Amelia’s 
           arms, we see a series of SCARS that run vertically. Slash 
           marks. Long since healed. Maybe a decade or so ago.

           James rolls up his sleeves. The same cut marks. But newer. 

                                 JAMES
                        It’s kind of addicting, right? 
                        Something about the pain...

           Amelia tries to hide hers.

                                 AMELIA
                        Clears your head.

                                 JAMES
                        I started cutting in high school. 
                        Haven’t been able to stop- Guess I 
                        should have picked up smoking 
                        instead.

           A beat. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I need a sworn statement from you 
                        on Ismail.

           James takes off his glasses and wipes them.

                                 JAMES
                        Sure. 

           Amelia opens a manilla folder and slides the form across the 
           table... James looks at it. Pulling out a pen then stops-

                                 AMELIA
                        What is it?

                                 JAMES
                        Major, what if I told you that none 
                        of us has seen a living, breathing 
                        Taliban fighter in 12 months. Would 
                        you believe me? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I thought you were attacked 
                        everyday. 
                                 JAMES
                        We are. 

           A beat.

                                 AMELIA
                        Captain Reed said the enemy doesn’t 
                        get close. Because of the ridge.

                                 JAMES
                        All those patrols? All those guard 
                        duties, and we haven’t seen a 
                        single living soul? There’s 
                        something wrong here. Not just the 
                        war. It’s in the water. In the air. 
                        Something... Sick.

                                 AMELIA
                        Tell me what you think happened to 
                        Ismail.

           James puts his glasses back on.

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t know, ma’am. I’m sorry. I 
                        really don’t.

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - NIGHT

           Pitch black as Amelia shuts the door and places the lock. 

           She turns on her headlamp to illuminate the space: Lockers 
           full of weapons. Duffy’s disassembled .50 CAL on the table in 
           front of her. 

           She sits down on the cot, removing her boots. Smelling her 
           socks. From her rucksack, she pulls out some baby wipes. 
           Cleans her feet, armpits, and face. She removes her blouse. 

           The headlamp catches the scars on her arms... The cuts seem 
           fresher somehow. Almost new. She runs a finger over one of 
           them, tracing an outline...

           Amelia flips open her combat knife. Studying her own 
           reflection. Then she reaches down inside her bag again. 

           This time pulling out a flip phone: Eli’s. She searches 
           through the contacts... Finding Wife. Clicks to call... The 
           line rings... And connects.

                                 ELI’S WIFE (O.S.)
                        Hello?
           Amelia slams the phone shut. Placing it deep within her bag. 
           It VIBRATES... Incoming call.  She reaches back down and 
           removes the battery.

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - NIGHT

           In flip flops, a tan undershirt, and her ACU pants, Amelia 
           makes her way to the porta potties. She opens the plastic 
           green door recently marked “Ladyboy Only.”

           INT. PORTA POTTY - NIGHT

           The headlamp illuminates a fresh coil of shit on the seat. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

           She tries her best to squat and not dry heave at the same 
           time. Through the crack in the door, she watches a group of 
           Soldiers walk to the barracks.

           In the john next to her, someone is PANTING.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Fuck me, bitch. 
                        Fuck me. 

           INT. PREPARATION ROOM - DAY

           Amelia stands over the bodies of the THREE HUMANOID CREATURES 
           from our opening sequence. This time, she’s the one cleaning 
           them. Covering their slender frames with white shrouds. 

           A slender, elongated, almost translucent hand reaches out for 
           hers...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Leave.

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - NIGHT 

           Amelia’s SCREAMING, sitting upright on the cot... But we 
           can’t HEAR her over the sound of a SAW MACHINE GUN CUTTING 
           THROUGH THE AIR.

                                 TOC INTERCOM (VOICE OF DUFFY)
                        Haji approaching the wire! Take 
                        your spots!
           Amelia, dressed only in her black PT shorts and a bra, grabs 
           her helmet, boots, and M4 and runs for the door.

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Both guard towers are FIRING into the dark of night. Soldiers 
           at their positions. Waiting. Looking through the slits in the 
           perimeter.

           Two turn to watch Amelia, helmet on, boots unlaced, no top, 
           just a bra, as she dashes for her spot. Schlaack takes his 
           position beside her. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Sorry, but you’re gonna get shit 
                        for looking like that.

                                 AMELIA
                        I wasn’t thinking. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        At least you made it out here. That 
                        counts for something. 

           Amelia checks her weapon.

                                 AMELIA
                        Where are they? 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        South Guard caught 10 to 12 guys 
                        moving up the ridgeline.

           Schlaack snaps his Night Vision into place. Amelia looks down 
           the line: The rest of the platoon is wearing NVGs. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Fuck, I forgot my NVGs.

                                 SCHLAACK
                        The approach seems deserted. 

           A three-round BURST from an M4. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Cease fire! Cease fire!

           For a moment, the night is still. We hear the clinking of 
           brass under boots.

           Then the MOANING begins. Like a child in agony.
                                 SCHLAACK
                        Jesus.

                                 AMELIA
                        What? What is it?

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Haji’s stuck in the wire. 

           SLOSHING SOUNDS. Guts falling out. Someone pukes down the 
           line.

                                 AMELIA
                        Why can’t they help him?

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Too dangerous. We’ll have to wait 
                        until first light.

           The SCREAMING continues as the SOLDIERS settle into place. 
           Trying to sleep against impossible odds.

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - DAWN

           Schlaack gently nudges Amelia, who startles from a deep 
           sleep. His ACU top covers her. 

           Amelia shakes herself awake. Embarrassed. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        You were talking in your sleep. 
                        Who’s Eli?

           Amelia rips the top off and throws it at him. She runs for 
           the weapons room.

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - DAWN

           Amelia sits on her cot, settling herself. Slowing her 
           breathing. 

           Then, drops off the cot and does a set of push-ups... Moving 
           faster and faster until her muscles give out, and she 
           collapses to the floor in total exhaustion...

           EXT. OUTER PERIMETER - MORNING

           The platoon’s leadership is outside the base, inspecting the 
           concertina wire. Schlaack stands next to Amelia, who’s the 
           only one wearing her FULL BATTLE RATTLE.
                                 KINNEY
                        I’ve never seen a .50 Cal do that. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        It wasn’t a .50 Cal, Top. Duffy 
                        shot him with his M4.

                                 REED
                        Maybe he was wearing an explosive 
                        belt, and the gunfire set it off. 

                                 KINNEY
                        I’ve seen suicide bombers explode 
                        up close. He’d be scattered about 
                        like Reese’s Pieces. No, this looks 
                        like someone dipped him in a vat of 
                        motor oil, lit him on fire, and 
                        threw him into the wire. 

           Our camera reverses to show the TALIBAN FIGHTER caught on the 
           top string. His entrails reach ten feet to the ground. 
           Everything charred. Blackened as if he’d been roasted alive. 

           Amelia can’t stop staring at the fighter... His mouth open 
           and twisted, permanently frozen in agony.

                                 REED
                        We need to bring his body down to 
                        the village.

                                 AMELIA
                        On the way back, can you stop at 
                        FSB Ullman?

                                 REED
                        I guess we could. What do you need?

                                 AMELIA
                        Photograph everything. Collect any 
                        intel, documents, and bring them 
                        back to me.

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - DAY

           Kinney and the platoon are gathered in a circle. The Taliban 
           fighter’s remains in a BODY BAG. Amelia stands behind it. 

                                 KINNEY
                        Alright. Mission is simple. Body 
                        drop at the village. Then we’re 
                        going to knock on the door of 
                        Ullman. James, you’re on point.
                                 JAMES
                        Roger, First Sergeant. 

                                 KINNEY
                        I want to be back up here by 1500 
                        hours. Giants are playing. And 
                        Duffy got satellite to work.

                                 REED
                        You heard the man. Mac’s got a game 
                        to catch.

           Amelia watches as the large black gates slowly open... The 
           platoon moves forward wearily. Radios and packs bobbing up 
           and down. They disappear out of view.

           The gate rolls back, the doors slamming together. A Soldier 
           throws a metal bar down, locking it. 

           I/E. GUARD TOWER - DAY

           Amelia climbs the stairs. Duffy’s on guard, turning away from 
           his line of sight when he hears her.

                                 DUFFY
                        Ma’am.

                        Duffy.

                        Wanna a looksie?

           Duffy extends a pair of BINOS. Amelia takes them-

           P.O.V. - BINOCULARS

           The patrol makes its way down the mountain pass. It’s a tough 
           slog. Steep drops and sharp rocks.

                                 DUFFY (CONT'D)
                        You smoke?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah.

           Duffy pulls out a pack of cigarettes and offers them to 
           Amelia. She nods, taking one. She returns the favor by 
           sharing her lighter. Duffy exhales. 
                                 DUFFY
                        Sorry about the other day. What I 
                        said. Ever since Morrison died, my 
                        brain’s been mush.

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s okay.

           They both enjoy the smoke. Nicotine rush rolling over. Amelia 
           looks down at the valley. Then up at the sun haloing the top 
           of a 15,000-foot peak in the Hindu Kush. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Duffy, anything happen out here 
                        that you can’t explain?

                                 DUFFY
                        Like what?

                                 AMELIA
                        Rico and James both told me 
                        stories.

                                 DUFFY
                             (Thinking)
                        Hmmm. Morrison had a whopper. 

           Duffy flicks his butt off the guard rail. He points at the 
           opposite tower. 

                                 DUFFY (CONT'D)
                        Back in February. We had mid-tour 
                        canceled cause of the weather. 
                        Snowin’ and stormin’ like a bitch. 
                        Early morning. Morrison watched a 
                        British soldier dig a grave. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I didn’t know we had allies up 
                        here.

                                 DUFFY
                        You don’t understand. Morrison 
                        watched a Colonial British Soldier. 
                        You know the kind with a musket and 
                        the stupid hat? He watched him dig 
                        a grave. Twenty feet long. He said 
                        he just watched him work. Frozen. 
                        Couldn’t move. Couldn’t touch his 
                        radio. Looked as real as you or me.

                                 AMELIA
                        And you believed him?
                                 DUFFY
                        Morrison never lied. (A beat) That 
                        was his problem. 

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - LATER - DAY

           Amelia wanders through the empty TOC, inspecting maps and 
           random bits of gear. She sits down at the desk and looks at 
           the radio. CHATTER from the unit as they continue on their 
           mission.

                        Jackson. What happened... The 
                        attack.

           Another beat.

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, Ma’am. I do’t know what- 
                        Oh shit. Speak of the devil and he 
                        shall appear. He’s calling. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Who’s calling?

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        I’ll put him on speaker.

                                 AMELIA
                        What-

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Mr. Graves? 

                                 ELI (O.S.)
                        Yeah? Who is this?
                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Sergeant First Class Jackson. I’ve 
                        got Major Yates on the line for 
                        you. 

                                 ELI (O.S.)
                             (Sounding surprised)
                        Amelia? How’s it going up there in 
                        the Korengal?

           Amelia SLAMS down the phone. Scared shitless. She stumbles 
           out of the TOC-

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - DAY

           And into the light... Crossing the empty base. Duffy calls 
           down from the guard tower-

                                 DUFFY
                        Ma’am! Anyword on return?

           She just looks at him.

                                 DUFFY (CONT'D)
                        Ma’am?

           Duffy’s puts a blunt to his lips, inhaling.

           In the DISTANCE... A RUMBLE... Amelia watches as a LARGE 
           PLUME of SMOKE RISES into the cloudless sky... 

                                 DUFFY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry, Ma’am. That’s us. Just 
                        blowing shit up.

           Amelia walks for the weapons room...

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Amelia SLAMS the door shut... Then, furiously digs through 
           her rucksack, trying to find Eli’s phone...

                                 AMELIA
                        Where is it- Where is it- Come 
                        on...

           Reaching the bottom, she dumps the backpack upside down, 
           emptying its contents... It’s not there.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck is going on?!?
                                 DUFFY (O.S.)
                        Major Yates! Major Yates! Come 
                        quick!

           EXT. MAIN GATE - DAY

           The front gate is wide open. Duffy and a couple of other 
           Soldiers have their rifles pointed out. Amelia approaches.

                                 AMELIA
                        What is it?

                                 DUFFY
                        Female outside the perimeter. Can 
                        you try talking to her?

           Just beyond the two blast doors, a WOMAN stands in a BLUE 
           BURQA...

           OUTSIDE:

           Amelia eases her way forwards... Looking back at Duffy and 
           the other Soldiers, standing there, providing overwatch.

                                 AMELIA
                        Do you need help?

           No response. Just the hood of the intricately designed burqa 
           stares back at her. Amelia takes another step closer. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Can you speak English? 

           A single drop of blood falls off the left hand of the woman 
           to the dirt below...  

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Let me help you.  

           The Woman lifts the burqa revealing a SUICIDE VEST STRAPPED 
           TO HER CHEST... She reaches for the detonator-

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        No!

           BOOOOOOM!!! The body’s EVISCERATED, the head flying off in 
           one direction... Blood soaks Amelia as she-

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - LATER - DAY

           Wakes on her cot... IT WAS JUST A FUCKING DREAM. But before 
           Amelia can even process it-
           POPS and GUNFIRE in the distance... The portable RADIO on the 
           workbench CRACKLES and comes to life.

           Amelia takes the radio and runs out the door...

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - DAY

           The SOUNDS of WAR play over the radio as Amelia enters the 
           building... Bursts of static and gunfire; an EXPLOSION tests 
           the limits of the radio’s speaker.

           The WHINE of a jet as it moves fast through the sky passing

           A beat. Amelia’s hand goes to her mouth... Horrified.

           EXT. MAIN GATE - DUSK

           Duffy swings the metal latch off, and the gate opens...

           Tired, covered in dirt and blood, the unit trudges in. Shell 
           shocked by the day’s events. Grady and Rico carry a black 
           body bag forward. 

           Amelia stands to the side, watching as the soldiers stop and 
           drops their packs.

           Rico throws up... Schlaack pats him on the back. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        It’s okay, Rico. I can take him.

                        No, I want to. I need to.

           Schlaack offers him some of the water from his Camelback. A 
           beat and then-

                                 REED
                        Look, I know it’s tough. But it’s 
                        what we all signed up for.

           Grady, blood on his ACUs, snaps off his helmet and lets it 
           tumble to the ground.

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        James would want you to carry on.

           Grady raises a bloody finger and points it at Amelia.

                                 GRADY
                        It’s her fucking fault.

                        would still be alive!

                        I said enough!

                        and give me twenty. 

           Schlaack and Rico pick up the body bag and head off.

                                 GRADY
                        This is why females shouldn’t mix 
                        with infantry. 

           Grady drops and does 20 push-ups with ease. Finished, he 
           dusts himself off and walks for his rucksack, looking back at 
           Amelia.

                                 GRADY (CONT'D)
                        Ain’t got any blood on you yet.

           Suddenly, he spins... bullrushing for Amelia, arms 
           outstretched, he grabs at her face-

                                 GRADY (CONT'D)
                        Here’s some for you... Here’s some 
                        for you, you fucking cunt!

           Amelia breaks Grady’s hold... Following it up with a 
           ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the chest. Grady tumbles back- 

           Amelia charges at him- CONNECTING with two quick blows to his 
           face, knocking Grady OUT COLD.

           The Soldiers stare at her in silence. Amelia fixes her 
           uniform. Then walks out of frame.

           Using a pocket MIRROR, Amelia brutally scrubs her face, 
           removing the dried blood from Grady.
           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - NIGHT

           The platoon stands in formation under the watchful lights of 
           the north guard tower. Reed and Kinney are out front.

           Rico and Schlaack step forward and fold a flag. 

           A single FLARE is fired, the bright red light illuminating 
           the COP and the valley below, before burning out and 
           disappearing completely.

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - LATER - NIGHT

           Amelia’s sitting at the table across from Corporal Schlaack. 
           Scattered in front of them: Documents and logbooks recovered 
           from FSB Ullman. But most of them are burned... Impossible to 
           read.

                        From the burn barrel. The rest we

                        their SCIF. 

           Of the charred documents, one MAP remains partially intact... 
           With WAYPOINTS that cross into Pakistan.

           Schlaack stands and walks over to a cipher-locked cabinet. He 
           opens it, bringing back a stack of printed SATELLITE IMAGES. 
           He hands them to Amelia... 

                                 AMELIA
                        A target package. 
           We PUSH IN on a blurry image of a traditional Pakistani 
           farmhouse. A PAGAN-LIKE SYMBOL painted on the roof... A room 
           with seven swimming snakes.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        I’ve seen this before...

           The phone CHIRPS. Schlaack picks it up. 

                                 SCHLAACK (INTO PHONE)
                        COP Halloran. One second. Ma’am, 
                        it’s for you.

           He hands her the phone.

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        This is Major Yates.

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Yates, it’s me.

                                 AMELIA
                        Schlaack, will you give me a 
                        moment.

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Sure.

           Schlaack stands and walks out of the TOC.

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Go ahead.

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        I’ve got an update from your 
                        friend.

           A beat.

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                             (Hushed)
                        Eli? 

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        He passed me something. Check your 
                        sipr email.

           Amelia opens up her laptop and connects it to the TOC’s 
           fiberoptic line. After a moment, her CLASSIFIED EMAIL opens. 
           A single message from Jackson.

           CLOSE UP: EMAIL ATTACHMENT
           It’s Sergeant Morrison’s personnel file. She scrolls through 
           it, finding-

           A COUNSELING LETTER.

           “Morrison claimed that several bodies had been found 
           mutilated... “Disemboweled”... Morrison has been counseled 
           for making false accusations related to the treatment of 
           translator Ismail by Private Grady. Recommend reduction in 
           rank.”

                                 JACKSON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Think it’ll help? 

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah... Listen, Jackson. You’d tell 
                        me if I was losing my mind, right? 

           Jackson laughs a little.

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        You were always nuts.

                        Thursday night. Remember after you 
                        told me to see Colonel Campbell. I 
                        came by... 

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Thursday? (A beat) No. You went to 
                        the XO’s, and I worked out. 
                        Couldn’t sleep worth shit, not 
                        after the rocket attack.

           A beat.

                        Do you believe in lucid dreaming?

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        Lucid what?

                                 AMELIA (INTO PHONE)
                        Dreaming. I must have been 
                        dreaming.

                                 JACKSON (O.S.)
                        You sound tired. Get some rest, 
                        Ma’am. 
           INT. DFAC - NIGHT

           Amelia sits by herself, poking at an MRE pouch of cold penne 
           pasta. She takes her combat knife out of her boot and 
           examines the blade: It’s perfectly clean.

           INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - NIGHT

           A black body bag rests on a stainless steel table surrounded 
           by hanging pieces of frozen meat...

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - MORNING

           Early sun. The Platoon stands at the edge of the helicopter 
           landing site.

           The THUMP-THUMP-THUMP of approaching rotors. A Black Hawk 
           soars over, circling the COP and kicking up dust. It settles, 
           wheels touching down on the baked mud.

           The cargo door opens... MAJOR GENERAL STUART, 50s, the 
           Division Commander, exits dressed in his full kit. He’s built 
           like a giraffe. Awkwardly returning a salute to Captain Reed 
           while ducking to avoid the rotors.

           The helicopter’s engine slowly dies as Reed and Kinney greet 
           him.

           Behind them, Duffy and Rico pass the body bag of Specialist 
           James up to the DOOR GUNNER. Somberly, they rejoin the 
           formation.

                                 STUART
                        At ease, men.

           Stuart removes his helmet. The cultish-personality of an Army 
           lifer.

                                 STUART (CONT'D)
                        You’ve done one hell of a job up 
                        here. A hell of a job. Every 
                        morning I personally ask for an 
                        update on Halloran. Hooah!

                                 SOLDIERS IN UNISON
                        Hooah!

                                 STUART
                        I know you lost one of your own 
                        yesterday. And I know how tough 
                        that can be. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 STUART (CONT'D)
                                 STUART (CONT'D)
                        But we make it through. As a 
                        platoon. As a division. We’re 
                        family.  

           General Stuart walks in-between the formation. From his 
           pocket, he pulls out the Unit’s combat patch. He slaps one on 
           the right arm of each soldier. Following it up with a 
           Division challenge coin.

                                 STUART (CONT'D)
                        There’s a lot of tradition with a 
                        combat patch. You men will have 
                        seen more combat than most ever 
                        will in 20 years of service. 

           Stuart stops in front of Amelia. Coldly locking eyes. Then he 
           moves on to the next soldier...

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - LATER - DAY

           The rotors of the Black Hawk spin furiously as Stuart climbs 
           in. Dust cakes the unit as the helicopter takes off, 
           disappearing over the perimeter and into the valley below.

           -- MOMENTS LATER --

           The platoon takes turns punching each other’s new combat 
           patches. There’s a sense of camaraderie. Maybe even a little 
           bit of joy.

           EXT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - DUSK

           The last licks of sunlight settle over the base. Amelia’s 
           boots crunch on the gravel as she approaches the TOC. 

           She knocks on the door and enters.

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - SAME

           Reed and Kinney sit at the table cleaning their rifles. 
           Kinney’s got his top off. His undershirt stained with sweat. 
           Reed spits into his dip bottle. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You wanted to see me? 

                                 REED
                        HQ called about an hour ago. 
                        They’ve closed your case. You’re on 
                        the next bird out. 
                                 AMELIA
                        But I didn’t even file my report. 
                        Does this have to do with General 
                        Stuart?

                                 REED
                        Getting you out of here first thing 
                        makes sense for everybody. You took 
                        your statements. Did your job. Time 
                        to move on.

                                 AMELIA
                        How come you didn’t tell me about 
                        Morrison? 

           A beat.

                                 REED
                        Tell you what?

                                 AMELIA
                        That he had an official letter of 
                        reprimand in his file. For accusing 
                        Grady of mistreatment towards 
                        Ismail.

                                 KINNEY
                        We didn’t tell you- because we 
                        handled it. Morrison lied. 

                                 REED
                        Resupply coming in tomorrow at 
                        0600. Don’t be late.

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - DUSK

           Rico is carefully placing two shotguns in a locker when 
           Amelia enters. 

                                 RICO
                        Sorry, Ma’am. Just finishing up 
                        inventory. 

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s okay. 

           She starts to repack her ruck. 

                                 RICO
                        Going somewhere?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah. Bagram. 
                                 RICO
                        Why?

           Amelia slams her gear down in frustration.

                                 AMELIA
                        They closed the case.

           A beat. Rico crosses to the door and stops. Looks back-

                                 RICO
                        It wasn’t your fault James died. It 
                        was mine. I was supposed to be 
                        watching his six. (A beat) I’m 
                        going to lie to myself- for the 
                        rest of my life. And pretend that I 
                        did.

           Rico leaves, shutting the door softly behind him.

           Amelia sits down and removes the combat knife from her 
           boot... She CUTS a fresh line just below her wrist, watching 
           as the blood drips to the floor...

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

           Amelia lies on her cot, rucksack packed in front of her, 
           already dressed in her ACUs. She has a PICTURE of Trent and 
           Leah on her chest... She falls asleep.

           POV - AMELIA - DREAMING

           QUICK FLASHES: Of scenes from before... Stabbing Eli. The 
           Female Suicide Bomber... The cleaning of the HUMANOID 
           CREATURES... One of which opens a deformed eye- the seven 
           snakes swimming like tadpoles across its iris...

           A SHRIEKING NOISE ERUPTS FROM THE BASE’S LOUDSPEAKER.

           Amelia springs up and off the cot... Hurriedly stuffs her 
           feet into her boots without lacing them. She grabs her rifle 
           and helmet and runs for the door-

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - NIGHT

           Amelia emerges from the weapons room to see Schlaack running 
           across the base.

                                 AMELIA
                        What’s happening?
                                 SCHLAACK
                        Head for the bunker! 

           The SIREN’s sound is muted by a .50 CAL RIPPING through the 
           air from one of the guard towers.

           Amelia runs down the narrow passageway for the bunker. 

           INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

           Amelia takes a seat by herself, four or five feet from the 
           opening. She loads her M4. Slowly rotates the selector switch 
           off safe and points the barrel at the door...

           -- A FLURRY OF CLOSE SHOTS --

           Through the mouth of the bunker, we see Soldiers running back 
           and forth... Frantically searching.

                                 UNKNOWN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        What the fuck was that!?!

                                 UNKNOWN SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        It’s on the roof!

                                 DUFFY (O.S.)
                        How many are there?

                                 UNKNOWN SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        At least four! Jesus! What is that!

           A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE. The sound of something being strangled. 
           The breath slips away...

           SOMEONE OR SOMETHING APPROACHES THE UNLIT BUNKER. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Who’s there?!? Identify yourself!

           Crunch. Crunch. CRUNCH. The footsteps approach. Inches 
           away... Amelia’s heart pounds in her chest. The sound 
           MUTATES. No longer boots... But something CRAWLING... 
           Dragging itself forward. 

           Amelia peers closer to the edge. Closer to the opening of the 
           bunker... Now the SOUND is BEHIND HER... She whips around, 
           struggling to find her flashlight... 

                                 DUFFY (O.S.)
                        Do you see?

           Behind her, Duffy’s standing with his weapon pointed into the 
           bunker past Amelia. His NVGs glow GREEN.
                                 AMELIA
                        What? Duffy?!? What is it!?!

           Duffy runs off leaving her alone...

           Amelia finds her flashlight. Tries to hold it while she 
           steadies herself and raises her rifle. The flashlight SNAPS 
           ON AND-

           THE BUNKER IS EMPTY. 

                                 UNKNOWN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Oh, God! Top, come quick!

           The SHRIEKING ALARM STOPS. 

                                 REED (ON LOUDSPEAKER)
                        The perimeter is secure. Repeat, 
                        the perimeter is secure. Everyone 
                        calm the fuck down.

           EXT. DOG KENNELS - NIGHT

           The platoon stands in a semi-circle looking in at the 
           kennels. 

           THE DOORS ARE ALL OPEN. Inside, the dogs have been reduced to 
           fur and blood. One leg has been completely ripped off. 
           Another’s jaw separated from the skull. The remaining eye 
           washed over with blood and discharge, staring back out.

                                 KINNEY
                        How could this happen? How could-

           Reed approaches Kinney and gets his first look. He gags, 
           almost throwing up- 

                                 REED
                        Why would they do that? Breach the 
                        perimeter to kill the dogs? What 
                        are they, taunting us?

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Sir, we didn’t find any signs of 
                        infiltration. No cuts in the wire. 
                        Nothing.

                                 DUFFY
                        They were on the roof. They climbed 
                        up the TOC- over the barracks. 
                        Then... Then... Flew.
                                 KINNEY
                        Flew? You’ve been smoking too much 
                        shit, Duffy.

                                 DUFFY
                        I swear, Top. You’ve got to believe 
                        me. 

                                 REED
                        Did anyone else see them?

                             (Meekly)
                        I did.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Me too.

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Rico. And Grady-

           Schlaack’s eyes shift to the back of the group. Grady’s 
           walking towards the platoon, the front of his ACUs covered in 
           blood. 

                                 REED
                        Grady, what the hell happened?

           Grady’s white as a ghost.

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        Why the fuck are you covered in 
                        blood?

           Kinney pushes his way through the Soldiers.

                                 KINNEY
                        You. You killed those fuckin’ dogs, 
                        didn’t you? 

           Kinney shoves Grady.

                                 GRADY
                        What? 

                                 KINNEY
                        Why else would you be covered in 
                        blood?!?
           Grady looks down at his hands. The expression on his face, 
           completely blank. Not understanding. 

                                 KINNEY (CONT'D)
                        You fucking piece of shit!

           Kinney launches himself at Grady, knocking him down. He kicks 
           him in the stomach.

                                 KINNEY (CONT'D)
                        You sick fuck. They’re just dogs!

           Reed and Schlaack race forward to restrain Kinney... 

                                 REED
                        Enough! Enough, Mac!

           But the damage is done. Blood courses from Grady’s mouth.

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        Where’s Rico?

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Still in the tower. 

                                 REED
                        Someone relieve him. (A beat) 
                        Grady, bury the dogs outside the 
                        gate.

                                 GRADY
                        You want-

                                 REED
                        You heard me! Get a shovel and get 
                        a move on! Go!

           EXT. PERIMETER - NIGHT

           FLAMES from the burn pit illuminate Grady as he carries the 
           remains of the dogs outside the base. The fire reflects off 
           his eyes. 

           He digs a shallow grave. Removes his ACU blouse, covered in 
           sweat and blood. He places the dogs in the ground. We catch a 
           glimpse of something else... 

           Human remains.
           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - LATER - NIGHT

           Reed, Kinney, and Amelia sit on one side of the table. Rico 
           on the other. 

                                 REED
                        You really want me to call this in? 

           Rico nods. 

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        And what do you think HQ will say 
                        when I tell them our base was 
                        attacked by monsters?

                                 RICO
                        It’s what happened, Sir. 

           A beat.

                        You’re tired, Rico. Go get some 
                        rest.

           Rico shuffles out the door. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Other soldiers saw it too.

                        to accept the fact that something’s 
                        going on here. Maybe Ismail missing 
                        was just the start- 

                                 REED
                        Start of what? Us losing our

                        they’ve been sitting up here, in 
                        the mud, in the dark. Getting shot 
                        at. There are no monsters out 
                        there.

                        That was the official story. 
                        Resupply bird found the platoon 
                        mutilated. But it wasn’t by the 
                        enemy. They had turned on each 
                        other. The cook poisoned the 
                        Captain. Someone lit the barracks 
                        on fire and locked the door-

                        They found three bodies cut up in 
                        the burn pit... 

           A beat. Reed looks disturbed.

                                 REED
                        Whatever this is- I want Grady kept 
                        under watch until we figure out. 
                        Ma’am. I think you might be lucky 
                        to be leaving...

           INT. BUNKER - FIRST LIGHT

           Grady sits, wrists bound with zip ties, on one of the wooden 
           benches. He’s got a gash on his head from where Kinney hit 
           him. A swollen lip. A Soldier stands watch.

           INT. DFAC - MORNING

           Amelia pours herself a cup of coffee... She’s got her ruck 
           packed. Already wearing her IBA and ballistic helmet. Ready 
           to fly for Bagram...

           Schlaack comes barging in. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Ma’am. Captain Reed told me to come 
                        find you. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What is it?
                                 SCHLAACK
                        It’s better if you just see for 
                        yourself. 

           EXT. MAIN GATE - MORNING

           The gate is wide open. Two Soldiers stand watch as a solitary 
           figure marches forward in a dirty white shawl. ISMAIL.

           He raises his hands and is searched thoroughly for weapons.

                                 KINNEY
                        Impossible... Im-

           Both Reed and Kinney look like they see a ghost.

                                 REED
                        Ismail, where have you been? 

                                 ISMAIL
                        Water. I need. Water. 

           Reed snaps his fingers, and Schlaack comes forward with a 
           canteen. He hands it to Ismail.

                                 REED
                        Go ahead. Drink.

           Ismail raises the bottle, almost as if he’s nervous. Then 
           drinks feverishly from it. 

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        You had everyone worried. They even 
                        sent Major Yates here to help find 
                        you. 

           Ismail looks at Amelia for the first time. His cheeks, 
           hollow. Skin, course and thin, like he’s a hundred years past 
           his age.

                                 ISMAIL
                        How did I get here?

                        Yes, Sir.

           Schlaack helps Ismail, unsteady on his legs. He puts an arm 
           around him, and the two trudge off...

                                 AMELIA

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - AFTERNOON

           A thick mist wraps its fingers around the base. Drizzle 
           becomes a steady rain. Then sheets of it, pouring down, 
           soaking all the buildings... In the guard towers, Soldiers 
           stand watch in green oversized ponchos. 

           Amelia struggles to light her cigarette just outside the 
           TOC... She covers her head as she makes a run for it...

           EXT. ISMAIL'S TRAILER - AFTERNOON

           A Soldier stands by as Amelia POUNDS on Ismail’s door.

                                 AMELIA
                        Ismail! It’s Major Yates. I need to 
                        speak with you. Ismail!

           She HAMMERS the door again. Looks at the Soldier-
                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Did he leave?

                        Not since I’ve been on duty.

           Amelia turns the handle finding it unlocked...

           INT. ISMAIL'S TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amelia comes in with a gust of wind... Her muddy boots 
           marking the cheap linoleum. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ismail?

           still made. 

           EXT. ISMAIL'S TRAILER - SAME

           Amelia comes back out...

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - AFTERNOON

           Amelia walks back through the pouring rain... She opens the 
           door to the TOC-

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - AFTERNOON

           But finds it empty... 

           EXT. OFFICERS QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

           Amelia knocks on Reed’s door... After a moment, he finally 
           answers. Reed looks sick.

                        Then he’s probably at the DFAC. 
                        Ma’am, you should dry off. 

           Reed starts to cough... 

                                 REED (CONT'D)
                        You’ll catch a cold like the rest 
                        of us.

           INT. DFAC - MOMENTS LATER

           Amelia enters... The lights are off. She walks in between the 
           tables and neatly stacked chairs... 

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Empty, save for THREE BLACK BODY BAGS, recently unrolled. 
           Amelia unzips one-

           Nothing. 

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - LATER

           Rain DRUMS against the roof. Amelia takes off her soaked 
           uniform, stripping down to her underwear and bra. She’s 
           freezing. RAPID KNOCKS on the door.

                                 AMELIA
                        Just a second.

           Amelia, sighs, throws her damp top back on, and opens the 
           door a crack.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        Yeah?

           It’s Schlaack, soaked himself. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Sorry to disturb you, Ma’am. But 
                        you’ve got watch. Thirty minutes.

                                 AMELIA
                        Me? Why?
                                 SCHLAACK
                        We’re short. Everyone’s pulling 
                        extra duty since... You know, 
                        Grady. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What do I need? 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Rifle. Helmet. IBA. Usual shit. See 
                        you out there.

                                 AMELIA
                        Wait, Corporal. Why are there body 
                        bags in the kitchen?

                                 SCHLAACK
                        No idea.

           INT. WEAPONS ROOM - LATER

           Amelia gears up. She adjusts the straps to her helmet. Loads 
           her AMMO POUCHES. Stashes a bottle of water in one of her ACU 
           cargo pockets.

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - DUSK

           The sky has cleared, the rain gone. The OutPost is covered in 
           large puddles; a roaring brook of mud moves in between the 
           barracks and the TOC.

           Duffy and Rico lay planks of wood across it. 

           I/E. GUARD TOWER - DUSK

           Schlaack’s behind the .50 Cal looking out at the sun as it 
           settles behind the mountains and valley. 

           Amelia raises her rifle and looks out through the scope.

           P.O.V. - SCOPE

           A flock of geese passes through her view, quietly following 
           the river, floating gently on the drafts of wind that filter 
           between the mountains. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        When’s the last time you pulled 
                        guard duty?
                                 AMELIA
                        Officer Candidate School. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        That’s a while... I don’t mind it. 
                        Let’s me think. (A beat) Why’d you 
                        join?

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m an Army brat. Dad fought in 
                        Vietnam. Bounced around from base 
                        to base as a kid. Kind of all I 
                        know. What about you?

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Me- I wish I never signed up. If I 
                        could go back- I’d stop myself from 
                        ever coming here. Now I think I’ll 
                        never leave. 

           The final light from the valley fades... That canyon-like 
           coolness returning.

           INT. DFAC - NIGHT

           Amelia comes in, finished with guard duty, and grabs a 
           Gatorade from the fridge. She sits down, wiped. Takes off her 
           helmet.

           The door swings open. Grady’s standing there, wrists bound in 
           front of him. Rico ushers Grady in and over to Amelia’s 
           table...

                                 RICO
                        Ma’am, Grady’s got something he 
                        wants to tell you. Go ahead, Grady. 

           After some hesitation... Grady speaks-

                                 GRADY
                        I killed Ismail. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What?

                                 GRADY
                             (Tears forming)
                        We were on patrol. I shot him. 
                        Burned his body. Buried it outside 
                        the gate. I can show you. I just 
                        wanted to come clean. I can’t live 
                        with it anymore... I can’t-
                                 AMELIA
                        But Ismail’s alive... 

                                 RICO
                        He can’t be. That’s what we’re 
                        trying to tell you.

                                 AMELIA
                        But I watched him walk through the 
                        gate-

                                 GRADY
                        That wasn’t Ismail, Ma’am.

           RUMBLE... Like a mortar impacting in the distance. The chow 
           hall lights flicker. They all look up-

           THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. SCREEEEEEEECCHHHHHH... 

                                 AMELIA
                        What is that?

           CLAWING TALONS AGAINST THE ROOF... Duffy bursts into the chow 
           hall, his face drained of color, in terror-

                                 DUFFY
                        They’re inside the fucking base!

                                 RICO
                        Who?!?

           THE LIGHTS GO OUT COMPLETELY AS GUNFIRE ERUPTS! SOMEONE’S 
           SHOOTING JUST OUTSIDE THE DFAC... Amelia spins to keep up 
           with the sounds when-

                                 DUFFY
                        Fighting positions! Now!

           Duffy rushes back out, leaving the door wide open.

           Amelia watches as the dark outside is interrupted by LIGHT 
           BLASTING FROM MULTIPLE BARRELS.

                                 GRADY
                        Rico, let me fight.

           Rico looks to Amelia, hesitates, then cuts free Grady’s 
           hands.

                                 RICO
                        Ma’am, I’m sorry we lied.
           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - NIGHT

           Gunfire illuminates the base, strobing. Giving us only 
           glimpses... We see the front gate is WIDE OPEN. 

           Amelia’s drawn to the doors- to a SWARMING SHAPE darker than 
           the night... COMING CLOSER. MOVING LIKE A STORM CLOUD, it 
           sweeps over the perimeter.

           The glass from the guard tower’s spotlight EXPLODES!

           M4s CHATTER WILDLY, sending orange tracer rounds through the 
           dark just inches above Amelia’s head... 

           She smashes into a SOLDIER wearing his NVGs. One lens cracked 
           and off. They both fall to the ground.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Get off me! Get off me!

           The Soldier spins free, MANICALLY FIRING his M4 on FULL AUTO 
           into the blackness. 

           Schlaack runs by- 

                                 AMELIA
                        Schlaack!

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Head to the bunker! 

           KA-BOOM!!! A LARGE EXPLOSION just outside the Guard Tower 
           illuminates the entire COP for THREE SECONDS.

           1... LARGE STICK CREATURES CLIMB THE WALLS OF THE TOC AND THE 
           BARRACKS LOOKING LIKE DADDY LONG LEGS. 

           2... One SWOOPS DOWN AND GRABS A SOLDIER, hurling him into 
           the air...

           3... Amelia sprints for the bunker.

           INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

           Pure black. Amelia feels her way forward against the wall... 

           Looking back at the mouth of the bunker, we watch and listen 
           to the horror playing out... Amelia raises her weapon at the 
           opening. Waiting. 

           A WRETCHING SOUND FROM WITHIN. She scrambles for her 
           flashlight... Searches the floor. The bench. Traces the walls 
           of the bunker up- illuminating:
           A CREATURE ABOVE HER. Clutching the ceiling with its long, 
           talon-like fingers. Its head widens, jaw detaching. The teeth 
           spinning like a whirlpool...

           Amelia SCREAMS... 

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - NIGHT

           She runs for the TOC; the .50 CAL OPENS UP from Guard Tower 
           West... 

           The Gunner’s SWARMED BY THE BLACK MIST... Dismantling the 
           tower piece by piece... The GUNNER SCREAMS as he’s swallowed 
           up in a pool of blackness. 

           The SWARM releases him, dropping the body into the burn pit 
           below... The pit ERUPTS IN FLAMES illuminating Amelia just as 
           she reaches the TOC’s door. 

           Amelia can’t help but watch as the Gunner disintegrates. 
           SCREAMING. PLEADING. Like trying to pull her forward.

                                 GUNNER
                        Help me!!!

           Terrified, she opens the TOC’s door-

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - NIGHT

           She slams the door shut, resting up against it. Catching her 
           breath.

           Amelia crosses to the radio and presses the black button to 
           transmit.

                                 AMELIA (INTO RADIO)
                        Bagram HQ. Bagram HQ, this is Major 
                        Yates. Can you hear me?

           Nothing. She tries to change the frequency. Different 
           channels. Then the volume knob. Not even static. 

           Amelia drops below the desk to see: The wires to the radio 
           have been severed.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        No.

           She stands slowly... Backing up. Bumping into-
           CAPTAIN REED, lying on the floor. A single line of blood 
           drips from the corner of his mouth, cascading off the gold 
           cross hanging from his neck.

           There’s a hole through his head. His right eye replaced with 
           a crater.

           -- THE DOOR OPENS --

           It’s Schlaack, Rico, and Duffy. 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        We’ve got to barricade this place! 
                        Come on!

           Duffy slams the door shut. For a moment the terrifying sounds 
           of war are cut off. Rico pushes a desk up against it and 
           flips it over, off its legs. Schlaack stacks heavy pelican 
           cases behind it. 

                                 SCHLAACK (CONT'D)
                        Major Yates. Look for some wood. 
                        Anything. 

           Amelia’s still staring at Captain Reed.

                                 SCHLAACK (CONT'D)
                        Yates!

           In the corner of the TOC, a stack of loose two by fours. 
           Amelia grabs three and brings them to Rico.

                                 SCHLAACK (CONT'D)
                        Duffy, find some nails.

           Duffy locates a container of nails and a hammer. He brings 
           them back and starts to mount the boards to the door. 

           Schlaack tries the radio.

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s cut. 

           Schlaack sees the severed wires.

                                 DUFFY
                        What’s cut? The comms?!?

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Just shut up for a moment! Let me 
                        think.

           Rico takes the hammer from Duffy and finishes the job. 
           THUMP. THUMP. THUMP on the door from the outside. THUMP. 
           THUMP. THUMP.

           Amelia moves for the door-

                                 SCHLAACK (CONT'D)
                        No. Don’t.

                                 AMELIA
                        What about the rest of the unit? 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        We’re it.

                                 DUFFY
                        Someone lit the barracks on fire. 
                        Cooked them... cooked them alive-

           Schlaack takes off his ACU top and covers Reed’s face. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Kinney? 

           A beat... A SCREAM FROM SOMETHING NOT HUMAN OUTSIDE THE 
           WALLS... Now the sound moves across the roof of the TOC...

                                 SCHLAACK
                        He’s gone.

           EXT. BURN PIT - NIGHT

           Kinney stands in the middle of human shit. Entrails seeping 
           from his stomach... Eyes illuminated by the burning remains 
           of the Gunner.

           INT. TACTICAL OPERATIONS COMMAND - MOMENTS LATER

                                 AMELIA
                        We’ve got to get out of here.

                                 SCHLAACK
                        The bunker. Leads to the tunnels. 
                        And to the village below...

                                 AMELIA
                        But there was something in there... 
                        With me- I felt-

           RIPPPPP!!! SLASH... The roof is being torn apart. Shingle by 
           shingle.
                                 SCHLAACK
                        We’ll all go together. Okay? It’s 
                        our only chance.

           Amelia nods.

                                 AMELIA
                        We’ll need a distraction. The 
                        humvee- We light the fucking humvee 
                        on fire and roll it out the front

           From the corner of the room, the RADIO COMES ALIVE. 

           Collectively their heads turn as one... A glimmer of hope. 
           But then- Realization. THE CORDS REMAIN CUT. Somehow, the 
           BLACK BUTTON DEPRESSES.

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - DUSK

           Winter. A cold wind sweeps over Halloran but 175 years 
           before...

           BRITISH SOLDIERS are setting up a base on top of the 
           mountain... We see trenches dug. Lines run. Cannons placed... 
           Below, the valley looks the same. A soft, fresh patch of snow 
           covers everything.

           A CRY from a SOLDIER in the distance.

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        Bring the doctor! Bring a lantern!
           A SWINGING LANTERN MOVES FORWARD... We follow as it’s handed 
           to a young DOCTOR climbing up the loose topsoil of a trench.

           Below him, Soldiers and Indian conscripts work hand in 
           hand...

           EXT. PERIMETER - DUSK

           The young Doctor moves out of the encampment, coming to a 
           GRAVEYARD filled with markers.

           Three Soldiers brush off one peculiar site. A BURIAL PLOT 
           TWENTY FEET LONG and only TWO FEET WIDE.

           A pickax and shovel CLANG off the wooden casket. Chunks of 
           frozen earth removed...

           They stare down:

           Inside the coffin, the SKELETAL REMAINS OF A GIANT. The 
           Doctor stumbles forward trying to examine when-

           CRIES OF AN ATTACK...

           Behind them, the base starts to BURN...

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. PORTA POTTY - NIGHT

           Amelia opens her eyes... SCREAMS from soldiers and unseen 
           beasts. The WHINE of the reaper drone circling above.

           OUTSIDE THE DOOR:

           Scratch... Scratch... Scratch...

           Between the cracks of the door and the frame, something 
           moves. The skin, white. Almost translucent. 

           Amelia looks down through the hole below. The SHIT BEGINS TO 
           SWIRL... She slams the cover down and looks back up:

           A YELLOW EYE. BLACK MARKS ACROSS THE IRIS. MOVING BACK AND 
           FORTH. FOLLOWING HER THROUGH THE SLIT...

           Amelia KICKS open the door and FIRES HER WEAPON!
           EXT. PORTA POTTY - NIGHT

           Into the stomach of RICO! He falls backward, clutching his 
           guts. 

           Amelia drops her weapon, staring down in horror-

                                 AMELIA
                        Rico! I’m sorry- I’m so sorry. I 
                        thought- I thought...

           She tries to comfort him as best she can. Blood spills out 
           and over his ACUs- Rico seizes... She grips his hands... 
           Watching as the life slowly drains from his eyes.

                                 SCHLAACK (O.S.)
                        Yates!

           Breaking her trance... Amelia stands and surveys the scene: 

           The humvee plan has gone awry. The vehicle burns in place 
           with its doors open. The body of Duffy lies next to one of 
           the wheels... His severed head, on the ground a few feet away- 

                                 AMELIA
                        Schlaack!!!

           The whole COP is on FIRE, smoke and flames billowing out into 
           the night. In the far distance, the outline of a soldier. 
           Grady? Kinney? We can’t be sure... 

                                 SCHLAACK
                        Get to the bunker! The tunnels!

           A Soldier raises his weapon and FIRES FULL AUTO RIPPING 
           SCHLAACK APART.

                                 RICO
                        Yates!

           Amelia drops her gaze... Rico stares up at her, MISSING HIS 
           EYES. 

                                 RICO (CONT'D)
                        Show me your war face!

           Amelia runs as fast as she can- 

           BUT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN HER AND THE BUNKER STRETCHES ON AND 
           ON FOREVER... 

           NOW SHE’S NOT MOVING, STUCK IN A DREAM’S QUICKSAND... THERE’S 
           NO SENSE OF UP OR DOWN. A SAW-LIKE NOISE SPEEDS UP IN THE 
           BACKGROUND... RACING TO CATCH UP WITH AMELIA-
           When ISMAIL’S DOOR OPENS- the Translator himself appears, 
           framed by the light from within like an angel or a jinn-  He 
           reaches out a hand...

           Amelia stumbles, falling... The ground beneath her giving 
           away to BLACKNESS WHEN-

           Ismail grabs her and pulls her in...

           INT. ISMAIL'S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Amelia OPENS HER EYES... She’s lying on an intricate prayer 
           rug, candles surrounding her. We SEE the house of snakes 
           drawn on the walls. Outside, no sound. Complete silence as if 
           the war has disappeared...

           Ismail stands over her as Amelia tries to sit up... She finds 
           herself pinned to the floor. As if some unseen weight was 
           sitting on her. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What is this place? 

           SMOKE EMERGES from Ismail’s mouth... Crossing the room, 
           floating like a SNAKE for Amelia... It finds her mouth, and 
           she can’t help but inhale.

                                 ISMAIL
                        Home to the Watchers.

           Ismail points up:

           The ceiling becomes see-through. Dark, primordial. FIREBALLS 
           STREAK into the sky... Plummeting from the heavens.

                                 AMELIA
                        Who are you?

           EXT. KORENGAL VALLEY - DAY

           1st Platoon walks in formation... Some of the men, like Rico 
           and James, have tears in their eyes... Uniforms stained with 
           blood and sweat...

           In the background, an ENTIRE VILLAGE BURNS... 

           EXT. KORENGAL VALLEY - DUSK

           The fire team stops at the bank of the river... Taking off 
           their tops, trying to clean off the blood. Grady drops to a 
           knee and drinks from his Camelback. He looks back at Ismail, 
           standing on the trail...

                                 GRADY
                        Ismail. What happened back there. 
                        Stays between us? Okay? We good? 

           Ismail just stares ahead blankly. Shell shocked.

                                 GRADY (CONT'D)
                        I said... Are we good?

           Grady watches him for a moment before raising his rifle. 

           BANG!

           A single shot echoes as Ismail drops like a brick.

           EXT. PERIMETER - NIGHT

           Grady pours lighter fluid into a freshly dug pit. MATCH CUT 
           Ismail’s BURNING BODY IN THE GRAVE WITH-

           EXT. BURIAL GROUND - FROM ABOVE - DUSK

           The CASKETS from the opening sequence as they’re lowered into 
           the ground. Scoops of dirt THUD and CRACK against the wood. 

           -- WE PULL BACK REVEALING --

           TALL SHADOWS RIPPLE BACK AND FORTH. AT FIRST, WE THINK MAYBE 
           THEY’RE TREES...

           BUT THEN WE REALIZE: THE GODS STAND AMONG THEM. TOWERING 
           ABOVE.
           INT. ISMAIL'S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Back with Amelia and Ismail... He releases her hand. 

                                 ISMAIL
                        You were never stationed here. 

           Amelia nods.

                        Then you can still leave.

                        The bunker. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Where does it lead?

                                 ISMAIL
                        Into your past. 

           EXT. COMBAT OUTPOST HALLORAN - NIGHT

           The CARNAGE continues to play on, as Amelia exits Ismail’s 
           trailer... The barracks, TOC, and DFAC burning to the ground, 
           casting plumes of smoke into the sky. 

           Only one of the guard posts remains standing: A tattered 
           Ameican flag, the stars and stripes on FIRE, snapping in the 
           wind.

           She passes Schlaack and Grady’s bodies, flies already 
           swarming over open eyes, and spots the bunker in the 
           distance...

           INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

           Amelia enters... Sliding her hand down the side of the 
           concrete... Until she comes to the end.

                                 AMELIA
                        No. No! No! 

           Amelia kicks at the wall, slams her shoulder into it... 

           The SOUND of SOMETHING draws her attention back to the mouth 
           of the BUNKER: Standing there, framed by the fires, One of 
           the BUTCHERED DOGS... It growls, showing its razor-sharp 
           teeth... 
           IT SPRINTS FOR HER!

           Amelia turns to flee- This time finding the back wall gone...

           INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT

           Amelia runs through the dark, the sounds of the DOG fast 
           approaching... 

           Then VOICES... Grady’s, Rico’s, Schlaack’s, Kinney’s... ALL 
           PLEADING...

                                 VOICES IN THE DARK
                        Major Yates! Major Yates! Don’t 
                        leave us! Show us your war face!

           Amelia just runs faster and faster... Bouncing off the dirt 
           and concrete. Not DARING TO LOOK BACK UNTIL- 

           SHE TUMBLES INTO A BRIGHT BLINDING WHITE LIGHT...

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Amelia WAKES... Startled. Not knowing where she is... Someone 
           rouses in the bed next to her... Trent. Her husband. He 
           smiles and closes his eyes, draping his arm around her. 

                                 TRENT
                        It’s early.

           The sound of FEET fast approaching. Amelia’s eyes SNAP to the 
           open door-

           And there’s LEAH, 6, standing in her PJs, smiling. She jumps 
           up onto the bed and embraces her mother.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           The coffee pot bubbles. Trent’s reading the newspaper while 
           keeping an eye on Leah, seated at the kitchen table, eating 
           her Cheerios. 

           Amelia comes in, freshly showered. She reaches for the 
           coffee. 

                                 TRENT
                        You okay, hun?

           As she pours a cup-
                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah, I just. What day is it? 

                                 TRENT
                        What day is it, Leah?

                                 LEAH
                        Wednesday!

                                 TRENT
                        Must have been a deep sleep, babe. 
                        Want me to fix you breakfast?

                                 AMELIA
                        Ummm...

                                 TRENT
                        Take a seat, hun.

           Trent hands her the newspaper... Amelia sits. She starts to 
           read the front page of the NY Times-

           CLOSE UP - NEWSPAPER

                        Oh- I think I know. Mommy’s getting 
                        cold feet. Only a few more weeks 
                        until OCS. Just admit it- you 
                        already miss us...

                                 AMELIA
                        But it’s 2010. It’s November 2010. 

           Leah and Trent both look at Amelia with curiosity, then 
           concern. Trent crosses to her. 
                                 TRENT
                        Honey. I don’t know what you took 
                        last night to help you sleep- But I 
                        can promise... You’re not a time 
                        traveler. 

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Amelia locks the door and stares at herself in the mirror. 
           And stares. And stares. And stares. 

           Until-

           Flashing across the whites of her eyes: The seven swimming 
           snakes.

           SMASH TO BLACK.
