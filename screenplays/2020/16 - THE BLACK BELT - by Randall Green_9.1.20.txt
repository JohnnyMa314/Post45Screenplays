                        If we kill him, the next one may 
                        be worse, and we can’t kill them 
                        all. We’d better carry out 
                        Teacher’s orders.

           INT. AIRPLANE, FLYING - DAY

           SIMON PALUSKA (13) sits in a window seat watching a movie on an 
           old portable DVD player - 1978’s kung fu classic, ”Five Deadly 
           Venoms”. The source of “Gecko”’s sage words.

           This is a modern airplane in modern times, with TVs in the back 
           of every seat. Still, a portable DVD player.      

           Simon is an awkward lump of still-forming pubescent human; not 
           fat or thin, not tall or short. He wears a Buffalo Sabres 
           sweatshirt and inexpensive jeans. 

           What he does not wear is headphones. The DVD’s AUDIO emits from 
           the player’s speakers (quietly - he is considerate, this kid).

           Simon mouths along to the dialogue. He even mimics some of the 
           kung fu moves - best he can, given the confines.

           The middle seat of the row is empty. The aisle seat, decidedly 
           not. A MAN, a tired man, gestures to a FLIGHT ATTENDANT. 

           The man WHISPERS to the Attendant, who then looks to Simon.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Sweetie do you have some 
                        headphones you can use with that? 
                        Or I can give you some?

                                 SIMON
                           (from his trance)
                        They broke. The thing broke off in 
                        the hole.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                           (apologetic)
                        I’ll need to ask you to mute the 
                        device. As a consideration to your 
                        fellow passengers.

                                 SIMON
                        ...The mute’s broken too.

           The Flight Attendant’s look turns even more apologetic. 
           Simon, understanding, shuts the DVD player - carefully, as you 
           do with a treasured item.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Thank you sweetie. Wait right 
                        there.

           The Attendant walks off. Simon gives a look: Where would I go?

           Simon leans back in his seat, exhales. It can be understood: 
           this is not the first bump in an otherwise perfect day.

           The Attendant reemerges through the First Class curtain with a 
           glass bottle of Coke, a glass of ice with a thick paper napkin 
           elegantly wrapped around it, and a bag of seriously-gourmet 
           looking mini chocolate chip cookies.

           The Attendant hands them to Simon with a smile. Simon, under 
           the immensity of this kind gesture, looks like he might cry.

           EXT. LONG BEACH AIRPORT - DAY

           Simon exits the airport, wheeling behind him a large Teenage 
           Mutant Ninja Turtles suitcase.

           Simon squints in the sun, like he’s never seen it that bright 
           or hot before.

           Simon scans the alien landscape. Finally,

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dude!

           Simon turns to see a MAN (mid-30s) in a Callaway Golf polo 
           shirt, cargo shorts, flip flops, backward Callaway Golf hat.

                                 SIMON
                           (evenly)
                        Hey Uncle Nate.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Lose the hoodie dude, it’s like 
                        95!

                                 SIMON
                        It’s all I’m wearing.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Well. Shit.
           INT. UNCLE NATE’S JEEP WRANGLER, DRIVING - DAY

           This car is a mess - empty Gatorade bottles, indeterminate 
           clothing items, some loose golf clubs in the back.

           Pearl Jam plays low from the radio. Uncle Nate drums lightly on 
           the steering wheel. There is much to discuss, but it’ll take 
           some verbal greasing to get to any of it.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        So this is an adventure, right?

           Simon nods.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You did bring t-shirts right? And 
                        shorts? They have summer in 
                        Buffalo?

           Simon again nods. He’s still squinting. Nate fishes in the 
           center console and produces a pair of filthy Oakleys. Hands 
           them to Simon. Simon puts them on.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Thought later we’d--

                                 SIMON
                           (interrupting)
                        The casket was tilted because you 
                        weren’t there to help carry it. 
                        Mom’s was. They didn’t even find 
                        Dad so that was less of a problem.
                           (then)
                        People talked about you.

           On Nate, who anticipated some form of this.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Anything of a...positive nature?

                                 SIMON
                        People were pretty focused on how 
                        the casket was tilted. 

           A beat as Nate imagines what was said of him.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I mean, dude. I had to prepare for 
                        your arrival. And your Pops didn’t 
                        place much importance on 
                        “events”--

                                 SIMON
                        But my mom did.
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Yea well I didn’t know your mom 
                        too well, did I.

           Simon, unequipped to respond, cleans off the Oakley lenses with 
           his sweatshirt. Really just rearranging the dirt.

           It’s on Uncle Nate to neutralize the tension.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Here’s a little tip for when you 
                        learn to drive: Tilt the rearview 
                        mirror up a bit more than you 
                        would...

           Uncle Nate does so with his center mirror. He sits up straight 
           so he can see clearly through it.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Encourages good posture.

           On Simon. That seems like something he will actually file away.

           They drive past a bland, two-story BRICK BUILDING. 

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        So that’s your school. 
                           (with a sense of pride)
                        I did some essential dad stuff by 
                        getting your class schedule. There 
                        are activities coming up too so 
                        it’s not all work. A talent 
                        show...in case you’re talented in 
                        a way that should be shown. A 
                        field trip - I signed the 
                        permission slip, even put an 
                        exclamation point after my 
                        signature. 

           Simon vacantly nods, his mind elsewhere.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Point is, I talked to the teachers 
                        and they seem really nice...

                                 SIMON
                        Adults are always nice. 

           It’s implied: Kids, less so. Nate glances over to Simon.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I’m sure the kids are--

           Simon interrupts, comes out with it:
                                 SIMON
                        I’m taking some gap years so it’s 
                        really not an issue for me.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        That’s...what? No, that’s 
                        a...college thing.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m not saying I won’t learn. I’m 
                        just not gonna learn school.

           On Uncle Nate. He decides: Best to table this for now.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Thought later we’d hang up some 
                        posters in your room. I have a 
                        bunch - by my age, a man has some 
                        posters. You like The Matrix?

           Simon nods. He does, in fact.

           They stop at a red light. Simon’s attention is CAUGHT, hard: 
           Housed within a stock, sunbaked shopping center, sandwiched 
           between an out-of-business travel agency and a small Greek 
           restaurant, sits The:

                        TAEKWONDO ACADEMY OF LONG BEACH 

           Simon lowers his sunglasses. And gets a good look.

                                 SIMON
                           (sotto)
                        There it is.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        ...There’s what?

           Simon just pushes his sunglasses back up. 

           The traffic light turns green - reflects in Simon’s glasses.

           EXT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           Establishing. A warren of “Luxury Spanish Villa Units” that in 
           no way evoke the feeling of being in Spain. Built in the 80’s.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Simon enters, Uncle Nate trailing with Simon’s suitcase. Simon 
           absorbs the two bedroom, carpeted apartment. 
           Notably, there are TWO LARGE TV’s, mounted side by side. 

           What else: There’s a small desk in the corner with a desktop 
           Dell computer. A ten-speed bike hanging on hooks on a wall. 
           Otherwise, not a tremendous amount to draw the eye.

                                 SIMON
                        I thought you said it was a house.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Did I?

                                 SIMON
                        You said, “My house...”

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        It’s a..I guess a colloquialism.

                                 SIMON
                           (sincere)
                        I don’t care that it’s not a 
                        house. I shouldn’t have said 
                        anything.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        It’s cool dude! Anyway, it’s our 
                        house now. Welcome to your new 
                        house!

           Simon is somewhat relaxed by the thought.

                                 SIMON
                        Thanks.
                           (then)
                        Why do you have two TVs?

           On Nate. This requires a considered answer.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I watch a lot of golf.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - DAY

           Uncle Nate shows Simon the small bedroom. There’s a treadmill 
           in the corner, but it has otherwise been cleared of junk.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Made your bed. I don’t even make 
                        my bed.

                                 SIMON
                           (impressed)
                        It’s bigger than the one I had.
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Hell yea it is! You’re in 
                        California now. The big leagues.

                                 SIMON
                        ..What does that mean?

           Nate doesn’t know, so he moves on.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        There are two sinks in the 
                        bathroom. Yours is the one without 
                        a bunch of shit around it.
                           (realizing)
                        Here’s the deal dude: I curse. 
                        “Swear”, what have you. I really 
                        want to not do it around you but 
                        that will require breaking a habit 
                        that I’m very much in the habit 
                        of. So..just do as I say, not as I 
                        do. Or I mean, do what I say, not 
                        as I say...which would inevitably 
                        involve some cursing. And actually 
                        you don’t really have to do...what 
                        I tell you to do. Unless it’s a 
                        matter of personal safety in which 
                        case I’d recommend it. Or...do you 
                        have to do what I say? We should 
                        figure all this out. I guess I’m 
                        your dad now...

           Nate is in over his head. It’s clear, even to an eighth grader.

                                 SIMON
                        Can we hang the Matrix poster 
                        another day?

           INT. “LEGENDS” SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

           Simon and Uncle Nate sit at a high-top near the bar. There are 
           TVs everywhere except the ceiling and the floor.

           Nate is locked in to the one TV airing a golf tournament. He 
           tears at a bar napkin. It’s quite clear that his involvement in 
           this match goes beyond mere fandom.

           The GOLFER on-screen misses an easy 5-foot putt.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        God damn it are you fuckin kidding 
                        me Fowler?

           People look. Nate reels it in.
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Fuckin 5 feet, straightaway.
                           (to Simon)
                        He should be making those all day 
                        long.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey you.

           Turn to find: BECCA RIGALLY (mid-30s). Easy smile. Golf 
           clothes. Biceps that are larger than Nate’s.

                                 BECCA
                           (to Simon)
                        And hey you! This must be The Mr. 
                        Simon!

           Nate stands and kisses Becca - a kiss that’s appropriate for 
           Simon-as-audience. Simon stands too, courteously. 

           Becca embraces Simon in a hug, knowing he needs one. Simon 
           awkwardly hugs her back. And they all sit.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Fowler fuckin 3-putted on 17. 
                        Believe that shit?

           Becca stifles an eye-roll. Directed at Nate, not at Fowler.

                                 BECCA
                        Guess dinner’s on me...

           Nate gives her hand an affectionate squeeze.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Si, Becca. Becca, meet Simon. 
                           (really trying)
                        He is now my son and the light of 
                        my life.

           Simon just doesn’t know what to do with that.

           A WAITER approaches - knows Becca and Nate.

                                 BECCA
                        Usual, pleeeease.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Iced tea for me. Three Splenda. 
                        Four lemons.

           The waiter looks to Simon.
                                 SIMON
                        I’ll drink this water.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You can have soda dude. 
                           (to Becca)
                        I’ve decided I allow soda. Unless 
                        you think otherwise?--

                                 SIMON
                        I already had soda today.

           Nate and Becca exchange a look, impressed.

           The waiter departs. Nate’s attention returns to the TV.

                                 BECCA
                        So how was your flight Simon!?

           Becca is warm with him, and it’s genuine. It draws Simon out.

                                 SIMON
                        ...I watched a great film with 
                        some great lessons about 
                        integrity. And the importance of 
                        displaying strength to your 
                        enemies.

                                 BECCA
                        Well that sounds awesome. Tell me 
                        more!

                                 SIMON
                           (nervous in her gaze)
                        You...want to act with integrity. 
                        And always...display strength to 
                        your enemies.

                                 BECCA
                        I can’t imagine you have enemies.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m new here so I don’t know yet.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (to the TV)
                        Don’t go at the pin, dipshit.

                                 SIMON
                           (to Becca, noticing)
                        Your bracelet is nice.

           Uncle Nate breaks from the TV to add,
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Isn’t that an elegant bracelet?
                           (warmly)
                        She bought it for herself before I 
                        even had the chance.

           Becca, generously, smiles at Nate.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Simon and Nate enter. Long day for these two.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        It’s 10. Where we at vis-a-vis 
                        your bedtime?

                                 SIMON
                        I went to bed after Mom and Dad. 
                        They were always tired.

           Simon sits on the couch. Uncle Nate collapses into a recliner. 

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        That fuckin store. Ya know, I told 
                        your dad: People need artwork 
                        framed, like, once a year max. And 
                        now there are websites that do it. 
                        Inexpensively.

                                 SIMON
                        It was more of a workshop than a 
                        store.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Yea. Exactly.
                           (then, softening)
                        Sorry man. You wanna watch the 
                        news or something?

                                 SIMON
                        I’m pretty tired.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (a beat, relieved)
                        I’m off tomorrow so we can do 
                        whatever you want.

                                 SIMON
                           (matter-of-fact)
                        I have to go sign up for karate 
                        lessons. There’s a dojo close to 
                        here - we passed it when we were 
                        driving so maybe you know it?
           On Nate, making sure he heard that right.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Karate lessons...

                                 SIMON
                        Yea, I’m gonna be a Black Belt. 
                        Once I accomplish that I’ll start 
                        back up at school.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Dude. I hate to be so direct after 
                        the day you’ve had. Days. Weeks I 
                        guess. But karate is bullshit. And 
                        you start school Monday.

           Simon, quietly, short-circuits.

                                 SIMON
                        No it’s not. And no I don’t.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        This guy on my floor in college 
                        was a Black Belt. And he’s in jail 
                        for securities fraud.

           Simon doesn’t know what that means. Doesn’t need to know.

                                 SIMON
                        Martial arts teaches you honor and 
                        discipline. And uppercuts.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I’ll teach you all that shit. Look 
                        dude, I’m gonna give you the real 
                        because life has made a man of 
                        you: Your folks did not leave you 
                        money. 
                           (some pride, not much)
                        Fortunately, for us both, I’m the 
                        Head of the Caddy Program at Tall 
                        Oaks so I was able to get you a 
                        job washing clubs after school. 
                           (then)
                        I’m just...afraid there’s no time 
                        for karate.

                                 SIMON
                        ..You work at a Caddyshack?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        It’s not a shack. It’s an elegant 
                        pagoda-like structure and my 
                        office has a Nespresso machine.
                                 SIMON
                        I thought you were a professional 
                        golfer.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (a beat)
                        I no longer am that.

                                 SIMON
                        So you help other people golf?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Hey, man, there’s a lot more to 
                        the situation. You’re a grownup 
                        now, but that doesn’t mean you 
                        understand nuance.

           Simon is losing his emotional grip.

                                 SIMON
                        Marcus Smith got his Black Belt 
                        and it earned him the respect of 
                        the whole school. Including 
                        teachers. Not even dead parents 
                        got me respect...

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (waves this off)
                        People respect you.

                                 SIMON
                        No, they don’t, they think I’m 
                        weird. But not for long. Black 
                        Belts aren’t weird - they’re 
                        leaders.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You’re not weird, Simon. Your 
                        parents just had weird rules and 
                        it made you seem weird. What 
                        parent makes their kid tuck their 
                        shirt in at public school?

                                 SIMON
                        I’m not starting school again 
                        until I’m a Black Belt. Second 
                        Degree Black Belt, to be safe.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (direct)
                        You’re going to school, Simon.
                                 SIMON
                           (equally direct)
                        Once I’m a Black Belt. Of course. 
                        I eventually want a school 
                        education in case I don’t make the 
                        Taekwondo Olympic team--

           Uncle Nate’s patience finds its end.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You want to be a Black Belt? You 
                        can probably buy a karate Black 
                        Belt on Amazon.

           Nate pulls out his PHONE. Opens the AMAZON APP.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (as he types)
                        Karate...black...belt.
                           (finds it)
                        Here. Twenty five bucks. And you 
                        can be a Black Belt. 

                                 SIMON
                        That’s not how you do it.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Do you think you deserve people’s 
                        respect?

                                 SIMON
                        Yes.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        And they’ll only give it to you if 
                        you’re a Black Belt.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea. For me...yea.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (in partial jest)
                        I don’t know, man. I’m doing the 
                        math: If you deserve respect, and 
                        you feel you need a “Black Belt” 
                        to get what you deserve...I 
                        say...just get a Black Belt. And 
                        then...back up your skills through 
                        YouTube video lessons. 
                           (almost to himself)
                        This is kind of the way of the 
                        world now.

           Uncle Nate points his PHONE toward Simon. Open to Amazon. 
           And there it is, indeed: For twenty-five bucks, you can One-
           Click a real-deal karate Black Belt.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        It’s either that...or you give 
                        people a chance to dig you for who 
                        you are. You pick. 
                           (with parental insistence)
                        Because school starts Monday.

           On Simon. He has no more resistance left in him today. 

                                 SIMON
                        I’m tired.

           Uncle Nate nods, empathetically.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I’ll make sure you have a glass of 
                        water next to your bed. Every 
                        night.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Simon lies in bed, wide awake. Water, as promised, by his side.

           Simon takes out his PHONE. Opens INSTAGRAM.

           He taps on MARCUS’S STORY. VIDEO of Marcus at a Taekwondo 
           tournament, victoriously hoisting a TROPHY. 

           Marcus’s vanquished OPPONENT gives a respectful BOW.

           In the bleachers behind, MARCUS’S PARENTS provide all manner of 
           applause, love, support, respect. Beside his parents, a crew of 
           Marcus’s MIDDLE-SCHOOL FRIENDS cheer.

           On Simon: His thoughts, it’s reasonable to assume, go back to 
           Uncle Nate’s words. 

           Then...his thoughts go forward...

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Simon pads across the room to Uncle Nate’s COMPUTER. He clicks 
           the mouse, waking the screen.

           Simon opens a browser. Types in Amazon.com. Amazon is logged-in 
           to Nate’s account.

           Simon types into the search bar: KARATE BLACK BELT.
           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB, CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           This place is beautiful. Unless you work there. 

           Simon, in an ill-fitting Tall Oaks polo, washes golf clubs. 

           A MAN approaches with his DAUGHTER, to whom the man pays no 
           attention, probably ever. 

           The girl is Simon’s age. She does not fit into the Club 
           landscape - Sonic Youth t-shirt, dirty white sneakers, and a 
           crude, seemingly-self-applied TATTOO of a PROPELLER on her 
           forearm. 

           Simon is too busy to notice her. Simon polishes the last club, 
           and the dad promptly collects the golf bag.

                                 GIRL
                        Aren’t you young to be working 
                        here?

           Simon looks up. And now, notices her.

                                 SIMON
                        Life has made a man of me. So I’m 
                        expected to work.

           The girl digests that, bemused. And she and her dad move on to 
           the valet stand.

                                 UNCLE NATE (O.S.)
                        Alright buddy boy! Quittin’ time. 

           Uncle Nate approaches.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I’m making you steak for dinner. 
                        However you like it cooked.

                                 SIMON
                        Is Becca coming?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Maybe, she’s still giving a 
                        lesson. But I always make extra 
                        for her in case.
                           (then)
                        She’ll probably discard of me at 
                        some point, so I enjoy every day 
                        with her as though it’s my last.
                           (it occurs to him)
                        You shouldn’t take her for granted 
                        either. Our lives are sunnier for 
                        her presence.
           EXT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - DUSK

           Simon and Nate approach the front door. Outside sits a medium-
           sized plastic AMAZON ENVELOPE.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I didn’t order anything. They 
                        always leave shit at the wrong 
                        house.

           Nate picks it up. It’s addressed to him. He’s puzzled.

                                 SIMON
                        ...It’s for me. And it’s all I’ll 
                        ever need from you.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM

           Close on Simon. He delicately opens the envelope. 

           With great ceremony, befitting his reverence for the item 
           inside, Simon pulls out: THE BLACK BELT.

           TURN TO: Uncle Nate. Mouth slightly agape. Amused and amazed.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You fuckin did it. Man, you are my 
                        son. 

                                 SIMON
                        Why do you keep saying that? 
                        Uncles don’t have sons.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (considers)
                        I aspire to be the exception to 
                        that rule. And we have a lot in 
                        common...Really I’m just surprised 
                        I didn’t pull this stunt when I 
                        was your age.

                                 SIMON
                        It’s not a stunt...I’m gonna study 
                        all of the moves and philosophy 
                        online. I’m going to earn it.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Yea of course. Who says you have 
                        to end with a Black Belt? Just 
                        start with one and work your way 
                        back. That’s become a popular, 
                        modern way of thinking. For many 
                        types of pursuits.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m not faking it. You’ll see how 
                        hard of a worker I am.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Damn right. You’re making it.
                           (then)
                        Just remember: With power comes 
                        responsibility.

           On Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        I’ve always had a lot of 
                        responsibilities.

           EXT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Uncle Nate’s Wrangler pulls into the parking lot. Hordes of 
           MIDDLE SCHOOLERS funnel in for the start of the day.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S WRANGLER - CONTINUOUS

           Nate wipes dust off the dashboard so he can see the CLOCK.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I meant to prep a whole 
                        motivational speech. Shit. And now 
                        I’m realizing I wouldn’t even have 
                        had time to deliver it.

                                 SIMON
                        No worries.

           Nate delivers his best “speech” anyway.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I have no doubt that you’ll make a 
                        lasting and positive first 
                        impression. You’re a very cool 
                        person, deserving of respect. 
                        That’s my opinion and I think 
                        others will share it.

           Simon fidgets with his backpack. All nerves.

           Uncle Nate looks Simon over, with recognizable paternal care.
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Packed a lot of steak in your 
                        lunch. Have a good day, alright?

           EXT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           We get a look at Simon, HEAD TO TOE:

           Plaid button-down shirt, tucked into khakis. Worn-out New 
           Balance sneakers. And around his waist,

                                 STUDENT (O.S.)
                           (mocking)
                        Is that kid wearing a karate belt?

           Simon, embarrassed, quick-steps toward the main entrance.

           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL, CLASSROOM - DAY

           Students settle into HOMEROOM. 

           At the front of the class: MS. ROSA (early 30s). Exceptionally 
           organized, from her outfit to her desk to her handling of a 
           room-full of high-octane children.

           Amongst those children, THE GIRL FROM THE COUNTRY CLUB. She 
           whispers to ANOTHER GIRL at an adjacent desk. 

           This Other Girl: She has dark braided hair practically down to 
           the back of her knees, wears a cool but homemade-looking hemp 
           dress. And also: A PROPELLER TATTOO on her forearm. 

           Simon, avoiding their eyes, scans the room for an empty desk.

           Simon notices a desk in the front row with a NAME CARD perched 
           atop. SIMON. It is hand-drawn, his NAME surrounded by STICKERS.

           Simon sits. His is the only desk with a name card. He could do 
           without it.

                                 MS. ROSA
                           (quiet, intentionally)
                        Good morning, class.

           The kids’ chatter stops on a dime. Respect.

                                 CLASS
                        Good morning, Ms. Rosa.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        You all know we have a new student 
                        joining us. 
                            (MORE)
                                 MS. ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Because you all so kindly 
                        contributed a sticker to his name 
                        card. Everyone, let’s welcome 
                        Simon Paluska!

                                 CLASS
                        Welcome Simon Paluska / Hi Simon 
                        Paluska / Welcome Simon.

           Simon manages a half-wave.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Simon, I know this is the last 
                        thing you want to do because it’s 
                        horrifyingly awkward and 
                        difficult. But that can be a very 
                        good thing sometimes. Would you 
                        introduce yourself to the class?

           After a beat, Simon, resigned, stands. No one looks at his 
           eyes. They look at his BLACK BELT. As, of course, they would. 
           There’s a mix of snickers and genuine curiosity.

           Ms. Rosa certainly notices the belt, but she’s not going to 
           draw any additional attention to it.

           Simon’s nerves paralyze his vocal cords. Rosa to the rescue.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        I’ll start, introduce myself. My 
                        name is Ms. Rosa. I’m a Veteran of 
                        the United States Air Force. And 
                        my favorite hobby is deep sea 
                        fishing. Maybe I should’ve joined 
                        the NAVY instead! 
                           (then, all business)
                        Simon?

           Simon looks to her, relaxes some.

                                 SIMON
                        Um. Hi Ms. Rosa. Hi, everyone. 
                        I’m...Simon. I’m from Buffalo New 
                        York...Go Sabres. My parents died 
                        in an avalanche last month. They 
                        saved up for five years to go 
                        skiing in Austria and then there 
                        was an avalanche.

           Most of the students give Simon a pitying look. Not what he 
           wants. Simon stands up a bit taller, and delivers this,
                                 SIMON
                        I live with my uncle now who is a 
                        professional golfer. And I’m a 
                        Black Belt in Taekwondo.
                           (a beat, emboldened)
                        Second Degree Black Belt.

           Ms. Rosa gives a look to the class: Be impressed.

           A KID, whose voice we might recognize as the mocking one from 
           outside, speaks up. This is JAMES.

                                 JAMES
                        Then why isn’t there a second 
                        stripe on your belt?

                                 SIMON
                        My Sensei is mailing it to me. 
                        Things got messed up after the 
                        avalanche.

                                 JAMES
                           (dubious)
                        Show us some karate.

           A chorus of “Yea!”s from the class.

                                 MS. ROSA
                           (warning)
                        James.

                                 JAMES
                        He doesn’t look like a Black Belt.

                                 THE GIRL
                        James, you look like what you 
                        sound like: A big asshole.

                                 THE OTHER GIRL
                        James. Listen to her, she’s right.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Olivia. Autumn.
                           (moving on)
                        James. There is no “look” 
                        associated with martial artists. 
                        Many of the skillsets are internal 
                        ones.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea. It’s mostly about 
                        perseverance and self-control.

           Ms. Rosa nods, impressed with Simon. James is unconvinced.
                                 JAMES
                        Whatever, I’m sorry. He just 
                        doesn’t look like a Black Belt.

           On Simon. Something rises in his eyes. Perhaps, the indignation 
           of a child who just lost his parents and now has to put up with 
           James.

           Simon WALKS OVER TO JAMES’S DESK... 

           Simon BOWS to James...

           Then, with all of his might, Simon SIDEKICKS JAMES’S DESK. 

           The desk sliiiides across the slick floor, then CAPSIZES, 
           spraying SCHOOL SUPPLIES in all directions.

           Everyone, Ms. Rosa included, and definitely James, is stunned.  

           Simon picks up a WOODEN RULER that fell out of James’s desk. 
           And Simon BREAKS IT IN HALF OVER HIS KNEE with a “Kee-HUP.”

           Simon turns to Ms. Rosa. And once again, BOWS.

           On OLIVIA (LIV) and AUTUMN: They look at Simon. They are in 
           love. Some form of it, anyway.

           EXT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Simon stands out front with Ms. Rosa. Just the two of them.

           Uncle Nate’s Wrangler rips into the lot, parks. Nate gets out.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Already dude?!

                                 MS. ROSA
                        You’re Uncle Nate. Must be.

           Nate nods cordially.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I have great respect for school 
                        teachers.

                                 SIMON
                        She’s in the Air Force too.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (impressed)
                        Sick.
                                 MS. ROSA
                        Principal Byrne, quite generously 
                        I think, decided to let this be a 
                        strike. On account of 
                        circumstances. But the 
                        responsibility is yours...
                           (then to Simon)
                        ...and yours, to see that violence 
                        of any kind is absent from our 
                        school.

                                 SIMON
                        He mocked me. He has no dignity or 
                        valor.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        There’s no excuse for retaliation.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        With respect, Ms. Rosa: As 
                        military personnel, you know that 
                        there is on occasion an excuse for 
                        retaliation. A vast portion of our 
                        tax-payer dollars are allotted to 
                        preparing for that eventuality. 
                        Like, if a terrorist “mocks” us, 
                        we retaliate. Not that Simon 
                        should sic battle-hardened canines 
                        on that little knucklehead or 
                        anything...But I think he made an 
                        effective statement. I mean, do 
                        you see that kid fucking with 
                        Simon again? 
                           (glances to Simon)
                        Frankly, I think Simon earned his 
                        respect.

           Ms. Rosa glares at Uncle Nate: Are you possibly serious?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        It was proportional, is my point.
                           (a nervous beat)
                        But your point is also well taken. 
                           (to Simon)
                        By me and my new son. 

           Simon is just embarrassed. By himself, by Uncle Nate. He grips 
           his Black Belt as though it’s a security blanket.

           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB, “THE 19TH HOLE” - LATER

           Simon sits alone at a picnic table outside the snack shack. 
           He’s off-duty, still in his school clothes. Still in his Belt. 
           A burger lies before him, uneaten. Simon looks at KARATE VIDEOS 
           on his phone.

           The GIRL, LIV, just appears, sits across from him.

                                 LIV
                        Simon, I’m Liv. You’re my hero. 

           On Simon, wondering if he heard that right.

                                 SIMON
                        ...What brings you to Tall Oaks?

                                 LIV
                        Waiting for my dad. Most of my 
                        life is waiting for my dad.

                                 SIMON
                        I get that. I’m gonna be waiting 
                        for my dad for the rest of my 
                        life.

                                 LIV
                           (a beat)
                        I can’t tell if you’re bleak or 
                        funny. I’m fine with it either 
                        way.

           Simon shrugs. He doesn’t know either.

                                 SIMON
                        You’ve been nice to me so I should 
                        tell you the truth.

           Liv is listening. Simon has a big decision to make. And he 
           makes it.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m not really a...Second Degree 
                        Black Belt. I was days away from 
                        my test but then...

                                 LIV
                        Your parents were consumed by an 
                        avalanche of snow. And rocks. Are 
                        you sad?

                                 SIMON
                        Wow, I...didn’t think about the 
                        rocks... 
                           (then, with sadness)
                        Martial artists don’t focus on 
                        sadness. Only on results.

           Liv nods. Respect.
                                 SIMON
                        Anyway I feel I have all the tools 
                        and skillsets to be a Second 
                        Degree - and I have what they call 
                        the indomitable spirit. But I 
                        couldn’t take the test.

                                 LIV
                        That’s alright, I’ll keep your 
                        secret. I’m really good at it.

           This is the closest thing to a conversation with a friend that 
           Simon has had in a very long time. 

                                 SIMON
                        You can have my burger if you 
                        want. I have a Skype training 
                        session with my Sensei from 
                        Buffalo later and I don’t want to 
                        eat until after.

           Liv believes what Simon is saying, in no small part because 
           Simon is beginning to believe it - an understandable phenomenon 
           for his age.

           Liv takes a bite of his burger. Then, mouth full,

                                 LIV
                        That’s awesome you have a Sensei. 
                        You should do the talent show, do 
                        some awesome karate stuff.

           Simon’s mind, at the thought of it, goes berserk. We should see 
           what that looks like. So we enter a brief DREAM SEQUENCE:

           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL, THEATER - DAY

           Simon, onstage, does a succession of fifteen back flips. 

           Simon breaks a dozen cinderblocks with his bare fists.

           Simon fights off Ninjas.

           Liv climbs onstage and kisses him on the cheek. 

           The entire school ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE. Ms. Rosa included.

           EXT. TALL OAKS C.C., “THE 19TH HOLE” - CONTINUOUS

                                 SIMON
                        I can take a look at the sign-up 
                        sheet.
                                 LIV
                        You should. Me and Autumn - you’ll 
                        meet Autumn, she’s hard to impress 
                        but she thinks you’re impressive - 
                        we’re gonna dissect a fetal pig 
                        onstage. It’s performance art.

           Simon thinks that’s really cool.

                                 LIV
                        We took it from science class and 
                        it’s in Autumn’s freezer - her 
                        parents are creepy hippies so it 
                        pretty much looks like the other 
                        stuff in their freezer. 

           Simon nods. That more or less makes sense to him.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Simon TRAINS along to a TAEKWONDO YOUTUBE VIDEO on Uncle Nate’s 
           computer - practicing his punches, kicks, and intensity. He has 
           a long way to go, but damn, he is trying.

           Uncle Nate enters the apartment carrying a LARGE DUFFEL BAG.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Got the goods!

           Nate drops the bag on the floor, unzips it. He takes out what 
           look like SHEETS OF CONCRETE. But they are clearly not heavy. 

           They look, close up, like what they are: PAINTED STYROFOAM.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Leslie in the golf cart garage - 
                        you owe her one.

                                 SIMON
                        I’ll send her a hand-written note.
                           (then) 
                        Are you sure this is a good idea?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Yea, it’s clever and it furthers 
                        your goal. I’m sure everyone 
                        thinks you’re awesome because you 
                        karate-chopped a bully’s personal 
                        belongings. But it doesn’t hurt to 
                        have insurance - believe me.

           Simon goes along with that logic.
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Doesn’t this shit look real? Looks 
                        real to me. Here, try one.

           Nate holds up the “concrete” slab. Simon focuses - the very 
           same focus as if it were real concrete - and PUNCHES THROUGH. 

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Fuck yea dude!

           Simon looks proud. But concern quickly takes over.

                                 SIMON
                        What if they find out it’s not 
                        real concrete?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Then...you’ll find out who your 
                        real friends are. Win win.

                                 SIMON
                        But what if no one’s my real 
                        friend?

           Nate has to think on that.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Impossible. You’ve got me.
                           (a beat)
                        Unless, of course, you kill me 
                        with a sick-ass uppercut.

           Nate gets into a FIGHTING STANCE. 

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Let’s see what you’ve learned, 
                        Grasshopper. Just be careful of 
                        Uncle Nate’s bad shoulder...

           Simon, game, gets into his fighting stance. Then goes at Uncle 
           Nate, playfully punching and kicking. 

           Nate takes the mock-beating.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Karate King, I am no match for 
                        you’re sick-ass uppercuts.

                                 SIMON
                        Beware my awesome strength!

           We FADE OUT from their “battle”, to:

           CLOSE ON: A SCALPEL tearing through the flesh of a FETAL PIG.
           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL, THEATER - DAY

           Onstage. Liv and Autumn wordlessly dissect the animal. They 
           have an iPhone trained on their operating table, STREAMING 
           VIDEO to a LARGE PROJECTOR SCREEN behind them.

           The student AUDIENCE is stunned silent. TEACHERS are seen side-
           stage, frantically whispering about if/how to stop this.

           Simon is also side-stage. On deck. He watches Liv and Autumn, 
           rapt by their “performance art”. 

           Finally, Liv places a My Little Pony BEDSHEET over the pig. 

                        LIV
                                                    AUTUMN
                  (loud)
                                               (loud)
                                           End.
              The.

           Liv and Autumn CURTSY, straight-faced, and wheel the table 
           offstage. Simon is pretty much the only one to applaud.

           As the girls pass him,

                                 SIMON
                        That felt...important.

                                 AUTUMN
                           (genuine)
                        Thank you.

           Liv smiles at him.

                                 TEACHER (ON STAGE)
                        Next, please welcome Simon 
                        Paluska. Who will be 
                        demonstrating...
                           (reads a card)
                        “Focus, strength and...concrete-
                        breaking with fists”.

           The students MURMUR. The Teacher kind of shrugs, steps aside.

           Simon walks out ONSTAGE. In his school clothes, and Black Belt. 
           A CURTAIN rises behind him, revealing: FIVE “CONCRETE” SLABS, 
           held up on either side by several stacked milk crates.

           Simon tenuously approaches a MICROPHONE. All eyes on him. Simon  
           puffs his chest, and recites this CREED from memory:

                                 SIMON
                        ”I come to you in peace and 
                        brotherhood for I have no weapons. 
                            (MORE)
                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        But should I be forced to defend 
                        myself, my principles or my honor; 
                        should it be a matter of right or 
                        wrong; then here are my weapons: 
                        My empty hands and feet.”
                           (then, somewhat timidly)
                        ...As we say in karate.
                           (quickly)
                        Today I will break through five 
                        reinforced concrete slabs using 
                        only my strength, spirit, 
                        determination...and fists.

           Simon walks behind his set-up. 

           The student audience is rapt. Ms. Rosa is...tolerating this.

           Simon focuses. 

           Simon breathes.

           Simon puts his hands to the slabs, as if feeling their energy.

           Simon RAISES HIS FISTED ARM.

                                 SIMON
                        Kee-HUP!

           BAM. Simon pulverizes the slabs. 

           The students go NUTS. Really, not far off from the dream-
           sequence reaction. Save for the Liv kiss; that’s not happening.

           Simon solemnly BOWS to the audience. 

           Then, amidst applause, Simon starts loading the broken slabs 
           into Uncle Nate’s big duffel bag. He makes a real show out of 
           how “heavy” it all is. As the APPLAUSE continues...

           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - DAY

           Simon eats lunch alone. That applause - it was still no match 
           for the preset social patterns of a middle school.

           Until...Liv and Autumn alight upon his table.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Can we sit?

           Simon gestures, “please”.
                                 LIV
                        Everyone’s talking about your

                                 SIMON
                        Not to me they’re not.

                                 AUTUMN
                        We are.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea that’s true.
                           (then)
                        I think your talent was 
                        misunderstood.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I think it was perfectly 
                        understood. It was meant to be 
                        uncomfortable. And people were 
                        uncomfortable.

                                 SIMON
                        I wasn’t. I’ve seen someone’s 
                        shin-bone get kicked out of their 
                        shin by a Flying Roundhouse Kick.

           The girls exchange the briefest glance: He’s the real deal.

                        You’re strong for a kid.

                        Life--

                                 LIV
                        --has made a man of you. I know. 
                        And I told Autumn.

           Autumn takes a baby carrot off of Simon’s plate. Eats it.

                                 LIV
                        So look: Me and Autumn are going 
                        on an epic mission, and we want 
                        you to join us.

           Autumn, wisely, knows to speak Simon’s language:

                                 AUTUMN
                        It’s a noble mission. Epic and 
                        noble.

           Simon is all ears.
                                 SIMON
                        What is it?

                                 LIV
                        We’re gonna steal a watch. It’s 
                        worth like forty grand.

                                 SIMON
                        Wow...must be an Apple watch.

                                 LIV
                        No, it’s made of gold and it’s 
                        important. My grandpa gave it to 
                        my older brother when he died--

                                 AUTUMN
                           (clarifying)

                        Yea and my brother is a scumbag 
                        and he doesn’t deserve it. He 
                        doesn’t deserve a forty grand 
                        watch.

           On Simon, digesting this all.

                                 LIV
                        The house my brother lives 
                        in...they have expensive DJ 
                        equipment and dirtbikes and maybe 
                        a gun. We could use a Black Belt 
                        around.

                                 AUTUMN
                        In case things get hairy. Which 
                        they will.

           Simon sweats. This scenario would be frightening even if he 
           were a Black Belt.

                                 SIMON
                        They always do. That’s what I 
                        train for. 
                           (then, needs to know)
                        Why would you want forty grand?

                        build a log cabin and live off the 
                        land.

                        your own karate dojo there.

           Simon’s DNA, at the thought of all of this, pretty much 
           reconfigures before our eyes - the freedom, the friends, who 
           are girls. The dojo. He’s being offered everything.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Think about it, k?

                                 LIV
                        But think quick. Their stupid 
                        “album release party” is next week 
                        and that’s when this goes down.
                           (then, disgusted)
                        It’s not even an album. They just 
                        make noise and want people to 
                        listen to it.

           Simon, his mind everywhere, can only nod. 

           Liv and Autumn stand, and depart.

           A look gradually emerges on Simon’s face. He is ALL. IN.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S WRANGLER, DRIVING - DAY

           Nate drives, Becca shotgun. Simon in the back. Nate and Becca 
           hold hands - it’s one of their good moments.

           Simon takes in the scenery, most of which is still new to him.

           Becca fishes through her purse. She hands Simon a TWENTY.

                                 BECCA
                        Here ya go honey. For lunch.

                                 SIMON
                           (touched)
                        Oh. Wow. Thank you. I’ll treat my 
                        friends too if that’s okay.

                                 BECCA
                        You are a true gentleman.
                           (playing along)
                        Befitting your station as a Keeper 
                        of the Belt.

           Then, to Nate, with some judgement,

                                 BECCA
                        Isn’t he a gentleman?
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You just made him rich. He can 
                        afford to be.

           Becca punches Nate’s thigh, more-or-less playfully.

           Nate pulls into the parking lot of a SHOPPING MALL.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Liv and Autumn stand outside an ARMANI EXCHANGE store. Simon 
           approaches.

                                 AUTUMN
                        You made the right decision.

                           (unsure)
                        I know. 
                           (looks around)
                        This place is cool - the mall by 
                        us was closed. It’s where people 
                        buy drugs now. And take them.

                                 AUTUMN

                        But what else is there to do?

                        like that. Aside from the belt, 
                        obviously. 

                                 AUTUMN
                        Definitely wear the belt so that 
                        nobody fucks with us.

                                 SIMON
                        The belt is a warning. A fair one.
                           (then)
                        I apologize for the rest of my

                        And no plaid shirts. 

           INT. ARMANI EXCHANGE - DAY

           Simon stands in the Men’s section. He is lost here, and looks 
           it. The girls are visible in b.g. looking at women’s clothes.

           A SALESPERSON approaches Simon.

                                 SALESPERSON
                        That belt is chic.

                                 SIMON
                        Oh. Thank you.

                                 SALESPERSON
                        Where’d you get it, if you don’t 
                        mind me asking?

                                 SIMON
                        It was...bestowed to me. By my 
                        Sensei.

                                 SALESPERSON
                        Ooh it’s a karate belt. I see it 
                        now.
                           (almost to herself)
                        That would look great with like, a 
                        blouse? Like a Kill Bill kinda 
                        look? Damn, I should run this up 
                        the pole to Giorgio.

           Liv and Autumn approach, each with a few clothing items.

                                 LIV

           On Liv and Autumn. They might not agree.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM, ARMANI EXCHANGE - DAY

           Simon stands alone before the mirror in a skin-tight black t-
           shirt with a bedazzled “A/X” across the chest.
           Simon hates it. Then he puts his Belt on. Kinda likes it now...

                                 LIV (O.S.)
                        How does it look?

                                 AUTUMN (O.S.)
                        Fashion show, dude!

                                 SIMON
                        I think it might work.

           Autumn and Liv ENTER THE DRESSING ROOM. They’re still holding 
           their items.

                                 SIMON
                        Are you allowed in here?

                                 LIV
                        We’re practically family.

           Simon has no time to process that before she demands:

                                 LIV
                        Take the shirt off.

                                 SIMON
                        Can you..leave first?

                                 AUTUMN
                        No, this has to be fast.

           Simon does as told, takes the shirt off. He feels very naked.

           Liv removes a PAIR OF SCISSORS from her purse. She cuts the 
           fabric around the SECURITY SENSOR, snipping it off.

           Simon’s eyes go wide. The following is HUSHED:

                                 LIV
                        Holes in clothes are cool anyway.

                                 SIMON
                        I have money!

                                 AUTUMN
                        How much?

                                 SIMON
                        Twenty dollars.

                                 AUTUMN
                           (looks at price tag)
                        This is eighty-nine dollars. You 
                        have expensive taste.
                                 SIMON
                        For a t-shirt? That’s not 
                        possible.

                                 LIV
                        Go distract the sales lady. We’ll 
                        take care of the rest.

           Simon, to protect his own neck as much as anything, puts his 
           plaid button-down back on and hustles out.

           INT. ARMANI EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Salesperson is staring into her phone. She sees Simon.

                                 SALESPERSON
                        How’d that shirt work out?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s not expensive enough.
                           (then, quickly)
                        Do you want to try my belt on?

           Her eyes light up.

                                 SALESPERSON
                        Do I.

           Simon removes his belt. He solemnly FOLDS IT - then he BOWS and 
           hands it to the Salesperson.

           The Salesperson awkwardly BOWS to receive it. Then she ties it 
           on herself. Looks in a mirror. 

                                 SALESPERSON
                           (loves it)
                        Damn.

           Simon sees Liv and Autumn slip out of the store.

                                 SIMON
                           (quickly)
                        All it takes is strength and 
                        determination. And you can have 
                        your own.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Simon, his Belt back on, RUNS. Catches up with Liv and Autumn.

           Autumn opens her large purse, shows Simon the bounty.
           There’s a thrill coursing through them. Simon included.

           MUSIC UP over the following scene. A song that captures the 
           feeling of being thirteen and happy. So, a song that Simon 
           would just now be absorbing for the first time.

           The kids race to the exit, and vanish from the mall.

           INT. PIZZA PLACE - DAY

           Simon pays for three slices of pizza and three sodas.

           He balances it all on a tray, brings it to Liv and Autumn who 
           wait at a booth.

           The three kids just tear into the food. There’s an easiness 
           about this unit. 

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Simon, Liv and Autumn get out of an Uber. Approach the house. 
           Nice house. Needs landscaping - no one’s tending to that. 

                                 AUTUMN
                           (to Simon)
                        Her dad sleeps between patients. 
                        Straight upstairs ok?

           Liv draws no more attention to that. She takes out keys and 
           opens the front door.

           INT. LIV’S HOUSE - DAY

           They pad upstairs.

                                 LIV’S DAD (O.S.)
                        Liv?

           Liv ignores him, continues up. Dad does not call out again.

           INT. LIV’S ROOM - DAY

           Liv closes the door, firmly, behind them. Autumn collapses onto 
           Liv’s bed, like it’s her own.

           The room is messy. To the extent we can glean this: it’s a 
           result of an active kid, not of laziness. A giant poster of 
           Green Day’s “Dookie” album cover serves as a centerpiece.

           This is the first girl’s room Simon has ever been in. It shows.
                                 SIMON
                        Nice framing job on that artwork.

                                 LIV
                           (a beat)
                        I’ve never looked at the frame.

                                 SIMON
                        Let me tell you, it’s not easy to 
                        get the joints that seamless on a 
                        piece as large as that.

                                 AUTUMN
                           (considers)
                        I always assumed frames just 
                        happen.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea. You shouldn’t, they’re hard 
                        to make.

           Simon has to actively draw his mind away from his parents, back 
           to the present. He sits, awkwardly, on Liv’s desk chair. On the 
           edge of it.

           Autumn dumps their stolen clothes out on the bed.

                                 LIV
                        Okay. First let’s try on our 
                        clothes. Then let’s plan our 
                        heist.

                                 SIMON
                           (uneasy)
                        I thought you said it was a 
                        mission.

                        A mission to heist something.

                                 LIV
                        Look, Simon, you don’t have to 
                        come with us to Montana. We can 
                        farm wheat and pomegranates with 
                        or without you. 

                                 SIMON
                        No I--

                                 AUTUMN
                        Pomegranates? We never discussed 
                        that.
                                 LIV
                        If the soil allows it. Why not?

           On Autumn: “Yea I guess why not”. It’s clear, this fantasy is a 
           longstanding one, and detailed.

                                 SIMON
                        I want to come.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Now that you mention it, why do 
                        you want to come?
                           (to Liv)
                        We should know why. Otherwise he 
                        might just be dead weight.

           This pushes a button.

                                 SIMON
                        I am not dead weight. I’m capable, 
                        and I can fend off thieves.

                                 LIV
                        Thieves...like us?

                        We’re not thieves, Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        I didn’t mean you. I meant 
                        invaders, on the farm.
                           (then)
                        But you did steal clothes.

                        From a corporation. Who cares? Do 
                        you know how much clothes get 
                        wasted every year and end up 
                        choking fish in the ocean? I read 
                        about it on Vulture.

           Simon tries to shift course, back to the positive.

                                 SIMON
                        ...I didn’t know about wasted 
                        clothes. Or the fish.
                           (then)
                        Should we try them on?

           The girls are glad to have him back onboard.

                                 LIV
                        Yes.

                        you have to turn your back to us. 
                        Those are the rules.

                                 SIMON
                        I know the rules. Many Black Belts 
                        are women. I know the rules.

           Simon turns away from them. They all strip to their underwear, 
           and put on their new clothes.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Okay.

           Simon turns back around. The girls in their all-black Armani 
           Exchange duds.

           Liv and Autumn look at Simon. And try not to laugh.

                                 SIMON
                        What?

           Simon looks down. The HOLE that Liv cut is directly around his 
           bellybutton. Simon quickly covers it with his hand.

                                 SIMON
                        Great. Great...great.

                           (stifling laughter)
                        No! It’s cool! My brother’s friend 
                        was an Israeli soldier and he 
                        pretty much only wears this brand. 
                        Even with holes.

                        ...Maybe the belt will cover it?

           Simon ties on his Black Belt. It does not cover it.

                                 SIMON
                        Great.

                           (sincere)
                        Simon. No one wears clothes with 
                        their bellybutton showing. Only 
                        you do. How original is that?

           Simon, seemingly, has no choice but to accept that reasoning.
                                 LIV
                        K, let’s look at the house on 
                        Google. I only know some of its 
                        weak points but we should know all 
                        of them.

           Liv goes to her desk and opens her laptop. Enters an address, 
           pulls up the Satellite View.

           Autumn follows her over to the desk.

                                 AUTUMN
                           (back, to Simon)
                        If this were an enemy fortress and 
                        you were a ninja - which you are - 
                        where would you infiltrate the 
                        fortress?

           Simon, however dubious of this all, likes having his opinion 
           valued. He approaches and takes a close look at the house.

           Then, as though summoning one of his kung fu movies,

                                 SIMON
                        There are many vulnerabilities.

                        They will never see us coming.

           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Students are lined up, PICKING TEAMS for dodgeball. James is 
           one of the captains.

           Only Simon and one other KID remain.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll take...Boris. Can’t pass up 
                        the chance to throw my balls at 
                        the Karate Kid’s face.

           Boris heads over to James. Leaving Simon, last. And nervous.

           Instead of joining the other team, Simon approaches the GYM 
           TEACHER. Liv and Autumn look on.

                                 SIMON
                        Um, Mr. Fleet?

                                 MR. FLEET
                        What’s up.
                                 SIMON
                           (quietly)
                        I have a note from my Uncle. That 
                        I don’t have to do gym because I 
                        train with my Sensei after school 
                        every day and it exempts me. My 
                        doctor says I might get 
                        overexerted if I do both.

           Simon produces the NOTE from his pocket. Mr. Fleet reads it.

                                 MR. FLEET
                        That’s a valid note. Whether I 
                        like it or not.

           Mr. Fleet heads off to get the dodgeballs. James approaches.

                                 JAMES
                        Scared of having my balls in your 
                        face?

                                 SIMON
                           (evenly)
                        No.

           James doesn’t know where to take it from there. Except,

                                 JAMES
                        If you kick my desk one more time, 
                        I will come to your house and 
                        screw your favorite pet. I don’t 
                        care if you are a ninja.

                                 SIMON
                        I don’t have a pet.

                                 JAMES
                        I’ll get you one. From the pound. 
                        And then I’ll come to your house, 
                        and I’ll sc--

           BLAM. Simon SIDEKICKS JAMES IN THE THIGH. James collapses, 
           moaning, clutching his thigh.

           Simon assumes a polished fighting stance. “Oh shit!”s bubble up 
           from the surrounding kids. Mr. Fleet marches back over.

           On: Liv and Autumn, eyes on Simon. It’s like they just 
           witnessed the moon landing. 

                                                                   CUT TO:
           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Simon sits in the waiting area by a very busy RECEPTIONIST. 

           Ms. Rosa enters from the hallway.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Cindy I’ll take care of this.

           Cindy, on the phone, gives a thumbs up.

           INT. MS. ROSA’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Just Simon and Ms. Rosa. Simon sits in his desk. Ms. Rosa leans 
           against hers.

           Simon notes the PHOTO OF A TODDLER on her desk.

                                 SIMON
                        Is that your daughter? She looks 
                        smart.

           Ms. Rosa nods. Stays on track.

           Ms. Rosa takes out her LUNCH COOLER. Removes a NECTARINE. 
           Places the fruit on her desk. Draws no further attention to it.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        I’m worried about you Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        Wouldn’t you be more worried if I 
                        didn’t stand up for myself?

                                 MS. ROSA
                        It’s how you do so.

                                 SIMON
                        As I told everyone at the talent 
                        show, through a microphone: 
                        “Should I be forced to defend 
                        myself, my principles or my honor; 
                        should it be a matter of right or 
                        wrong”--

                                 MS. ROSA
                           (matter-of-fact)
                        I know you’re not a Black Belt.

           The way she said it: He knows she knows. It puts him back in 
           his seat. Still, he continues on defense.
                                 SIMON
                        I’m not showy about it. That might 
                        be why you have that 
                        misconception.

           Ms. Rosa picks up the NECTARINE. 

           She tosses it up high, elegantly, like a tennis serve...

           ...and at its APEX, she does a JUMPING-HIGH-KICK, connecting 
           with the nectarine MID-AIR. The nectarine EXPLODES as though it 
           were detonated internally. 

           Nectarine guts fly everywhere, including onto Simon’s face. 
           Simon is awe-struck.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Game recognize game. And game 
                        recognize...not.
                           (then)
                        Krav Maga. There’s a lot of down-
                        time in the military and I’m not 
                        one to let time go to waste.

           Simon does not have access to language at the moment. Ms. Rosa 
           hands him a paper towel. He wipes the fruit off his face.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Look, Simon...You have the heart 
                        of a Black Belt. But if you kick 
                        any more students, or any more 
                        school property...then it will be 
                        a problem for both of us.
                           (then)
                        Because I like having you around.

           On Simon. He accepts the warning.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Why don’t you take karate lessons? 
                        Earn the belt? I know you can do 
                        it.

                                 SIMON
                        I can...but I can’t. My parents 
                        took out loans against their life 
                        insurance before they drowned in 
                        snow...so I have to have a job. 
                           (a beat)
                        But I’m using the internet to 
                        study and learn.

           Ms. Rosa respects his effort. She’s about to speak, then -
                                 SIMON
                        Is there a farmer’s market around 
                        here? I’d like to work on jump-
                        high-kicking fruit, just like you.

           On Ms. Rosa. She has her hands full with this kid.

           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB, CLUBHOUSE - DUSK

           Simon cleans golf clubs. Drudgery. In the b.g., Liv and Autumn 
           approach.

                                 LIV
                        Hey.

                                 AUTUMN
                        James cried after you left. Wish 
                        you saw it.

                                 SIMON
                        I was just defending my honor.

                                 AUTUMN
                        James has no honor.

                                 SIMON
                        That’s probably what he was crying 
                        about.

                                 LIV
                        We’re gonna go stake out the 
                        house. It’s actually off the golf 
                        course. Eleventh hole. 

                                 AUTUMN
                        I brought binoculars. And kombucha 
                        - my dad unfortunately makes it.

                                 LIV
                        Then afterward I thought we could 
                        get frozen yogurt and talk about 
                        our responsibilities in Montana.

                                 AUTUMN
                        The cabin should have skylights. 
                        So we can have a lot of 
                        houseplants. 

                                 LIV
                        I was thinking that too. And we 
                        can dig a pool. And probably build 
                        a ping-pong/pool table combo.
           They look at Simon expectantly. He’s torn between the 
           unappealing crime stake-out, and the very appealing Montana 
           escape. Simon glances to the golf clubs.

                                 SIMON
                        Let me just finish this pitching 
                        wedge.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Simon, Liv and Autumn wade through dense brush.

           E.D.M. MUSIC can be heard, thumping. It GROWS as they near.

           Finally, the HOUSE is in view. An ultra-modern monstrosity. 

                                 SIMON
                        Wow. Your brother is rich.

                                 LIV
                        He’s a houseguest. That’s all 
                        he’ll ever be.

           Autumn takes out her BINOCULARS. We ENTER THAT POV:

           Imagine one of those TIKTOK houses. That’s what’s going on 
           here. Young people drinking from Solo cups on balconies.

           Exit binocular POV.

                                 SIMON
                        I thought you said the party is 
                        next week.

                                 LIV
                        It is. This isn’t a party...this 
                        is just how they live.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I see Cory’s room.

           Autumn hands the binocs to Liv.

                                 LIV
                        He used to use the safe as a 
                        nightstand because he doesn’t 
                        understand furniture. But it might 
                        be in his closet now. Or somewhere 
                        else in the house, which would 
                        suck.

           Simon’s attention is on both of their ARMS. The TATTOOS.
                                 SIMON
                        Hey can I ask a question I’ve been 
                        wondering?

           The girls look to him.

                                 SIMON
                        The propeller on your arms. Is it 
                        a plane propeller or a boat 
                        propeller?

                        LIV
                                                    AUTUMN
                                           Boat.
              Plane.

           Liv and Autumn lock eyes with one another. They’re out of step, 
           and it’s a startling realization. They try to move right on.

                                 AUTUMN
                        ...It can be either. That’s why 
                        it’s a great tattoo. That’s why we 
                        spent hours sticking sewing 
                        needles in our skin.

           Liv, clearly, is more upset about it though.

                                 LIV
                        We have to get up to his balcony 
                        and get eyes on the safe. I’ll 
                        make sure there’s no one lurking. 
                        Wait here.

           Liv crouch-runs toward the house. Autumn’s mind still on the 
           tattoo issue. Simon regrets raising it.

                                 AUTUMN
                           (confiding)
                        I wanted to move to an island. 
                        That’s why it’s a boat.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea...There are no islands in 
                        Montana. Or maybe there are? 
                        Within lakes?

                                 AUTUMN
                        Her mom moved to Montana when she 
                        lost her mind and her dad 
                        prescribed her a lot of pills that 
                        just made everything worse. We 
                        stole a pill once and tried it - 
                        it does make everything worse.
                           (then)
                        But we’re still gonna go...Right?
           Simon nods. While also realizing that their fantasy has some 
           real shit anchored to it.

                                 SIMON
                        Won’t your parents miss you?

                                 AUTUMN
                           (shrugs)
                        They’re pot farmers who never 
                        wanted kids. They’ll understand.
                           (then)
                        Where is she?

           A thought occurs to Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        Maybe it’s a seaplane.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Huh?

                                 SIMON
                        Your propellers. Could be a 
                        seaplane. A plane and a boat.

           Autumn is, in fact, mightily comforted by that thought. Like 
           she and Liv are back together again.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Yea. I guess that’s what it is.

           Simon feels like he should confide something now.

                                 SIMON
                        My uncle is addicted to gambling. 
                        He’s pretty good at it and he’s 
                        saving for an engagement ring 
                        but--

                                 LIV (O.S.)
                           (hushed)
                        All clear.

           Autumn looks to Simon. No time now to address his issue. Simon 
           and Autumn rush out toward Liv.

           EXT. “THE DJ HOUSE” - NIGHT

           Simon, Liv and Autumn stay low, approach one side of the house.

           They speak in WHISPERS.
                                 SIMON
                        How will you get into the safe? Is 
                        the combo your birthday or 
                        something?

                                 LIV
                           (as if)
                        No.

                                 AUTUMN
                        It’s probably Daft Punk’s 
                        birthday.

                                 LIV
                        We’re gonna take the safe and 
                        figure it out from there. 
                           (then)
                        Good thing you have freak ninja 
                        strength to carry it.

           On Simon. Yes. Good thing...

           They’re against the side of the house. Under a second-floor 
           BALCONY. There is IVY-COVERED LATTICEWORK leading up the side 
           of the house.

                                 LIV
                        We just need to make sure the 
                        safe’s still in there. Then we can 
                        bounce.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I’ll go.

                                 SIMON
                        No. It might be necessary to 
                        disable someone inside with a 
                        Clinch Hold...I’ve been 
                        specifically practicing that Hold. 
                        I’ll go.

           The girls trust Simon. His skills. Their appreciation shows.

           Simon begins to ascend the latticework. He makes it up to the 
           BALCONY. 

           WITH SIMON. He looks in the room. Lights on, but unoccupied.

           Simon shoots Liv and Autumn a thumbs-up.

           Simon carefully opens the sliding glass door. Slips inside.
           INT. CORY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Simon scans around: Various recording equipment. A bong that’s 
           taller than Simon. A NITROUS OXIDE TANK. But NO SAFE.

           Simon goes to a CLOSET DOOR. Opens it, but it’s in fact a 
           BATHROOM, and inside is -

           WOOF WOOF WOOF a ROTTWEILER BOUNDS OUT OF THE BATHROOM. Stops 
           just short of attacking Simon. Simon freezes.

           The dog SNARLS, TEETH BARED. It takes a step toward Simon. 
           Simon is terrified, but tries to placate the beast.

                                 SIMON
                        I...love...dogs.....they are...all 
                        lovable...

           The dog steps forward. 

                                 SIMON
                        ...St. Bernards even tried to save 
                        my parents. I...don’t blame them 
                        that they couldn’t...

           The dog: another step, its bloodlust growing. 

           Simon notices, right beside him, the NITROUS TANK.

                                 SIMON
                        ...If I blast this helium in your 
                        open mouth, it’s possible you’ll 
                        float right out the window. God 
                        help you if you’re high up when it 
                        wears off.

           The dog takes another step.

           Simon, slowwwwwly, puts his hand on the Nitrous tank’s KNOB. 
           About to turn it on full-blast. Then, realizes,

                                 SIMON
                        I’d rather die than hurt you. 

           Simon BOLTS BACK TO THE BALCONY, 

           Tries to SLIDE THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND HIM but the dog SLIPS 
           THROUGH, BARKING WILDLY, 

           Simon climbs over the edge, trying to reach the latticework, 
           but now he’s HANGING BY HIS FINGERTIPS. 

           The dog BITES HIS ARM.
           And

           Simon

           Drops 

           THUD.

           Liv and Autumn rush to him. Simon doing all he can to keep from 
           crying. His arm GUSHING BLOOD. 

                                 SIMON
                           (weak)
                        The safe...it’s in the 
                        bathroom...where the animal lives.

           The DOG CONTINUES its BLOODTHIRSTY BARKING.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who the fuck is there.

                                 LIV
                        Go. Go go go.

           The girls pick Simon up onto his feet. They bolt into the 
           woods. 

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

           Simon, Autumn and Liv emerge onto a deserted GOLF GREEN. 

           The bright moon illuminates the lush course. It would be a 
           beautiful scene, were Simon not bleeding profusely.

           Simon is panicked. Liv and Autumn are CHARGED UP. Laughing 
           giddily.

                                 SIMON
                        What the hell is funny?

           The girls pull back on the laughs.

                                 LIV
                        We have to put pressure on your 
                        arm. Give me your belt.

                                 SIMON
                        No!

                                 AUTUMN
                        Her dad’s a psychiatrist. A man of 
                        medicine. Listen to her.
                                 LIV
                        Do you want to LOSE the arm? How 
                        many one-armed karate guys do you 
                        know?

           Simon, resigned, and in agony, takes off his Belt.

           Liv carefully wraps it around his wound. Then PULLS IT TIGHT.

                                 SIMON
                        Fuck! Fuck that!

                                 AUTUMN
                           (sincere)
                        Nice tourniquet, Liv. Good to know 
                        you can do that in case we have 
                        any construction equipment 
                        accidents at the cabin.

           Simon looks to his arm. The blood soaking through, ruining his 
           Black Belt. He LOSES HIS SHIT.

                                 SIMON
                        You’re not going to build a cabin. 
                        No one will even sell you power 
                        tools. You have to be 18.

           The girls did not expect that from him. It puts them on their 
           heels. But that surprise turns...to anger.

                                 LIV
                        Fuck you, Simon.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I own power tools. That’s how 
                        we’re gonna break open the safe.

                                 SIMON
                        Stop stealing stuff! It’s not 
                        honorable.

                                 LIV
                        I only steal what’s mine.

                                 SIMON
                        I was trained in the way of 
                        integrity and honor. Not crime.

                                 LIV
                        You’re a Black Belt. You’re a 
                        fighter!
                                 SIMON
                        Karate’s about defense, not 
                        offense. You don’t go looking for 
                        trouble.

           Liv, standing beside a SAND TRAP, reaches down and grabs and 
           handful of SAND. She THROWS IT IN SIMON’S FACE.

           Simon is stunned. He spits sand, wipes it from his eyes.

           Liv’s voice trembles:

                                 LIV
                        I have spent my whole life on 
                        defense. Autumn too. And we’re 
                        done with that.

                                 AUTUMN
                        We’re on motherfucking offense 
                        now. You can like it or not.

           Liv walks away, toward the cart path. Autumn follows her. 

           Leaving Simon, alone on the green.

           Simon watches as, moonlit, Liv and Autumn fade from view.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Uncle Nate has obscure European Tour golf tournaments on both 
           TVs. He’s glued to his phone, frantically texting. Not happy.

           Simon enters, his face tear-streaked.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (distracted)
                        How was frozen yogurt.

                                 SIMON
                        Hi.

           Simon beeline’s to the bathroom, shuts the door.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Simon gingerly unwraps the Belt. Pain. The deep TEETH MARKS on 
           his arm start gurgling blood. 

           Simon wraps a towel tightly around his arm... 

           He secures the towel with a whole roll of dental floss... 
           And starts washing his Belt in the sink. 

           Bloody water circles the drain. 

           The Belt is now a faded, muddy black/red. 

           Simon chokes back tears.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Simon THROWS THE BLOODY, WET BLACK BELT IN HIS CLOSET.

           Simon lies on his bed. Holds his arm tight. And silently cries.

           MUSIC UP - appropriate to Simon’s current devastation - as we 
           enter a MONTAGE of the days that follow:

           EXT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           By the DUMPSTERS. Simon has a pile of assorted garbage-plywood.  
           His arm is now properly bandaged.

           Simon holds pieces of plywood - attempts to KARATE CHOP through 
           them. With limited success.

           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Simon sits on the bleachers while the rest of the kids play 
           dodgeball. Liv nor Autumn will meet his eyes.

           James avoids his gaze too, but that’s straight up out of fear.

           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB, CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Simon washes clubs. Nate and Becca are visible in b.g. by the 
           Caddy Pagoda, quietly ARGUING. Simon looks, then looks away.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Simon lies in bed, his portable DVD player on his chest, 
           vacantly watching Bruce Lee’s “FIST OF FURY”.

           END MONTAGE/MUSIC.

           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Simon trudges through the hallway, crowded with socializing 
           students. Liv and Autumn amongst them.
                                 MS. ROSA (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Simon turns. 

           INT. MS. ROSA’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Just the two of them. Evident concern on Ms. Rosa’s face.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        I noticed a change of wardrobe--

                                 SIMON
                        The belt was destroyed by blood.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        ...Should I be concerned? Further 
                        concerned?

                                 SIMON
                        No. I was training so hard that I 
                        bled. That means I’m doing it 
                        right.

           Ms. Rosa reads him, closely.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        You’ll have to tell me what’s 
                        wrong if I’m going to do anything 
                        to help you with it. 

           On Simon, eyes down.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Or do you not want the advice of a 
                        Third Degree Black Belt.

           Simon looks up at her, in awe. Third Degree. It’s as though 
           she’s just revealed herself to be Captain Marvel.

           But Simon still won’t talk. Ms. Rosa takes another NECTARINE 
           from her lunch cooler. 

           She places it on Simon’s desk. Gives him an encouraging nod. 
           Simon tries for a moment to resist the bait. But he can’t.

           Simon stands. Focuses. He tosses up the nectarine, and kicks. 
           Total whiff. 

           Ms. Rosa picks it back up, gives it to him.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        It’s like..hockey. 
                            (MORE)
                                 MS. ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Go where the puck is going to be. 
                        Not where it is.

           Simon registers that. He tries again. CONTACT. The nectarine 
           flies against the wall. 

           No fruit-explosion; nothing nearly as badass as Ms. Rosa. But 
           he’s also not a Third Degree Krav Maga Black Belt. He’s pleased 
           nonetheless, and so is Ms. Rosa. 

           Simon, now, opens up.

                                 SIMON
                        My friends don’t share my values.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        And what would those be? Your 
                        values...

                                 SIMON
                        Courtesy. Discipline. Self-
                        control.

                                 MS. ROSA
                           (deep inhale)
                        Simon, man...you heard those words 
                        from karate movies and demo 
                        videos. But you’re thirteen and 
                        still learning what they actually 
                        mean. Just like your friends.
                           (then)
                        Here’s a value, one I know you can 
                        nail: compassion. It’s really hard 
                        being your age. So unless your 
                        friends are injuring themselves or 
                        others...maybe give them a break. 
                        And then, maybe, they’ll give you 
                        one back.

           That makes a lot of sense to Simon. He walks over and picks up 
           the dirty, dented nectarine, goes to hand it back to Ms. Rosa.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        You can throw that out. 
                           (then)
                        The bus is waiting. You excited? 
                        Ever been to the aquarium?

                                 SIMON
                           (a beat)
                        I’ve never even been to the ocean.
           EXT./INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

           Simon tentatively steps onto the bus. A cacophony of middle-
           schoolers amped up for a FIELD TRIP.

           Simon Forrest-Gumps-it down the aisle, all seats taken. He 
           nears Liv and Autumn.

                                 SIMON
                        Hi.

           Liv is staring at her phone. There seems to even be some 
           tension between Liv and Autumn.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Don’t worry. We won’t bother you.

                                 SIMON
                        That’s not--

                                 BUS DRIVER (intercom)
                        Everyone. Take your seat.

           Simon has to continue on. The only open seat is directly BEHIND 
           JAMES. Great.

           Simon sits. The bus lurches into motion.

           Simon unzips his backpack and removes a DVD CASE. He taps James 
           on the shoulder. James turns back.

                                 JAMES
                        What.

                                 SIMON
                        I wanted to lend you this. It’s an 
                        awesome kung fu movie. You’ll like 
                        it but you’ll also learn from it. 
                        So that next time it’s a fair 
                        fight.

           James, intrigued, accepts the DVD.

                                 SIMON
                        The fairest fight is the one that 
                        is avoided...
                           (then)
                        That’s from the movie.

           EXT. AQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC - DAY

           Establishing. The kids pour from the bus.
           INT. AQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC - DAY

           Students are split into several smaller GROUPS, each led by a 
           TOUR GUIDE.

           WITH SIMON. Feeling all alone with his group of rando students. 
           He glances over toward Autumn and Liv’s group.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        ...why we call them Sea Jellies 
                        and not Jellyfish. Fish anatomy is 
                        centered around a backbone, while 
                        the Sea Jelly is a dome-shaped 
                        invertebrate...

           The students vacantly nod along.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        At the end of our tour, we’ll 
                        visit the “please touch” Manta Ray 
                        tank. You can pet them!

           On the students: Now we’re talking!

           Simon’s group continues on. They pass the GIFT SHOP.

           On Simon. And his new IDEA. Simon surreptitiously slips away 
           from the group. And enters,

           INT. AQUARIUM GIFT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Simon browses around. Shark teeth. Sand Dollars. Stuffed animal 
           sea creatures. 

           He stops at a JEWELRY CASE - necklaces and such made with 
           pieces of coral, sea glass, etc. Simon, it’s clear, is shopping 
           for a girl. Or as is the case, girls.

           Then, from the corner of his eye, he spots: A shelf with SMALL 
           CERAMIC FIGURINES of SEA-PLANES. He has found the perfect gift, 
           and it shows on his face.

           Simon picks one up, spins the working PROPELLER. Pleased. Then 
           he looks at the PRICE TAG. Forty dollars each!

           Simon is not leaving without these sea-planes. He looks around, 
           tracks the EMPLOYEES. His heart goes staccato. 

           Simon STUFFS TWO SEA-PLANES IN HIS BACKPACK.

           And as the Jane’s Addiction tune goes, he walks..right..through 
           the..door.
           INT. AQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC - DAY

           Simon spots Liv and Autumn’s group. He races up, blends in.

                                 SIMON
                        Liv, Autumn, hi.

                                 LIV
                           (re: Tour Guide)
                        We’re learning.

                                 SIMON
                        I got you something.

           He has their curiosity. Simon removes the two SEAPLANES from 
           his backpack. Gives the propellers a little spin.

                                 SIMON
                        It’s a boat. And a plane. 

                                 AUTUMN
                           (to Liv)
                        I forgot to tell you. Our 
                        propellers, they must be from 
                        seaplanes. They’re both.

           Liv softens up. It appears to be a healing moment between the 
           girls. 

           Then, a concerned look overtakes Liv’s face.

           A HAND lands on Simon’s shoulder. He turns. SECURITY GUARD.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Can I ask you to come with me?

           Simon looks to Liv and Autumn. All three of them wondering what 
           he’ll do. Then, we find out:

           Simon RUNS, CLUTCHING THE SEAPLANES. To his mind, they’re not 
           even his anymore. They belong to Liv and Autumn. He cradles the 
           planes, as if to reach the endzone would mean a Super Bowl.

           Simon is fast and nimble, weaving between AQUARIUM-GOERS. 

           The burly GUARD PURSUES.

           The STUDENTS look on in disbelief.

                                 JAMES
                           (impressed)
                        Hell yea dude...

           Simon looks back. He’s far ahead of the lumbering Guard, but 
           the Guard still pursues.
           Simon STOPS. Turns. And steps into a KARATE FIGHTING STANCE. 
           Ready to take the Guard on.

           The Guard, obviously, just keeps running toward him...

           So Simon reassesses, and CONTINUES RUNNING AWAY.

           Then...Simon begins...to GLIDE. He’s HIT A PATCH OF WATER ON 
           THE GROUND.

           Simon slides, fast, hard, RIGHT INTO THE “PLEASE TOUCH” MANTA 
           RAY TANK. CRACK.

           THE TANK’S GLASS SPIDERWEBS. AND SHATTERS.

           WATER AND MANTA RAYS POUR OUT ONTO THE FLOOR. 

           Everyone nearby SCATTERS. Some scared CHILDREN SCREAM.

           Simon is on his ass. Beside him...two broken seaplanes. And a 
           FLOPPING MANTA RAY.

           The GUARD reaches him. Simon tries to gather the seaplane 
           pieces.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Forfeit the merchandise, son.

           The Guard, trying not to slip, grabs for Simon and the 
           seaplanes. While AQUARIUM PERSONNEL rush in to rescue the Rays. 

           Simon squirms on the wet floor, AMIDST FLOPPING MANTA RAYS, 
           away from the Guard. 

           Just as the Guard is about to get his paws on Simon, Simon 
           GRABS A MANTA RAY AND SLAPS IT ACROSS THE GUARD’S FACE. 

           The Guard, stunned, steps back, the writhing Ray in his hands.

           Simon desperately gathers up the rest of the seaplane pieces...

           ...And runs for his life.

           We land on Liv and Autumn, dumbstruck. They’ve created a 
           monster. And they probably want to marry it.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Uncle Nate enters, with BECCA. Nate wears his golf clothes, 
           and, respectfully, a blazer. Becca, too, clearly just stepped 
           off the course. She holds her golf visor in her hands.

           They take seats across the desk from THE PRINCIPAL. Ms. Rosa is 
           seated adjacent the Principal’s desk.
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Hi Principal--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        You can call me Miranda.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (dubious)
                        I find that informality in 
                        authority figures is a trap. Is 
                        that what this is?

           Becca places a hand on Nate’s arm - take it easy.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        It’s just that there’s two of you 
                        and--

                                 MS. ROSA
                        There are two of you as well.

                                 BECCA
                           (courteous)
                        Hello.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Let’s get to the matter at hand. 
                        The violence. Theft. Vandalism. 

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (genuinely curious)
                        Was there profanity? I’ve been 
                        really trying to watch my mouth in 
                        front of him.

           Miranda looks to Ms. Rosa, who thinks, shakes her head, No.

                                 MIRANDA
                        No profanity.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        That’s a relief, right? To all of 
                        us?

                                 MIRANDA
                        Mr. Paluska. The aforementioned 
                        behavior was perpetrated by, 
                        seemingly, a lovely, sensitive, 
                        intelligent boy.

                                 BECCA
                        But damaged. You have to calculate 
                        that in.
                                 MS. ROSA
                        You are...

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        She’s his mother-figure.

           Nate points back and forth between himself and Becca.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        This is very complicated. But 
                        what’s crystal clear is that she’s 
                        his mother-figure. And a damn good 
                        one.

           Becca truly appreciates that. It’s safe to say that her 
           calculus on Nate just shifted somewhat, in Nate’s favor.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        The aquarium declined to pursue 
                        charges, on account of there being 
                        no Wet-Floor-Caution sign near 
                        the...wet floor. But I’m afraid 
                        disciplinary measures from the 
                        school will be necessary.

                                 MIRANDA
                        And you need to talk to him about 
                        the karate. It is a fantasy, and 
                        it’s become problematic.

           Something about that didn’t sit right with Becca. She uncrosses 
           her legs. Leans back in her chair. Reeeal comfortable. She’s 
           got a look in her eye. And then, she leans forward.

                                 BECCA
                        Ms. Rosa. Principal Miranda - I’ll 
                        call you that if I may. When I was 
                        Simon’s age, I went to this crappy 
                        day camp one summer. I was a 
                        lonely girl. A really..lonely 
                        girl. But as luck would have it, I 
                        met this other lonely girl - 
                        Cassie, I think. We were both 
                        only-children. Both pretty much 
                        poor. Both had mean, mean parents. 
                        So we decided to tell people we 
                        were sisters. Rich sisters. We 
                        didn’t want to make other kids 
                        feel bad, so we mostly just talked 
                        about our immense, generational 
                        wealth amongst ourselves. We would 
                        talk about how happy we were that 
                        Jeeves added Airheads to the candy 
                        cellar. 
                            (MORE)
                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        How our olympic-size pool could 
                        use re-tiling. How the Barbies’ 
                        hair in the Barbie Display 
                        Pavilion looked so so pretty at 
                        sunset. How our pregnant 
                        thoroughbred...Estelle...was due 
                        any day.

           Becca is reliving this, and Miranda and Ms. Rosa are right 
           there with her. Uncle Nate too. 

           On a dime, Becca is back to reality.

                                 BECCA
                        “Fantasies”, at Simon’s age, are 
                        not a problem. They’re a solution. 
                        And sometimes the only one.
                           (then)
                        We will talk to Simon about his 
                        behavior. But you stay the fuck 
                        away from his fantasy.

           Miranda and Ms. Rosa are without a response to that. 

           Becca stands - ”We’re through here”. Nate looks to Becca, 
           lovingly. He stands as well.

           Becca and Nate head for the door. Then, Becca turns back.

                                 BECCA
                        It’s fair that I add: I am a 
                        trained paralegal - my night job. 
                        And I read the fine print on the 
                        kids’ permission slip. That wet 
                        floor? That’s your 
                        problem...should we choose to make 
                        it so.
                           (then, gently)
                        So cut Simon some slack. The kid’s 
                        parents just died, ya know.

           After a beat, Nate decides it necessary to add,

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        In a fucking. Avalanche.

           Becca departs. Nate follows.

           On Miranda and Ms. Rosa. Each hoping that the other has 
           something to say.
           INT. GOLF CART GARAGE, TALL OAKS C.C. - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Simon. GREASE STAINS on his face. 

           He’s cleaning golf cart axles. Unglamorous work. In this case, 
           punishment.

           Uncle Nate enters.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        When you’re done with those I want 
                        you to hose down the lawnmowers.

                                 SIMON
                        I already did.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Then...wax them or something. Bec 
                        got you out of a real pickle, but 
                        I’d feel like a bad dad if I 
                        didn’t teach you that hitting 
                        people with stingrays is wrong.

                                 SIMON
                           (sotto)
                        Manta Ray. They don’t sting.
                           (then, fed up)
                        I was just trying to do something 
                        nice for my friends. One of them 
                        might even be my girlfriend.

           On Nate: Simon’s behavior is making more sense to him now.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Dude..you’re headed down a 
                        dangerous path if you’re willing 
                        to go all Clyde for your Bonnie.

                                 SIMON
                        What?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s 
                        sweet that you want to kick ass 
                        and commit crimes for a girl you 
                        love. But you’re at a sensitive, 
                        developmental point in your life 
                        when trouble can become habit-
                        forming. And listen to someone 
                        who’s gotten in trouble: You don’t 
                        want it.

                                 SIMON
                        What have you ever done? 
                            (MORE)
                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        All you do is bet on golf. And 
                        that’s legal. I looked it up.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You know what I’ve done?
                        I’ve...swerved off a fucking 
                        bridge. That’s what.

                                 SIMON
                        On a golf cart?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        ...No. And that’s why I bet on 
                        golf...instead of play it.

           The information settles on Simon.

                                 SIMON
                           (realizing)
                        Your shoulder.

           Nate nods.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Stay away from trouble. Okay?

           REVEAL: LIV. Standing outside the garage.

           Liv, expressionless, marches over to Simon...

           ...and FRENCH KISSES HIM.

           Liv about-faces, and disappears from the garage.

           It will take time for Simon to catch up with what he’s feeling 
           right now. But he is glowing.

           Uncle Nate’s eyes are wide. Brimming with paternal pride.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I can’t be relied on to be right 
                        all of the time. You might want to 
                        follow your heart. Like, within 
                        reason. No more crime. But, yea...

           On Simon, frozen in time. He just lost his kissing-virginity. 
           Years, likely, before he ever thought he would.

                                                                   CUT TO:
           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           MUSIC UP. This time, of the badass sort.

           Simon, wearing only his underwear, takes the blood-caked Black 
           Belt out from the closet. 

           With great seriousness, he ties it on.

           Simon opens up the screen on his DVD PLAYER. Presses PLAY. 
           Another Bruce Lee movie. 

           Simon, all focus and intensity, kung-fu’s along to the movie.

           INT. PIZZA PLACE - DAY

           Simon sits at a booth with a FULL PIZZA before him.

           Liv and Autumn enter, sit opposite him.

           Simon gestures to the pie, “Please.” The girls dig in.

                                 SIMON
                        How was school? I was suspended 
                        for the day, as you’re aware.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I know you guys kissed.

           Simon tries, in vain, not to blush.

                                 LIV
                        I kissed him. I’m not so sure he 
                        kissed me back.

                                 SIMON
                        Yes I did.

           Liv shrugs. She takes out her phone and opens ZILLOW.

                                 LIV
                        Check this out. 18-thousand 
                        dollars for four acres of land by 
                        a river. We’d still have twenty-
                        two g’s for cabin materials and 
                        toiletries and stuff.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I think we can get 45 for that 
                        watch. Doris Day supposedly owned 
                        it before your Grandpa - I heard 
                        him say that once.

           Simon gets with the vision.
                                 SIMON
                        We could fish in the river, my mom 
                        taught me how to gut fish. We’d 
                        save money on food if we just eat 
                        sushi from the river.

                                 LIV
                           (sincere)
                        That’s great.
                           (then)
                        The DJ party is in three days. 
                        That doesn’t give us much time to 
                        steal a getaway car.

           Simon puts his slice down. Did he hear that right?

                                 AUTUMN
                        Borrow a getaway car.

                                 LIV
                        I thought you knew that’s what I 
                        meant.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I didn’t know.

                                 LIV
                        Simon, you knew what I meant...

                                 SIMON
                        No...Steal and borrow are more 
                        different than similar.

                                 LIV
                        Well we have to steal it before we 
                        can give it back. That's how 
                        stealing becomes borrowing.

           On Autumn: "Yea, fair point."

           Simon goes rigid. At the thought of more “trouble”.

                                 SIMON
                        Why do we need a getaway car? We 
                        have getaway legs.

                                 LIV
                        The safe is heavy. And I told you, 
                        they have dirtbikes and probably a 
                        gun. 

                                 SIMON
                        Can’t we “borrow” one of your 
                        parents’ cars?

                        Uncle Nate always needs his for 
                        work but maybe one of yours?

                                 LIV
                           (a beat)
                        My dad...no.

           A heaviness sets over Liv. Autumn breaks it by moving on.

                                 AUTUMN
                           (rolls her eyes)

                        We don’t have time to go over all 
                        of this again. We need to get that 
                        watch during the DJ party so we 
                        can escape from here and have a 
                        good life. 
                           (then)
                        Does this really take convincing?

           Simon, under their gaze, sips his soda.

                                 LIV
                        Are you in or not Simon?

           Simon says this quietly, rationalizing his decision.

                                 SIMON
                        If you trust yourself, any choice 
                        you make will be correct.

           On the girls: Huh?

                                 SIMON
                        David Carradine. "Kung Fu".
                           (then)
                        I am in.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           With Simon, Liv and Autumn, dressed in black. Simon wears his 
           Black Belt. The girls both have their hair pulled back in 
           ponytails. All business.

           Liv carries a CROWBAR. She tucks it inside her jacket.

                                 LIV
                        House is on the next block. It’s a 
                        ‘99 Taurus. Easy grab.
                                 SIMON
                        How do you know how to turn it on?

                                 LIV
                        Videos on the Dark Web. You can 
                        access it through the computers at 
                        school - isn’t that nuts?

           Simon nods. That is nuts.

                                 SIMON
                        Hey I don’t mean to be a downer, 
                        but...do you think people will 
                        sell land to kids?

                                 AUTUMN
                        My sister’s gonna do it for us. 
                        She lives in Ojai. She doesn’t 
                        believe in rules.

           On Simon: That takes care of that.

                                 SIMON
                        Can we use some of the money for 
                        throwing-stars and swords? To 
                        protect the property? My hands 
                        themselves are lethal weapons, but 
                        the sword is the extension of the 
                        hand. Doesn’t hurt to have 
                        extensions.

           Liv and Autumn look to each other, silently consult, decide.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Yea. Sure.

                        I also know how to use tools. My 
                        parents made me go to their shop 
                        after school so I’m pretty much a 
                        woodworker.

                        I’d love a screened-in porch. So 
                        we can watch the sun rise without 
                        bugs.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m sure I can do that.

                                 LIV
                        We also need a barn for the cows.

                        I’ve been making a list. I’ll put 
                        that on it.

           On Liv and Autumn. Surprised, and touched, by his commitment.

           They reach the end of the block. Up ahead, a modest two-story 
           home. In the driveway: A late-model FORD TAURUS.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Simon, Liv and Autumn crouch behind hedges adjacent the house. 
           And hereon, speak in WHISPERS.

                                 LIV
                        Autumn - wait here and keep 
                        lookout. Simon, come with me. In 
                        case you need to fight us out of a 
                        physical altercation.

           Simon gives a sturdy nod, prepared to rise to that occasion.

           Simon and Liv crouch-walk over to the car.

           There are lights on in the house, but only upstairs.

                                 SIMON
                        You know...I did kiss you back. 
                        Why did you say I didn’t?

                        This can’t be the time we talk

                                 SIMON
                        I’m a martial artist, we’re 
                        trained to multi-task. But if you 
                        don’t want to--

                                 LIV
                        Fine. You kissed me back. 
                        Just...not enough, I guess. It 
                        didn’t seem like you liked me.

                                 SIMON
                        I...but I..

           They reach the car, concluding that conversation, for now. 

           Liv unsheathes her CROWBAR.

           Simon gives her an enthused thumbs-up - “good luck!”
           Liv JIMMIES THE CROWBAR into the doorjamb. The door OPENS.

           Liv and Simon look to each other, hearts racing, thrill 
           coursing through.

           Liv gets in the driver’s seat and starts feeling around under 
           the steering wheel. 

           She pops off the cover to the IGNITION WIRING.

           That’s when Simon notices: In the cupholder, a THERMOS. And 
           screen-printed onto it: A PHOTO OF A TODDLER. 

           The exact same photo of a toddler from Ms. Rosa’s desk.

           Simon’s heart DROPS.

                                 SIMON
                        Liv. We have to bail. Liv. Get out 
                        of the car. 

                                 LIV
                        Did they see us?!

                                 SIMON
                        No, Liv, get out of the car.

                                 AUTUMN (O.S.)
                        What’s going on?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s Ms. Rosa’s car!

                                 LIV
                        I know! 

                                 SIMON
                        You know?!

           Autumn runs up.

                                 AUTUMN
                        What’s going on?!

                                 SIMON
                        It’s Ms. Rosa’s car!

                                 AUTUMN
                           (news to her)
                        Oh. Shit.

                                 LIV
                        You knew that.
                                 AUTUMN
                        I...don’t think so.

                                 LIV
                        What does it matter? I knew she 
                        drove a shitty old car that we can 
                        break into. So that’s what we’re 
                        doing.

                                 SIMON
                        She’s nice. She’s a good teacher. 
                        And I shouldn’t be telling you 
                        this...it was told to me in 
                        confidence, but...she’s a Black 
                        Belt.

                                 LIV
                        So are you!

                                 SIMON
                        No, she’s like a real...she’s a 
                        Third Degree. She can explode 
                        fruit - imagine what she could do 
                        to our heads.

           Liv, defiant, touches the ignition wires together. THE CAR 
           STARTS.

                                 SIMON
                        This has become dishonorable. I’m 
                        outta here. 

           Liv looks to Autumn: Get in.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Maybe we shouldn’t--

           THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE OPENS.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        What the hell?

           Simon RUNS OFF.

           Liv goes to put the car in REVERSE, but realizes...it’s a stick 
           shift.

           Liv ends up putting it in NEUTRAL, and the car slowly rolls 
           forward toward the garage.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        I’m calling the police!

           Liv bails from the car. The car lurches forward. Taps into the 
           garage door and stops.
           Liv and Autumn high-tail down the street after Simon.

           We get a CLOSE LOOK at each of their faces. No thrill this 
           time. Only fear.

           EXT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Simon, Liv and Autumn sprint up. Finally stop. Gasp for breath.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Simon opens the door, turns on lights. Liv and Autumn follow 
           him in.

                                 SIMON
                        He’s not home. We can regroup here  
                        while we wait to get arrested.

                                 LIV
                        She didn’t see us.

                                 SIMON
                        You don’t know that. Black Belts 
                        have incredible vision. We train 
                        in the night.

           Liv and Autumn are now slightly concerned.

           Simon continues on to his room. Liv and Autumn trail.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Simon sits on his bed, face in hands. Autumn lies down on the 
           treadmill. Liv paces. They’re still gathering their breath.

                                 LIV
                        Maybe I messed up.

                                 SIMON
                        Maybe?! She’s a good teacher!

                                 LIV
                        To you. When I hand stuff in late 
                        she always calls them "excuses" 
                        but they’re not. They’re reasons.

                                 AUTUMN
                        She thinks I smoke pot. Just 
                        because I smell like it.
                                 SIMON
                        Well...I can probably talk to her. 
                        Maybe she doesn’t see you two for 
                        who you are yet.

                                 LIV
                        Or she does. And maybe we don’t 
                        see who we are yet.

           On Autumn, needing to think about that. Not wanting to.

                                 LIV
                        And you know what? I don’t give a 
                        shit what she thinks about us. 
                        After we take that watch to Big 
                        Nick's Pawn and Jewelry Inc on 
                        Sunday, she won’t be our teacher 
                        anymore. We’re gonna home-school 
                        each other about things that 
                        matter. We’ll make our own 
                        curriculum of adventure books and 
                        archeology books and we’ll learn 
                        which berries in the forrest will 
                        kill us and which ones won’t.

                                 AUTUMN
                        And I have my sister’s MasterClass 
                        log-in. So we can do the R.L. 
                        Stine one and write scary stories 
                        for each other.

                                 SIMON
                        ...We’ll have internet?

                                 LIV
                        Yes we’ll have internet.
                           (then)
                        And you’ll teach us martial arts. 
                        That way we can all be Black 
                        Belts. We can fight off bears if 
                        they decide to mess with us.

           Simon’s anger is fading. The fantasy again taking root; again 
           seeming real.

                                 SIMON
                        ...I’ll definitely teach you.

           Simon lays back on his bed. Exhausted. They all are. His eyes 
           begin to close.

           Then, Liv’s attention is caught by SOMETHING in Simon’s OPEN 
           CLOSET.
                                 LIV
                        Oh we could actually use that. I 
                        bet the safe would fit in it - 
                        it’ll be easier in case we need to 
                        drag it.

                                 SIMON
                           (eyes closed)
                        Huh?

           Liv goes to the closet and grabs UNCLE NATE’S BIG DUFFEL BAG. 
           The one Simon used for the “concrete” talent show slabs.

           Liv unzips the bag. 

           Simon hears the sound of the ZIPPER and SHOOTS UP.

                                 SIMON
                        Don’t go in there.

           Too late.

                                 LIV
                        What’s this junk?

           Simon tries to pull the bag away, but Liv pulls it back.

                                 SIMON
                        Those are personal effects!

           Liv picks up a few pieces of BROKEN, PAINTED STYROFOAM.

                                 LIV
                        This is...this is your bag from 
                        the talent show.

           Autumn walks over to get a look. Liv crumbles some styrofoam in 
           her hands.

                                 LIV
                        This is...not concrete.

                                 SIMON
                           (panicked)
                        That’s not what I used. That was 
                        just stuff to test the set-up, 
                        to...make sure the dimensions of 
                        the set-up were good.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Then why is it painted like real 
                        concrete?

           Simon doesn’t have a ready answer for that.
           Liv and Autumn look to each other, as it dawns:

                                 LIV
                        You can’t break concrete with your 
                        bare fists. You can only break 
                        styrofoam with your bare 
                        fists...which anyone can do. 
                           (piercing)
                        You’re...not a Black Belt.

                                 SIMON
                        Yes. I am.

           Liv PUNCHES SIMON’S ARM. HARD.

                                 LIV
                        You would have blocked that. On 
                        instinct.

           Simon feels everything slipping away.

                                 SIMON
                        I...am a Black Belt...of 
                        Taekwondo. My Sensei--

                                 AUTUMN
                           (interrupting, calmly)
                        Do a split.

                                 SIMON
                        What?

                                 AUTUMN
                        Do. A split. Every Black Belt can 
                        do a split. Orange belts can 
                        probably do a split.

           Liv looks to Autumn. Then back to Simon.

                                 LIV
                        Do a split, Simon.

           On Simon. Holding back tears. He takes a deep breath. Wishes 
           upon a star, probably. And tries to do a split. 

           He gets about...30% of the way there. Maybe 25%. All he’s got.

           Liv and Autumn are aghast. By the very weak split. By the 
           deception.

                                 LIV
                        You. Are a fraud.

                                 SIMON
                        I...am not...
                                 AUTUMN
                        You are! You’re absolutely that!

                                 SIMON
                        ...Batman’s parents died and he 
                        created a persona. WHY CAN’T I?

                                 LIV
                        Because you’re not Will Arnett. 
                           (then, pointed)
                        Not by a mile.

           Simon’s heart shatters.

                                 AUTUMN
                        We can’t trust him in Montana. I 
                        bet he doesn’t even know how to 
                        gut a fish or build a screened-in 
                        porch.
                           (then)
                        I bet...his parents aren’t even 
                        dead.

           Liv looks to Simon. Well?

                                 SIMON
                           (trembling)
                        They are. Both of them. 
                        Permanently.

           Simon, here, now, feels the loss of his parents, in its 
           entirety, for the first time. There’s a geyser of tears in wait 
           behind his eyes.

                                 SIMON
                        Not even a Taekwondo Black Belt 
                        has the power to change that.

                                 LIV
                           (a measured beat)
                        Well...I’m sorry about that. 
                           (then, self-protecting)
                        And I’m sorry you won’t be joining 
                        us in Montana.

           Liv walks out of the room. Autumn looks to him. Wants to be of 
           comfort...But she follows Liv out. 

           Simon, stunned, hears the front door SLAM SHUT.

           Simon doesn’t know what to do. He takes off his Black Belt. And 
           BITES DOWN ON IT, hard, as though he were getting a limb sawed 
           off. Tears begin to stream.
           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB, PUTTING GREEN - DUSK

           Uncle Nate putts on the practice green. Simon sits on the edge 
           of the green, bored, miserable, watching. His Black Belt 
           noticeably absent.

           Nate sinks a glory of a 20-footer.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        That is touch.
                           (to Simon)
                        Get in on this, man. I wanna see 
                        what you got.

           Simon shakes his head - no thanks.

           Uncle Nate walks over. Physically picks Simon up and places him 
           on his feet. Hands Simon his putter.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (compassionate)
                        Bad news for you. There’s a strict 
                        24-hour moping period around here. 
                        That time has expired.

           Nate places a golf ball on the green in front of Simon.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Now show me your famous Black Belt 
                        focus, and sink that sphere!

                                 SIMON
                        I’m not a Black Belt.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Yea I know. But someday you will 
                        be. And you’ll look back at this 
                        putt you’re about to sink, and 
                        think to yourself: I had it all 
                        along. The focus. It was right 
                        there in my heart.

           Simon, to placate Nate more than anything, lines up to putt. 

           He strikes the ball and...............leaves it short.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Easy tap-in from there. I think 
                        you should feel encouraged by that 
                        shot.

           Simon shrugs. Walks over to the ball. Taps it in. The sound of 
           the ball hitting the cup cheers him, if minimally.
                                 SIMON
                        I was starting to be in love with 
                        her. And now she’s never gonna 
                        talk to me again.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I think she’ll get over it, man. 
                        Kids lie all the time. Shit. Your 
                        dad told me that our mom was 
                        always tired because she stayed 
                        awake to murder the monsters under 
                        our bed. But really, she was tired 
                        because she was sad.

           Nate takes the ball out of the cup. Lines up a new putt.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Kids lie. Because otherwise, 
                        everything seems too scary and 
                        hard. 
                           (then)
                        He lied, but he was protecting me.

           Simon gets that.

                                 SIMON
                        He was good at protecting people.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        That is correct Simon. That’s 
                        where you get it from. 
                           (then)
                        Your lie wasn’t a bad one, kiddo. 
                        You were just trying to protect 
                        yourself. Nothing wrong with that.

                                 SIMON
                        I wanted to protect them too. Liv. 
                        And Autumn.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Welllll, those chicks seem 
                        hardcore. I’m not sure they need 
                        your help. But I’m proud of you 
                        for being a good friend - showing 
                        up for them whether they need you 
                        or not. That’s some Black Belt-
                        level friend shit right there.

           This lands with Simon. The “showing up”. The "Black Belt-level 
           friend shit.” 

           Simon's moping-period, it seems, has indeed concluded. In its 
           place: Determination.
           MUSIC UP over the following. Appropriate to his determination.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - MORNING

           Simon springs from bed. Immediately hits the floor and does 
           PUSH-UPS. He jumps to his feet and heads straight for the -

           TREADMILL. He turns it up way too fast. But, determined, as he 
           is, Simon sprints with all of his might.

           EXT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           By the dumpsters. Simon, in the zone, breaks plywood over his 
           knees. Kee-HUP.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - DUSK

           Simon stands before a mirror. In his SKIN-TIGHT ARMANI EXCHANGE 
           T-SHIRT. Bellybutton hole and all.

           Simon TIES ON HIS BLACK BELT.

           Simon takes the DUFFEL BAG from the closet. He opens it, and 
           dumps all of the styrofoam onto the ground. 

           Simon stuffs the duffel bag into his BACKPACK. 

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Simon opens the FREEZER. It’s packed with FROZEN STEAKS.

           Simon takes a few steaks and stuffs those in his backpack too.

           Then he grabs a HANDFUL OF RANDOM COOKING UTENSILS.

           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           Simon rides up on Uncle Nate’s bike. Parks it. Walks with 
           purpose toward,

           EXT./INT. GOLF CART GARAGE - NIGHT

           The garage is unattended. Simon approaches one of the big, gas-
           powered LANDSCAPING GOLF CARTS - the kind with a FLATBED in 
           back. The key is in the ignition, as it is with all the carts.

           Simon turns it on. And drives out of the garage.
           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Simon drives past the Clubhouse, slowly, with great focus, 
           hoping to avoid detection. It’s his first time behind the wheel 
           of anything.

           Then he hears,

                                 BECCA (O.S.)
                        ...Simon?

           Shit. Simon stops. Becca approaches, carrying her golf bag.

                                 SIMON
                        Hi Bec!

                                 BECCA
                        Where’s your uncle? 

                                 SIMON
                           (sincere, all the way)
                        Probably off doing something nice 
                        for you. That’s usually what’s on 
                        his mind.

           Becca registers that, but stays on the immediate matter,

                                 BECCA
                        Are you here alone?...Why are you 
                        driving the landscaping cart?

                                 SIMON
                        I have answers to all of those 
                        questions. But I’m afraid I don’t 
                        have time to answer them.
                           (then)
                        My friends could be in trouble.

                                 BECCA
                           (concerned)
                        Do you need an adult?

                                 SIMON
                        No. I’m hoping not.

           Simon, no time to waste, just starts driving away.

                                 SIMON
                           (calls back)
                        Love you...
                           (then, decides)
                        ...Mom!

           On Becca. That’s a whole lot to absorb. 
           She watches as Simon drives off the Tall Oaks property.

           With decidedly maternal concern, Becca takes out her phone.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Simon drives, his hands at 10 and 2, nervous but intent. His 
           BACKPACK on the seat next to him.

           Various CARS pass him. Confounded looks from the drivers - on 
           account of a middle-schooler driving a golf cart at night on a 
           residential road.

           Simon spots a POLICE CRUISER up ahead. 

           Simon drives up ONTO SOMEONE’S LAWN, trampling some innocent 
           daisies in the process. Simon looks down at the now-2D flowers, 
           feels genuinely bad about it.

           The Cruiser passes by. Simon waits a beat, and drives on. 

           The SOUND of THUMPING MUSIC grows near.

           EXT. “THE DJ HOUSE” - NIGHT

           Simon drives past the house, slowly, casing the place. There 
           are various EXOTIC CARS outside. 

           Inside, a party. The party.

           Simon parks the golf cart around the corner from the house. 

           INT. THE DJ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Simon - and again, let’s remember what he’s wearing - enters. 
           BLACK BELT and BELLYBUTTON on full display.

           The vibe is that of a frat party - elevated, somewhat, by some 
           Vegas club-DJ’s success. 

           That very DJ spins from a PODIUM at the rear of the cavernous 
           living room.

           Simon has never seen drinking or smoking, at least not like 
           this. He wades through the much-taller crowd.

           People cut him confused looks, but that’s all.

           Simon, overwhelmed, ducks into a SCREENING ROOM.
           INT. SCREENING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           FIELD OF DREAMS plays on the massive screen, without audio. 
           Simon is briefly transfixed by it, until,

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What are you?

           Simon looks to his right to see a GUY and a GIRL (20s) sitting 
           in recliners. The Guy holds an upturned FRISBEE with LINES OF 
           COCAINE on it.

                                 SIMON
                        ...Hi. Do you know Liv and Autumn?

                                 GUY
                        What are you?

                                 SIMON
                        I’m Simon. I think that’s what 
                        you’re asking?

                                 GIRL
                           (to herself)
                        I like that shirt.
                           (then)
                        What’s in the backpack?

                                 SIMON
                        Steak, mostly. If there’s extra 
                        later you can have the rest.

           The Guy slides the frisbee away from himself.

                                 GUY
                        Things have become weird. No more 
                        for me.

                                 GIRL
                        You seem...really young.
                           (re: coke)
                        I’m sorry, we can’t offer you any. 
                        You seem really...young.

                                 SIMON
                        I wouldn’t know what to do with 
                        that. Do you know Liv and Autumn?

                                 GUY
                        Are you wearing a karate belt?

                                 SIMON
                        Yea.

           The Guy processes that. Along with everything else.
                                 GUY
                        I don’t think I have any more 
                        questions.

           Simon exhales, frustrated. These people are useless. He heads 
           back into,

           INT. THE MAIN FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Simon makes his way toward the KITCHEN. His eyes peeled for Liv 
           and Autumn. 

           A HAND grabs onto Simon’s backpack, YANKING him into,

           INT. PANTRY - CONTINUOUS

           Liv and Autumn. (The pantry, incidentally, is just beer, 
           coconut water, and dozens of bags of almonds).

                                 LIV
                        You better tell me why you’re 
                        here.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Nice belt.

                                 SIMON
                           (to Autumn)
                        Thanks.
                           (then, to both)
                        I don’t need your permission to be 
                        here. This is a neighborhood party 
                        and I’m a neighborhood boy.

                                 LIV
                        This is a private affair and 
                        you’re a trespasser.

                                 SIMON
                        How could you say that to someone 
                        you kissed?!

                                 AUTUMN
                           (to Liv, in Simon’s defense)
                        He wore the shirt. That took guts.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea it did. And you’re gonna need 
                        guts to pull off this “noble” 
                        heist. Guts...and the stuff in my 
                        backpack.
                                 LIV
                        But you can’t be trusted. I don’t 
                        care what’s in your backpack if 
                        you can’t be trusted.

                                 SIMON
                        How were you planning to get the 
                        safe out? Did you get a car?

                                 AUTUMN
                        We brought a red wagon. We’ll run 
                        through the woods with it.

                                 SIMON
                           (scoffs)
                        A red wagon.
                           (then, full of guts)
                        I brought real wheels. And the 
                        stuff in my backpack.

           Liv and Autumn are both glad he’s here, and do everything they 
           can to hide the fact.

                                 LIV
                        You still can’t come to Montana.

                                 SIMON
                        It’s a big state and I’ll go there 
                        if I want. I doubt I’ll even run 
                        into you.

           Liv and Autumn look to each other. They respect his defiance. 
           It’s tacitly understood: He’s back in.

           INT. THE DJ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Simon, Liv and Autumn make their way slowly toward the STAIRS - 
           trying, perhaps too hard, to look like they belong there. Liv 
           sips a BEER. Hates it.

                                 SIMON
                        Where’s your brother?

                                 LIV
                        Sucking dentist medicine by the 
                        pool. I never want to be like him.

                                 SIMON
                        Drugs make no sense.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Tell that to my parents.

           They walk UPSTAIRS. As other PARTYGOERS fumble their way down.
                                 PARTYGOER
                        Whoaa, it’s the Rugrats!

                                 LIV
                           (to Partygoer)
                        Go and fuck yourself. 
                           (then)
                        Is that how the Rugrats talk?

                                 PARTYGOER
                           (scared)
                        Oh...I don’t think so.

           INT. THE DJ HOUSE, UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

           They walk past people coming and going from assorted bedrooms, 
           and head toward a ROOM at the end of the hall. Its door closed.

           Simon does that military-style thing where he points with his 
           pointer and middle fingers to his eyes, then to the room.

           They reach the door. Liv slowly opens it.

           INT. CORY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Liv quietly shuts the door behind them.

           GROWLING, SNARLING emits from the bathroom.

                                 LIV
                        I forgot about Edward...

           Simon holds up his scabbed arm.

                                 SIMON
                        I never will.

           Simon opens his backpack, and takes out a FROZEN STEAK.

                                 AUTUMN
                           (sincere)
                        Oh my god. He’s a genius. He’s a 
                        genius who thought ahead.

           Liv, with a look to Simon, acknowledges: Nice work.

           Simon removes the steak from its plastic grocery store wrapper. 

           They approach the bathroom. The SNARLING intensifies.

           Simon, in one ninja-like motion, opens the door and TOSSES IN 
           THE STEAK.
           Edward shuts right up, blissed out on the frozen meat.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the bathroom. Liv pets Edward, who pauses from the 
           steak to lick her hand. The bathroom is marble-clad and filthy.

           In the back, next to the tub: THE SAFE.

           Simon, Liv and Autumn look to one another. Look to the safe: 
           Their ticket out.

           Simon opens his backpack again and removes the DUFFEL BAG.

           Autumn is blown away.

                                 AUTUMN
                        It’s one genius thing after 
                        another.

                                 SIMON
                        Wait til you see my wheels.

           Simon opens the duffel bag, lays it flat in front of the safe.

           They TIP the heavy safe over into the bag, and zip the bag 
           around it.

           It takes all three of them to drag it out of the bathroom.

           INT. CORY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 SIMON
                        Let's drop this out the window. 
                        Run down. And get it to my wheels.

                                 LIV
                           (realizing)
                        What if the watch breaks in the 
                        fall? I say we just lug this out 
                        the front door. People here only 
                        pay attention to themselves.

                                 SIMON
                        If the watch is as classy as you 
                        say it is, it can withstand a 
                        fall. Most of the expensive ones 
                        are tested by mountaineers.

                                 AUTUMN
                        I’m seeing merit to both of your 
                        arguments--
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who the fuck are you?

           A MAN (early 40s) enters the room, holding a motorcycle helmet.

                                 LIV
                        I’m Cory’s sister. Who are you?

           The man clocks the CUBE SHAPED OBJECT in the duffel bag.

                                 MAN
                        Would you tell me what's in that 
                        bag?

                                 AUTUMN
                        I’ll tell you what’s not in the 
                        bag: Your business.

           The man LAUGHS.

                                 MAN
                        I actually have a feeling my 
                        business is in that bag.

           The man lunges for the bag. The kids try to stop him. He elbows 
           Simon to the floor. Unzips the bag. Sees the safe.

                                 MAN
                        You kids are insane. Walk away. 
                        Now.

                                 LIV
                        No. This is mine. My grandpa meant 
                        to leave it for me.

                                 MAN
                           (mocking)
                        Your grandpa left you 600 Ecstasy 
                        pills? That’s...so weird of him.

           On Liv, Simon, Autumn: Oh, shit.

                                 LIV
                        Well, there’s other stuff in there 
                        too. 

                                 AUTUMN
                           (to Liv)
                        We could sell the drugs to 
                        someone. Then we’d have enough to 
                        build an arcade room.

           Liv likes the sound of that. Defiant, she re-zips the bag.
                                 LIV
                        We’re taking the safe.

           The man threateningly walks toward her.

           Simon, still dazed on the floor, reaches for his backpack. 
           Unnoticed. He creeps his hands in and pulls out:

           Two METAL KITCHEN SPATULAS, TIED TOGETHER WITH ROPE LIKE 
           NUNCHUCKS.

           Simon stands and WHIPS THE GUY ACROSS THE FACE, CUTTING HIS EYE 
           WITH THE SPATULA’S EDGE.

           Simon gets in his fighting stance.

                                 SIMON
                           (to the man)
                        It’s three vs. one. You’d be wise 
                        not to engage in this battle.

           The man wipes blood from his face. He has had enough of this. 

           So he pulls out his GUN. POINTS IT AT SIMON.

                                 LIV
                           (scared but strong)
                        Like you’re gonna shoot a kid.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Is that worth it? For drugs?

                                 SIMON
                        Guys...I think he might think it’s 
                        worth it.

           The BEDROOM DOOR OPENS AGAIN. It’s UNCLE NATE and another GUY.

                                 LIV
                        Ohh shit. Hey Cory.

                                 SIMON
                        Uncle Nate?!

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Simon?!

                        Liv what the fuck are you doing up 
                        here... 

           Cory then realizes the Man - a man he knows - with his gun out.
                                 CORY
                        You have a gun out near my sister 
                        bro?! You better holster that 
                        fuckin thing before it goes off in 
                        your direction.

           The man tucks his gun away.

                                 MAN
                        They're trying to take the safe.

                                 SIMON
                        UNCLE NATE WHY ARE YOU HERE?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Why are you here? You said you had 
                        homework!

                        party. So shoot me.
                           (to the gun man)
                        Don't, though. 
                           (to Uncle Nate)
                        Why are you here?

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Cory...handles my bets.

                                 SIMON
                        He’s your bookie?! There are 
                        websites for that! Why are you 
                        doing something legal illegally?!

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I’ll teach you about taxes but not 
                        right now.

           Cory halts the proceedings.

                                 CORY
                        YO. LIV. WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO 
                        TAKE MY SAFE.

                                 LIV
                        Grandpa should never have given 
                        you that watch. It’s extremely 
                        valuable and it means something to 
                        me and you don’t even wear it. 

           On Cory: That’s what you want?
                                 CORY
                        I don’t wear it because it’s a 
                        piece of shit. He got it on Canal 
                        Street.

                                 AUTUMN
                        But...he said Doris Day once owned 
                        it. I heard him.

                                 CORY
                        By the time you knew him, he might 
                        have believed that to be true.

           Cory OPENS THE SAFE. He takes out the WATCH (situated beside 
           zip-lock bags of E pills).

                                 LIV
                           (disbelieving)
                        If it’s a “piece of shit”, why do 
                        you keep it in a safe?

                                 CORY
                           (softening)
                        ...Because it was Grandpa’s. I 
                        didn’t even know you wanted it. 

           Cory tosses the watch to Liv. 

                                 CORY
                        Take it.  
                           (sincere)
                        It’ll look cool on you.

           Liv feels the weight of it in her hands. It sure is light. Sure 
           is fake.

           The fact of this settles on Liv, Autumn, Simon. 

           Montana, the dream, vanishes.

           But Simon won’t let it go...

                                 SIMON
                        We should confiscate the drugs. 
                        That’ll at least buy us the land. 
                        We can start out with tents.

                        Please keep your gun where it is. 
                        Me and the innocent children are 
                        vacating the room. Without your

                        Let me just get your duffel bag 
                        and spatulas.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Leave the duffel bag and spatulas, 
                        Simon.

           On Simon: Fine.

           EXT. THE DJ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Uncle Nate escorts Simon, Liv and Autumn out of the house.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (takes out his phone)
                        I Ubered.

                                 SIMON
                        Oh it’s cool. I brought wheels.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Uncle Nate drives the golf cart. Autumn sit shotgun. Simon and 
           Liv sit on the flatbed in back.

                                 SIMON
                        Sorry I took the cart Uncle Nate. 
                        I hope you don’t get fired.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (shrugs)
                        Becca’s my boss, I’m not too 
                        worried about it. Plus: She is to 
                        be my wife.

                                 SIMON
                        You proposed?!
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I’m gonna get the shoulder surgery 
                        first so I can start training 
                        again for the Tour. She showed me 
                        the rock she wants...let us just 
                        say I am motivated to win.

           Simon is very happy to hear this. Uncle Nate smiles. Knows what 
           a mom (and Becca, specifically) would mean to Simon.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                           (excited)
                        You kids wanna take a shortcut? 
                        Hold on back there.

           Simon holds on to the cart’s edge. Liv holds on to SIMON. His 
           heart flutters.

           Simon looks down at Liv’s hand, clutching his arm. He sees: 
           She’s WEARING THE WATCH.

           Simon looks closely at the watch. And notices,

                                 SIMON
                        The time is right.

           Liv allows a smile. It’s sad but real.

           Uncle Nate pops up over a curb, drives through someone’s lawn,

           Emerging onto,

           EXT. TALL OAKS GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

           Uncle Nate steps on the gas, to the great delight of the kids 
           onboard.

           As the wind whips through Simon and Liv’s hair, Simon unties 
           his Black Belt. And drops it off the cart. Like he were tossing 
           it into an ocean.

           Simon and Liv keep their eyes on it - a snake in green grass - 
           until it disappears from view.

           Then, from HIGH ABOVE:

           The golf cart traverses the moonlit course. A joyride.

           INT. WILL ROGERS MIDDLE SCHOOL, HALLWAY - DAY

           With Simon, making his way through the rush of students. 
           He wears his normal clothes, and a belt - the kind that keeps 
           your pants up. 

           Simon spots Liv at her locker. Approaches.

                                 SIMON
                        Hey.

                                 LIV
                           (in a rush)
                        Hey.

                                 SIMON
                        Where’s Autumn?

                                 LIV
                        How should I know?

                                 SIMON
                        She’s just..usually with you 
                        between third and fourth.

                                 LIV
                        Well, she’s a bitch, so who cares.

           This sets Simon back.

                                 SIMON
                        I don’t understand.

                                 LIV
                        She got to leave early for spring 
                        break. Who needs Montana when you 
                        have a cool sister in Ojai...
                           (then)
                        Has Ms. Rosa been weird to you?

                                 SIMON
                           (thinks)
                        No.

                                 LIV
                        Me either. Guess Black Belts can’t 
                        see in the dark.

                                 SIMON
                        Yea. Guess not.

           Liv shuts her locker.

                                 LIV
                        I gotta get to math.

           On Simon. Feeling no love from her.
                                 SIMON
                        You’re not wearing the watch...

                                 LIV
                        It’s broken. You said the time was 
                        right but it’s not. It’s broken.

                                 SIMON
                           (admitting)
                        I wanted you to feel better.

           Liv, despite her resistance, gets momentarily choked up. 

           She gives Simon a look - one of defeat, but there’s gratitude 
           in there, too.

           And Liv walks off.

           EXT. TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB, CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Simon cleans a bag of golf clubs.

           Uncle Nate approaches, carrying a BUNDLE of 2X4’s.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Golf Cart Leslie to the rescue 
                        again. This what you need?

                                 SIMON
                        Yes. Perfect.

           MUSIC UP. The following in MONTAGE:

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           We might expect Simon to be karate-chopping the 2X4’s. 

           Instead, he is carefully sawing them into sections.

           EXT. DRIVING RANGE, TALL OAKS COUNTRY CLUB - DUSK

           Simon, Uncle Nate and Becca drive golf balls into the late-
           setting sun. Nate and Becca, expertly. Simon tries.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Simon helps Nate and Becca shop. A highly quotidian scene of 
           family stuff, and Simon couldn’t be more pleased with it.

           The MUSIC/MONTAGE abruptly ends with,
                                 MS. ROSA (O.S.)
                        Simon?

           Simon turns to see Ms. Rosa. Her adorable TODDLER sitting in 
           the front part of the shopping cart.

                                 SIMON
                           (to Nate/Becca)
                        I’ll have you called on the 
                        intercom if I lose you.

           Uncle Nate and Becca give sheepish waves to Ms. Rosa, and 
           continue down the aisle.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        So this is how you spend spring 
                        break?

                                 SIMON
                        This is how you spend spring 
                        break?

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Yea. It is.

                                 SIMON
                        Same.
                           (then, quickly)
                        I think you know that I tried to 
                        steal your car.

           On Ms. Rosa, incredulous.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        I...have to say that I did not 
                        know that, Simon.

                                 SIMON
                           (deflates - shit)
                        I was sure we locked eyes for a 
                        moment. I was sure you were just 
                        waiting to have me arrested 
                        because you obviously know about 
                        the element of surprise.

           Ms. Rosa, understandably, is unsure what to do with this.

                                 SIMON
                        But please know: I intended to 
                        bring it back. And I didn’t know 
                        it was your car until it was way 
                        too late.

           Ms. Rosa’s daughter gets antsy. Ms. Rosa touches her hair, 
           calming her.
                                 MS. ROSA
                        It’s a...crazy thing you did, 
                        Simon. Telling me that.

                                 SIMON
                        If I’m ever going to be a real 
                        Black Belt, I have to be 
                        honorable. And car theft is not 
                        honorable. I’m glad I came clean 
                        about this, even if it means jail.

           Ms. Rosa’s daughter reaches out her hand toward Simon, amused 
           by him. Simon gives her a goofy smile, which she loves.

                                 MS. ROSA
                           (just curious)
                        Who were the other kids with you?

                                 SIMON
                        Well..ratting is also 
                        dishonorable. I’m not trying to 
                        dig myself a deeper hole.

           Ms. Rosa exhales. She has a child and shopping to do. No real 
           time or interest for this.

                                 MS. ROSA
                           (absolving him)
                        It was only attempted car theft, I 
                        suppose. And you got an A on your 
                        Civics test...

           This is news to Simon. He perks up.

                                 MS. ROSA
                        Keep it honorable, Simon. I’m 
                        serious. 
                           (then)
                        See you next week.

           On Simon: He will keep it honorable. 

           Ms. Rosa nods, and heads off.

           Simon grabs a box of Captain Crunch and goes in search of Uncle 
           Nate and Becca.

           MUSIC UP AGAIN. The MONTAGE continues.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Close on Simon, lacquering a section of wood.
           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

           Simon rides Uncle Nate’s bike. Wears his BACKPACK.

           EXT. LIV’S HOUSE - DAY

           Simon carefully deploys the kickstand, parks the bike.

           MUSIC/MONTAGE ENDS.

           INT. LIV’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Liv opens the door.

                                 SIMON
                        I have a present for you.

           Liv, intrigued, steps aside.

           INT. LIV’S ROOM - DAY

           Simon sits on her desk chair. Places his backpack in front of 
           him on the floor. And unzips it. 

           He removes: TWO SMALL, SQUARE ITEMS, wrapped in newspaper.

                                 SIMON
                        Only one’s for you. But they’re 
                        the same.

           Liv unwraps one of them. A smile gradually appears.

                                 SIMON
                        The propeller was all that was 
                        salvageable. But I think the 
                        propeller’s what matters to you 
                        guys.

           We now get a look at the ITEM in Liv’s hands: A beautiful, 
           handmade PICTURE FRAME. The result of Simon’s intensive 
           woodwork. Mounted inside the frame: The PROPELLER from the 
           stolen aquarium seaplane. 

           It takes Liv a beat to find the right words. Then she does...

                                 LIV
                        I love it.

                                 SIMON
                        The other one’s for Autumn.
                                 LIV
                        She’ll love it too.

                                 SIMON
                        I don’t know how to give it to 
                        her--

                                 LIV
                        I’m going to Ojai tomorrow. My 
                        dad’s letting me go. He never lets 
                        me go on trips so I don’t know 
                        what got into him.

                                 SIMON
                        ..Maybe something good.

                                 LIV
                           (hopeful)
                        Maybe.
                           (then)
                        You could come. I’m sure you could 
                        come.

           Simon would love that, more than anything, but,

                                 SIMON
                        Uncle Nate’s gonna teach me how to 
                        golf this week. I don’t want to 
                        let him down.

           Liv nods.

                                 SIMON
                        So I guess I’ll see you at schoo--

           BLAMMO. Liv kisses Simon on the lips. Her eyes are closed, 
           appropriately. His are wide...open. In wonderful disbelief.

           EXT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           Simon bikes up. A smile all the way around his head.

           INT. UNCLE NATE’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Uncle Nate and Becca prep dinner in the kitchen.

                                 BECCA
                        Hey sweetie.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m home.
                                 UNCLE NATE
                        Yo, your teacher stopped by.

           Simon’s heart sinks. He looks like he’s prepared for an ambush.

                                 BECCA
                        Wish you told us she was a karate 
                        champion before I swore at her on 
                        her own turf.

                                 SIMON
                        ...I’m not sure I was aware of it 
                        at the time. But you don’t have to 
                        be scared of her, she has a great 
                        awareness of her power and would 
                        never misuse it.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        She left something for you. I put 
                        it on your bed.

           INT. SIMON’S ROOM - DAY

           Simon enters, expectantly. 

           His eyes illuminate as he registers the item on his bed:

           A karate WHITE BELT.

           Simon picks it up. The belt rests in his outstretched palms.

           Uncle Nate appears at the door.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        I guess she told her Air Force pal 
                        about you - runs that dojo over by 
                        the Wendy’s. Said the lessons are 
                        on the house...
                           (clearly editorializing)
                        ...considering your immense 
                        potential to be a karate champion 
                        of world renown.

           Uncle Nate knows how much this means to Simon.

                                 UNCLE NATE
                        You should stretch. It’s all about 
                        flexibility, karate.
                           (then)
                        I’m telling you things you know.

           And Uncle Nate heads back to the kitchen.
           Simon clutches the White Belt in his hands. The Black Belt cost 
           twenty-five bucks. This one is priceless.

           EXT. SHOPPING CENTER - DAY

           Uncle Nate’s Wrangler parks. 

           Simon gets out, in his crisp Gi (uniform) and White Belt.

           INT. TAEKWONDO ACADEMY OF LONG BEACH - DAY 

           Simon joins a group of OTHER WHITE BELTS on the mat - KIDS HIS 
           AGE, and, it’s reasonable to assume, soon to be his friends.

           MUSIC UP as the kids assemble in a disciplined fashion before 
           the SENSEI.

           INT. LOBBY, TAEKWONDO ACADEMY - CONTINUOUS

           Uncle Nate and Becca, their pride on display, observe through a 
           glass wall. Alongside other parents.

           CLOSE ON: Simon, in Junbi, the Ready Stance. Feet parallel, 
           fisted arms before him at a slight bent. Focus ahead.

           As Simon takes a moment to tighten the knot on his White Belt, 
           we end on our TITLE:

                                THE BLACK BELT
