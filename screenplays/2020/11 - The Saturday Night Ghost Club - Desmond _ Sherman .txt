           FADE IN:

           EXT. CEMETERY -- NIGHT

           A crescent moon looms over the small town graveyard, casting
           sharp shadows on the weathered tombstones. It's eerily quiet
           as we slowly creep through, save the rustle of fallen leaves
           in the breeze.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Most people are unsettled by the dark
                        and mysterious. They walk faster past
                        graveyards. They shy away from
                        unnerving topics like death. And they
                        dare not ask questions about that
                        which cannot be easily explained.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        But not my Uncle Calvin...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of a bike in motion. QUIRKY TRINKETS
           decorating its frame. All-seeing eyes. Cthulhu beads. An
           alien head sticker that reads, "Believe."

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Some say he was an expert in legend
                        and lore, an encyclopedia of ghosts
                        and the most unseemly monsters that
                        lurk in the night... Others say he
                        was just crazy. I'll let you decide.

           EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The BIKE SKIDS TO A STOP outside of a suburban home. As the
           rider climbs off, we move up... Past acid washed jeans, a
           gaudy tie-dye shirt, and long frizzy hair...

           Until we reveal a man who looks like a Grateful Dead roadie
           on a perpetual tour of the supernatural, with a face that
           screams wide-eyed believer. This is UNCLE CALVIN (late 30s).

           He glances towards the upstairs window, where YOUNG JAKE (5)
           looks down, waiting for him. A trepidatious boy whose
           pajamas don't quite fit over his chubby frame.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        But for me, a scared kid growing up
                        in a nowhere town... He was the best
                        uncle I could ever ask for.
           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Young Jake's eyes are locked on his CLOSED CLOSET DOOR,
           imagination running on overdrive. Calvin steps up by his
           side, sizing up the closet like an old adversary.

                                 CALVIN
                        I take it this is its lair?

           Young Jake nods, keeping his distance. Calvin cautiously
           opens the closet... Just boxes and toys inside. But that
           doesn't deter him.

                                 CALVIN
                        Tell me, Jake, what does this monster
                        look like?

                                 YOUNG JAKE
                        Uh... Kinda hairy. And slimy.

                                 CALVIN
                        Like a snake? Or more like a blob?

                                 YOUNG JAKE
                        A blob. But it can stretch too.

                                 CALVIN
                        So we're dealing with a hairy, slimy
                        blob with uncanny stretching
                        abilities... Sounds like a Slurper
                        Slug. A rare cryptid, difficult to
                        track, but they're out there... You
                        keep anything tasty in your closet?

                                 YOUNG JAKE
                        Just my Halloween candy.

                                 CALVIN
                        Slurper Slug then, guaranteed.

           Calvin sets down a battered TOOLBOX. Opens it, revealing an
           assortment of ODD INSTRUMENTS and bags of COLORFUL POWDER.
           He fishes through it, searching for something.

           But the sound of HUSHED VOICES draws Jake's attention to his
           CLOSED BEDROOM DOOR. Beyond it, his parents are arguing -
           CECILIA and SAM (30s).

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        I don't know why you always let him
                        do this. Jake's just gonna keep on
                        believing in all this shit.
                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        Well telling him to "stop being a
                        sissy" just makes things worse.
                        Calvin's helping the only way he
                        knows how --

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        But who's the one who needs help?

                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        I'm not getting into this again --

           It pains Jake to hear them arguing like this...

                                 CALVIN
                        Jakey-boy...

           Young Jake turns to meet his Uncle's resolute eyes.

                                 CALVIN
                        There are far more pressing matters
                        than the concerns of non-believers.
                        If we let this Slurper Slug linger,
                        it'll find a mate. And a nest of
                        those little guys would make even a
                        mortician barf his biscuits.

           He pulls a bag of RED POWDER out of his toolbox.

                                 CALVIN
                        This is cochineal, made from the
                        crushed shells of beetles. Commonly
                        used in containment spells. Grab me
                        some of that Halloween candy.

           Young Jake nods. Then grabs some from a plastic pumpkin in
           the closet. Places it into Calvin's outstretched hand.

           Then watches, engrossed, as Calvin lays a line of candy on
           the closet floor between converging barbed lines of
           cochineal that end in an expertly laid pile. A trap.

                                 CALVIN
                        Now the Slurper Slug will traipse up
                        this path, see, which gets narrower
                        and narrower until the Slug gets
                        stuck here in what I call the point
                        of no return. Then this cochineal
                        will vaporize it into nothingness.

           He closes the closet door. Then looks Young Jake in the eye.
                                 CALVIN
                        But listen carefully... If you peek
                        inside the closet, the Slurper Slug
                        might escape. So under no condition
                        can this door be opened until the sun
                        rises. No matter what you hear, no
                        matter what you smell, you have to
                        leave your closet closed. Promise?

           Young Jake nods vehemently.

                                 CALVIN
                        By the oath of the White Mage, do you
                        swear it?

                                 YOUNG JAKE
                        The oath of who?

                                 CALVIN
                        The pinkie variety will suffice.

           Calvin sticks out his pinkie finger. Young Jake links his.

                                 CALVIN
                        Sleep easy tonight, Jakey-boy. You
                        shall find peace by morning.

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- LATER

           And sure enough, Young Jake sleeps soundly.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The thing is, he didn't just believe
                        me... He believed. I never questioned
                        why he did and the other adults
                        didn't. I was just glad I had him.

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           We move past PHOTOS OF JAKE AND CALVIN through the years.
           Trick or treating in homemade costumes. Building an epic
           couch fort. Holding giant turkey legs at a local carnival.

           Jake's room emulates his Uncle's persona. Cluttered with
           skeletal figurines of cryptids, Fangoria magazines, lava
           lamps, books on spotting mermaids and hunting werewolves.
           The general decor suggests we're in the MID-1990s.

           We find JAKE (12) staring through a magnifying glass as he
           carefully paints a KNIGHT MINIATURE. A kid who struggles
           with his weight, which doesn't help his self-esteem either.
           His PARENTS' VOICES filter in from outside, causing Jake to
           tense. He hesitantly rises to look out his window, seeing
           his Dad standing on the doorstep below.

                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        Are you at least gonna say bye to
                        him?

                                 SAM
                        My plane leaves in two hours.

                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        So what do I tell him then? Dad's
                        taking a really long trip?

                                 SAM
                        Tell him whatever you want. Or have
                        your brother say I got eaten by a
                        vampire for all I care.

                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        You're a real piece of shit, you know
                        that!

                                 SAM
                        Yeah, I'm gonna miss you too.

           Jake watches his Dad walk away without glancing back. He
           climbs into a waiting TAXI... Jake's Mom steps onto the
           doorstep, PAPERS in her hand, watching it drive away...

           Then she steps back inside. The sound of the FRONT DOOR
           SLAMMING makes Jake flinch.

           He takes a shaky breath, restraining his emotions. Whatever
           he's feeling, he keeps it locked up tight inside.

           Then he sits back down, and continues painting his knight...

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The truth is... Calvin was more than
                        just an Uncle to me. He was my ally,
                        my protector against the most
                        fearsome monster of all...

           And now we see that Jake hasn't just painted one miniature,
           but an ENTIRE TABLETOP. Trees, castles, goblins, dragons...

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Loneliness.
           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           RAIN pelts the glass. Lightning flashes. Jake lies awake in
           bed, listening to the house creak its protests to the storm.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        But as I'd soon learn... Lonely souls
                        are who the real monsters prey upon.

           Jake rolls over, forcing his eyes closed. For a few moments,
           all is calm, just the sound of the falling rain.

           Until A DOOR CREAKS OPEN somewhere in the house...

           Jake's eyes open. What was that?

           He sits up, looking around... But he doesn't hear anything
           except the rain... Then --

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud... HEAVY, HOBBLING FOOTSTEPS.

           Jake stiffens, knowing something is very wrong. 

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud...

           When he speaks, he can barely muster a whisper.

                                 JAKE
                        Mom? Mom, is that you?

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud... Drawing closer...

           Until they stop... RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS OPEN DOOR.

           Jake's breaths grow faster. His eyes scanning the darkness.
           But there's nothing there...

           Then LIGHTNING FLASHES, casting jagged shadows that
           reveal --

           A DARK INHUMAN FIGURE in his doorway... UNNATURALLY TALL
           WITH GROTESQUELY MISPROPORTIONED LIMBS.

           Jake startles! But the figure fades into the darkness with
           the lightning...

           Jake doesn't move, eyes wide, breathing frantically as he
           stares into the void. Did he actually see that thing?

           Then LIGHTNING FLASHES AGAIN -- And now THE DARK FIGURE
           STANDS CLOSER TO HIM.
           Jake moves back in his bed, terrified, pressing himself into
           the wall, nowhere else to go. But as he looks around, it's
           dark again... The Figure nowhere to be seen.

           Until LIGHTING FLASHES, illuminating THE DARK FIGURE
           TOWERING RIGHT OVER HIM --

           We don't get a good look at it... But JAKE DOES. And he's so
           horrified, he can hardly breathe.

           The FIGURE LURCHES FORWARD, letting out a PIERCING GHOSTLY
           WAIL. JAKE SCREAMS! But as lightning flashes again --

           THE DARK FIGURE IS GONE.

           Jake scrambles to turn on his lamp, gasping for breath,
           looking around. But he's all alone...

           And then he peers down and realizes... HE WET HIMSELF. He
           looks away, horribly embarrassed and ashamed.

           LAUNDRY ROOM

           Jake opens the washing machine, stuffing his bed sheets
           inside. Douses them with detergent. He starts the cycle. And
           stands there in the darkness...

           And now the tears come... Tears of humiliation.

           But he aggressively wipes them away, fighting them back.
           Upset with himself for even daring to cry.

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Jake remakes his bed with clean sheets, rain still falling
           outside. But something more weighs on him.

           His gaze shifts to his dresser drawer... Not wanting to
           acknowledge whatever is hidden inside... But then he opens
           it. Moves various items to dig out a CRINKLED DRAWING,
           crudely drawn by a younger Jake...

           It's of the SAME DARK INHUMAN FIGURE. Less literal and more
           abstract.

           He's seen this thing before.

           INT. KITCHEN, JAKE'S HOUSE -- MORNING

           Jake picks at his breakfast, still shaken up, tired from not
           sleeping.
           Cecilia multitasks in her nurse's scrubs, putting away
           dishes while packing her work bag. An unspoken tension hangs
           between them...

                                 CECILIA
                        I should be home by six, so put the
                        casserole in the oven at five. Set to
                        three-fifty and leave the lid on. 

           She zips her bag. Kisses Jake on the forehead on her way
           towards the door.

                                 JAKE
                        Mom?

                                 CECILIA
                        Yeah?

           She glances back, a hint of pain on her face that she tries
           to hide. They hold each other's gaze...

                                 JAKE
                        Have a good day.

           Not what he was going to say... But that's all he can
           manage. He goes back to his breakfast. Cecilia hesitates,
           knowing she should say more. But instead just heads out.

           The door closes. Jake sets his spoon down. 

           EXT. SMALL TOWN MAIN STREET -- DAY

           Jake rides his bike past the old STOREFRONTS. They were
           probably charming decades ago, but their time has passed.

           He pulls up to a store all its own, its small parking lot
           empty. And yet, the very sight seems to give him comfort. He
           hops off his bike and approaches the antique CARVED WOODEN
           DOOR. GOTHIC LETTERS forebode --

                                    THE OCCULTORIUM

           INT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- CONTINUOUS

           Black walls. Dim lighting. Cramped aisles. Jake browses
           books titled Practical Demonology, Witch Hunting Made Easy,
           The Necronomicon Box Set. Peruses display cases of tarot
           cards, ouija boards, do-it-yourself voodoo dolls.

           His gaze shifts to the back... Where Calvin stands behind
           the register, a STUFFED RAVEN looming over it, talking to a
           COLLEGE BURNOUT holding a perfectly ordinary looking ROCK.
                                 COLLEGE BURNOUT
                        I don't know man, are you really sure
                        this is from Stonehenge?

                                 CALVIN
                        Sure am, fair traveler. This
                        particular fragment was smuggled out
                        by an outcast Druid at great peril to
                        his everlasting soul.

           Burnout waits for the punchline... But it doesn't come.

                                 COLLEGE BURNOUT
                        Whoa... Okay, and uh, I don't suppose
                        you have any, you know...
                                 (
                                  whispers
                                         )
                        Acid.

                                 CALVIN
                        Ah... Knew a guy who bought some
                        acid. One night, he thought the cops
                        were at his door so he ate his whole
                        stash all at once. Now he thinks he's
                        a glass of orange juice. Lives in the
                        nuthouse, terrified that someone's
                        coming to drink him.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        But I do have a special going on all-
                        seeing eyes. Much safer investment.

                                 COLLEGE BURNOUT
                        Uh... No thanks man. I'm cool.

           He sets down the rock and walks out. Calvin turns to Jake.

                                 CALVIN
                        And that, Jake, is why you shouldn't
                        do drugs.

           They exchange a smile. Jake continues perusing the aisles.

                                 CALVIN
                        And what about you, young warlock?
                        What's calling out to you today?

           Jake hesitates... Then reaches into his pocket and pulls out
           the crinkled drawing of the Dark Figure.

                                 JAKE
                        Do you have any books on monsters
                        that look like this?

           He hands the drawing to Calvin, who looks it over. While
           drawn by a young hand, its effect is still chilling.
                                 CALVIN
                        Hmm... Those look like... Claws of
                        some kind. And blood. Likely
                        carnivorous. You see it in a late
                        night movie or something?

                                 JAKE
                        It was in my bedroom.

           Calvin's brow furrows. That got his attention.

                                 JAKE
                        I saw it once when I was little. Then
                        it happened again last night. I know
                        that sounds crazy, but I swear to God
                        I was wide awake. Like I could feel
                        its breath on my face. It was
                        there... And then it vanished.

                                 CALVIN
                        Vanished?

                                 JAKE
                        Into thin air.

           Calvin takes another look at the drawing, concern growing.

                                 CALVIN
                        Well in that case, I've got good news
                        and bad news, Jakey-boy. The good
                        news is, I know of no monsters that
                        call bedrooms their domain. Lycans,
                        chupacabras, yetis, and the like,
                        they're nocturnal, but generally keep
                        to the outdoors. The bad news is...
                        The recurrence of these spectral
                        encounters concerns me.

                                 JAKE
                        Spectral encounters?

                                 CALVIN
                        Monsters don't vanish into thin
                        air... I think you're being haunted.

           We can almost see the color drain from Jake's face.

                                 CALVIN
                        Now, most spirits are harmless. Just
                        reflections of gentle-minded souls.
                        They've merely lost their way and
                        occasionally bump into us on their
                        celestial journey. But this...
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALVIN (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  points to drawing)
                        Is not one of those spirits.
                                 (
                                  smiles reassuringly
                                                    )
                        Not to worry though. You've come to
                        the right place. Follow me.

           Jake tails Calvin as he moves between the shelves, grabbing
           items and piling them into Jake's arms.

                                 CALVIN
                        Hang these rosemary wreaths around
                        your room. And these garlic strands
                        too. Then burn this sage like incense
                        before going to sleep. Oh, and make a
                        salt circle around your bed. I'm all
                        sold out, but table salt is fine.
                        Non-iodized preferably.

           He turns, seeing how unnerved his nephew is.

                                 CALVIN
                        You're gonna be fine, Jake... A
                        restful night's slumber awaits.

           A PHONE RINGS. Calvin's head whips around. Only it's not the
           ordinary phone on the counter. The ringing comes from a
           NUCLEAR RED ROTARY PHONE in the BACK OFFICE.

                                 CALVIN
                        Uh oh, gotta skedaddle. Let me know
                        if you have any more problems!

           He races for the red phone, leaving Jake standing there.

                                 CALVIN (INTO PHONE)
                        Warlock here. This line is secure.
                                 (
                                  listens
                                        )
                        Crop circles in Kansas City?! Can
                        this be corroborated?

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- DAY

           Jake steps out, arms full of Calvin's random stuff.

                                 LEXINGTON (O.S.)
                        I swear, every time that damn bat
                        phone rings, Calvin's whole world
                        stops spinning.

           Jake turns to see LEXINGTON GALBRAITH (40s), stooped with a
           hangdog expression, sweeping the sidewalk outside his store:
           "LaserDisc Land - Format of the Future."
                                 LEXINGTON
                        What was it this time? Sand worm
                        infestation under the Earth's crust?
                        Venomous snakes in the ball pit at
                        Chuck E. Cheese?

                                 JAKE
                        Something about crop circles.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Ha! Of course... Probably the
                        Lobstermen of Gamma Seven trying to
                        enslave the human race.
                                  chuckles
                                 (
                                         )
                        World would be a boring place without
                        folks like your Uncle to keep it
                        interesting, eh kid?

           Jake nods.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- DAY

           Jake rides towards home, passing nondescript houses along
           the tree-lined street. Bike basket overflowing with his
           spiritual cleansing supplies.

           SPLASH! A SODA CAN HITS HIM, rocketing soda into the air,
           causing him to nearly crash, ALL THE SUPPLIES TUMBLING OUT.

           TWO BOYS ride by on bikes, laughing their asses off. PERCY
           (12), small but cruel, and TERRY (12), an oaf for his age.

                                 PERCY
                        What's all that shit for, fat ass?
                        Doing a ritual to summon some balls?

           Hearing them laugh hurts Jake more than anything. He watches
           them pass out of sight.

           Then he climbs off his bike and picks up the various items
           off the ground, putting them all back in his basket. 

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Rosemary wreaths and garlic strands hang over the bed and
           desk. Sage smokes on the nightstand. Salt forms a protective
           circle around the bed, where Jake sleeps soundly...

           Until A ROSEMARY WREATH FALLS.

           Jake's eyes open. He sits up, looking around... But there's
           nothing there. He sighs. It's fine. Lays back down to sleep. 

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud...
           And Jake's eyes snap open, heart filling with dread.

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud... Along with that GHOSTLY WAIL.

           Jake doesn't dare move, staring at his half-open door. Fear
           swirling as the footsteps draw closer... And closer... Thud,
           Thud... Thud, Thud... Until they stop.

           Jake sits up. But he can't see anything out in the hallway.
           Only darkness. His shallow breaths the only sound.

           Gathering his courage, he tiptoes out of bed. The floor
           creaks as he draws closer to the door... Closer...

           Steeling himself, he looks out into the hallway and sees --

           Nothing.

           Phew. The tension fades from his body, as he pushes the door
           closed. Turns to head to bed --

           And THE DARK FIGURE REACHES OUT OF THE DARKNESS FOR HIM.

           JAKE SCREAMS, startling back into the door. He frantically
           turns on the light --

           And THE FIGURE IS GONE. Jake glances around, still reeling,
           certain he saw it.

           Then he notices part of the SALT CIRCLE HAS BEEN SMUDGED.
           Maybe he did it... Or maybe something else did. He grabs the
           salt off his dresser and pours more, filling the gap.

                                 CALVIN (PRE-LAP)
                        This is more serious than I thought.

           INT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- DAY

           Jake follows Calvin as he refills jars of ingredients.

                                 JAKE
                        But I did everything you said! It
                        just came back, like none of that
                        stuff was even there.

                                 CALVIN
                        Spiritual cleansers work wonders on
                        most entities. But if a ghost is
                        particularly powerful, it'll cut
                        through them like ectoplasmic butter.
                                 JAKE
                        My mom uses salt and rosemary to make
                        chicken. Don't you have anything
                        stronger?

                                 CALVIN
                        Like chili powder? Jalapenos? Spirits
                        don't work like that.

           He puts back the remaining ingredient jars, ruminating.

                                 CALVIN
                        Have you visited any graveyards
                        lately? Or been fiddling around with
                        a Ouija board?

                                 JAKE
                        No. No way.

                                 CALVIN
                        What about your mom... Has she
                        witnessed any anomalies?

                                 JAKE
                        No. Only me.

                                 CALVIN
                        Hmm... Well, young minds are more
                        receptive to supernatural energies.
                        But it's still peculiar...
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Do you remember what happened when
                        you first saw it?

           The question hangs... Not what Jake wants to talk about.

                                 CALVIN
                        Information is power, Jake.
                        Especially against the unknown.

                                 JAKE
                        I... It was...

                                                              FLASH CUT:

           YOUNG JAKE (5) stands frozen in the dark hallway outside his
           room, taking sharp breaths, tears filling his terrified
           eyes... We hear the horrific GHOSTLY WAIL --

                                                          BACK TO SCENE:

                                 JAKE
                        It was a long time ago... I don't
                        really remember.
           Calvin studies him, recognizing that's a lie.

                                 CALVIN
                        Okay. It's just... Well, to be
                        honest, it doesn't make sense.

                                 JAKE
                        Which part?

                                 CALVIN
                        Your house isn't haunted. No one's
                        ever been murdered on the premises --
                        at least not to my knowledge. It's
                        not built on a burial ground. Even if
                        it was, I perform a cleansing ritual
                        on it every harvest just to be safe.
                        Unless...
                                 (
                                  a new thought
                                              )
                        We're dealing with a wandering ghost.

                                 JAKE
                        A wandering ghost?

                                 CALVIN
                        Ordinary ghosts are restrained. To a
                        house, an orphanage, a graveyard. But
                        a wandering ghost has no such
                        bindings. It can leave its resting
                        place and go out looking for
                        something... Or someone.

           We can almost feel the shiver run down Jake's spine.

                                 JAKE
                        But why me?

                                 CALVIN
                        Difficult to say. Though negative
                        energy has been know to attract
                        malevolent spirits. And from what
                        I've ascertained, there's been a lot
                        of negative energy in your household
                        lately...

           Jake's eyes fall, not wanting to go there.

                                 CALVIN
                        Now a conventional thinker might
                        suggest that what you saw was some
                        kind of metaphorical representation
                        of these recent events... But you
                        felt a real presence. Something
                        unnatural.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALVIN (cont'd)
                        And now that it's found its way back
                        into your life, it's going to keep
                        coming back.

                                 JAKE
                        But why'd it come in the first place?
                        I was just a little kid then, there
                        wasn't as much... Negative energy.

                                 CALVIN
                        That's the mystery we have to
                        unravel. But pursuing a wandering
                        ghost in your home won't do us any
                        good. It can wander away, and then
                        wander back again... So we need to
                        find where it wandered from. Could be
                        where it's buried. Could be where it
                        died. Could be where it was murdered.
                        And my guess is it's somewhere
                        nearby...

           His ominous words weigh heavily on Jake.

                                 CALVIN
                        Now I happen to be a bit of an expert
                        on local lore. And there are places
                        around our town known for their
                        paranormal disturbances. We can
                        investigate them one by one. Once we
                        find the right place, we can figure
                        out who this ghost was, and why it's
                        haunting you. Then comes the tricky
                        part... Confronting it.

                                 JAKE
                        Confronting it? You want to confront
                        this thing?

                                 CALVIN
                        Well technically, it's your ghost, so
                        you have to confront it. But I'll be
                        by your side the whole time. 

           Dread fills Jake's eyes. He takes a few steps back.

                                 CALVIN
                        Jake? What were you expecting?

                                 JAKE
                        I don't know, I figured you'd have
                        something in the shop we could use.
                        You know, from a distance.
                                 CALVIN
                        For most poltergeists, sure. But not
                        for what you're describing.

                                 JAKE
                        Well what if I just ignore it?

                                 CALVIN
                        Jake, as your elder, I have some
                        tragic wisdom for you... No
                        significant problem has ever been
                        solved by ignoring it.

           He steps forward and takes a knee, coming to Jake's level.

                                 CALVIN
                        This ghost won't go away until it
                        either gets what it wants, or you
                        force it to leave... And the longer
                        you let it linger, the harder it will
                        be to rid yourself of it.

           Jake doesn't respond, absorbing his Uncle's words...

                                 CALVIN
                        Being haunted is a terrible way to
                        live... And it'll only get worse.
                        Specters of malice can drive good
                        people mad. Loved ones become
                        helpless to intervene. It's a... A
                        life of desolation...

           He drifts off momentarily... Something deeper buried there.
           Then looks back to Jake.

                                 CALVIN
                        But venturing into the domains of
                        spirits is no small matter either.
                        The question is... How brave are you?

           Jake looks into his Uncle's resolute eyes.

                                 JAKE
                        I... I'm not like you.

                                 CALVIN
                        I think you're braver than you give
                        yourself credit for.

                                 JAKE
                        I think you give me too much credit.

           They hold each other's gaze... Then -- DING! From the door.
           Jake and Calvin turn as --
           A Native American boy steps inside. Athletic build with
           empathetic eyes. He takes in the store, curiosity piqued.
           We'll soon learn his name is BILLY YELLOWBIRD (12).

                                 CALVIN
                        More on this later.
                                 (
                                  to Billy
                                         )
                        Greetings, fair traveler. What
                        mysteries do you seek?

                                 BILLY
                        My... My setsuné just died.

                                 CALVIN
                        Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about your
                        grandmother. How can I help?

                                 BILLY
                        It happened so fast, I... I never got
                        to say goodbye. I was wondering if
                        you do those things where you, you
                        know... Talk to dead people?

                                 CALVIN
                        A seance? Don't recommend em', too
                        hard to find a reliable medium these
                        days. But I do have something you
                        might be interested in...
                                 (
                                  to Jake
                                        )
                        And you as well...

           He begins rummaging around a nearby storage closet.

                                 CALVIN
                        Have you met my nephew? He's into
                        dead people too. So to speak.

           Billy turns to Jake, who's caught off guard.

                                 JAKE
                        I mean, sort of. Not really.

                                 BILLY
                        I'm Billy. Just moved here.

                                 JAKE
                        Jake. Born here.

           Calvin comes back to them with a BATTERED OLD SUITCASE. Sets
           it on the counter and unlatches the brass clamps.

                                 CALVIN
                        Alright, step closer. You too, Jake.
                        This here is called a Spirit Phone...
           He opens the suitcase, revealing an old PHONOGRAPH PLAYER.
           Rods, sprockets, and gears covered in dust. Though its wires
           are curiously connected to a more modern SPEAK & SPELL TOY.

                                 BILLY
                        What's it do?

                                 CALVIN
                        Opens a connection, as they say. But
                        it's very unorthodox. Using a spirit
                        phone is like patching into a party
                        line. It won't just be your grandma
                        on the other end. There's a million
                        spirits floating around. And not all
                        the dead mean us well...

           He exchanges a glance with Jake.

                                 BILLY
                        Let's do it.

           Jake turns, impressed. Because this sure freaks him out.

                                 CALVIN
                        Then let's see if anyone picks up...

           He plugs in the Spirit Phone... Jake tenses as an EERIE HUM
           RISES. Calvin holds out the Speak & Spell to Billy.

                                 CALVIN
                        Just type your grandmother's name.

           Jake watches with bated breath as Billy types the letters
           one by one. W-A-U-B-U-N.

                                 CALVIN
                        Waubun... Lovely name.

           Billy presses enter... The device speaks in its creepy
           voice: WAAaaauuBUN...

           And THE PHONOGRAPH'S SPROCKETS AND COGS BEGIN MOVING. Jake
           watches, eyes widening, as its turn table spins around...

           Then STRANGE NOISES emanate from its horn... THROBS and
           BURRS... Difficult to make out.... Like someone twisting the
           tuner on a radio without slowing to find a station.

           Jake grips the counter, anxiety rising. Billy watches, just
           as tense. But Calvin is focused, in his element.

           The sounds begin to take on more shape and weight... Like
           DISTANT SCREAMS distorted across sonic frequencies...
           And SOMEONE BREATHING... EERIE BREATHING...

           Jake listens... He wants out of here.

           THE SOUNDS CUT OUT. And an uneasy silence takes hold,
           everyone staring at the machine...

                                 CALVIN
                        That was... Hah-ho! A little intense.

           They laugh nervously. Jake releases his white-knuckle grip
           on the counter.

                                 CALVIN
                        But I don't think we heard her. Just
                        atmospheric harmonics. Might have
                        tuned into a distorted radio feed.
                        Nothing more than harmless signals.

                                 JAKE
                        Signals...

           He nods, trying to convince himself that's all it was.

                                 BILLY
                        Is there anything else we can do?

           Jake turns, seeing how much this means to him. Calvin thinks
           it over.

                                 CALVIN
                        Has your grandmother been...
                        Officially laid to rest yet?

                                 BILLY
                        No. But we brought her to the funeral
                        home two days ago.

                                 CALVIN
                        That explains it. We don't have much
                        time then. We'd better go tonight.

                                 JAKE
                        Go where?
                                 (
                                          )
                                  realizing
                        You can't be serious...

                                 CALVIN
                        Only if you're up for it.

           Billy turns to Jake expectantly.

                                 BILLY
                        I'll go if you will...
           Jake's on the hot seat. Hard to say no to someone his age...

           EXT. FUNERAL HOME -- NIGHT

           A CREEPY BUILDING overlooking the CEMETERY. Dark at this
           hour. Calvin, Jake, and Billy park their bikes nearby.

                                 CALVIN
                        Onward. Our mission awaits.

           Calvin darts around the side of the building. Billy follows,
           Jake lagging behind. Calvin stops at a SIDE DOOR.

                                 CALVIN
                        This leads to the embalming room.
                        Behind it is death. Sanitary and
                        sterilized, but still death. Billy,
                        are you sure you want to go through
                        with this?

           Billy nods.

                                 CALVIN
                        And you, Jake?

           Jake sees the look on Billy's face, urging him on. He nods.

           Calvin pulls out a KEY.

                                 BILLY
                        Where'd you get that?

                                 CALVIN
                        Those of us who traipse about the
                        underworld have our connections.

           He inserts the key into the lock and opens the door. Pulls
           out a FLASHLIGHT. And leads them inside --

           INT. FUNERAL HOME -- CONTINUOUS

           Jake follows close behind the others, as Calvin's flashlight
           beam illuminates the creepy embalming equipment. WASHTUBS.
           GLASS CANISTERS OF LIQUID. STAINLESS STEEL TABLES.

           And a wall of VAULTS.

           Calvin holds a finger to his lips. Stay quiet. Then leads
           them over, their footsteps the only sound. Jake watches
           tensely as Calvin scans the vaults, finding the right one.

                                 CALVIN
                        This is hers... You ready?
           Billy nods. Calvin looks to Jake, who nods too. Then Calvin
           flips the latches on the vault, the sound echoing. He grabs
           the handle. A METALLIC CREAK as he slowly PULLS OUT THE
           SLAB... Crrrreeeeaaaakkk... Revealing --

           A DEAD MAN. Lips like papery worms. Teeth gray and cracked.
           Jake and Billy recoil at the sight.

                                 CALVIN
                        Sorry... My fault.
                                 (
                                  to body
                                        )
                        Humblest apologies for disturbing
                        you, sir. Back to your eternal rest.

           He pushes the vault shut.

                                 CALVIN
                        Wait... I know where she is.

           He heads off another direction. Billy gives Jake a look. Is
           your uncle for real? Jake shrugs. They move on into the --

           STAGING ROOM

           Where a CASKET rests, illuminated by eerie moonlight.

                                 CALVIN
                        She's in there, Billy. I promise.

           Billy hesitantly approaches the casket. Turns back to Jake -
           are you coming? Jake takes a breath, then moves to follow.
           Billy puts his hand on the lid and slowly lifts...

           Inside lies an OLD WOMAN, pale but peaceful. Face serene.

           Billy stares, holding back his swirling emotions. Jake
           stands there, not sure what to do.

           Then Billy leans forward, whispering words we don't hear to
           his grandmother. When he's finished, he gently touches her
           cheek. Takes a shaky breath.

                                 BILLY
                        We can go now.

           Calvin closes the casket.

           Together, they make their way towards the door. But Jake
           suddenly freezes as he sees --

           A SHADOWY FIGURE standing on the far side of the room,
           watching them. But as Jake focuses, he sees it's not the
           Figure that's been haunting him. It's the UNDERTAKER (50s).
           Calvin grabs Jake by the shoulders and leads him out. But as
           he does, we see Calvin exchange a knowing look with the
           Undertaker... Who returns a subtle nod.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- NIGHT

           Jake, Calvin, and Billy ride their bikes down the street.

                                 BILLY
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah, sure. It was fun.
                                     )
                                 (
                                  beat
                        Maybe fun isn't the right word.

           They laugh, tension bleeding away.

                                 BILLY
                        So you're into ghost stuff too, huh?

           Jake turns to Calvin, who shrugs. It's your call.

                                 JAKE
                        I, I guess so...

                                 BILLY
                        Have you ever seen one?

           Jake hesitates. Then nods.

                                 BILLY
                        Really? What was it like?

                                 JAKE
                        It's...

           How to explain this...

                                 JAKE
                        It's like a nightmare... But real.
                        Like every bad feeling in your whole
                        life hitting you all at once.

                                 BILLY
                        Shit. That sounds way worse than the
                        ghost stories I've read.

                                 CALVIN
                        In my experiences, truth is often
                        scarier than fiction.
                                 BILLY
                        So what are you gonna do? Is your
                        family gonna have to move?

                                 JAKE
                        I... I don't know...

           But Billy lingers, waiting for more.

                                 JAKE
                        Actually... My Uncle and I were
                        thinking of... Doing some ghost
                        hunting. To try and track down the
                        one I keep seeing.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        Maybe you'd wanna come?

           Calvin's pride shines through in a subtle smile.

                                 BILLY
                        Seriously?! Of course! Wait, where
                        are you going?

                                 CALVIN
                        Just some sites around town. Places
                        where the film between our world and
                        the spirit realm is as thin as the
                        skin on a soap bubble. Things go
                        slip-sliding through all the time.

                                 BILLY
                        Hell yeah, that sounds awesome!

                                 CALVIN
                        We could make it a regular thing...
                        Say Saturday nights? The Saturday
                        Night Ghost Club...

           Their eyes meet, liking the sound of it. Billy slows to a
           stop by a driveway in front of a modest home.

                                 BILLY
                        Well, this is me... Guess I'll see
                        you guys on Saturday.

           He rides towards the house. Jake smiles, Calvin patting him
           on the shoulder. It's nice to have a friend.

           EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Jake and Calvin slow their bikes outside Jake's house. As
           they do, the front door opens. Cecilia steps out, carrying
           trash to the cans.
                                 CECILIA
                        Little late, Cal...

                                 CALVIN
                        Don't know what happened. All of a
                        sudden, the sun was down and the moon
                        was up. Must've forgotten to flip
                        over my hourglass.

                                 JAKE
                        I was just helping Uncle C restock
                        the shop.

                                 CECILIA
                        I called the shop.

           She drops the trash in the can and eyes them expectantly.

                                 CALVIN
                        My sincerest apologies, Cecilia. I 
                        was on a very important call --
                        Speaking of which, and this is highly
                        classified, but I got a most
                        disconcerting tip that rabid, blood
                        sucking, vampire bats escaped from a
                        testing lab in the area. Have you
                        been watching the skies lately?

           Cecilia smirks, but quickly hides it.

                                 CECILIA
                        I'm pretty sure they've been clear,
                        but we'll keep an eye out. Jake, put
                        your bike away and come in. Thanks
                        for giving him something to do, Cal. 

                                 JAKE
                        I'll be right there, mom.

           She steps back inside. He immediately turns to Calvin.

                                 JAKE
                        We can't tell her what we're doing.
                        She'd freak.

                                 CALVIN
                        Agreed. My sister's a good egg, but
                        she's not a true believer. So for her
                        sake, let's keep our club a secret
                        for members only.

           Jake holds up his pinkie finger.
                                 JAKE
                        By the oath of the White Mage?

           Calvin smiles and links his finger with Jake's.

                                 CALVIN
                        By the oath of the White Mage. See
                        you Saturday, Jakey-boy.

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           WIND BLOWS outside, causing a TREE BRANCH TO SCRATCH AGAINST
           THE WINDOW. Scratch... Scratch... Scratch...

           Jake stares at it from his bed, imagining the worst.
           Scratch... Scratch...

           He rolls the other way, forcing himself to ignore it. But
           then another sound rises above --

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud...

           And Jake can't ignore those. He sits up in bed, staring at
           his closed bedroom door.

           Thud, Thud... Then that same GHOSTLY WAIL... Thud, Thud...  

           Jake springs out of bed, TURNING ON ALL THE LIGHTS. Then
           approaches the door with trepidation. Slowly opens it --

           Light spills out of his room into the hallway beyond. But
           there's nothing out there.

           Jake closes his door. Turns, taking in his room. He's the
           only one here.

           And yet, he senses something... Something lurking just out
           of sight. He takes a deep, steadying breath.

                                 JAKE
                        We're gonna find you...

           If the ghost is here, it doesn't respond.

           But the tree branch continues to scratch against the window.
           Scratch... Scratch... Scratch...

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- DAY

           Jake walks alone. He didn't sleep much last night.

                                 PERCY (O.S.)
                        Hey Jake!
           Jake looks up -- SOMETHING HITS HIS HEAD and bounces off --

           BANG! A FIRECRACKER EXPLODES with a loud POP! Causing Jake
           to stumble back and fall.

           Percy and Terry approach, holding more FIRECRACKERS.

                                 PERCY
                        Happy early Fourth of July!

           Jake glares up at them, eyes filled with rage. Percy stands
           over him, delighting in his torture.

                                 PERCY
                        Here's the problem, Jake... My street
                        has a strict weight limit. City
                        ordinance or some shit. And you're
                        way over the max. So we're gonna have
                        to blow some of that excess lard off.

           Terry hands him another FIRECRACKER. Percy holds a LIGHTER
           to its fuse.

                                 PERCY
                        T-minus ten seconds. Ten... Nine...

           Jake realizes he's serious. Scrambles to his feet and runs.

                                 PERCY
                        Eight.. Seven... Ah, screw it --

           He winds up to throw the firecracker --

           CRACK! A ROCK NAILS HIM IN THE FOREHEAD! He drops the
           firecracker and it EXPLODES NEAR THEIR FEET, causing them to
           jump away. Jake looks over to see --

           Billy standing across the street... And beside him is his
           older sister, DOVE YELLOWBIRD (14). A skater girl with bell
           bottoms, dyed hair, tank top, and backwards hat. An aura of
           unpredictability about her.

           Jake stares, completely taken by her presence. She may as
           well be an angel... A bad ass, skater-girl angel. 

                                 DOVE
                        News flash, ass clowns. We live on
                        this street too.

                                 PERCY
                        If you think I won't hit a girl, you
                        got another thing comin', bitch!

           Billy steps forward, but Dove yanks him back.
                                 DOVE
                        I'll take that as a compliment,
                        coming from you. A bitch can push out
                        a baby the size of a watermelon and
                        live to tell the tale. But if I were
                        to throw this rock at your scrawny
                        dick, you'd die a virgin.  

           SHE TOSSES A BIGGER ROCK in her hand. Now Percy's having
           second thoughts. Jake watches, in awe of this girl.

                                 DOVE
                        Did I mention I played baseball for
                        six years? Pitcher. On the boys team.
                        But coach said I threw too wild. So
                        if I miss your baby dick, I'll
                        probably hit your teeth. But they
                        look like they could use some fixing.

           Percy suddenly becomes self-conscious of his buckteeth. Dove
           holds up the rock, a fierceness in her eyes.

                                 DOVE
                        You gave him ten seconds. I'll give
                        you three. Three... Two...

           Percy and Terry take off running. Dove watches them go. Then
           turns to Jake and Billy with a smirk.

                                 DOVE
                        Well, that's my good deed for the
                        year. See you boys around.

           And just like that, she skates off in the other direction,
           leaving Jake mind blown. Billy comes up to him.

                                 BILLY
                        That's my sister, Dove... She's sorta
                        like that.

           Jake stares after her, the lightning bolt of first love.

                                 BILLY
                        You doing anything today?

           EXT. POND, FOREST -- DAY

           Jake and Billy sit at the edge of a secluded pond, sharing a
           box of candy.

                                 BILLY
                        How come no one else comes here? It's
                        not like a toxic waste dump, is it?
                                 JAKE
                        Naw, it's just my secret hangout.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Well, not really secret. It used to
                        be Percy and me's hangout.

                                 BILLY
                        Who's Percy?

                                 JAKE
                        The guy with the firecrackers.

                                 BILLY
                        You were friends with that prick?

                                 JAKE
                        Just for a summer. He was the new kid
                        in town once too.

                                 BILLY
                        Don't want friends like that anyway.

           Jake nods. But the memory weighs on him...

                                 JAKE
                        Do you really wanna be my friend? Or
                        do you just not know anyone else yet?

                                 BILLY
                        I think you're cool, man. And your
                        Uncle's awesome.

                                 JAKE
                        Thanks. He is pretty awesome.

                                 BILLY
                        Do you really wanna be my friend? Or
                        do you just like my sister?

           Jake chokes on his candy.

                                 JAKE
                        What are you talking about? That's
                        totally not --

                                 BILLY
                        Back home, guys would hang out with
                        me just so they could be around Dove.

                                 JAKE
                        That's... That's crazy.

                                 BILLY
                        She takes pills, you know.
           A moment as Jake absorbs this.

                                 JAKE
                        She's sick?

                                 BILLY
                        Kind of. I don't know. She's been to
                        all these doctors. I mean, she
                        doesn't look sick. She's just not
                        always wired right, up here.
                                 (
                                                   )
                                  points to his head
                        My mom says, Dove acts like the
                        sun... In this never-ending state of
                        heat and light that would burn the
                        rest of us up. Or something like
                        that.

                                 JAKE
                        Whoa...

                                 BILLY
                        Just watch out for her, man. Dove
                        acts cool and tough, but I only hang
                        out with her 'cause my mom makes me.

                                 JAKE
                        But I thought she had a lot of
                        friends. All those guys you said --

                                 BILLY
                        Those weren't friends. They weren't
                        hanging around 'cause they wanted to
                        go roller blading or take her to a
                        dance, if you know what I mean.

           Jake nods, but is no less enamored.

                                 BILLY
                        At least she had a doctor she didn't
                        hate back where we lived. But now
                        it's like starting all over.

                                 JAKE
                        So why'd you guys move then?

           Billy hesitates.

                                 BILLY
                        My mom got a new job.

           That's definitely a lie. But Jake doesn't press.
           INT. KITCHEN, JAKE'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Cecilia sits at the kitchen table, working her way through
           bills while eating leftovers at the same time.

           Jake comes from his room, carrying a BACKPACK.

                                 JAKE
                        Hey... Uncle Calvin and me are gonna
                        have a movie night, and then I was
                        gonna stay over. That okay?

                                 CECILIA
                        Just nothing R-rated, okay? I don't
                        want a repeat of last time.

                                 JAKE
                        Duly noted.

           He shoulders his backpack and heads for the door.

                                 CECILIA
                        Hey Jake.

           He turns to face her. She hesitates... But then just says --

                                 CECILIA
                        Just call if you need anything, okay?

                                 JAKE
                        Okay, mom.

                                 CECILIA
                        You know what, why don't I just pick
                        the movie.

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- EVENING

           Lights glow inside the old shop, decidedly eerier when the
           sun begins to set. A fitting home for a Ghost Club.

           INT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- EVENING

           The door dings as Jake steps in. Calvin looks up from
           putting supplies in his satchel.

                                 CALVIN
                        Make up a good story for your mom?

                                 JAKE
                        I said we're doing a movie night. But
                        she said she had to pick the movie.
                                 CALVIN
                        What's wrong with my movies?
                                  off Jake's look
                                 (
                                                )
                        What? The Exorcist is educational.

                                 JAKE
                        And probably why she sent this.

           Jake pulls out a VHS tape of The Sandlot.

                                 CALVIN
                        Talk about no practical value.

                                 LEXINGTON (O.S.)
                        Not to mention VHS.

           He steps out of the bathroom.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        LaserDisc, Jake, tell your mom
                        everything's going laser.

                                 CALVIN
                        Jake, I beg your forgiveness. I let
                        the secrecy of our club slip to Lex
                        here and he wanted to come along.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Every club needs an adult chaperone.

           The door dings as Billy walks in... Followed by Dove. Jake's
           heart skips a beat.

                                 BILLY
                                 (
                                  begrudgingly
                                             )
                        Hey... Is it alright if my sister
                        comes too?

                                 CALVIN
                        I'd never turn away a seeker of
                        knowledge. So long as Jake is cool
                        with it.

                                 (
                                 JAKE
                                  voice cracking
                                               )
                        I'm cool.

                                 DOVE
                        And here I thought I'd need to submit
                        a personal essay.
                                 CALVIN
                        Your application is hereby approved.
                        I'm Calvin, this is Lex, and this
                        here is Jake. Our club's founder.

           Jake manages a shy wave.

                                 DOVE
                        Fancy. I'm Dove Yellowbird.
                                  looks around
                                 (
                                             )
                        So where'd you get all this weird
                        shit anyway?

                                 CALVIN
                        Oh, it comes from all over. This
                        charm amulet here? From Egypt. This
                        monkey's paw? Morocco. And this all-
                        seeing eye is from Romania.

                                 DOVE
                        And if it all came from a warehouse
                        in Taiwan, your clientele wouldn't
                        know the difference, amirite?

                                 CALVIN
                        Ah... A skeptic. We'll see if we can
                        make a believer out of you yet.
                        Alright gang, gather in. Let's call
                        this club's first meeting to order.

           He takes center stage... All eyes on him.

                                 CALVIN
                        After extensive research, I've
                        determined the first spiritually
                        charged locale for investigation. But
                        before we venture forth... A warning.
                        We're searching for the spectral
                        remnants of those who were suddenly
                        and brutally robbed of life.
                        Grotesque entities that still crave
                        closure... And perhaps vengeance.
                        Those who are ready to make this
                        trek, step outside... Those who
                        aren't, there's always Nickelodeon.

           EXT. FOREST ROAD -- NIGHT

           Flashlight beams pierce the darkness as Calvin leads the
           group down a seldom used DIRT PATH THROUGH THE WOODS.

                                 JAKE
                        Where exactly are we going?
                                 CALVIN
                        If I told you, you might think better
                        of coming.

           That's not reassuring. The path narrows, but Calvin doesn't
           slow. He pushes through branches, and they emerge into a --

           CLEARING

           Nestled amongst the trees, overgrown train tracks running
           through. Up ahead an ABANDONED TRAIN TUNNEL waits. Its dark
           mouth open and haunting, like it descends straight to hell.

                                 CALVIN
                        Welcome to the Screaming Tunnel.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Let's get a fire going. Then I'll
                        tell you all a real ghost story.

           EXT. THE SCREAMING TUNNEL -- LATER

           A CAMPFIRE crackles, casting deep shadows on the group
           sitting around it. The Screaming Tunnel lurking behind them.

                                 CALVIN
                        There used to be a house not too far
                        from here... A little wood-frame
                        jobbie that a family lived in... A
                        mother, father, and their only son...

           His voice is low, drawing his audience in. A storyteller.

                                 CALVIN
                        But life wasn't easy for that boy...
                        A childhood accident left him with a
                        scar from brow to chin.

           He runs a slicing finger down his face.

                                 CALVIN
                        And as he grew, so too did his scar.
                        You can imagine what happened when
                        the other kids got a look at him. His
                        only refuge was to wander these
                        woods, finding peace amongst the
                        trees and brooks. A lonely life...

           Jake leans in, the story hitting home.

                                 CALVIN
                        Until one night... When he became a
                        legend... An ordinary night, not so
                        different than this one...
           Jake's eyes are drawn to the GLOWING EMBERS cast out by the
           fire. He watches as they transition into --

           FIREFLIES in the twilight. And now we are in...

           CALVIN'S GHOST STORY

           A BOY (12) WITH A SCARRED FACE and 1950s clothing emerges
           from a trail, carrying a stick that he swings at the grass.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        He was out on his own, as he usually
                        was, when they came...

           The Boy looks up to see a handful of KIDS approaching, the
           kind who prey on weaklings.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        They said they wanted to play a game,
                        and were one person short. Maybe he
                        was ignorant of their motives, or
                        maybe he was too afraid to resist.
                        Either way, the trap was set...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Darkness falls as the Boy and the others stand before the
           Screaming Tunnel, staring into its gaping black mouth.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        They told him he'd get to go first...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The Boy tentatively advances into the darkness, a LIT MATCH
           his torch. The others just behind him with matches of their
           own, little balls of flame in the blackness.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        Though no matter how far he went,
                        they kept telling him to go just a
                        little bit further...

           The Boy doesn't notice as THE MATCHES BEHIND HIM GET FURTHER
           AWAY... AND EVENTUALLY DISAPPEAR.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        But soon, the poor boy realized that
                        this was no game anymore.

           The Boy turns, realizing he's all alone... Panic sets in. He
           moves his match this way, that way. But he's in a void.
                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        They likely expected he'd stumble his
                        way out. That they'd have a great
                        laugh at his expense. But darkness
                        has a way of swallowing you whole.

           The Boy's MATCH GOES OUT, plunging him into PITCH BLACK
           NOTHINGNESS. His frenzied breaths echo.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        But then came a glimmer of hope...

           A FAINT LIGHT reveals the Boy's scarred face. A DISTANT GLOW
           at the end of the tunnel, beckoning him...

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        Perhaps he thought that his 'friends'
                        had come back for him. Or that
                        morning had already come...

           The Boy frantically runs towards the light...

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        But sometimes, what we so desperately
                        seek, is the very thing we should be
                        running away from...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The other kids loiter outside the tunnel, waiting for him to
           emerge. Just a silly prank to them.

           But they all freeze when they hear a TRAIN WHISTLE RINGING
           OUT from within the tunnel... Realizing...

           Then THE BOY'S EAR-PIERCING SCREAM echoes from inside,
           before going abruptly silent.

                                                         BACK TO PRESENT:

                                 CALVIN
                        And that, is why they call it... The
                        Screaming Tunnel.

           Jake, Dove, and Billy stare wide-eyed at Calvin. Even
           Lexington is freaked out.

                                 DOVE
                        Holy shit...

                                 CALVIN
                        The legend says, if you go into this
                        tunnel at night and strike a match,
                        you'll see him there... Watching you.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALVIN (cont'd)
                        Then your match will go out, even if
                        there's not a hint of a breeze... And
                        then, it's just you and him in the
                        darkness.

           If Jake was nervous before, he's terrified now.

                                 CALVIN
                        Time to see if the legend is true.

           He reaches into his satchel and pulls out a BOX OF MATCHES.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Really, Cal? You'll scare the bloody
                        daylights out of 'em.

                                 BILLY
                        I want to do it!

                                 DOVE
                        Hell yeah! Me too.

           Once again, all eyes on Jake. He feels the pressure.

                                 BILLY
                        Come on, Jake. This is what we're
                        here for, right?

           Jake nods. Calvin smiles and gets to his feet. The others
           follow, looking towards the tunnel. But Jake approaches
           Calvin, speaking softly so the others can't hear.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin, the ghost I saw... It
                        didn't look anything like --

                                 CALVIN
                        Ghosts often look different in death
                        than in life. I'm betting whatever
                        you saw didn't look human at all.

           Jake nods, knowing he's right.

                                 CALVIN
                        We'll find out if this is the right
                        place soon enough.

           He pours water onto the fire, sending hissing steam into the
           air. Then turns on his flashlight, the others doing the
           same. And together, the members of the Saturday Night Ghost
           Club venture towards the tunnel... Its black mouth looming.
           INT. THE SCREAMING TUNNEL -- CONTINUOUS

           The group steps in, flashlight beams wandering. They stay
           close together as they creep forward, footsteps echoing.

           Jake aims his light ahead, but there's only more darkness
           waiting. He hears SOMETHING SKITTER and whips his light
           towards it. But there's nothing there... 

           Then Calvin raises his hand, and they all stop.

                                 CALVIN
                        Everyone turn off your flashlights.

           They all do, except for Jake.

                                 CALVIN
                        Everyone. Or else it won't work.

           Jake turns his off too, plunging them into TOTAL DARKNESS.

           A MATCH FLARES, the beacon held in Calvin's hand. Bright
           enough to see their nervous faces, especially Jake's.

                                 CALVIN
                        Okay now, keep your eyes open...

           Jake forces himself to look past the match's glow... Tense
           seconds pass as they stand huddled together...

           Then the MATCH FLICKERS --

           Jake's eyes narrow ever so slightly, gripped by fear. And in
           the blackness, he sees --

           A FAINT WHITE SHAPE, illuminated by the match's light... A
           SHAPE THAT COULD BE A PERSON. Jake's breath catches --

           The MATCH GOES OUT, plunging him into the black void again.

           And we hear JAKE SCREAM.

                                                                FADE IN:

           EXT. THE SCREAMING TUNNEL -- NIGHT

           JAKE'S POV: Blurry faces come into focus, standing over him.

                                 CALVIN
                        Easy now. Deep breaths. You alright?

           Jake looks up at them, realizing he's lying outside.
                                 JAKE
                        What happened?

                                 BILLY
                        You fainted.

                                 DOVE
                        Went down like a ton of bricks. We
                        carried you out.

           Now Jake's embarrassed. Calvin goes in for the save. 

                                 CALVIN
                        It happens to the best of us.
                        Occupational hazard.

           He reaches down and helps Jake to his feet.

                                 JAKE
                        But you all saw him, right?

                                 DOVE
                        I didn't see shit.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Me neither.

                                 BILLY
                        I saw him... I think.

                                 DOVE
                        Yeah, 'cause you wanted to see him.
                        That's how these things work.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin, did you see him?

           Calvin sees the desperation in his nephew's eyes...

                                 CALVIN
                        Sorry, Jake... It's possible my
                        sensors are a bit rusty.

           And now Jake feels even worse. The others gather their
           things to leave. Billy steps up next to him.

                                 BILLY
                        Jake... Whatever you saw... Did it
                        look anything like --

                                 JAKE
                        No...
           Billy nods. He puts a reassuring hand on Jake's shoulder,
           and walks off... Leaving Jake standing there, staring back
           at the Screaming Tunnel...

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- NIGHT

           The shop is dark. But lights glow in an upstairs window.

           INT. CALVIN'S APARTMENT, ABOVE THE OCCULTORIUM -- NIGHT

           A cozy apartment above the shop. The bare essentials of a
           bachelor, coupled with decorative pieces of macabre art.

           Jake sits at the table, still shaken up. Calvin sets down
           two mugs of hot cocoa with marshmallows and sits.

                                 CALVIN
                        Hey... Just because some of us didn't
                        see him doesn't mean he wasn't there.

                                 JAKE
                        What if Dove's right? What if I just
                        saw what I wanted to see?

                                 CALVIN
                        Does the entity you see at night feel
                        like your imagination?

           Jake shakes his head "no."

                                 CALVIN
                        Belief is a fascinating thing... No
                        living soul has ever seen a god. And
                        yet, if you believe in one, no one
                        calls you crazy. But with ghosts,
                        folks think we're the weird ones for
                        believing, even if we've actually
                        seen them. Humans are a funny bunch.

           Jake smirks, feeling a little better.

                                 JAKE
                        How many ghosts have you seen?

           Calvin ponders the question, sipping his cocoa.

                                 CALVIN
                        Just my share.

           But he doesn't elaborate further.

                                 JAKE
                        I've only seen this one...
           He clenches his cup, but doesn't drink, thoughts weighing
           heavily...

                                 JAKE
                        The first time I saw it, I... I
                        thought it was some kind of monster.

           Calvin stops mid-sip, realizing Jake is opening up...

                                 CALVIN
                        Sounds like you've got your own ghost
                        story. I'm listening if you're ready
                        to tell it.

           Jake takes a shaky breath. Staring down at the marshmallows
           melting in his hot cocoa...

                                 JAKE
                        I... I'm not sure how late it was...

           Off the marshmallows, we TRANSITION INTO --

           WHITE GLOBS rising within a viscous BLACK LIQUID. It's a
           lava lamp on a nightstand, as we find ourselves in --

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

           Young Jake (5) sleeps soundly in bed. A quiet night...

           That's interrupted by the sound of a DOOR CREAKING OPEN
           somewhere in the house.

           Young Jake groggily opens his eyes... He sits up, looking
           around his dark room. But it's quiet. Then --

           Thud, Thud... Those now familiar lumbering footsteps.

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 YOUNG JAKE
                                           )
                        Mom? Dad?

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud...

                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                        I remember feeling my breath rushing
                        in and out. I could hear my clock
                        ticking on the wall. And I felt the
                        cold floor beneath my feet.

           Young Jake swings his bare feet to the cold floor.
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                        I don't know why I went to look... I
                        wish I hadn't. Maybe then it wouldn't
                        have seen me.

           The floor creaks as he tiptoes to the open door... Stepping
           into the --

           HALLWAY

           Where he stares into the darkness... But there's nothing --

           A SHAPE MOVES.

           He gasps, seeing the DARK INHUMAN FIGURE at the end of the
           hall, shrouded in the shadows. STARING RIGHT AT HIM.

           Then IT HOBBLES FORWARD, wobbling, shaking. Thud, Thud...
           Thud, Thud...

           Young Jake stands frozen, taking sharp breaths as it draws
           closer... Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud...

                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                        I wanted to run, but my feet wouldn't
                        move. I opened my mouth to scream,
                        but nothing came out.

           The Figure lets out a GHOSTLY WAIL, piercing Jake's psyche.
           His head cranes back and back as the monstrous Figure
           hobbles ever closer, towering over him.

           It comes to a stop, taking in the minuscule child before it.

           Then it takes one more step forward into the night light
           from Jake's room, giving us our first real look at it...

           Its face is BLACKENED AND CRACKED, like A DECOMPOSING BURN
           VICTIM, with BLOOD SEEPING past its EMPTY WHITE EYES.

           Young Jake can hardly breathe, tears welling up.

           The Figure reaches out a GROTESQUE HAND, CLAWED NAILS
           DRIPPING BLOOD. We hear YOUNG JAKE SCREAM --

           INT. CALVIN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- BACK TO PRESENT

           Jake sits, clutching his mug, scarred by the memory.

                                 JAKE
                        I don't know what happened after.
                                 CALVIN
                        Do you remember what happened earlier
                        that day? Did your folks have an
                        argument perhaps?

                                 JAKE
                        I don't think so. It was just a
                        normal day. I didn't do anything.

                                 CALVIN
                        I know you didn't.

                                 JAKE
                        Then why did it come back?

           He's desperate, looking to his Uncle for answers.

                                 CALVIN
                        Have you talked to your parents about
                        this yet?

                                 JAKE
                        My mom doesn't want to talk about
                        anything. She just wants to pretend
                        like everything is fine. And my dad
                        would never believe me. Even if he
                        was still around, I'd never tell him.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        I don't want to keep feeling like
                        this. I just want it to go away.

                                 CALVIN
                        We're not gonna stop until it does.

           He means it, and that's some comfort.

                                 CALVIN
                        The Screaming Tunnel was just our
                        first stop. There are other more
                        haunted sites to investigate. We'll
                        find it.

           Jake nods warily, knowing the worst is yet to come.

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM, CALVIN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Overstock from the Occultorium clutters the space.

           Jake lies awake in the bed. Sleeping here is even harder
           than at home. His gaze traces over the various trinkets
           stashed about. Skulls. Amulets. Voodoo dolls. All creepier
           in the darkness.

           He rolls over, facing the wall. Trying to get comfortable.
           Then sounds of WHISPERING seep in from another room... Jake
           stirs, listening...

           It's Calvin's voice, speaking groggily in his sleep. Hard to
           make out. But amidst the gibberish, we catch some words.

                                 CALVIN (O.S.)
                        Can't... Over there... I...

           Jake sits up, sensing something isn't right. There's fear in
           his Uncle's voice.

                                 CALVIN (O.S.)
                        No... I don't... Why are...
                                       )
                                 (
                                  louder
                        Stay back! Get out!

           Jake scrambles out of bed --

           HALLWAY

           Jake quickly moves to his Uncle's door, where he hesitates,
           listening... But it's quiet within. He carefully opens it...

           Inside, Calvin sits on his bed, staring off at nothing.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin?

           He doesn't respond. Doesn't move.

                                 JAKE
                        Hey Uncle Calvin, you okay?

           Nothing from Calvin... Then --

                                 CALVIN
                        I'm fine... Just a... Strange dream.

           He turns, seeing his nephew standing there.

                                 CALVIN
                        Back to bed, Jakey-boy. I'm fine.

           Jake nods. Then leaves him be, heading down the hall. But he
           glances back, concerned...

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           A pencil makes jagged strokes on paper, drawing a new image
           of the Dark Figure. Filling in more details.
           Jake sets down his pencil, staring into those haunting white
           eyes, blood seeping past them. Spread around it are more
           SKETCHES OF THE DARK FIGURE.

           He looks to a thick TOME ON GHOSTS open nearby, definitely
           from the Occultorium. Flips through it, comparing pictures
           in the book to his own sketches, searching for a match.
           Searching for a clue. 

           KNOCKING on the front door jars his attention. He scrambles
           to stash everything in the drawer.

           INT. ENTRYWAY, JAKE'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Jake opens the door. His eyes widen as he sees --

           Dove standing outside.

                                 DOVE
                        Oh good. They didn't ship you off to
                        the loony bin.

           She steps in past him without being invited.

                                 DOVE
                        Figured anything was possible after
                        what happened, so thought I'd check
                        in on ya.

                                 JAKE
                        My mom's not home.

                                 DOVE
                        Good for her.

                                 JAKE
                        I... I'm not supposed to have girls
                        over if she's not here.

                                 DOVE
                        Oh... So this happens all the time.

                                 JAKE
                        No...

                                 DOVE
                        Then why's it a rule?

                                 JAKE
                        It's... I just figure she'd be mad.
                                 DOVE
                        Well I won't tell if you won't.

                                     )
                        So whatcha got to eat around here?

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           Jake sits on his bed, munching on a Pop-Tart, watching Dove
           mosey around his room, Pop-Tart in hand. She eyes his quirky
           trinkets. Opens the closet. Peeks in drawers at random.

                                 JAKE
                        What are you doing?

                                 DOVE
                        Collecting intel. Gotta know who my
                        little brother is hanging out with.
                        Wanna make sure you're not hoarding
                        dead rats or spare body parts.

           She looks over his intricately painted miniatures.

                                 DOVE
                        Wish I had that kind of focus.

           She opens the drawer containing Jake's ghost drawings, his
           latest one on top --

                                 DOVE
                        Damn. Someone's an artist.

                                 JAKE
                        What, no, that's --

           He scrambles to close it, but Dove snatches the drawing.

                                 DOVE
                        You artists and your neurosis. So
                        what is this freaky thing anyway?

                                 JAKE
                        It's nothing. Just an idea for a
                        horror story.

                                 DOVE
                        I love horror! Okay, battle royal:
                        Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, and
                        Hannibal Lecter. Who's left standing?

                                 JAKE
                        I, um... I don't know --
                                 DOVE
                        My money's on Hannibal. He'd just sit
                        back with his fava beans and chianti,
                        and wait for the others to slaughter
                        each other. Then he'd eat their
                        bodies. So what's your horror story
                        about?

                                 JAKE
                        It's...

           Dove eagerly waits. But Jake's got nothing. He sighs.

                                 JAKE
                        Okay, it's not actually a story... I
                        just draw what I see at night.

           Dove waits for the punchline.

                                 DOVE
                        Oh shit, you're serious.

                                 JAKE

                        want you to think I was a wuss or

                        tunnel that some dead kid supposedly
                        haunts, I don't think you're a wuss.

           Jake smiles, relieved.

                        It's cool you draw. My old doctor
                        kept telling me to, said it's
                        therapeutic. What do ya think? Should

                        I don't know... Stuff.
           She hesitates, a crack in her veneer.

                                 DOVE
                        You ever feel like... Like you just
                        want to scream at someone?

                                 JAKE
                        Sometimes...

                                 DOVE
                        Well I don't need a reason to feel
                        that way. Sometimes it's just --
                                  snaps her fingers
                                 (
                                                  )
                        Like that. Other times, I figure I
                        oughta just end it all. Just rid the
                        world of my presence. But then I feel
                        like I'm floating on a cloud... Like
                        it's so good, but it's not real.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        So yeah, I'd draw all that.

           Jake listens, wanting to understand.

                                 DOVE
                        You're lucky you've got your own club
                        to help you with your shit. I wish
                        there was a club for people like me.

                                 JAKE
                        Well I'm glad you're in ours.

           She looks into his eyes. A moment between them.

                                 DOVE
                        Thanks Jake.

           The sound of the FRONT DOOR OPENING breaks it.

                                 DOVE
                        Uh oh... Someone's busted.

           ENTRYWAY

           Jake and Dove step out as Cecilia walks in.

                                 CECILIA
                        Oh. Who's this, Jake?

                                 DOVE
                        I'm Dove and I'm leaving. Nice
                        meeting you, Jake's parental unit.

           She smoothly steps past out the door. Cecilia turns back to
           him. He's a deer in headlights.
                                 JAKE
                        She's... Uh... My friend's sister.
                        They're new... She said she was
                        hungry so I gave her a Pop-Tart.

           Cecilia smirks at his babbling.

                                 CECILIA
                        A Pop-Tart? You know there's real
                        food in the fridge, right?

           She tussles Jake's hair as she walks past.

                                 CECILIA
                        And hold the door open for her next
                        time.

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- EVENING

           The sun sets as Jake pulls up on his bike.

           INT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- EVENING

           The door dings as Jake steps in, the rest of the club
           already gathered.

                                 JAKE
                        Sorry I'm late.

                                 CALVIN
                        Not to worry. Ghosts never sleep.

           Jake looks to Dove and she nods back, making him smile.

                                 CALVIN
                        Alright gang, we've crossed one
                        spectral site off the list. Tonight,
                        we venture to our next destination...
                        A sunken wreck.

           Lexington stiffens... Something about this unnerves him.

                                 CALVIN
                        We'll rally to Stagg Lake. Hope you
                        all brought your sea legs.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        You sure about this one, Cal?

                                 CALVIN
                        Course I'm sure. What's not to be
                        sure about?
                                 LEXINGTON
                        I... Just might not be a good place
                        for a bunch of kids.

                                 DOVE
                        Oh pull-eeez... We're hardly kids.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        You ain't adults either. And some
                        places are better not meddled with.

                                 CALVIN
                        Lex, no one's forcing anyone into
                        anything. Now whoever's up for it,
                        gimme a hand with this thing. 

           He pulls out a crumpled, deflated RAFT that's seen better
           days, riddled with patches. Off their skeptical looks --

                                 CALVIN
                        She's seaworthy, I promise.

           All except Lexington move to help... Which Jake notices.

           EXT. LAKE -- NIGHT

           A layer of mist hangs heavy. Calvin's raft glides through
           the water, flashlight beams leading the way.

           RAFT

           Calvin paddles as the kids pan their lights.

           In the distance, Lexington's van is parked on the shore,
           headlights shining. He sits on the bumper, watching. 

                                 DOVE
                        What a lame-o.

                                 CALVIN
                        No need for names. We all fear
                        something.

           He paddles on as the quiet overtakes them. Then --

                                 CALVIN
                        Look... Down there.

           They aim their flashlights down, revealing the outline of a
           SUBMERGED YELLOW CAR below the surface.

                                 BILLY
                        A car? Why didn't they drag it out?
                                 CALVIN
                        I'm not one to assess the ineptitude
                        of local bureaucracies. Though I like
                        to think it stays where it is because
                        no one wants to go down there...
                        Afraid of what they might unleash.

           Jake gazes down into the water, nervous about what remains.

                                 CALVIN
                        They say it was a frigid night...

                                 DOVE
                        Who's they?

                                 CALVIN
                        They who first told this story, whose
                        names are lost in the mists of time.

           Jake's eyes are drawn to the mist drifting over the water...

                                 CALVIN
                        And like they said, it was a frigid
                        night, cold enough to see your
                        breath, yet too dry for it to snow...

           The flashlight beam transitions into a CAR'S HEADLIGHT as we
           find ourselves in --

           CALVIN'S SECOND GHOST STORY

           A 1970s YELLOW CAR heads down a dark road. Inside, a BOY
           (16) drives with a GIRL (16) beside him, all smiles.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        But a pair of young lovers were
                        having no trouble keeping warm and
                        cozy, coming back from a date.

           The two of them exchange adoring glances, holding hands.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        The boy was of honorable stock.
                        Treated her with the utmost respect.
                        They had a future together. Their
                        love was true. But sometimes even
                        love is no match for fate...

           The boy's eyes widen as A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS from the
           opposite direction suddenly swerves into their lane, ABOUT
           TO HIT THEM HEAD ON. He instinctively YANKS THE WHEEL --

           Sending his car CRASHING THROUGH A BARRICADE and into the
           darkness beyond. We hear the SPLASH OF WATER.
                                                                 CUT TO:

           The boy's eyes open. He gasps for air. The car FILLING UP
           WITH WATER, already up to his nose, forcing him under --

           He can scarcely see anything in the DARK WATER. Until
           SOMETHING SHINY stands out -- the GIRL'S EARRINGS. Now he
           sees her closed eyes, BLOOD seeping out of a head wound.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        He didn't know if she was dead or
                        alive. All he knew for sure was that
                        they didn't have much time.

           The Boy frantically unlocks his seat belt. Gets it off and
           pulls the door latch... But the door won't budge. He pushes
           harder, forcing it open just wide enough.

           He reaches for her. But can't free her from the seat belt.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        In traditional stories, the hero
                        would save the girl... But ghost
                        stories don't have heroes. And even
                        when that poor boy's heart said he'd
                        rather sacrifice himself than lose
                        her... He couldn't overcome his own
                        instincts to survive.

           The Boy desperately struggles to free her... But he can't --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The Boy breaks the surface of the water, gasping for breath,
           barely alive... And decidedly alone.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Something rising out of the dark water... The GIRL'S FACE
           breaking the surface, EYES OPEN BUT LIFELESS... Followed by
           her PALE BODY, like a ghost rising from her watery grave...
           On a backboard carried by RESCUE PERSONNEL.

           Nearby, the Boy watches from the shore, sobbing, crying out
           for his love, hands holding him back from rushing to her.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        When they pulled her out, her body
                        was cold as ice, the warmth of their
                        love gone. But her eyes... Her eyes
                        were still open... Searching for her
                        love... Waiting to be saved.

           The Girl's lifeless eyes stare off...
                                                         BACK TO PRESENT:

           Calvin lets his words hang... A sadness in him, feeling for
           that poor couple.

                                 CALVIN
                        Now, she wanders still... On the road
                        they last drove. To the places they
                        used to frequent. But no matter how
                        far she roams... This is where she
                        died... And must always come back to.

           An unnerving thought as Jake eyes the car in the water.

                                 CALVIN
                        Legend has it that some nights, you
                        can still see her down there...
                        Waiting to be rescued from her
                        eternal abyss. You only have to
                        dangle in a hand to offer your help.

                                 BILLY
                        You mean, like... Summon her?

           Calvin nods.

                                 CALVIN
                        But we have something more to offer
                        her tonight.

           He holds out his hand, revealing a PAIR OF EARRINGS.

                                 CALVIN
                        A local collector found these for me
                        years ago. I couldn't verify their
                        authenticity, so I never put them up
                        for sale. But now...

           Jake's eyes widen as Calvin lowers the earrings into the
           water, gently moving them back and forth. Swish, swish...
           The group sits tensely, on pins and needles. Swish, swish...

           But nothing happens.

                                 JAKE
                        Maybe she's not here?

                                 CALVIN
                        Maybe... Or maybe we go to 'Plan B.'

           He puts away the earrings and begins taking off his shoes.

                                 BILLY
                        Whoa, seriously?
                                 CALVIN
                        She died in that car. Only one way to
                        know if she still haunts it.

                                 DOVE
                        I love this idea!

           She's already on her feet. Peeling off her sweatshirt, down
           to a tank top and shorts. Billy follows suit, not to be
           outdone. But Jake's not so eager.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin, are you sure we should
                        be doing this...

                                 CALVIN
                        Only by choice, Jakey-boy. Staying
                        aboard to safeguard the raft is an
                        equally noble task.

           He stands and pulls off his shirt --

           Revealing that HIS TORSO IS COVERED IN VICIOUS SCARS. Jagged
           and violent, badly healed by time.

           Jake stares, aghast. He's never seen those before. Dove and
           Billy stop what they're doing, just as surprised.

           But Calvin is oblivious, grabbing his flashlight and jumping
           in the water. He resurfaces, seeing them all staring.

                                 CALVIN
                        What are you waiting for? Got
                        ourselves a ghost to find.

           Jake and the others exchange wary glances. Then Dove jumps
           into the water. Billy follows a moment after.

           Leaving Jake on the raft alone. Nothing noble here.

           He starts to peel off his shirt, revealing his flabby
           stomach. Hesitates, embarrassed. And elects to keep his
           shirt on. He grabs a flashlight, and jumps in with a splash.

                                 CALVIN
                        Alright, it's gonna be dark down
                        there. Follow me and stay together.

           He dives. Jake and the others follow --

           UNDERWATER

           Jake looks around, trying to get his bearings.
           JAKE'S POV: The water is dark and murky. Can't really see
           anything except for the beams of their flashlights. He pans
           his around, until it settles on --

           THE SUNKEN CAR. Yellow paint now rusted and faded. Overgrown
           with weeds after so many years.

           He follows the others to it. They shine their lights into
           the windows, but the glass is too grimy to see inside.

           Calvin hands his flashlight to Jake. Then grabs the door
           handle and pulls... It CRACKS OPEN a little. The others join
           in, pulling with all their might...

           Until THE DOOR CREAKS OPEN. Then they all go up for air --

           SURFACE

           They reemerge, catching their breath.

                                 BILLY
                        Okay, who gets the honor?

                                 DOVE
                        Jake's club, you want to be first in?

           Jake's mouth falls open. No way in hell does he want to.

                                 CALVIN
                        You do seem more attuned to the
                        supernatural. Lead the way.

           He gives Jake a reassuring nod. Jake steels himself. If he's
           got to... Then he dives --

           UNDERWATER

           Jake swims towards the open car door, flashlight in hand, an
           abyss of darkness inside. The others just behind. With
           trepidation, he grabs the frame and pulls himself in.

           His flashlight provides glimpses of what's left. Everything
           covered with grime. Cracked windshield. Seats in tatters.

           Then Jake freezes, seeing something else...

           A SCARF DRIFTING THROUGH THE WATER like a snake. As Jake
           focuses his light on it, it shifts in the currents,
           revealing that it's COVERED IN BLACKENED BLOOD.

           Jake stares, transfixed. Then he reaches out to grab it...
           As he does, it flows through the water, revealing the REAR
           VIEW MIRROR behind it --
           With a PALE FIGURE IN ITS BLURRY REFLECTION.

           Jake screams, bubbles roiling out as he turns -- But there's
           nothing behind him. Just light filtering in from the others'
           flashlights.  

           SURFACE

           Jake breaks the surface, gasping for air. The others come up
           around him.

                                 BILLY
                        Holy shit, you saw her, didn't you!

                                 DOVE
                        It just looked like some dirty scarf.

                                 JAKE
                        I... I don't know...

                                 BILLY
                        Calvin, did you see anything?

           Calvin is quiet, causing the others to turn to him.

                                 CALVIN
                        With my eyes, no. But there are many
                        kinds of sight... And I definitely
                        sensed something in there...

           He trails off, trying to wrap his mind around it.

                                 DOVE
                        Well I didn't see or sense shit.

                                 CALVIN
                        Like I say, ghost hunting isn't an
                        exact science. But not to worry,
                        we'll find what we're looking for.

           He gives a stoic nod to Jake, who's still shaken up.

                                 CALVIN
                        Best board our faithful craft and get
                        back to the land of the living.

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- NIGHT

           Jake and Calvin peddle up on their bikes, still soggy.

                                 CALVIN
                        I'll find you some dry clothes. Just
                        got a new shipment of t-shirts,
                        should be something in your size.
           He parks his bike. But Jake eyes him, something on his mind.

                                 JAKE
                        How'd you get those scars?

                                 CALVIN
                        Oh those? Got into a tussle a few
                        years back with what I suspect was a
                        werewolf. Or a coyote, hard to be
                        sure. And that, is why I never walk
                        alone on a full moon night.

           He chuckles, heading inside.

           But Jake lingers, not believing him this time.

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM, CALVIN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Jake is asleep in the spare bed. All is quiet...

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud...

           Jake's eyes snap open.

           He sits up, frantically turning on the lights, certain
           there's something in here. But it's just him. He sits there,
           breathing heavy. But no more footsteps come.

           Then a new thought hits him... Determination filling his
           eyes. He swings his feet out of bed and creeps to the door.

           HALLWAY

           Jake steps down the hall, drawing subtle creaks beneath his
           feet. He passes Calvin's room, hearing his steady breathing
           within. Keeps going, towards the apartment's door.

           On a hook beside it is a CTHULHU HEAD KEY CHAIN. Jake
           quietly takes it.

           INT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- CONTINUOUS

           A door opens as Jake steps into the shop. This place is
           creepy by day, but it takes on a far more ominous aura by
           night. Every trinket shrouded in shadow, threatening.

           But Jake steels himself, making his way down an aisle. He
           knows what he's after, and it's in the storage closet.

           He swings the door open to reveal all sorts of random junk,
           and amongst it... The suitcase containing the SPIRIT PHONE. 
           Jake carefully takes it out and sets the Spirit Phone on the
           counter. Then with a fortifying breath, he plugs it in. Once
           again, the EERIE HUM rises from it...

           He takes the Speak & Spell and types H-E-L-L-O... Then
           presses enter.

           Its creepy voice blares in the silence: HEEeeeLOOOO...

           Throbs and burrs emanate from the horn, very distant.

           Jake leans closer, trying to hear anything. Turns up the
           volume, but still can't make anything distinct out.

           Then he types a new phrase... W-H-A-T  D-O  Y-O-U  W-A-N-T?

           WuuuT DOOoo YOOoo WaaaanT...

           The sounds from the horn change pitch... Taking on more
           shape and weight... Before settling into SOFTLY HISSING
           STATIC. Static that begins to PULSE...

           Hiss, Hiss... Hiss, Hiss... Hiss, Hiss...

           Jake's eyes widen. Could it be? Some kind of message?

           He turns up the volume even more, trying to make out the
           sound... Hiss, Hiss... Hiss, Hiss...

           He leans even closer... Hiss, Hiss... Hiss, Hiss --

           SUDDENLY SPARKS FLY FROM THE WIRING, sending out a LOUD HISS
           OF STATIC. Jake jumps back as a puff of SMOKE RISES, the
           spirit phone falling silent.

                                 JAKE
                        Holy shit...

           He catches his breath. Was it the ghost? Or... He doesn't
           seem to know. His eyes pan around the odd shapes and creepy
           shadows of the shop... But he doesn't see anything lurking.

           INT. CALVIN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Jake quietly lets himself back in, closing the door. He
           tiptoes back towards his room...

           But before he gets there, HE HEARS WHIMPERING... Coming from
           somewhere else in the apartment. Someone is crying.

           Jake listens, more confused than frightened... Seeing a
           faint light glowing. He creeps towards it, tiptoeing to the
           edge of the --
           KITCHEN

           Where Calvin sits at the table, shirt off, scars bare. He
           whimpers and cries, feverishly SKETCHING SOMETHING with a
           charcoal pencil on a sketchpad.

           Jake watches from the doorway, but Calvin doesn't glance
           over, unaware of his presence.

           Then Calvin lets out a WRETCHED SOB, startling Jake.

           Calvin drops his pencil. Cries building... Until another
           guttural moan escapes him, more animalistic than human.

           And this is all too much for Jake. He carefully steps away,
           not making a sound, leaving his Uncle alone.

           SPARE BEDROOM

           Jake climbs back into bed, troubled by what he just saw. He
           lays his head on his pillow, but his eyes remain open...

           EXT. OCCULTORIUM -- DAY

           The warm sun peeks over the nearby buildings. A new day.

           INT. HALLWAY, CALVIN'S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Jake hesitantly steps out. Listens... It's quiet now. He
           creeps down the hall, looking into the next room --

           Where Calvin sleeps in his bed. The room is a cluttered,
           disorganized mess, but he's okay.

           Jake takes a relieved breath. Then moves on into the --

           KITCHEN

           And comes to a stop, seeing CALVIN'S SKETCHPAD on the table.
           He knows he shouldn't. But... He opens it.

           And stiffens at the sight of --

           The FACE OF A DARK CREATURE, mouth open in a twisted scream.
           Features rendered in brutal slashes, mostly shrouded in
           shadow, except for its WHITE EYES.

           Chillingly similar to the Ghost that haunts Jake.

           Jake stares at it, his frightened mind racing, none of this
           making sense to him...

           He quickly closes the notebook.
           EXT. POND, FOREST -- DAY

           Jake and Billy are back at the same secluded spot, looking
           out over the water.

                                 JAKE
                        It was so weird... Like he was
                        sleepwalking, or in a trance or
                        something. He didn't even know I was
                        there.

                                 BILLY
                        Creepy... Has it happened before?

           Jake shakes his head "no," but there's more weighing on him.

                                 JAKE
                        His drawing looked so much like what
                        I've been seeing. Not the same,
                        but... Similar.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Do you think that maybe... Do you
                        think maybe he could be haunted?

           Billy turns, seeing how much this worries Jake.

                                 BILLY
                        You mean... Like you?

           Jake nods. Looking down into the shallow water.

                                 BILLY
                        I read this book that said sometimes
                        when a ghost haunts someone, if it
                        doesn't get what it wants, it moves
                        on to the next generation in the
                        family. Maybe it started with him...
                        And it came down to you?

                                 JAKE
                        But why wouldn't he just tell me?

                                 BILLY
                        Maybe he didn't realize it was
                        happening... Like it's some kind of
                        possession thing... Like he can't
                        control it.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        Maybe that's how he got those scars.

           Jake considers this... And it only unnerves him more.

                                 JAKE
                        Have you always been into ghosts?
                                 BILLY
                        Kinda. My dad used to read scary
                        stories to me when I was little.

           But he hesitates, something more there.

                                 BILLY
                        I always liked the idea of them. You
                        know, that someone can come back.
                        Like they're never gone forever.

                                 JAKE
                        I don't think I'd want to come back.

                                 BILLY
                        I would.

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           Jake sits at his desk, absorbed in the pages of a worn book
           with a photo and write-up on the Screaming Tunnel.

           He flips forward. We catch glimpses of more CREEPY LOCATIONS
           and GHOSTLY APPARITIONS. "Bachelors Grove Cemetery," "The
           Villisca Ax Murder House," "Griggs Mansion." But he keeps
           going, not finding what he's looking for.

           He sets the book next to a PILE OF OTHERS relating to
           HAUNTED SITES. Grabs the next one.

                                 CREEPY VOICE
                                 (
                                  from outside
                                             )
                        Jake... Jake... Come out of your
                        hole, Jake...

           Jake smirks. Goes to the window and looks out at Dove.

                                 DOVE
                        Hey, did you hear that weird voice
                        too? I think your house is haunted.

                                 JAKE
                        You coulda just rang the doorbell.

                                 DOVE
                        That'd be so ordinary.

           EXT. SMALL TOWN MAIN STREET -- DAY

           Jake and Dove walk past the quiet storefronts.

                                 JAKE
                        So where are we going?
                                 DOVE
                        Wherever life takes us.

           He waits for more but she doesn't offer anything.

                                 DOVE
                        So whatcha been doing all week? I've
                        been batshit bored in this town.

                                 JAKE
                        Mostly just researching.

                                 DOVE
                        Researching? Dude, it's summer.

                                 JAKE
                        Ghost stuff.

                                 DOVE
                        Right. Of course you are.

                                 JAKE
                        It's weird... The Screaming Tunnel's
                        in all the books. It's like
                        legendary. But I can't find anything
                        about that sunken car.

                                 DOVE
                        So?

                                 JAKE
                        So isn't that weird?

                                 DOVE
                        Just give it a few more years and I'm
                        sure it'll be all the rage.

           They pass a mom and pop BRIDAL STORE, where several TEENAGE
           GIRLS ogle the wedding dresses in the window.

           Dove slows, glaring...

                                 DOVE
                        Look at them... So sad...

                                 JAKE
                        They don't seem sad.

                                 DOVE
                        They will be one day. You live in a
                        town like this and a wedding dress is
                        the only future you have to hope for.
           She watches the girls laugh and chat, totally carefree. The
           very fact that they're happy seems to sting the most.

                                 DOVE
                        Screw that conventional bullshit. I'm
                        never getting married.

           She keeps walking, faster now. Jake hurries to catch up.

                                 JAKE
                        You're not?

                                 DOVE
                        Hell no. Just gonna be me, myself,
                        and I. I'm moving to Europe. Did I
                        tell you that?

                                 JAKE
                        What?

                                 DOVE
                        I'd fit in more there. Everyone says
                        it's so much better anyway. You ever
                        been to Europe?

                                 JAKE
                        No --

                                 DOVE
                        I'm gonna take up drawing. And
                        painting too. Nothing like
                        commercializing therapy, right?

           She's talking energetically fast, but it's unnatural,
           imbalanced. And Jake is too young to realize...

                                 DOVE
                        I'll set up an easel right outside
                        the Louvre and scam tourists. Except
                        my work will be good. Like really
                        good. I mean, I could be a prodigy
                        and no one even knows it yet.
                        Seriously though.

                                 JAKE
                        Dove, slow down --

                                 DOVE
                        I don't want to stay in Paris
                        forever. Just for like a few months
                        or a year. Then I'll go to college in
                        Australia. That'd be sweet. Major in
                        oceanography or some shit like that.
                        Swim with sharks. Screw high school.
                                 JAKE
                        But what about your family --

                                 DOVE
                        You don't have to graduate high
                        school to go to college, you know
                        that? You just need a GED. You can
                        travel the world, experience life,
                        cram some studying in, and just pass
                        a test. Easy as pie.

           She's not slowing down. Jake can barely keep up.

                                 DOVE
                        Think those bridal store bitches are
                        ever gonna go anywhere? Ha! I'll bet
                        my money they all get knocked up
                        before they're old enough to drink.

                                 JAKE
                        Dove, wait... Just stop for a second!

                                 DOVE
                        Back home, I had real friends, not
                        like them. Maybe you can meet my
                        friends one day. You can all visit me
                        in Paris. Or Australia. I had so many
                        friends, you have no idea.

                                 JAKE
                        Why don't we try to find Billy.

           Dove stops abruptly to face him.

                                 DOVE
                        Why?

                                 JAKE
                        Because you're not making sense.

                                 DOVE
                        Nothing makes sense!

           Jake startles back. Dove bursts out laughing.

                                 DOVE
                        That's the secret of life! Nothing
                        makes sense! You say you're haunted
                        by a ghost. Does that make sense? No!
                        My dad clobbered my mom with a piece
                        of stove wood and crushed her
                        kneecap. Doesn't make sense! Now here
                        we are, one big happy family, sans
                        one asshole! Does that make sense?
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOVE (cont'd)
                        I think not! Why should any of us
                        keep trying to make sense?

           Jake's jaw falls open. WTF... Is she serious?

                                 JAKE
                        Billy never told me that...

                                 DOVE
                        Billy likes to pretend everything's
                        peachy. You know why he's so into
                        ghost stories? The people in them are
                        even more fucked up than us!

           She laughs hysterically as Jake just stares.

           Then her laughs subside as tears fill her eyes. She turns
           away, taking a few steps, not wanting him to see her face.

           Jake cautiously approaches. So out of his element.

                                 JAKE
                        Dove... Hey Dove, it's okay...

           She just shakes her head.

                                 JAKE
                        Dove?

                                 DOVE
                        I'm such a joke.

                                 JAKE
                        No you're not.

                                 DOVE
                        Such a joke...

           She wipes away a tear before it falls, sniffling hard.

           Then something catches her eye... She takes a breath,
           composing herself.

                                 DOVE
                        Thanks for the walk, Jake. Been fun
                        knowing ya.

           She moves ahead, under the sign for a GREYHOUND BUS STOP.

                                 JAKE
                        What, wait, where're you going?
                                 DOVE
                        Wherever the wind takes me. Or as far
                        as this'll go. Whichever's further.

           She pulls out a WAD OF CASH. Maybe fifty bucks in small
           bills, but a fortune to a teen in the 90s.

                                 DOVE
                        Life's short. Misery's long. Gotta
                        get to the airport somehow.

                                 JAKE
                        But you don't have clothes or a
                        toothbrush or --

                                 DOVE
                        You think I'm crazy, don't you.

           Jake stammers, trying to find reasonable words.

                                 JAKE
                        What, no, I --

                                 DOVE
                        It's okay... You can say it. You're
                        crazy, Dove. I've heard it before.

                                 JAKE
                        I --

           In the distance, he sees A BUS COMING. Holy shit, she might
           actually do this. And he blurts out --

                                 JAKE
                        I think you're like the sun.

           But the phrase causes her to stiffen with a pained twinge.

                                 DOVE
                        Who told you to say that?

                                 JAKE
                        Nobody. It was my own --

                                 DOVE
                        You're lying.

           Jake shrinks under her piercing gaze. She sees the bus
           approaching and softens.
                                 DOVE
                        Listen, I'll miss the club. And even
                        though I don't believe in any of that
                        shit... I hope you find the ghost
                        you're looking for.

           The bus slows to a stop. The door opens. 

                                 DOVE
                        Be seein' ya.

                                 JAKE
                        Dove, wait! I'm gonna tell!

                                 DOVE
                        You're the boss of you.

           She climbs up the steps, gives money to the driver.

                                 JAKE
                        Dove! Dove wait! I, you, you can't -–

           But she just waves as the door closes, and the bus drives
           off. Jake watches in dismay...

           Then he takes off running back the way they came.

           EXT. DOVE AND BILLY'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Jake runs up the Yellowbird's driveway. Pounds on the front
           door, heart racing. The waiting is painful. He pounds again.

           Then the door opens, revealing MRS. YELLOWBIRD (40s),
           leaning on a cane.

                                 JAKE
                                 (
                                  fast, breathless
                                                 )
                        I'm Jake -- Jake Baker --

                                 MRS. YELLOWBIRD
                        Oh, Billy told me about --

                                 JAKE
                        Dove got on a bus! To somewhere! The
                        airport, I think! She was talking
                        about Paris and then she just left!

           Mrs. Yellowbird's smile fades.

                                 MRS. YELLOWBIRD
                        Jesus, that girl...

           Her expression betraying years of pain and frustration.
                                 MRS. YELLOWBIRD
                        Which way did it go?

                                 JAKE
                        To the, um, the east. Down Lewis
                        Avenue. I could come with you --

                                 MRS. YELLOWBIRD
                        Thank you, Jake, but this isn't our
                        first rodeo.

                                 JAKE
                        Okay, just please have her call me
                        when --

           The door closes, leaving Jake standing there.

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Jake sits at his desk, flipping through the same ghost
           books. But he's antsy now, unfocused.

           He eyes the portable phone nearby, not ringing. Checks his
           watch, which only stresses him more.

           Finally, he can't take it anymore and dials the phone. Waits
           as it rings... Rings... An ANSWERING MACHINE picks up --

                                 DOVE (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        Yo, we're not here. You know what to
                        do after the beep. And if you don't,
                        we don't talk to dummies anyway.

           BEEP. Jake hangs up. Where is she?

           EXT. DOVE AND BILLY'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Jake rides up on his bike. He drops it in the grass and goes
           to the front door. Knocks. Waits...

           No sounds from inside. He rings the doorbell. And waits...

           He looks around. But there's no car in the driveway. No one
           up or down the street. He's the only one around.

           He trudges back to his bike, not wanting to leave, but not
           knowing what else to do. Picks it up --

           But then he sees a CAR DRIVING DOWN THE STREET. His spirits
           soar as it pulls into the Yellowbird's driveway. He drops
           his bike and rushes over.

           Dove hops out of the front passenger seat looking chipper,
           while Billy gets out of the back, exhausted.
                                 DOVE
                        Hiya, Jake-o-matic. How's the ghost
                        research coming?

           Mrs. Yellowbird climbs out of the car with strained effort.

                                 MRS. YELLOWBIRD
                        Inside, Dove. Now.

                                 (
                                  to Jake
                                 DOVE
                                        )
                        Guess I'll catch ya on the flip.

           Jake's jaw hangs open as he watches Dove follow her mom
           towards the house.

                                 MRS. YELLOWBIRD
                        You can go home now, Jake.
                        Everything's fine.

           Billy follows behind. Jake makes eye contact with him as he
           passes. Billy shakes his head and swirls his finger by his
           ear... Cuckoo. Then goes inside too and the door closes...

           Leaving Jake standing there, seeing their family in an
           entirely new light...

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- EVENING

           Jake rides up, noticing Billy's bike already there. He parks
           his and goes inside.

           INT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- CONTINUOUS

           Jake steps in and sees Dove perusing a nearby aisle like
           nothing happened.

                                 DOVE
                        Sup Jake. Ready for another nice,
                        normal evening out? Psyche!

           She goes back to looking around. Jake exchanges a look with
           Billy, who rolls his eyes. Then picks up a trinket off a
           shelf, unwilling to say more. 

                                 LEXINGTON (O.S.)
                        I'm telling ya, Calvin, this is going
                        too far! It's getting dangerous.

           Jake hears this and steps deeper into the store...

           Where he sees Calvin and Lexington in the back office.
           Lexington heated, and Calvin playing it cool.
           But there's something... Off about Calvin, even by his
           standards. Unshaven, hair a mess, clothes rumpled.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        I'm all for helping your nephew, but
                        just not that place.

                                 CALVIN
                        Lex, it's a site of major paranormal
                        significance. We can't just skip it.
                        What're you so worried about?

           Lexington notices Jake standing there and hesitates. But
           Calvin brightens and steps out of the office.

                                 CALVIN
                        Got a good one picked out for us
                        tonight, Jake. Scariest yet!

           He pats Jake on the shoulder. But all of the weirdness from
           everyone is making Jake uneasy.

                                 CALVIN
                        Alright gang, gather up!
                                 (
                                  announcer voice
                                                )
                        Live from the world famous
                        Occultorium... It's Saturday night!

           EXT. FOREST PATH -- NIGHT

           Footsteps crunch in gravel as the Ghost Club makes its way
           down the long forgotten path through the trees, flashlights
           illuminating the way. Calvin and Jake up front, the others a
           few paces behind. Calvin whispers so only Jake can hear him.

                                 CALVIN
                        Jake, I want to warn you... This next
                        site isn't like the others. The
                        screaming tunnel's ghost was born out
                        of a cruel prank. The lake's by a
                        tragic accident. But this one... This
                        one was created by an act of pure
                        evil. For all of our sakes, I hope
                        this isn't your ghost.

           The path opens up before them to reveal --

           THE REMAINS OF A HOUSE

           Blackened rubble. Charred support beams point towards the
           sky like shadowy tusks. A sense of death lingering. Calvin
           was right. This places reeks of evil.
                                 DOVE
                        Shit... What happened here?

                                 CALVIN
                        A tragedy of the darkest kind.

           He approaches the house. Only this time, there's trepidation
           in his eyes. He fears this place too.

                                 DOVE
                        Third time's the charm, eh boys?

           She scampers ahead. Jake exchanges a look with Billy, then
           moves to follow. Lexington advances uneasily.

           Together, the Ghost Club climbs the splintered steps,
           spreading out to look around. Ash. Charcoal. Not much left. 

                                 CALVIN
                        Just keep your feet on the supports
                        so you don't fall through. Like
                        walking on rails.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Hey Cal, I really don't think  --

                                 CALVIN
                        It's fine, Lex. There's enough solid
                        wood left to support us.

           Jake is all too aware of the tension between them.

           Up ahead, Calvin takes a seat on some collapsed rubble. He
           motions them over. They all sit around him, waiting with
           bated breath for him to begin.

                                 CALVIN
                        You'll, uh... You'll have to forgive
                        me... Everything I heard about this
                        place, I heard third-hand, fourth-
                        hand even. All I know for sure is it
                        happened many years ago, on a
                        summer's night... There was a cold
                        edge on the wind, the first sign that
                        fall was beginning to threaten...

           Jake gazes over the rubble...

           And as he does, sounds of MUSIC AND LAUGHTER FILTER IN...
           The burned out house FADING INTO WOOD PANELING AND WALLS, as
           we find ourselves in --
           CALVIN'S THIRD GHOST STORY

           We move through the warmly lit home, past PHOTOS OF A YOUNG
           COUPLE. Laughter from the kitchen draws us in... Where the
           twenty-something HUSBAND AND WIFE cook dinner together.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        A pair of newlyweds built this place.
                        Still basking in the afterglow when
                        they moved in. They were planning to
                        raise a family here, far from the
                        hurly-burly of city life, nestled
                        away on their own little corner of
                        the world...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Outside, the quaint home glows like a beacon in the DARK
           WOODS that surround it.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        But they didn't go far enough... And
                        the monsters of the world were drawn
                        in like moths to the flame...

           FOUR SHADOWY FIGURES emerge from those dark woods.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Knock... Knock... Knock... The Husband and Wife's heads
           turn, startled. Then the Husband walks over. 

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        It was late, but not late enough that
                        a visitor couldn't come knocking.
                        Like a wolf in sheepskin clothing,
                        whispering Little pig... Little
                        pig... Let me come in...

           THE HUSBAND OPENS THE DOOR...

           We don't see who's outside. WE STAY ON THE COUPLE, only
           seeing the shadowy shoulder of whomever is speaking to them.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        But a monster, like a ghost, is
                        clever. It doesn't say it like that.
                        It says its car broke down and asks
                        to use a phone.

           The Husband turns back to his Wife, faced with a decision...

                                                                 CUT TO:
           BOOTS TRACK MUD into the house.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        But it didn't take the couple long to
                        realize the hell they'd let into
                        their home...

           A GLOVED HAND pulls the phone off the wall. The other hand
           brandishes a KNIFE and CUTS THE CHORD.

           The Wife shrieks, cowering behind her Husband. But before he
           can do anything, they hear the FRONT DOOR BREAKING OPEN, and
           turn to see --

           THREE MORE FIGURES standing outside, obscured by shadow.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Moving through the house once again, past photos of the
           couple... But now there's a TRAIL OF BLOOD on the floor. We
           follow it through the home...

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        There is... There's no record of what
                        those men did that night. That's the
                        only merciful part of this story. But
                        after they'd done what they came to
                        do, they left... Vanishing back into
                        the darkness, never to be found. They
                        left everything intact... Except for
                        the two people inside.

           We come around a corner to find --

           The Husband holding his Wife, bending over her, his body
           blocking the worst carnage. She's barely hanging on.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        He managed to get her in the car.
                        Drove to the hospital as fast as he
                        could. But it was too late...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The Husband sits alone at the kitchen table, staring off,
           surrounded by an unbearable emptiness.

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        After the funeral, he was left to
                        live in their house alone. But he was
                        never truly alone...

                                                                 CUT TO:
           The Husband sleeps on his side of the bed, the other side
           noticeably vacant.

           Knock... Knock... Knock...

           He sits up abruptly, looking around. Listening as --

           Knock... Knock... Knock...

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        At first, he thought it was a
                        nightmare. But it returned every
                        night. Again and again. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The Husband plods through the dark house, HANDS COVERING HIS
           EARS, as the KNOCKING ECHOES ALL AROUND HIM. Knock! Knock!
           Knock! Knock! Knock!

                                 CALVIN (V.O.)
                        Soon, this little corner of the world
                        became a prison... A prison that
                        drove him mad... And when he couldn't
                        take it anymore, he burned their
                        house to the ground.

                                                         BACK TO PRESENT:

           The group sits amidst the charred remains of the tragedy.

                                 CALVIN
                        After the flames died down, he... He
                        found a kitchen knife in the ash...
                        And met his maker by his own hand.

           Calvin lowers his head, as if to mourn the dead. Staying
           still uncomfortably long as the others stare. When he speaks
           again, his voice is low, not looking up at anyone.

                                 CALVIN
                        Perhaps he... Perhaps he thought the
                        fire would release her spirit. But
                        some ghosts cling to more than walls
                        and windows. And now... She's left to
                        wander. Knocking on doors... Looking
                        for a home she'll never find... For a
                        husband who'll never hold her again.
                        For a child she'll never bear.
                        Forever alone... Forever searching...

           He trails off... Staring away into the charred lumber.
           Silent as the tension hangs. Jake glances at the others and
           notices the dread on Lexington's face.
           Then Calvin reaches out a hand and knock, knock, knocks on
           the skeletal door frame next to where he sits.

           And he waits... As if expecting the door to open.

           He raises his hand again. Knock... Knock... Knock...

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin... You okay?

           But Calvin doesn't respond. Eyes vacant, mind somewhere far
           away, as if in a trance. Knock... Knock... Knock...

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin?

           Dove and Billy are getting worried too. But Calvin keeps
           knocking, unaware of anyone else's presence. Knock...
           Knock... Knock...

                                 DOVE
                                 (
                                  whispering
                                           )
                        Dude, what's wrong with him?

                                 JAKE
                        I don't know...

           Then Calvin stands, turning away from them, staring out the
           empty door frame. Knock... Knock... Knock... Lexington gets
           up, trying to delicately pull Calvin away.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Calvin... Hey Cal... Come on, let's
                        go. Cal. Cal!

           Knock. Knock. Knock. Each strike harder than the last.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin, stop! Please!

           Knock! Knock! Knock! His knuckles growing bloody from the
           rough wood. But he doesn't notice. Knock! Knock! Knock!

           Lexington turns to the others, even more worried than them.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Get out of here. Don't look back.
                        I'll get him home.

                                 JAKE
                        But --

                                 LEXINGTON
                        No buts. Just go!
           Dove and Billy get up. But Jake lingers, watching Calvin.
           Knock! Knock! Knock! Dove puts a hand on Jake's shoulder.

                                 DOVE
                        Come on, Jake.

           Jake reluctantly follows them. But he can't help watching
           his Uncle as he goes, in no way reassured...

           EXT. FOREST PATH -- NIGHT

           Jake, Dove, and Billy head back.

                                 BILLY
                        That place was creepy as shit. Maybe
                        he was more sensitive to it. You
                        know, like you were at the tunnel.

           Jake nods, trying to justify it.

                                 BILLY
                        I read this book once that said in
                        the most haunted places, a really
                        malevolent ghost can take control of
                        someone's body, and make them do all
                        sorts of weird stuff --

                                 DOVE
                        Jesus Christ, Billy, not now!

                                 BILLY
                        Well what do you think happened?!

           The question hangs...

                                 DOVE
                        I don't know...

           They walk on in uneasy silence. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- NIGHT

           All the houses are dark. The streets empty. No one else out
           at this hour. Except for Jake, riding his bike home. Alone
           now. Only his swirling thoughts for company. 

           But then he senses something... And eases his bike to a stop
           in the middle of the road. He looks around... Into the
           shadows... Is someone there?

           A breeze flutters the leaves on the nearby trees, causing
           their branches to CREAK. Then --

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud...
           Jake's eyes widen with horrible recognition.

           Thud, Thud...

           Jake looks around, searching. But he can't see it. Thud,
           Thud... Thud, Thud... Then that GHOSTLY WAIL, excruciating
           on the ears. And out of the darkness --

           The DARK FIGURE EMERGES. About ten feet away, hobbling
           towards him.

           Jake takes off on his bike, pedaling as hard as he can. He
           glances back. For a moment it looks like he might be safe --

           But the Dark Figure hobbles out of the darkness,
           inexplicably still right behind him.

           Jake keeps going, pedaling for his life. Looks back again --

           But in spite of how far he's gone, the Dark Figure is still
           close behind. He can't get away!

           Jake pedals even harder, pushing himself to the brink. Thud,
           Thud... Thud, Thud... Another GHOSTLY WAIL and --

           EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Jake pops the curb and jumps off his bike, running for the
           door --

           INT. JAKE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Jake dashes in and slams the door shut. Then rushes to the
           window and looks out.

           But there's no Dark Figure outside...

                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        Jake... Is that you?

           Jake tenses. Oh shit... He tries to catch his breath. Fix
           his hair. Then steps further into the house...

           Where he finds Cecilia on the couch, TV on in the
           background. But she's focused on him.

                                 CECILIA
                        Thought you were sleeping over at
                        Uncle Cal's.

                                 JAKE
                        He... He's not feeling well.
                                 CECILIA
                        What do you mean? He's sick?

           But Jake can't hide his concern, and Cecilia realizes
           there's something more there. She gets up, coming to him.

                                 CECILIA
                        Jake... What's wrong?

                                 JAKE
                        Nothing. He's just not feeling well.

           He tries to head upstairs but it's not that easy --

                                 CECILIA
                        Hang on!
                                 (
                                  off Jake's look
                                                )
                        What do you mean not feeling well?

                                 JAKE
                        I don't know... He's just not
                        himself. Why's it matter so much?

                                 CECILIA
                        Because he's my brother and I know
                        him better than anyone. If
                        something's wrong with him, I need to
                        know right now.

           A tinge of emotion in her voice.

                                 CECILIA
                        Jake, please... Tell me what's wrong.

           And Jake realizes just how serious this is...

           INT. KITCHEN, JAKE'S HOUSE -- LATER

           The tension hangs heavy as Jake sits at the table,
           expression grave. Cecilia stands, holding the phone to her
           ear. Then hangs up with an anxious sigh.

                                 CECILIA
                        He's still not answering.

           She leans on the counter, trying to keep her cool, but she's
           extremely worried.

                                 CECILIA
                        So let me get this straight... You
                        two haven't been watching movies like
                        you told me... You've been going out
                        to abandoned train tunnels, and
                        underwater cars, and burned houses?
                                 JAKE
                        It was a Ghost Club... Those were the
                        haunted places.

                                 CECILIA
                        Is that what he told you? That it'd
                        be some fun summer adventure?

                                 JAKE
                        No, it... It wasn't like that...

                                 CECILIA
                        You should have told me.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin said it was for true
                        believers only. We knew you wouldn't
                        understand.

                                 CECILIA
                        I understand a lot more than you
                        think... And for the time being, it's
                        best that you not see your Uncle. No
                        more Occultorium. No more Ghost Club.

                                 JAKE
                        But that's not fair --

                                 CECILIA
                        Go to bed, Jake. You're in enough
                        trouble as it is.

                                 JAKE
                        But he's being haunted!

           Cecilia tenses, deeply disturbed by hearing this.

                                 CECILIA
                        The last thing I want to talk about
                        right now is ghosts... Now go to bed. 

           And Jake knows he'll be getting nothing more from her. 

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Jake sits on the floor, paging through an old PHOTO ALBUM.
           Gazing at the images of him and Calvin going back through
           the years. Trick or treating together. Having a pizza party.
           Holding up all-seeing eyes in the Occultorium.

           He flips further back, into his younger years...

           And stops on an old photo of Calvin as a younger man,
           holding BABY JAKE in his arms.
           Only Calvin looks different then. Normal clothes. Brown
           hair. No conspiratory gleam in his eyes. Not a larger than
           life Uncle. Just an ordinary guy, smiling at his new nephew.

           Jake stares at this man, so different than the Uncle he
           knows today...

           Pling!

           He looks up. Pling! Pling! PEBBLES HITTING HIS WINDOW.

           Jake sees DOVE OUTSIDE, holding her skateboard.

           EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Jake sneaks out the door. Zips up his coat.

                                 DOVE
                        I'm such a bad influence on you.

           She rides off. Jake scrambles to get his bike and follow.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND -- NIGHT

           No one around at this hour. The teeter totter and merry-go-
           round giving off the occasional squeak in the breeze.

           Jake and Dove sway on the swings, forward and back...

                                 DOVE
                        How's he doing?

                                 JAKE
                        My mom says I'm not allowed to see
                        him for a while.

                                 DOVE
                        That sucks. So no more Ghost Club?

                                 JAKE
                        Guess not.

                                 DOVE
                        I want to say he's gonna be okay...
                        But I hate it when people say that
                        shit like they know it's true.

                                 JAKE
                        So don't say it then.

                                 DOVE
                        I hope it though.
                                 JAKE
                        I hope so too.

           They sway in silence.

                                 DOVE
                        I like you, Jake. You don't put on
                        any kind of act. You're not cool and
                        you don't think you are.

                                 JAKE
                        Thanks. I guess?

                                 DOVE
                        I'm just saying that you're real,
                        y'know? That makes you interesting.

                                 JAKE
                        You're interesting too.

                                 DOVE
                        Ha! If you could slap a tag on me and
                        put me on a shelf, you know what it'd
                        say? "Somewhat damaged."

                                 JAKE
                        We're all a little damaged.

                                 DOVE
                        I'm in a special category though. One
                        of these days, your mom will say you
                        can't hang out with me anymore too,
                        just like your Uncle.

                                 JAKE
                        She wouldn't do that.

                                 DOVE
                        Sure she would. Haven't you figured
                        it out yet? I'm the girl your mom
                        warns you about.

           She hops off the swing, landing gracefully. Breezes over to
           the merry-go-round. Jake follows her.

                                 JAKE
                        Where did you go that day? When you
                        got on that bus.

                                 DOVE
                        Nowhere really.

           She slowly spins... But Jake waits for a real answer.
                                 DOVE
                        My cash grab didn't take me as far as
                        I wanted... Only a few towns over. I
                        tried to con my way into a punk rock
                        show, but the bouncer didn't buy that
                        I was eighteen for a second. Wound up
                        hanging at a 24-hour doughnut shop
                        till my mom and Billy found me. Let's
                        just say the ride home was stressful. 

                                 JAKE
                        Are you gonna try and leave again?

                                 DOVE
                        I don't know what I'm gonna do in the
                        next minute, let alone tomorrow, or
                        the next day. I just... I just don't
                        want to die like all those other poor
                        souls, you know. Miserable in their
                        own skin, always trying to shed it.

           She slows the the merry-go-round to a stop.

                                 DOVE
                        Do you ever think about your funeral?

           Jake shakes his head "no."

                                 DOVE
                        I do. All the time. How would you
                        want to be posed in your coffin?

                                 JAKE
                        You get a choice?

                                 DOVE
                        Why not. You can pick your box and
                        your plot. Why not pick your pose? I
                        mean, most people do the obvious.

           She lies down on the ground, closing her eyes, folding her
           hands across her chest.

                                 DOVE
                        But I want something more grunge.
                        Like Kurt Cobain style.

           She flips the bird with a rock star sneer. Jake laughs.

                                 DOVE
                        What about you? Pick your pose.

           Jake thinks about it. Then lies down next to her. He holds
           up his hands, face frozen in mock terror.
                                 DOVE
                        What the hell is that?

                                 JAKE
                        I'm buried alive.

                                 DOVE
                        Oooooh, primo. Some mortician's
                        getting fired now.

           They both laugh, lying next to each other under the stars.

                                 DOVE
                        Maybe I'll get cremated. Coffins just
                        take up space anyway. And then
                        someone can scatter me in the wind.
                        I'd be everywhere then.

                                 JAKE
                        Like the sun.

           She turns to him, their eyes meeting.

                                 DOVE
                        Yeah. Something like that.

           A shared smile. Their faces close.

           Then Dove stands, moseying over to the monkey bars. Jake
           gets up, watching her climb.

                                 DOVE
                        I've gotta get out of this town,
                        Jake. Hook up with some guy with a
                        motorcycle and long hair. I'm
                        flexible on hair length, but the
                        motorcycle is a must.

           We can practically feel Jake's heart breaking...

           Dove sees the look on his face and realizes --

                                 DOVE
                        Oh, Jake...

           She goes to him. He looks away, trying to hide his pain.

                                 DOVE
                        Oh no, I didn't mean to... Shit. It's
                        just... The things I want are
                        different from the things you want.

                                 JAKE
                        I want the same things you do.
                                 DOVE
                        No you don't.

           He can't look her in the eye. She gently takes his hand.

                                 DOVE
                        This much is true, though... I could
                        pass into the long dark with you.

           He lifts his head, not understanding.

                                 DOVE
                        That's what my setsuné used to call
                        death. Blackness smooth as oil,
                        stretching into forever. She said
                        you've got to think hard about whose
                        hand you're holding when that long
                        dark takes hold. Someone strong and
                        solid, with a good heart. I was
                        holding her hand when she died. If
                        you're still around whenever it
                        happens, maybe you could hold mine.

           Jake takes a shaky breath. Then manages a nod.

           Dove smiles. Then pulls him in for a hug.

                                 DOVE
                        Your Uncle's lucky to have you.

           Jake forces a nod, trying to hold back tears.

           INT. KITCHEN, JAKE'S HOUSE -- MORNING

           Jake sits alone at the table, pensively swirling his spoon
           in his bowl of oatmeal. Cecilia breezes in wearing scrubs,
           gathering things in her work bag.

                                 CECILIA
                        There are cold cuts in the fridge for
                        lunch. And no Occultorium or any
                        other ghost stuff. Understood?

           Jake nods. She heads for the door.

                                 JAKE
                        Mom?
                                 (
                                  off her look
                                             )
                        Have you heard from him?

           Cecilia hesitates, masking her concern as only a parent can.
                                 CECILIA
                        No, but that's not unusual. He'll get
                        through this. He always does. Just...
                        Let him be. Got it?

                                 JAKE
                        Got it.

           And she's out the door.

           But the moment it closes, Jake's eyes rise to the PHONE...
           The house is quiet, nothing stopping him...

           He picks it up and dials a number. Listens as it rings...
           Rings... Then a click, and SPOOKY MUSIC PLAYS.

                                 CALVIN (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        Greetings, fair traveler. You've
                        reached the Occultorium. We may have
                        wandered into another dimension, but
                        kindly leave a message, and we'll get
                        back to you upon our return... Should
                        we return at all...

           BEEP. Jake hangs up. Considering his next move...

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- DAY

           Jake rides up, getting off his bike.

           He goes to the door and pulls on it -- LOCKED. A "CLOSED"
           sign in the window. He knocks on the door anyway.

                                 JAKE
                        Hey Uncle Calvin? You in there?

           He knocks louder. No response. He presses his face to the
           window, but there's no activity inside.

           Jake glances around, noticing CALVIN'S BIKE, locked tight to
           a post. Looks up to the little apartment above the shop.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin, you home? Uncle Calvin?

                                 LEXINGTON (O.S.)
                        Let it go, kid. He's probably still
                        sleepin'.

           Lexington comes out the door of his shop.

                                 JAKE
                        Is he okay?
                                 LEXINGTON
                        More or less.

                                 JAKE
                        You're sure?

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Calvin's strong. Always has been.

           He heads back towards his shop --

                                 JAKE
                        Why were you so scared to go to that
                        burned out house?

           Lexington turns, considering his answer.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Maybe I spook easy.

                                 JAKE
                        I'm not stupid.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        No... But you're young, kid, and this
                        ain't just some campfire story
                        anymore. Trust me. There are some
                        ghosts you don't wanna go huntin'
                        for. Leave him be.

           He steps back inside...

           Leaving Jake feeling no better about the situation. He
           sighs, frustrated. Then glances into the Occultorium window
           one more time. Eyes tracing over everything inside.

           Then something catches his attention... The SPIRIT PHONE
           sitting on the counter.

           And suddenly, a new idea hits him... He grabs his bike and
           rides off.

           EXT. FUNERAL HOME -- DAY

           Foreboding, even in daylight.

           Jake pulls up on his bike, taking it in with braver eyes.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME -- DAY

           The door creeks open as Jake enters. Not a welcoming place.

           He makes his way in, eyeing various coffins on display in a
           side room, lids open... Ready for occupants to fill them. 
                                 UNDERTAKER (O.S.)
                        May I help you?

           Jake startles as the Undertaker walks up behind him, the
           same man who was lurking when Calvin brought them at night.
           His eyes narrow as he sees Jake's face.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        You're Calvin's nephew.

           Jake nods.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        Here to see another dead body? I have
                        several lying in wait...

                                 JAKE
                        No... Thank you... Actually, I... I
                        wanted to talk to you.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        Has there been a death in the family?
                        Typically I handle the arrangements
                        with someone slightly... Older.

                                 JAKE
                        No, it's not that... Well, at least,
                        not recently. There's this old burned
                        out house past the edge of town...

           The mere mention makes the Undertaker uncomfortable.

                                 JAKE
                        My Uncle Calvin said two people died
                        there. A wife and a husband. I need
                        to know if it's actually true.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        It's not really my place to be
                        telling you --

                                 JAKE
                        You don't understand. Whatever
                        happened at that house, to those
                        people... Their spirits... I think
                        they're haunting my Uncle. He's in
                        trouble. Please.

           The Undertaker is torn, but he sees Jake's desperation. 

           STORAGE ROOM

           Jake follows the Undertaker into the dark, musty room,
           filled with shelves of boxes and filing cabinets.
           The Undertaker pulls one open, leafing through. Then he
           pauses. And PULLS OUT A FILE. He turns to Jake, considering.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        Are you sure you want to see this?

           Jake is nervous... But he's come too far now. He nods. The
           Undertaker hands him the file. Jake hesitantly opens it...

           Revealing a PHOTO OF A DECEASED WOMAN (20s) IN A CASKET.
           Serene but soulless. Jake flips past more photos of the
           Undertaker's work, eerie in their every detail.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        You really don't know...

                                 JAKE
                        Know what?

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        Surely you've seen pictures of her...

           Jake shakes his head, no idea what he's talking about. Flips
           another page. Scanning through information.

           Name: Lydia Sharpe. Age: 29. DOD: 08/14/86.

           And then he suddenly freezes, his hands starting to tremble.
           Because no ghost story could ever prepare him for this...

           SPOUSE: CALVIN SHARPE

           Jake stares at the name...

                                 JAKE
                        That's... That's my Uncle's name.

           The Undertaker takes a shaky breath. Then nods.

                                 JAKE
                        But that's impossible... He's never
                        been married.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        He was once. Your Aunt Lydia was
                        buried ten years ago... Right outside
                        in this very cemetery.

           Jake takes in the image of the woman in the casket. Stunned
           beyond words... Her haunting image boring into his soul.

                                 JAKE
                        But what about the other person?
                                 UNDERTAKER
                        What other person?

                                 JAKE
                        My Uncle said two people died there.
                        That her husband killed himself. But
                        he's still alive.

                                 UNDERTAKER
                        Hers was the only body to come
                        through my doors. There was no other.

           And that leaves Jake even more rattled.

           EXT. POND, FOREST -- DAY

           Jake and Billy sit at the pond's edge.

                                 BILLY
                        But he's never even mentioned her?
                        Not even once?

                                 JAKE
                        Never.

                                 BILLY
                        And if he was her husband and her
                        husband didn't die...

                                 JAKE
                        He's still haunted.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        I think it's her, Billy. The ghost
                        I've been looking for. It's like you
                        said. When a ghost doesn't get what
                        it wants, it starts haunting the next
                        generation in the family.

                                 BILLY
                        But... Your ghost doesn't look
                        anything like her.

                                 JAKE
                        Uncle Calvin said ghosts can look
                        different in death than in life. Even
                        not human at all.

           The unsettling thought sinks in.

                                 JAKE
                        He's been acting like she doesn't
                        exist for years... Maybe all she
                        wants is to see him again.

                                 JAKE (cont'd)
                                    really see him. Say
                        You know,
                        goodbye. Like you and your setsuné.

                                 BILLY
                        You can't take your Uncle back to
                        that house.

                                 JAKE
                        Maybe there's another place... If the
                        story's true, she didn't die at that
                        house, she died in some hospital.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        But I know where she's buried.

                                 BILLY
                        I don't know man... This seems like a
                        bad idea... If you're right, your
                        Uncle's been living with this ghost
                        for a long time. It could be really
                        powerful. Maybe there's a reason he's
                        never confronted her.

                                 JAKE
                        The whole reason we started the Ghost
                        Club was to confront ghosts.

                                 BILLY
                        I know. But I thought it'd be fun.
                        This is getting too real.

                                 JAKE
                        It was always real.

                                 BILLY
                        So maybe we should stop then. Just
                        leave it alone.

                                 JAKE
                        We can't just pretend like something
                        bad isn't happening.

           Billy doesn't reply, getting more uncomfortable.

                                 JAKE
                        Dove told me why your family really
                        moved here. What your dad did.

                                 BILLY
                        What?

                                 JAKE
                        It's okay man.
                                 BILLY
                        Dove told you? Dove's crazy. She says
                        bullshit all the time, you seriously
                        believe her?

           But his reaction is enough for Jake to know it's true.

                                 JAKE
                        My dad hasn't called me once since he
                        left... Sometimes I'm kinda glad
                        though. If he found out about the
                        Ghost Club, he'd just say I was a
                        sissy or a weirdo. I get what it's
                        like to have your dad be an asshole.

                                 BILLY
                        My dad's not an asshole! He... He's
                        just living somewhere else for a
                        little while.

           He looks away, unable to make eye contact.

                                 JAKE
                        I'm really sorry about what happened.
                                 (
                                  stands up
                                          )
                        But ghosts don't just go away on
                        their own. Not until they get what
                        they want or you force them to leave.

           He grabs his bike.

                                 BILLY
                        Jake...
                                 (
                                                )
                                  off Jake's look
                        Just be careful, okay?

           Jake meets his friend's worried gaze. Then nods. I will.

           INT. HALLWAY, JAKE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           All the lights off. Far past bedtime.

           Jake peeks out of his room... The coast is clear. He tiptoes
           down the hallway. Then pushes open a door into the --

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Where his mom is fast asleep.

           He silently makes his way to the dresser... Where his MOM'S
           PURSE sits. He reaches in and grabs her ADDRESS BOOK.

           CECELIA STIRS. Jake freezes... But she doesn't wake.
           And he slips back out the door.

           JAKE'S BEDROOM

           A flashlight snaps on, illuminating the address book. Jake
           flips to Calvin's entry. Numbers for "Home," "Occultorium."
           And a third phone number -- "FOR EMERGENCY ONLY."

           Jake dials the emergency number on the portable phone. Waits
           as it rings... Rings... Rings...

                                 CALVIN (FROM PHONE)
                        Warlock here. This line is secure.

           Jake smirks. Then muffles his mouth with his hand and
           garbles his voice, sounding as foreboding as he can manage.

                                 JAKE (INTO PHONE)
                        This is the Watcher. I've heard
                        reports of strange happenings at the
                        Oak Park Cemetery. Ghosts rising from
                        their graves.

           Silence from the other end. Jake waits, growing nervous --

                                 CALVIN (FROM PHONE)
                        Can this be corroborated?

                                 JAKE (INTO PHONE)
                        That's why I called you. My sources
                        tell me you can be trusted. Meet me
                        there at midnight.

                                 CALVIN (FROM PHONE)
                        Wait... Who are you? I've never heard
                        of the Watcher.

                                 JAKE (INTO PHONE)
                        That's because I'm always watching...

           He cringes, not his best line, but --

                                 CALVIN (FROM PHONE)
                        Of course. See you at midnight.

           Jake hangs up, proud of himself.

           INT. ENTRYWAY, JAKE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Jake tiptoes down the stairs. He quietly opens the door and
           steps out into the night. The door creaks closed behind him,
           and as it clicks shut --
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, JAKE'S HOUSE -- SIMULTANEOUS

           His mom's eyes open. She sits up in bed, looking around...

           EXT. ROAD -- NIGHT

           Jake pedals down a lonely road, armed with only a
           flashlight. He crests a hill to see --

           THE CEMETERY

           Where our story began... Crescent moon looming above,
           casting sharp shadows on the weathered tombstones. Eerily
           quiet, save the rustle of fallen leaves in the breeze.

           Jake pedals closer, trepidation building. But he soldiers
           on. Until he reaches the ARCHWAY separating the graveyard
           from the rest of the world. Stows his bike there.

           Then shines his flashlight ahead... At the ROWS AND ROWS OF
           TOMBSTONES waiting for him. He checks his watch...

           The sound of a clanking bike chain makes him turn.

           And there's Calvin, pedaling towards the cemetery. Jake
           signals with his flashlight, motioning him over.

           But Calvin doesn't look well. Even more scraggly and short
           on sleep than last time. He slows as he sees --

                                 CALVIN
                        Jake? What are you doing here?

                                 JAKE
                        My mom was getting suspicious, so I
                        used an alias to protect the club.

                                 CALVIN
                        You mean... You're the Watcher?
                                         )
                                 (
                                  chuckles
                        Like a supernatural secret agent.

                                 JAKE
                        Something like that.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        I found her, Uncle Calvin. The ghost
                        that's been haunting us.

           Calvin's brow furrows.

                                 CALVIN
                        The ghost?
                                 JAKE
                        You said we needed to find where the
                        ghost came from and confront it. If
                        we go to her grave together, I think
                        maybe she'll show herself.

           He steps through the archway... Heading down a path between
           the tombstones. Calvin hesitantly follows.

                                 CALVIN
                        I'm not sure I understand...

                                 JAKE
                        You'll see.

           They trek further, passing grave after grave. Calvin's
           unease grows with every step. Frightened by this place. 

                                 JAKE
                        This is it...

           He slows, shining his light onto A STATUE OF A HOODED WOMAN
           WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, looming over them. Her stone eyes
           forever open, face etched in the subtlest smile.

           Jake turns, taking in his Uncle's face...

           Only Calvin doesn't seem scared or sad... More...
           Confused... Like when you haven't seen someone in a very
           long time, and you're struggling to recall their name.

           But then his gaze steadies, remembering...

                                 CALVIN
                        Ah yes... Black Agnes.

           Jake's eyes narrow. Who?

                                 CALVIN
                        She... She, uh...
                                  struggling
                                 (
                                           )
                        She lived here with her husband a
                        long time ago... Back in the horse
                        and buggy days. Till one night,
                        she... She drowned... Drowned in the
                        river. Now she wanders... Her dress
                        blackened by mud and grime --

                                 JAKE
                        Her name's not Agnes.

                                 CALVIN
                        It's... It's not?
                                 JAKE
                        It's okay... We don't have to be
                        scared of her anymore.

           He shines his light on the grave's inscription --

                                L Y D I A   S H A R P E

           And as Calvin stares at the name, the faintest hint of
           recognition begins to shine through...

                                 CALVIN
                        She... She has my last name...

           He looks up at the stone face, those familiar stone eyes...

                                 CALVIN
                        But I... I don't know a Lydia...

           Confusion washes over Jake's face.

                                 CALVIN
                        Or maybe I... No...

                                 JAKE
                        Of course you know her. She was --

           Calvin shakes his head violently, startling Jake.

                                 CALVIN
                        I'm not... I don't...

           His trembling hands frenzy through his hair. Jake takes a
           step back, growing more alarmed.

                                 CALVIN
                        Her name's Agnes... She... She
                        drowned... I...

           And Jake realizes he's made a terrible mistake bringing his
           Uncle to this place --

                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        Jake! Calvin!

           CECILIA HURRIEDLY APPROACHES.

                                 CECILIA
                        Jake, get away from him!

           Jake moves away as his Mom rushes to her brother.

                                 CECILIA
                        Calvin? Cal?
           Calvin takes deep, steadying breaths.

                                 CALVIN
                        I uh... I feel a little strange...

           He gazes at the statue.

                                 CALVIN
                        Does she... Does she look familiar?

                                 CECILIA
                        She might... What do you think?

                                 CALVIN
                        I... I don't know...

           Cecilia gently wraps a hand around his arm.

                                 CECILIA
                        Maybe it'll come back to you another
                        day... Besides, there are a lot of
                        Sharpes in this area.

                                 CALVIN
                        Yeah... A lot of Sharpes.

           He tilts his head... Looking up into those stone eyes...

           Then he reaches out, touching the statue's outstretched
           hand... And smiles slightly, returning hers.

                                 CALVIN
                        Humblest apologies for disturbing
                        you, fair maiden. Back to your
                        eternal rest.

           And with that, he steps away, following Cecilia.

                                 CALVIN
                        Whoever she is, I wish I'd known
                        her... Must've been beautiful.

                                 CECILIA
                        Must've been. Want a ride home?

                                 CALVIN
                        Yeah... I'm awfully tired...

           Jake watches as his mom leads Calvin away...

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Jake sits on his bed, in a daze. Unable to wrap his mind
           around this reality. He looks up as his mom walks in.
                                 JAKE
                        Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't know --

                                 CECILIA
                        You didn't know because I didn't tell
                        you... You did what you did because
                        you love your Uncle.

                                 JAKE
                        But why doesn't he remember her?

           She sighs, sitting down next to him.

                                 CECILIA
                        Some things you leave buried hoping
                        they stay buried.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        I was gonna tell you what happened
                        when you were older... But I guess
                        that's now.

           She strokes his hair.

                                 CECILIA
                        I know Uncle Calvin told you some
                        ghost stories... If you're ready,
                        I'll tell you one more.

           Jake nods. Cecilia takes a shaky breath.

           Then she picks up one of Jake's ghost books off his
           nightstand, flipping through it.

                                 CECILIA
                        It all started here...

           She comes to a stop on a familiar image.

                                 JAKE
                        The Screaming Tunnel?

                                 CECILIA
                        That's where your Uncle Calvin and
                        Aunt Lydia had their very first date.

           Jake stares at the tunnel, seeing it with a new perspective
           now... And as he does, the old photo DISSOLVES INTO THE REAL
           PLACE as we find ourselves in --

           OUR LAST GHOST STORY

           The Screaming Tunnel stands foreboding as ever. YOUNGER
           CALVIN and LYDIA step towards it, taking in the sight.
           They're in their 20s. Calvin in conservative slacks and
           shirt, with skeptical eyes. While Lydia looks more like
           Calvin in the present, a hippy without a care and that all
           too familiar wide-eyed gleam.

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        They met in college. Believe it or
                        not, your Uncle was studying physics.
                        Back then, he only believed what
                        could be seen. Until he met Lydia,
                        whose passions lay in the mysterious
                        unknown...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Calvin and Lydia step into the tunnel, holding a flashlight.
           Huddled close as their footsteps echo.

                                                              FLASHBACK:

           Calvin leads Jake and the Ghost Club into the same tunnel.
           They turn off their flashlights, bringing us into darkness.
           And from that darkness --

                                                     BACK TO GHOST STORY:

           LYDIA LIGHTS A MATCH. She and Calvin stare into it...

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        But inside that tunnel, something
                        magical happened...

           The two of them gaze into the light together... Then their
           eyes meet. A shared smile and laugh.

           And then a sweet KISS. That life changing kiss when you know
           you've found your love.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           We move through the same warm home we saw in the previous
           ghost story. Only now CALVIN AND LYDIA ARE IN THE PHOTOS.
           Laughter from the kitchen draws us in... Where Calvin and
           Lydia cook dinner together.

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        After they got married, they built a
                        house outside of town. They were
                        planning to raise a family there.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           That same house we saw in Calvin's ghost story. Glowing like
           a beacon in the DARK WOODS that surround it.
                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        Calvin called it their own little
                        corner of the world. And it was...
                        Until one night...

           The FOUR DARK FIGURES emerge from the woods.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Knock... Knock... Knock... Calvin and Lydia's heads turn,
           startled. Then Calvin walks over to the door. 

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        The truth is, Jake, there are things
                        out there far scarier than ghosts...

           CALVIN OPENS THE DOOR... It's not a monster outside, but a
           MAN. A little scruffy, shivering in the cold.

                                 MAN
                        I'm so sorry to bother you, but my
                        car broke down and my kids are gonna
                        be worried sick. Could I trouble you
                        to use your phone? Only be a minute.

           Calvin hesitates. Then smiles sympathetically.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A GLOVED HAND pulls the phone off the wall. The other hand
           brandishes a KNIFE and CUTS THE CHORD.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Moving through the house once again, past the photos of
           Calvin and Lydia. But now there's BROKEN GLASS. Upended
           furniture. And a TRAIL OF BLOOD, leading us to see --

           Calvin holding Lydia in his arms, bending over her, his body
           blocking the worst carnage. She's barely hanging on.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A 1970s YELLOW CAR speeds down a dark road. The same car
           from Calvin's second ghost story. Calvin drives frantically,
           shirt covered with blood, gripping his wife's hand.

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        Your Uncle drove her towards the
                        hospital as fast as he could.

           Calvin looks over to his wife, holding a SCARF to her wound,
           trying to stem the flow of blood...
           And the car drifts over the center line... HEADLIGHTS from
           the opposite direction. CALVIN IS ABOUT TO HIT THEM HEAD ON.
           HE YANKS THE WHEEL --

           Sending his car CRASHING THROUGH A BARRICADE, into the
           darkness beyond. We hear a SPLASH --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE CAR IS FULL OF WATER. Calvin frantic, desperate for air,
           scarcely able to see anything. Until SOMETHING SHINY STANDS
           OUT in the dark water -- LYDIA'S EARRINGS.

                                                              FLASHBACK:

           Jake watches as Calvin lowers those SAME EARRINGS into the
           water, gently moving them back and forth. Swish, swish...

                                                     BACK TO GHOST STORY:

           Something rises out of the dark water... LYDIA'S FACE
           breaking the surface, EYES OPEN BUT LIFELESS... Followed by
           her PALE BODY, like a ghost rising from her watery grave...
           On a backboard carried by RESCUE PERSONNEL.

           CALVIN WATCHES FROM THE SHORE, sobbing, crying out for his
           love, hands holding him back from rushing to her. He
           struggles against them, his whole world coming apart.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Calvin sits alone at the kitchen table in his house, staring
           off at nothing.

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        Afterwards, he went back to live in
                        that empty house...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Calvin sleeps on his side of the bed, the other side
           noticeably vacant.

           Knock... Knock... Knock... He sits up, looking around.

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        But her ghost lived on in his mind...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Calvin plods through the dark house, HANDS COVERING HIS EARS
           as the KNOCKING ECHOES ALL AROUND HIM. Knock! Knock! Knock!

                                                              FLASHBACK:
           Calvin stands in the remains of the burned out house,
           KNOCKING HIS HAND AGAINST THE DOOR FRAME OVER AND OVER
           AGAIN, as Jake and the others watch in dismay.

                                                     BACK TO GHOST STORY:

           Calvin continues to cover his ears, tears flowing. Only NOW
           WE DON'T HEAR KNOCKING. IT'S ALL IN HIS HEAD.

                                 CECILIA (V.O.)
                        And when he couldn't take it anymore,
                        he burned their home to the ground.

                                                         BACK TO PRESENT:

           Cecilia takes another shaky breath, tears welling up as Jake
           listens intently.

                                 CECILIA
                        He... He found a knife in the
                        rubble...

                                                              FLASHBACK:

           Calvin pulling off his sweatshirt in the raft, revealing
           that his TORSO IS COVERED IN VICIOUS SCARS.

                                                         BACK TO PRESENT:

                                 CECILIA
                        He almost died. Though I like to
                        think that what saved him is some
                        part of him still wanted to live...
                        For those of us he had left.

           Her gaze rises to meet Jake's... And the realization dawns.

                                 JAKE
                        He came to our house that night...
                        Didn't he?

           His mom solemnly nods. And suddenly, everything comes
           flooding back to Jake, as we --

                                                              FLASHBACK:

           To Jake (5) sitting in his bed in his dark bedroom,
           listening as --

           Thud, Thud... Thud, Thud... Echoing closer.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Jake steps into the hallway... And stops on sight of --
           THE DARK FIGURE at the far end. It wobbles and shakes,
           unsteady. Then it sees Jake... And moves towards him...

           Jake stands frozen as the Figure hobbles closer... Thud,
           Thud... Thud, Thud... Letting out a WAIL OF AGONY... Only it
           doesn't sound like a ghost... It's a person in excruciating
           pain. And then it steps into a faint patch of light --

           And we see IT'S CALVIN.

           SKIN AND CLOTHES BLACKENED BY SOOT FROM THE FIRE. BLOOD
           SEEPING out of the wounds on his torso. Tears streaming down
           his face. He stumbles forward, REACHING OUT WITH BLOODY
           HANDS TOWARDS --

           YOUNG JAKE SCREAMS, HORRIFIED.

           CECILIA RUSHES TO PULL HIM AWAY, shielding him as --

           CALVIN COLLAPSES onto the floor.

           We move back, taking it all in... Cecilia frantically
           struggling to help Calvin... As Young Jake cries,
           traumatized by the sight.

                                                         BACK TO PRESENT:

           Jake sits on the bed, no longer that little boy.

                                 JAKE
                        He's my ghost...

                                 CECILIA
                        I'm so sorry I didn't tell you... But
                        telling you meant telling you
                        everything. And the thought of it
                        broke my heart because I saw how you
                        looked up to your Uncle. Watching you
                        two grow close has been one of the
                        greatest joys of my life.

                                 JAKE
                        But why doesn't he remember?

                                 CECILIA
                        I don't know... Perhaps the same
                        reason you didn't. It's how his mind
                        dealt with the trauma.

           Her words linger, as Jake begins to understand...
                                 CECILIA
                        He'd lost so much blood that night,
                        the doctors had to put him into a
                        coma. And when he woke up weeks
                        later... He didn't remember anything.
                        Not the men who came out of the
                        woods. Not the car crashing into the
                        lake... He didn't even remember his
                        wife. It was all buried under
                        superstitions, conspiracy theories,
                        and... Ghost stories.

           She lovingly strokes his hair.

                                 CECILIA
                        This town is haunted for him. It's
                        full of his ghosts... But once you
                        sense their presence, they disappear
                        again.

           She wipes away her tears.

                                 CECILIA
                        After what happened, your dad didn't
                        want Calvin in our lives anymore. He
                        thought he was crazy. But I couldn't
                        throw him away like that. I love my
                        brother. I keep his secret because...
                        To do anything else would wreck him.
                        The few others who know keep it
                        because they care about him too. And
                        now, it's time to ask you...

           She takes Jake's hand...

                                 CECILIA
                        One day, your Uncle may turn a
                        corner... But until then, I need you
                        to promise to keep this secret. Some
                        ghosts are meant to wander. Can you
                        promise me that, Jake?

           Jake meets her gaze with all of the strength and fortitude
           he has gained. Then nods, resolute.

                                 JAKE
                        By the oath of the white mage.

           Cecilia smiles, wrapping her son up in a hug. They sit there
           on the bed together, holding each other close.

           EXT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- DAY

           Morning's light casts a warm glow on the old shop.
           Jake pulls up on his bike. Parks it in his usual spot out
           front. Eyes the "Open" sign in the window. But he hesitates,
           uncertain what he is going to find inside.

           Then he takes a fortifying breath... And steps through the
           shop's antique wooden door.

           INT. THE OCCULTORIUM -- CONTINUOUS

           The door dings as Jake steps in, glancing around. But Calvin
           is nowhere to be seen.

           His gaze drifts over the aisles... The tarot cards, ouija
           boards, and books on everything that goes bump in the night.
           Seeing it all with wiser eyes now.

                                 CALVIN (O.S.)
                        Greetings, fair traveler...

           Jake turns as his Uncle emerges from the back.

                                 CALVIN
                        What mysteries do you seek today,
                        Jakey-boy?

           The question hangs... Hard to tell his state of mind. 

                                 JAKE
                        Just... Browsing around.
                                     )
                                 (
                                  beat
                        How you feeling, Uncle Calvin?

                                 CALVIN
                        I'm... Pondering a mystery myself.
                        Had the strangest dream last night...

           Jake tenses. Calvin comes around the counter, brow furrowed.

                                 CALVIN
                        I was walking amongst tombstones. And
                        all around, ghosts were rising from
                        their graves like mist after a rain.
                        My heart was pounding. But then...

           A smile curls across his face, remembering...

                                 CALVIN
                        A brilliant glow pierced the darkness
                        like a lighthouse through a storm...
                        And this beautiful angel emerged. She
                        reached out her hand... And when I
                        touched it, all my fear was washed
                        away... Then I drifted off into the
                        most peaceful slumber...
           He gazes wistfully, still caught up in the memory. And Jake
           smiles, knowing his Uncle is going to be okay.

                                 CALVIN
                        Course I have no idea what it all
                        means. Could've just been that
                        burrito I ate. Dreams are funny like
                        that. Never been my specialty.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Speaking of specialties... I've been
                        ruminating on your ghost, and I've
                        broadened the scope of our inquiry to
                        include some additional sites of –-

                                 JAKE
                        I found my ghost.

                                 CALVIN
                        What? You did?! But who was it? Did
                        you establish spectral communication?
                        Why was it haunting you?

           Jake searches for the right words...

                                 JAKE
                        He was... Hurt. He'd lost his
                        family... But he wasn't ready to move
                        on yet. I don't think he was trying
                        to scare me. I just think he... He
                        didn't want to be alone anymore. But
                        whenever he's ready, I'll help him
                        find what he's looking for.

           Calvin gazes at his nephew, beaming with pride.

                                 CALVIN
                        Like I said, Jake... You're braver
                        than you give yourself credit for.

           But then he lowers his voice, that familiar gleam back.

                                 CALVIN
                        Though a word of caution... I just
                        got off a very important call, highly
                        classified. Apparently, some baby
                        crocodiles have found their way into
                        our town's sanitation system. So just
                        be sure you're not too brave when you
                        sit down on your commode...

           Jake smirks, but quickly hides it.

                                 JAKE
                        I'll be careful.
                                 CALVIN
                        Though I suppose... Now that you've
                        found your ghost, there's not much
                        need for our ghost club anymore...

           A tinge of melancholy. Jake sees how much this means to him.

                                 JAKE
                        I mean... Ghosts live forever, right?
                        No reason our club can't live on too.

           The thought of that makes Calvin smile. Jake raises his
           pinkie finger. Calvin locks it with his. A promise made.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- EVENING

           Autumn has arrived, the trees blazing with red, yellow, and
           orange. HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS on lawns and houses.

           The members of the Saturday Night Ghost Club stroll down the
           sidewalk together, trick or treating. Jake is a vampire,
           Billy a wolfman, Dove is Carmen Sandiego on her skateboard.
           And Lexington, being who he is, is just dressed normally.

           But Calvin is fully in his element. Decked out as a ghoul in
           a homemade costume and impressive makeup.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        As we grow up, we stop believing in
                        the things that my Uncle does.
                        Society beats that stuff out of us.
                        But to find an adult who really sees
                        the world the way a kid does... Who
                        believes in what a kid believes...

           Jake turns to Calvin, gazing with mature admiration.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Some may call that a tragedy... But I
                        don't see it that way. I consider my
                        Uncle a miracle.

           Lexington veers off, heading to his parked van.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Gotta get back to the shop, big movie
                        rental night. Cal, you want a ride?

           Calvin stops and stares up at the sky.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Cal?
                                 CALVIN
                        Looks like no full moon tonight.
                        It'll be safe to walk.

                                 LEXINGTON
                        Suit yourself. Later ghost hunters.

           They continue down the street as Lex drives off.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Lex remained a loyal friend to my
                        Uncle, dutifully keeping his secret.
                        Though his business sense never
                        improved. After the advent of DVDs
                        forced him to close LaserDisc Land,
                        he opened up a camera shop instead,
                        and called it... Polaroid Dreams.

           EXT. DOVE AND BILLY'S HOUSE -- EVENING

           The Ghost Club stops in front of the Yellowbird House.

                                 BILLY
                        Bye Calvin! See you at school, Jake!

                                 DOVE
                        Or in the spirit realm, whichever
                        comes first. Lates!

           Jake waves as they head towards their house together.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Billy started seeing a therapist too.
                        Eventually he'd talk about what
                        happened with his dad. But his love
                        of ghost stories lived on. After
                        college, he drove across the country,
                        exploring haunted sites and writing
                        books. His first was called, "Tales
                        from the Occultorium" and was
                        dedicated to my Uncle.

           Jake's gaze drifts to Dove, watching her do one last
           skateboard trick outside before going in.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I'd never fall for anyone as hard as
                        I did for Dove Yellowbird. You always
                        fall hardest the first time. I
                        haven't seen her in years, but Billy
                        tells me she lives in a bohemian loft
                        in San Francisco. She took up drawing
                        and sure enough, was a natural.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        She sent me a piece for my birthday
                        once. It was called, "The Long Dark."

           INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM -- EVENING

           Jake steps in. Sets down his pumpkin of Halloween candy.
           Then opens the drawer with his drawings of the Dark Figure.
           Flips through them... Only they aren't scary to him anymore.

           He tosses them in the trash, no need for them now.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        As for me... I'd like to think I
                        followed in my Uncle's footsteps and
                        became a ghost hunter... Of sorts.

           INT. SMALL AUDITORIUM -- DAY

           We move past a poster reading, "Neuropsychology New Student
           Orientation - The Ghosts of our Past: Coping With Trauma.
           Special Guest - Dr. Jacob Baker, Ph.D."

           A small gathering of GRADUATE STUDENTS listen as ADULT JAKE
           (40s) speaks from the podium with a mature confidence.

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Our brains are the most haunted sites
                        in the world. Filled with the ghosts
                        of our pasts. The ones we bury away.
                        The ones we try to forget. And if we
                        tell ourselves our ghost stories long
                        enough, they can become our reality.

           A familiar gleam in his eye. He may as well be Calvin
           telling stories around the campfire.

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        But like my Uncle, we are the truth
                        seekers... Wading through the spooky
                        forest that is the human mind. We
                        don't always know where we're going
                        or what lurks around the next corner.
                        But we soldier on, seeking to shed
                        light on our patients' mysteries.
                        Whatever they may be...
                                 (smiles)
                        So today... I'd like to formally
                        welcome you into our Ghost Club. And
                        as members, you're expected to never
                        stop braving the night.

           The audience applauds. As it quiets, a STUDENT raises her
           hand. Jake motions to her.
                                 STUDENT
                        Dr. Baker, is your Uncle still with
                        us?

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        He is. Still running the Occultorium.
                        And still the best Uncle a kid could
                        ask for.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- DAY

           A young boy, NICHOLAS (5), walks down the sidewalk, timid
           and skittish in his little Iron Man costume. Nestled safely
           between Adult Jake and Older Calvin (70s), walking on either
           side. Other costumed Trick or Treaters stroll past. 

           They come to a house with a PUMPKIN FULL OF CANDY on the
           porch, and a SCARY MECHANICAL GHOST looming over it,
           lighting up and making spooky sounds. Cheesy to us, but
           frightening to five-year-old eyes.

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Go on...

           But Nicholas hesitates, fear shining through.

                                 CALVIN
                        Nicholas, did your dad ever tell you
                        about the ghosts haunting this town?

           Nicholas looks up to Jake, who responds with a coy shrug.

                                 CALVIN
                        It's true. But don't be afraid...

           He kneels down in front of Nicholas.

                                 CALVIN
                        Most of them mean us no harm. Merely
                        harmless reflections of gentle-minded
                        souls. They've just lost their way.
                        Now they wander the great unknown in
                        search of peace, wishing to guide us
                        to safety whenever we're in danger.
                        And sometimes, just before you fall
                        asleep at night, you might see one of
                        them shimmering... Watching over you.

           Nicholas smiles. That doesn't sound so bad.

                                 CALVIN
                        And that, is why I'll always believe
                        in ghosts.
           Nicholas turns to the mechanical ghost, not so frightening
           anymore. He scampers up to it and grabs a piece of candy out
           of the pumpkin. Jake can't help but smile, moved by the
           sight. Calvin holds out his hand to his grand-nephew.

                                 CALVIN
                        Come along, Nicky-boy. My sources
                        tell me they're handing out full-
                        sized candy bars on Walnut Lane...

           Nicholas takes his great Uncle's hand and they all head off
           down the street together. And we can't help noticing how
           happy Calvin is trick or treating with his family.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I don't know why such awfulness
                        befell my Uncle... All I know is that
                        deep down, where he keeps his ghosts,
                        he also keeps his strength. He's the
                        strongest man I've ever known.

           We move up and away as they walk past goblins and monsters
           navigating the neighborhood, out for candy and adventure...

           Until we land on a GHOST DECORATION hanging from a tree,
           fluttering in the breeze... 

                                                               FADE OUT.
