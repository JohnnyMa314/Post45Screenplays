           Right now aboard the International Space Station, SIX 
           astronauts are spending their hours working, living, eating, 
           exercising, and sleeping in the close quarters of the vessel. 

           Half of the ISS was contributed by RUSSIA, the other half by 
           the UNITED STATES. 

           The same can be said for its crew...
           OVER BLACK

           HEAVY NERVOUS BREATHS.

                                                            FADE IN TO:

           INT. SOYUZ SPACECRAFT. 

           We see the sweat-drenched brow of DR. KIRA WILLIAMS (30), 
           newly an astronaut in every sense of the word. She's a 
           natural alpha personality, and an extrovert to boot. However, 
           in recent years she’s carefully practiced repressing those 
           qualities. 

           A woman’s voice with a RUSSIAN ACCENT crackles through the 
           comms-system.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Entering final approach...

           Kira is listening, but in addition to her hood’s built-in 
           headset, she’s managed to run an additional headphone to one 
           of her ears. We trace the cable to -- 

           An old school CD Walkman. The device is long past its heyday, 
           but after what looks like multiple DIY surgeries, it's still 
           in working order.

           Kira's nervous eyes peer through her glass visor, zig-zagging 
           between the various monitors to the small circular window. 
           Outside it, we can see --

           The massive Space Station. It’s the size of a football field, 
           and its white exterior glows bright against the darkness.  

           Kira’s eyes widen at the sight -- Wow. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Pretty something, huh?

           In the seat next to Kira, we meet CHRISTIAN (late 20s), a 
           bookish, valedictorian type. If you’ve ever gone to a party 
           when you were supposed to be studying for an exam, then you 
           and Christian don’t have much in common. Oddly enough though, 
           he and Kira actually might...

           Kira half-nods in response. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        Don't worry. Worst part's over.
                             (beat)
                        But...

                                 (MORE)
                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        This is right about the point when I 
                        spewed hard on my first ride up 
                        here...
                             (beat)
                        It was oatmeal... mostly... Got 
                        everywhere. Just floating all over 
                        the place y'know? 

           Kira closes her eyes tight. 

                                 KIRA
                        I'm sorry to hear that...

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I think Gordon's still mad about it. 

           Her focus shifts to the Walkman. Although we don’t hear the 
           music, we are able to make out the sound of the CD as it 
           begins to skip within the device --

           Carefully, Kira runs a gloved thumb over the old silver duct 
           tape that’s holding the plastic battery cover in place. 

           She removes the headphones from their jack, blows into the 
           input, and then slides ear-pods back in, and presses play. 
           From Kira’s reaction, we get the impression that it’s working 
           again. 

           Christian regards the relic.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        Y'know technology's come a long way  
                        since they made those things. 

           Kira places a protective hand over her Walkman, as her eyes 
           move back to the ISS. 

                                 KIRA
                             (re: the ISS)
                        Y'know it's come a long way since 
                        they made that thing too, right?

           Christian settles back into his seat.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Just wait till you get onboard.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Standing by for contact... 

           Hearing that, Kira’s eyes snap shut. 
           The vessel carrying her is a Russian craft called a SOYUZ. It 
           JERKS as it connects with something outside of its tight 
           walls. We hear metal SHIFTING from somewhere beyond the 
           vessel. 

           Kira holds her breath through it all, until --

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Contact and capture confirmed. 

           She exhales slightly, anticipating whatever is supposed to 
           come next.   

           It’s quiet. 

           She waits for something to happen, but nothing does... The 
           lull in action is enough to tickle at the concern center of 
           our brains.

                                 KIRA
                             (hiding nerves)
                        Does it usually take this long?

           Christian shrugs. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Oh, man. Sometimes it takes hours. 

           He notices Kira's uncomfortable state. 

           Kira waits. More sweat seems to accumulate, struggling to 
           cling against her head in the absence of gravity. Christian 
           takes notice.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        ...But they do always open the door 
                        eventually.

           Long beat. Then --

           KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK!

           Three staccato metallic THUMPS resonate from the other side 
           of the Soyuz’s entry hatch, BOOMING through the small space. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        See?

           Kira sighs with relief. A thin smile curls her lips as she 
           finally removes her ear-pods and wraps their thin cable 
           around the Walkman. Then --

           We hear the sound of heavy metal sliding, and --
           BLINDING LIGHT pours into the Soyuz. 

           Kira squints through it. Our eyes adjust with hers, allowing 
           us to see --

           FOUR OTHER ASTRONAUTS in mixed colored jumpsuits, 2 in blue, 
           2 in green. They clap their hands together, celebrating the 
           new arrivals. 

           The astronaut nearest us is a kind-faced man, wearing a faded 
           New York Mets cap. He’s presumably the person who was 
           KNOCKING. This is ALEXEY PULOV (30s). We’ll get to know him 
           better momentarily. 

           He extends a hand, helping to pull a now smiling Christian 
           from the seat and out of the Soyuz.

           Once on the other side he yanks Alexey in for a hug and then 
           moves to greet the others. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        I missed you guys too.

           A handsome GI JOE type, with close-cut hair and a military 
           demeanor, pushes his way toward the front. Meet GORDON 
           BARRETT (late 30s). He slaps a welcoming hand around 
           Christian's before moving back toward the hatch where Kira 
           still waits in darkness.    

           He reaches out his arm for Kira to take. 

           Her body floats away from her seat, out of the darkness and 
           toward the light of the ISS. She clasps her hand around 
           Gordon’s. 

                                 GORDON
                        Dr. Williams. Welcome to the most 
                        remote desert island known to man.  

           The group of astronauts laugh. Off Gordon’s smirk, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           TITLE CARD: 

                                           ISS

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ISS - LATER

           Kira scrolls back a collapsible door, revealing that she is 
           no longer in her spacesuit, but rather a familiar blue 
           jumpsuit with an AMERICAN FLAG prominently featured on the 
           shoulder. 

           Inside, the ISS is a blaring white mess of technology. Each 
           available inch of wall space has been put to use. 
           Experiments, life support, and vital utilities occupy every 
           visible nook and cranny. If we’re being honest, once you get 
           past the majesty of space, this entire thing is kind of an 
           eyesore...  

           Kira’s hair floats whimsically away from her skull. She pulls 
           it down only to have it drift back into the air above her. 

           She scoffs in disbelief, then --

                                 FAMILIAR VOICE (O.S.)
                             (Russian)
                        Hair tie?

           Kira turns to find, WERONIKA (30), sporting a green jumpsuit 
           with a Russian flag patched to it. She’s cut her hair in a 
           half-shaved pixie cut that actually seems to work without 
           gravity. Right off the bat, we can tell Weronika is cool in a 
           hipster kind of way.

                                 KIRA
                        ...Excuse me?

                                 WERONIKA
                             (with a smile)
                        Scrunchie?

           Weronika pulls a hair tie off her wrist and holds it out for 
           Kira to take. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        I’m not using it. 

           Kira accepts the offer, tying her hair back in a ponytail. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        Now you really look like one of us. 

           Kira smiles. 

                                 KIRA
                        That's good to hear. I feel like I'm 
                        a set of braces away from being back 
                        in middle school.

                        Thanks.  

                                 WERONIKA
                             (Russian -- no 
                              translation)
                        Vazhno to, chto my derzhimsya 
                        vmeste. 

           Kira stares at her, blankly.  

                                 KIRA
                        Just um... One more time, please? 

           Weronika laughs.

                                 WERONIKA
                        It means “The important thing is 
                        that we stick together.” It’s a 
                        quote from a famous astronaut. My 
                        training partner, Alexey, and I say 
                        it all the time. 

                                 KIRA
                        Who was the astronaut?

                                 WERONIKA
                        Buzz...

                                 KIRA
                        Aldrin?

           Weronika smiles, coyly. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Lightyear... 

           Kira smirks. 

           Weronika holds her hand out for a handshake. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        Weronika. 

           Kira hesitates, staring at Weronika’s hand -- just long 
           enough for her to take notice. 

           Forcing herself to save the interaction, Kira extends her 
           arm, thrusting it out in an over-practiced gesture. 

                                 KIRA
                        Kira.
                             (beat)

                        of intended. 

           Weronika smiles.

                                 WERONIKA
                        Don’t worry about it. 
                             (lowers her breath)
                        Between us... I still haven’t really 
                        gotten used to all this. 

                                 GORDON
                        I see you ladies’ve met. 

           They turn to find Gordon pulling his way toward them. 

           From their orientation he looks upside down, until he stops 
           and readjusts himself, dropping from the quasi-ceiling to the 
           quasi-floor, making himself eye level with them. 

           **Let’s take this opportunity to explain that everything 
           within the ISS is completely weightless. As such, every 
           wall/surface serves a purpose.**  

                                 KIRA
                        Yes, Weronika was just starting to 
                        help me get my bearings. 

                                 GORDON
                        Yeah?
                             (to Weronika)
                        Think you can help me with that when 
                        you’re done?

                                 WERONIKA
                        You’re hopeless. But I still have 
                        faith in Dr. Williams.

                                 GORDON
                        Fair enough. 
                             (to Kira)
                        Well, I’m glad to see you getting 
                        acquainted with my better half...

                                 WERONIKA
                        Gordon!

                                 GORDON
                        I was talking about the station.

           Weronika rolls her eyes. The spark between these two is not 
           lost on Kira... It's an uncomfortable realization. 
                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                             (to Kira)
                        How about a tour?

           Off Kira, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ISS - NODE TWO - MOMENTS LATER

           Gordon effortlessly glides through the station’s corridors -- 
           he’s been doing this for a while. Kira follows, less 
           gracefully.   

                                 GORDON
                        How do you like your bedroom? 

                                 KIRA
                        More of a closet, isn’t it?

                                 GORDON
                        S’not so bad. 

                                 KIRA
                        No, it's pretty much everything I 
                        was promised... Just think if you 
                        wanna call it a bedroom it should 
                        have a, y’know -- bed, not --

                                 GORDON
                        A sleeping bag Velcroed to the wall?

                                 KIRA
                        Yeah... 

                                 GORDON
                        S’comfier than the Soyuz though, 
                        ain’t it?  

                                 KIRA
                        High bar... 

                                 GORDON
                        Yeah, well just be grateful you got 
                        here in six hours... Took me two 
                        full days. And let me tell you, 
                        after a trip like that, when you 
                        hear a knock on the other side of 
                        the hatch you’re ready to kiss the 
                        first smiley Russian face you see. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Why just the Russians?
                                 GORDON
                        Could be a dog for all I care. 
                        Russians are just the ones who like 
                        to knock... Language barriers are 
                        less than they used to be, but they 
                        say it’s their way of letting you 
                        know that “it’s time to start paying 
                        attention.” I guess getting up here 
                        is just the commute... 

           Gordon moves along, returning his attention to the tour. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Node Two back there is pretty much 
                        your home away from home. Do 
                        whatever you want in your pod. 
                        Sleep, watch movies -- you can try 
                        the internet, but there’s better 
                        ways to waste your time up here, 
                        connection never really works. 
                             (beat)
                        Unfortunately, that means your loved 
                        ones’ll have to be pretty patient 
                        with you when you video chat. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Got it.  

           Despite Kira's efforts to blow past that comment, Gordon 
           detects a twinge of something in her voice. 

                                 GORDON
                        Shit, I feel like it just got colder 
                        in here or something.

                                 KIRA
                             (embarrassed/sarcastic)
                        Sorry, forgot everyone who comes up 
                        here spends five years training 
                        because they want to stay in touch 
                        with people.

           Gordon pauses. 

           We hear a constant LOW HUM resonate through the ISS. 

                                 GORDON
                        ...Touché.
                             (beat)
                        Well, I suppose I’ll take this 
                        awkward silence to point out that 
                        LOW HUM you’re hearing. 
                                 KIRA
                        I noticed. 

                                 GORDON
                        Hope you like the white noise, 
                        because that’s our life support. You 
                        hear that, it means everything's 
                        right as rain.
                             (half laughs)
                        When you don’t hear the hum... 
                        That’s when you can panic...

           Gordon turns his attention back to his tour, pulling himself 
           toward the next stop. 

           They pass through an open hatchway, to --

           INT. NODE ONE - CONTINUOUS

                                 GORDON
                        We pretty much share every space up 
                        here. So unfortunately I can’t offer 
                        you much seclusion, but I thought 
                        you might be excited to see where 
                        you’ll be working for the next six 
                        months or so. 

           A glimmer of excitement races across Kira's face as she lays 
           eyes on the small lab setup that’s been provided for her. 

           It’s only about four feet wide, but despite her restraint, 
           the sight is enough to put a smile on Kira’s lips.

           Gordon unhooks a small key-like object from his belt. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Here.

           She accepts the key. 

                                 KIRA
                        What’s this?

                                 GORDON
                        Key. Since Alexey and Weronika came 
                        up, the active experiments on board 
                        have gotten pretty far from safe if 
                        you don't know what you're doing...

                                 (MORE)
                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Like I said, we all pretty much 
                        share everything up here, so now if 
                        you wanna avoid anyone looking for 
                        extra watch glasses and accidentally 
                        ruining months of your research, 
                        just lock it down with that. Works 
                        on any American lock. You can use 
                        Russian cabinets if you want too, 
                        but you gotta trade keys.

                                 KIRA
                        Understood. 

           Kira looks back to the small lab. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        Gordon?

                                 GORDON
                        What can I do ya for?

                                 KIRA
                        ...I'd like a moment to get 
                        acquainted with the space. My 
                        cultures are time sensitive and I'm 
                        hoping to get some set up right 
                        away. 
                             (beat)
                        Alone, if that's alright. 

           Gordon makes a clicking sound with his cheek as he smiles at 
           her. 

                                 GORDON
                        Take as much time as you like, 
                        doctor. 

           He disappears from sight, leaving Kira to her own devices. 

           ALONE NOW -- Kira examines the lab. She runs her hands across 
           her samples, counts her beakers/tools, and takes stock of the 
           space. 

           She pulls back, taking it all in. 

                                 KIRA
                        This’ll do...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. NODE ONE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kira slips a glass slide under the lab’s mounted microscope 
           and peeks trough it, seeing -- 

           MICROSCOPE POV -- SEVERAL TISSUE CELLS float aimlessly on the 
           glass. Whatever they’re supposed to be doing, we get the 
           impression they’re not doing it.  

           Kira frowns, disappointed. Then --

                                 VOICE
                             (carefully annunciating)
                        Hello, doctor... 

           Kira looks up to see --

           ALEXEY as he enters. 

           He’s a seemingly nice enough guy, and a hard worker to boot, 
           but in terms of approachability, he’s a far cry from Weronika 
           and Gordon. 

           Kira is guarded. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        I hear we’ll be working closely. 

           Kira looks at him, puzzled. She doesn’t have the slightest 
           clue what he’s saying. Even if she spoke Russian, she 
           wouldn’t know what he is talking about. 

                                 KIRA
                             (broken Russian)
                        Hello...
                             (English)
                        ...Sorry, that's pretty much all I 
                        got...

           Alexey picks up on this. In an effort to make his intentions 
           more clear --

           He places one hand over his chest. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        ...Doctor -- 

                                 KIRA
                             (interrupting)
                        -- Pulov, right? I read about you in 
                        my dossier.

                        Actually I read a translation of 
                        your thesis on the contagious cancer 
                        among Tasmanian Devils as well. I 
                        would love to pick your brain on 
                        your work at some point while I'm --

           Before Kira can finish her sentence, Alexey points to one of 
           two laminated signs over the lab that reads --

           BIOLOGICAL ENGINEER: ALEXEY PULOV

           The other reads -- BIOLOGICAL ENGINEER: KIRA WILLIAMS

           Kira’s face drops, something sinks inside her at the sight.  

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                             (half to herself)
                        We’re sharing...?

           Alexey smiles, blankly. It’s his turn to not understand what 
           the other is saying.  

           Gordon re-enters, now joined by Weronika. 

                                 GORDON
                        Dr. Williams, this is Alexey 
                        Pulov... Far as I can tell, he’s the 
                        nicest bastard on the whole station. 

           Kira extends her hand -- a bit more casually this time. 

                                 KIRA
                        Pleased to meet you.  

           Alexey takes off his Mets cap, in an effort to be more 
           formal.

                                 ALEXY
                             (Russian)
                        Welcome aboard. 

                                 KIRA
                             (to Gordon)
                        I feel bad, they let me fast track 
                        through the language requirements 
                        way back at the start of my 
                        training. I don't understand him.  

                                 GORDON
                        Don't sweat it. Pulov's accent's 
                        about as rural as it gets. 
                                 WERONIKA
                        To tell the truth, even I ask him to 
                        repeat himself every once in a 
                        while... 

                                 GORDON
                        So, who knows, maybe he’s a prick.  

           Alexey smiles at Kira. She forces herself to reciprocate.

                                 KIRA
                             (to Gordon)
                        Seems nice enough. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Glad you think so, cuz now's your 
                        chance to get to know the bigger 
                        Pulov...

           Kira follows Gordon and Weronika out of The Node, leaving 
           Alexey alone. 

           Beat, then --

           Alexey wanders over to the microscope Kira had been using a 
           moment ago. He peeks in and examines the cells for himself. 

           Off Alexey --

           INT. ISS - NODE THREE - MOMENTS LATER

           Gordon and Kira pull their way into NODE THREE. In here we 
           find -- 

           Christian, already hard at work. His hands are in the 
           protective gloves of an airtight GLASS BOX experiment. 

           A few feet further into The Node -- NICHOLAI (late 30s), 
           rides as hard as he can on a stationary bike. Think Ivan 
           Drago, then age him up a bit and give him Dolph Lundgren’s 
           actual degree in chemical engineering. 

           INSIDE THE GLOVEBOX --

           Christian’s gloved arms use a handheld blowtorch to light a 
           chemical swab. 

           KIRA -- recoils as a perfectly spherical orb of fire expands  
           and BLASTS against the protective glass of Christian’s 
           experiment. 

           He takes notice. 
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Sorry about that.

           He removes his hand, turning the box’s protective glove 
           inside out in the process. 

           He notices Kira’s eyes drifting back toward the glass 
           glovebox. 

                                 KIRA
                        Looks safe... 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I know, but combustion’s totally 
                        secure in the glovebox. This thing 
                        is airtight -- state of the art... 
                        And I missed it very much. 

           His eyes roll toward Nicholai. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        -- But don’t ask me why they put it 
                        in the gym... 

           Kira smirks. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        They put the bathroom in here too. 
                        Do you hear me complain?

           Nicholai hops off the stationary bike, and then from our 
           perspective essentially maneuvers his body to the ceiling 
           where he begins lifting weights on a specialized machine. 

                                 GORDON
                             (to Nicholai)
                        ‘Bout the bathroom? Nah... But 
                        you’ve been salty about my bench 
                        press since I got up here.

           Nicholai scoffs. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        You’re the only person who can brag 
                        about lifting weights in zero 
                        gravity. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Whenever you're both done, Nicholai 
                        you can say hi to the new girl now.  

           Between reps, Nicholai throws a halfhearted salute/wave 
           toward Kira. 
                                 KIRA
                        Pleasure. 

                                 WERONIKA
                             (to Kira)
                        Give him a couple days to warm up. 
                        He's a teddy bear.

                                 GORDON
                             (to Christian)
                        Speaking of bragging rights, you 
                        bring it up or what? 

           Christian moves to a specially designed backpack that he has 
           fixed to the nearby wall.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Thought you'd never ask.    

           Kira watches him fish through the pack until he unearths a 
           small basketball and hands it to Gordon. 

                                 GORDON
                        It's perfect. I owe ya one!

                                 KIRA
                        You requested a basketball...?

                                 GORDON
                        You kidding me? I've been waiting 
                        two months for this thing. 

           Nicholai moves across the Node, accepting the ball from 
           Gordon. He turns toward a small hoop fit for a kid's bedroom 
           that's been set up above the door. And --

           He shoots, effortlessly bouncing the ball off the ceiling and 
           through the hoop. Gordon frowns at the site, just as --

           Alexey enters the node, plucking the ball out of the air. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                             (to Nicholai)
                        What's that then, H.O.R.S?

           Alexey passes the ball back to Gordon.

                                 ALEXEY
                        H.O.R.S.E. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        While I got all you guys here now, 
                        Santa actually brought presents for 
                        everyone this time. 
           He riffles through his bag, distributing a box of ALENKA 
           Russian chocolate bars to Nicholai. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        Good man. 

           Christian hands a rubber-banded stack of paperbacks to 
           Weronika. Her and Alexey trade selections.  

                                 ALEXEY
                        Spasibo. 

           Christian riffles further, remembering something. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Oh, and I got these from your niece! 

           He hands Weronika a stack of papers. She lights up at the 
           sight. Nicholai and Alexey moves closer, looking over her 
           shoulders. 

                                 WERONIKA
                             (Russian)
                        I think she really captured you guys 
                        this time.

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (smiles)
                        It's beautiful.

           We meet his gaze to see that they're looking at a child's 
           drawing. At first it looks like a series of colorful 
           scribbles, but labels help us realize the images are intended 
           to depict every member of the ISS crew. Everyone, but Kira 
           that is... 

                                 CHISTIAN
                             (to Kira)
                        Sorry, Williams. Wasn't sure what 
                        you'd be into. But --

           He lifts a small rocket ship keychain into view, letting it 
           dangle on a long strap.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Something from the gift shop. The 
                        strap is the same webbing we use in 
                        our tethers.
                             (beat)
                        ...I'll do better next time.  

           Kira accepts the tiny trinket, surprised he thought of her at 
           all.  
                                 KIRA
                        I couldn't have asked for anything 
                        better.  

           Nicholai unwraps one of the Alenka bars, and instinctively 
           breaks it in half, giving the bigger side to his brother.   

                                 GORDON
                        If we're done with the Yankee swap, 
                        I was just about to show Dr. 
                        Williams Cupola for the first time, 
                        if you gentlemen are interested in 
                        joining us. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...I’ve heard a lot. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        You kidding me, seeing someone's 
                        first time never gets old.  
                             (to Kira)
                        We don’t have a lot to get excited 
                        about up here... But I do promise 
                        the YouTube tours have nothing on 
                        the real thing.

           Gordon moves her toward another hatch, this one is downward 
           from where we’re oriented. 

           They all wait for Kira to enter the hatch first. 

                                 GORDON
                        After you. 

           Kira moves forward, ever so slightly reserved. She reorients 
           herself, pulling her way toward the hatch so that it’s at eye 
           level, rather than looking down. 

           She peers in, and --

                                 KIRA
                        ...Whoah...

           Behind her, rest of the ISS crew match her gaze, all framed 
           perfectly within the view of the round hatchway. 

           We trace Kira’s eye line to find she’s staring at the ISS’s 
           glass-bottom observatory module. 

           She moves forward, fully placing herself inside --
           INT. CUPLOA MODULE - CONTINUOUS

           The bright blue glowing Earth occupies every inch of window 
           space. It’s beautiful. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Looking up at the ISS is one thing, 
                        but looking down from it. That's the  
                        special part.

                                 KIRA
                        Yeah. I mean... I’ve seen pictures 
                        but --

                                 GORDON
                        Soak it in. Only about 500 or so 
                        people have ever seen what you’re 
                        seeing.

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian - no translation)

           Kira turns her head to glance back, but can't quite remove 
           her eyes from Earth. Prompting -- 

                                 WERONIKA
                        He says "Suddenly five years 
                        training starts to make sense, no?"

           Gordon hangs friendly arms around the Pulov brothers in 
           agreement. 

           Kira presses her hand against the glass taking it all in. Her 
           eyes race from continent to continent. Then --

                                 KIRA
                        ...What’s that? 

                                 GORDON
                        What?

                                 NICHOLAI
                        She’s looking at Angkor Wat. 

                                 KIRA
                        No, it was like a fl--

           SUDDENLY -- 

           A small spark, like a match head, appears on the globe below, 
           and then FLARES out, causing our eyes to strain. 
                                 WERONIKA
                        Was that a --

                                 NICHOLAI
                        No... 

                                 GORDON
                        You all just saw a flash, right --

           Before he can finish his sentence another FLARE erupts on the 
           planet’s surface. 

           The expanding light takes a second to hit all the way up 
           here, but then -- 

           BOOOOOM!

           The entire station shakes, knocking every astronaut out of 
           place. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        What the hell is going on down 
                        there?!

                                 NICHOLAI
                        Get out of Cupola...

           Alexey glances at his brother, understanding his request 
           without need for the language.  

                                 KIRA
                        What?

           Without thinking, Alexey climbs through the hatch, pulling 
           his way toward Kira --

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (to Alexey - Russian)
                        NET!

           She turns her attention toward the commotion. With her 
           attention off Earth, she doesn’t notice when another spark 
           ignites on the blue surface of Earth behind her. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        GET OUT NOW!

           Alexey wraps his arms around Kira and pushes his legs off the 
           glass bottom of the Cupola, pushing both of them toward -- 

           Nicholai, who thrusts his arm through the hatch, grabbing 
           hold of Kira’s wrist and YANKING hard. 
           The glow behind her and Alexey, EXPANDS even faster and 
           brighter than before. 

           It moves up, and UP, AND UP, fully engulfing the Cupola’s 
           glass bottom, just as --

           Nicholai pulls Kira and Alexey fully through the hatch, 
           allowing GORDON to slam it shut behind them --

           CRASHHHH!

           Kira covers her head. 

           THE STATION SHAKES VIOLENTLY. 

           Gordon and Weronika catch Christian, as he loses his grip. 

           - The group huddles in the safety of each other.

           - The station's lights FLICKER.

           - Various stowage items FLY out of their place, thrown 
           aimlessly into the zero gravity hull of the station. 

           After a long moment, the lights steady. 

           The group struggles to right themselves.

           Beat. Then --

                                 KIRA
                             (worried)
                        ...What just happened?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ISS - NODE ONE - MOMENTS LATER

           All six members of the ISS crew gather in the quasi-kitchen. 
           Nerves are high. 

           Gordon holds the radio earpiece tightly against his ear. 

                                 GORDON
                             (into radio)
                        Houston, this is Commander Barrett. 
                        Do you read?

           No response. He turns to the eagerly awaiting group and 
           shakes his head.

           Weronika curses in Russian.
                                 WERONIKA 
                        I need to talk to my sister! I have 
                        to know she and the kids are okay.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Well in case anyone's wondering, the 
                        internet's obviously out too. Did 
                        anyone see if one of those flashes 
                        was near California? My whole 
                        family's over there. If Sacramento 
                        got hit -- 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (interrupting)
                        -- This isn't a helpful line of 
                        thinking. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        What are you, a fucking robot?! I 
                        just want to know if they're okay!

                                 GORDON
                        Listen! Nicholai is right... I know 
                        everyone has people down there we're 
                        worried about.

           Kira's eyes drift down. Maybe not everyone...

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        But until we know any better there's 
                        no sense in getting all panicked 
                        about what could or couldn't be. So 
                        let's just try to keep level heads 
                        for the time being, okay?

           The room remains silent, accepting this, uneasily.  

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Good.

           Gordon turns back to the radio. 

           WERONIKA leans over him, leaving less distance than two 
           platonic crew members would, as she listens to --

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                             (into radio)
                        Houston, this is Barrett. Can anyone 
                        read me?

           Nicholai sits on the far side of The Node, also trying to get 
           a hold of Earth. 
                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                             (to Weronika)
                        I’m not getting anything...
                             (beat)
                        If you have a minute, can you do a 
                        walkabout of the station and check 
                        for any obvious damage?

                                 WERONIKA
                        ‘Course. 

           ALEXEY -- looks over in time to see Gordon kiss Weronika's 
           hand in a gesture that's less sneaky than he seems to think 
           it is. 

           Alexey averts his eyes.

           Weronika runs a comforting hand across Gordon's back, before 
           moving away to comply with his instructions. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (Russian - into radio)
                        Can you hear me? This is Nicholai 
                        Pulov, ISS crew. Requesting 
                        information from the ground.

           NICHOLAI looks up from his monitor. His eyes narrow as he 
           takes note of Alexey's discomfort, before turning his 
           attention toward Weronika as well.

           She passes -- 

           CHRISTIAN -- who nervously fiddles with a pocket-sized 
           Rubik’s Cube. Twisting and turning its sides without even 
           looking to see if the colors are matching up. 

           Weronika takes notice. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Is this really the time for that?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Helps me relax...

           She regrets commenting. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        ...No judgments. Sorry...

           NICHOLAI -- watches the exchange. He keeps his eyes on 
           Weronika as she crosses the room, moving toward Alexey.
                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                             (Russian)
                        You okay?

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        As much as the rest of us... 
                        Anything from the States?

                                 WERONIKA
                             (Russian)
                        Not yet.
                             (beat)
                        ...You nervous? 

           Alexey shrugs -- Yes.

           Weronika leans in so no one else can hear. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                             (Whispering in Russian)
                        I have a bottle of vodka taped under 
                        the Canadarm control console. We can 
                        share it, like when we were in 
                        training... 
                             (smiles)
                        Just don’t tell Nicholai or Gordon. 

           Alexey smiles. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        Deal. 

           Weronika gives him a friendly squeeze on the shoulder and 
           then EXITS THE NODE. 

           Kira and Nicholai watch her go from their respective 
           positions. 

           A CHAT-BOX -- on the LAPTOP monitor Gordon has been hovering 
           over PINGS with the message that reads -- 

           GORDON BARRETT. REMAIN SILENT. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS 
           CLASSIFIED.

           Gordon rereads the message three times, before finally --

           He hits the mute key on the monitor, but it’s too late. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                             (to Gordon)
                        Houston respond?
           The group turns in unison, awaiting Gordon’s answer. 

                                 GORDON
                             (lying)
                        Not yet. Just a confirmation tone 
                        when I opened the app... Sorry... 

           The group turns away, disappointed. 

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NODE --

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (Russian -- into the 
                              radio)
                        Ground. This is --

           Nicholai stops short, listening for a response. BUT --

           We’re just not entirely sure if he’s getting one or not. 

           ON GORDON --

           He places his radio’s earpiece on its dock, shifting his 
           attention fully to the chat box. A new message reads --

           AN ACT OF WAR HAS OCCURRED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 
           RUSSIAN MILITARY. FURTHER COUNTRIES' INVOLVEMENT IS BEING 
           INVESTIGATED. 

           Gordon’s eyes widen. 

           ON NICHOLAI --

           We hold on his face. He’s wearing headphones, but still we 
           don’t know if anything is getting through. 

           ON GORDON --

           Gordon reads as a new message comes in, this time stating --

                       THE ISS HAS BEEN DEEMED A PRIORITY FOOTHOLD. 

                    ALL U.S. CITIZENS ABOARD ARE TO ABORT ALL ORDERS AND 
                                      EXPERIMENTS. 

                  YOUR NEW OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE FACILITY. 

           Beat. Then --

                                 BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. 

           A droplet of sweat pushes its way off Gordon’s head and into 
           the air above him. 
           After a long moment, he types out a response that simply 
           reads -- 

           ...WHY?

           Before the Americans on the ground can type anything back --

           THE STATION SHAKES VIOLENTLY ONCE AGAIN! THE LIGHTS SHUDDER, 
           promptly CUTTING the chat’s feed.  

           The group of oblivious astronauts in the middle section of 
           The Node sighs with relief as the lights flicker back on. 

           Gordon looks past them to Nicholai on the other side of The 
           Node. 

           NICHOLAI looks back. Their eyes meet only briefly, before he 
           averts his gaze. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                             (to Gordon -- oblivious)
                        Anything?

           Off Gordon, shell-shocked --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ISS - NODE ONE - LATER

           ALEXEY’S HANDS cut through a plastic snack package with a 
           small SCISSOR which is then Velcroed to the food-prep table. 
           He moves to a corner of the room where --

           Nicholai hovers, headphones on, desperately attempting to fix 
           the radio. No luck.

           The Node feels more claustrophobic than it had moments ago. 
           It’s dead silent. Suspicious eyes move around the room. 

           ACROSS THE NODE -- 

           Gordon pretends to tamper with the small TV above the food 
           prep station. 

           In truth, he’s only using the activity as a cover so he can 
           speak freely to Kira and Christian without alerting their 
           Russian neighbors. 

           The other Americans feign mundane tasks. Again, we are given 
           the impression that they have heard the news. 

           They all speak in hushed voices. 
                                 KIRA
                             (under her breath)
                        This is insane... What the hell are 
                        we supposed to do with that 
                        information? 

                                 GORDON
                        Hell if I know. That’s all they 
                        said. No why... No how... Just the 
                        orders from Uncle Sam.

                                 KIRA
                        Could the transition have been 
                        tampered with? Maybe it’s a prank or 
                        something. 

                                 GORDON
                        Those flashes from down below look 
                        like a prank to you? Something shook 
                        the hell out of the station too. Did 
                        that feel like a prank? 

                                 KIRA
                        No, but it didn't exactly feel like 
                        reality either, did it? 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        It’s unlikely anyone would have been 
                        able to breach and cut 
                        communications like that. It’s more 
                        probable that something’s either 
                        damaged or we’re dealing with the 
                        residual effects of an 
                        electromagnetic pulse. 

                                 GORDON
                        An EMP? You mean to say whatever’s 
                        going on down there is nuclear. 

           Christian shrugs -- Duh.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        The pulse from a warhead at a high 
                        enough altitude could have caused 
                        one. It's not crazy to think 
                        something like that could overload 
                        some of our electronics, but we're 
                        all still alive, so it can't have 
                        been too powerful. If that’s the 
                        case, hopefully communication will 
                        come back online in about twenty-
                        four hours.
                                 KIRA
                        If it’s just damage, how do we fix 
                        it? 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Depends...

           Something occurs to him. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        But maybe the question we should be 
                        asking ourselves is -- if we got 
                        orders from our government to take 
                        control of the ISS... How do we know 
                        the wonder-twins didn’t get the 
                        same? 

           His eyes shift toward ALEXEY AND NICHOLAI, who are now 
           currently finishing a seemingly INTENSE CONVERSATION on the 
           other side of the room. We hold on --

           NICHOLAI. We’re unsure if he heard anything from the 
           Americans. Then -- 

           Weronika enters, breaking the silence. Her face is awash with 
           concern. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        We have a problem.

           Off the worried group waiting for more --

           INT. RUSSIAN ORBITAL SEGMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The group stares at a variety of computers, both Russian and 
           American in design. Each displays the same message -- 
           "OFFLINE." 

                                 WERONIKA
                        We have no internal propulsion. 
                        Everything's dead or damaged. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        This can't be happening...  

                                 KIRA
                        The ISS hasn't used the Zvezda 
                        thrusters in years, what's so 
                        concerning about not having them 
                        now?

           Alexey drags a hand down his face. 
                                 GORDON
                        We intentionally let the station 
                        lower its altitude to shorten your 
                        trip up here. It should never have 
                        been a problem to readjust, but --

           Gordon trails off. His eyes move to a very worried Weronika -- 
           he'd rather spare her the rest of this statement, but Kira 
           finishes the thought for him.

                                 KIRA
                        -- But now we're low enough for the 
                        drag of the atmosphere to pull us 
                        down to Earth. How long do we have?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Little less than a day. 

                                 GORDON
                        We'll find a way to schedule an 
                        immediate resupply, use the 
                        additional boost to lift us again.  

                                 NICHOLAI
                        That would require talking to the 
                        ground.

                                 WERONIKA
                             (to Nicholai)
                        I don't hear you suggesting 
                        anything!  

           Nicholai looks like he might SNAP back at her, but Alexey 
           places a calming hand on his brother's shoulder.  

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                             (half to herself)
                        Great. We survived a nuclear blast 
                        only so we could fall to death. 

           Hearing this, Kira pushes her way to one of the terminals. 
           She clicks a red RECORD icon. 

                                 KIRA
                             (to the computer)
                        This is Science Officer Kira 
                        Williams, requesting immediate 
                        reboost assistance from the ground. 
                        If you receive this message in the 
                        next twenty-four hours, you can 
                        still keep us afloat.  
                             (beat)
                        We're counting on you. 
           Her message resonates through the group. 

           She clicks the icon again to stop the recording, and then 
           clicks a different icon marked SEND. 

           The screen is replaced with an empty LOADING BAR labeled 
           "PENDING." 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        Soon as a signal comes back online, 
                        someone down there'll receive that 
                        and send help. 
                             (beat)
                        ...Right?

           No one responds out loud. 

           Finally, Chistian pipes up, breaking the silence as he SETS 
           HIS WATCH TIMER, with a BEEP-BEEP.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Great, well in about twenty-three 
                        hours we'll all be in a ball of fire 
                        rocketing through the atmosphere, or 
                        we'll be right as rain... 
                             (to Alexey)
                        Any luck on the radio?

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian -- no 
                              translation)

           The Americans stare at him, blankly. 

           Beat. Nicholai pipes up “TRANSLATING.” 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        He says antenna is broken. Needs to 
                        be repaired... manually. 

           Long beat. 

           The entire group turns their attention to --

           GORDON. For the first time since we’ve met him, he doesn’t 
           look quite as macho. Shit...
           Off Gordon’s uneasy nod, we --

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           OVER BLACK UNTIL --

           A hatch is opened, causing light to flood in, illuminating --

           INT. AIRLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           TWO lifeless SPACESUITS hang, tethered to opposite walls of 
           the small room. 

           Gordon steps into view, flanked by Christian and Weronika.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIRLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Gordon is now almost fully suited up. 

           Weronika reaches for the helmet, but Gordon snatches it up 
           first. 

                                 GORDON
                        I got it.
                             (beat)
                        ...I can put it on myself.

           Weronika’s expression scrunches, confused by his reaction. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Okay...

           She lingers for a moment before moving toward the exit. Then -
           -

                                 GORDON
                        Wait --

           Weronika pauses. Gordon shoots Christian a knowing glance, 
           prompting --

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Subtle.  

           He steps outside the room, leaving them alone for a moment. 
           INT. HALLWAY - OTHER SIDE OF THE AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Christian steps into the hallway. On the far side, he catches 
           sight of --

           The Pulov brothers in intense conversation. 

           Christian presses his back against the wall, hiding his 
           presence. He watches as --

           Nicholai places a pieces of paper in his brother's hand. We 
           can't hear what they're saying, but we can tell Alexey is 
           resistant. 

           Nicholai cups his palm around the back of Alexey's neck and 
           places their foreheads together.  

           Christian watches as Alexey reluctantly accepts the paper.

           Off Christian, suspicious --

           INT. AIRLOCK - SAME

           Gordon takes Weronika's hand. 

                                 GORDON
                        I um... I guess I haven't had a 
                        chance to say this yet, but... You 
                        do know I love you, right?

           With a smile, she wraps her arms around his now oversized 
           collar and kisses him gently on the lips. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Tell me that again when you get 
                        back.

           Gordon nods. 

           Weronika exits, allowing Christian to return from the 
           hallway.  

           He fastens the helmet to the suit. 

           Once Weronika is out of view, Christian helps Gordon finish 
           suiting up. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        You good with this?

                                 GORDON
                        No... 
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        You don’t... have to go out there. 

           Gordon grabs hold of a multipurpose Drill-Tools, sitting in 
           charging docks. It looks like something you might buy at Home 
           Depot, but completely silver and JUMBO-SIZED to compensate 
           for the suit’s gloved hands. 

                                 GORDON
                        We need to assume I do. I trust 
                        Weronika, but I want you guys to 
                        keep an eye on the others, alright? 
                        You get the slightest hint 
                        something's up, you tell me. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        We will. 
                             (beat)
                        I promise. 

                                 GORDON
                        Thanks. 

           Reluctantly, Gordon pulls his visor down and turns toward the 
           airlock's outer door. 

           Christian exits, leaving him behind. We hear the inner door 
           seal behind Gordon. 

           He’s alone. 

           EXT. SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

           The outer airlock door opens. 

           In the perfect silence of space, Gordon emerges from the 
           airlock. 

           We can feel our stomachs drop as he moves off the platform, 
           now freely suspended in space. He looks downward, and --

                                 GORDON
                             (quiet)
                        If you guys can hear me in there... 
                        Try not to look out the windows...

           We trace his eye-line until finally we see it... Earth, now 
           no longer the same heavenly blue oasis we had seen earlier. 

           A handful of newly formed deserts of ash and blackness have 
           been scattered across its surface like giant cigarette burns.  
           Clouds of haze have begun to skew the planet's blue/green hue 
           toward a flat grey. It's a deeply discouraging sight.  
           After a heavy moment, Gordon pulls his attention back to the 
           task at hand. Slowly and cautiously, he HOOKS his braided 
           steel TETHER to the station with a carabiner clip designed to 
           prevent him from floating away. That makes us feel better... 
           but not a whole lot.  

           Gordon speaks into his helmet’s built-in-radio, finally 
           breaking the silence. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Tether attached. You guys reading me 
                        in there?

           Beat.

                                 KIRA (O.S.)
                        I’m here, Gordon. 

           Gordon begins making his way across the outside of the 
           station as he speaks. 

                                 GORDON
                        Williams? I sure as shit hope 
                        Christian’s with you... No offense 
                        or anything.  

                                 KIRA (O.S.)
                        He’s still making his way back from 
                        the airlock.
                             (snarky)
                        Good thing I trained for this too 
                        though, isn't it? 

           Gordon grunts, dissatisfied. 

                                 GORDON
                        Yeah? Well I haven’t... You keeping 
                        a close eye on our friends in there?

           Beat. 

                                 KIRA (O.S.)
                        ...Nicholai and Weronika aren’t far. 
                        I don’t see Alexey.  

                                 GORDON
                        I don’t like this...

           Gordon sets his focus on the CANADARM -- a large mechanical 
           appendage attached to the outside of the ISS.
                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Approaching Canadarm. Antenna 
                        shouldn’t be far on the other side 
                        of it. 

           His movement is cautious and slow. Gordon is well-trained, 
           but even that confidence can only take one so far in a 
           situation like this. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        I know you haven’t done a spacewalk 
                        yet, but I can promise you, they’re 
                        scary enough without our... 
                        situation inside... 

           Kira's demeanor softens, picking up on his stress. 

                                 KIRA (O.S.)
                        What can I do to make you feel 
                        better?

                                 GORDON
                        Just keep talking, alright? If you 
                        get the sense that something's 
                        fishy. Even the slightest bit. Give 
                        me a heads-up, and I’ll hustle my 
                        ass back to the airlock. 

                                 KIRA (O.S.)
                        I can do that. 

           INT. ISS - SAME

           Alexey pulls his way through the station. He slips through 
           the hatchway into --

           INT. ISS - NODE TWO - CONTINUOUS

           In doing so, he comes face to face with --

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        What are you doing?

           Alexey points to his temple and shakes his head. 

           Christian doesn’t respond for a moment, then --

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        Pressure migraine?

           Alexey shrugs. 
           Beat. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        Let me know if you need some 
                        Excedrin... Stuff always works the 
                        best for me...  

           With a grateful nod, Alexey moves past him. 

           Christian follows him with his eyes for a moment, until 
           Alexey slips into one of the sleep pods and seals the 
           collapsible door behind him. 

           Satisfied enough, Christian continues on his way, exiting 
           view. 

           We stay on the empty node for a long beat, until --

           The collapsible door to Alexey’s sleep pod SLIDES back 
           open... 

           INT. NODE ONE - SAME

           Kira holds herself close to the radio. Nicholai and Weronika 
           are on the far side of The Node. 

                                 GORDON (O.S.)
                        Kira?

                                 KIRA
                        Yes?

           INTERCUT - GORDON/KIRA

                                 GORDON
                        Keep talking. 

                                 KIRA
                        Um...

           She thinks. Then --

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        How long have you been seeing 
                        Weronika?

                                 GORDON
                        ...I don't know what you're talking 
                        about... 

           Gordon begins to slowly climb his way past the Canadarm. 
                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Moving past the Canadarm.

                        That's what you're gonna go with, 
                        huh?

                                 GORDON
                        That's what I'm goin' with... 

           Kira is grasping at straws here. 

                                 KIRA
                        Fair, I get it... But I will say, 
                        you've gotta know the PDA's pretty 
                        annoying for everyone around you 
                        guys, right? Pair that with the fact 
                        that relationships aren't 
                        particularly smiled upon by any 
                        space program... And then I gotta 
                        imagine intimately speaking, physics 
                        isn't exactly on your side --

                                 GORDON
                        Jesus, Williams. Did I ask you?

                                 KIRA
                        My point is, there's gotta be a good 
                        reason for doing what you're doing. 
                        Don't tell me it's just cuz she's 
                        cute. 

           Gordon thinks for a moment. Then --

                                 GORDON
                        I didn't even know her 'till I got 
                        up here five months ago. We had a 
                        karaoke night the week I docked. 
                        Believe it or not that's the kind of 
                        fun party stuff we'd probably be 
                        doing right now. 

                                 KIRA
                        Tragic. 

                                 GORDON
                        We'd met, but not really, y'know? I 
                        was all business till she got up for 
                        her turn. 

                                 KIRA
                        -- Wooed you with her singing?
                                 GORDON
                        Not even close, I thought my 
                        eardrums were gonna explode. 

                                 KIRA
                        For real?

                                 GORDON
                        Yeah, she was awful. She knows it 
                        too. 
                             (beat)
                        But she kept getting up there again  
                        and again. Just having a blast... So 
                        yeah, maybe you could say by the 
                        third at bat, yeah, she technically 
                        wooed me with her singing... 

           Kira smiles. 

           INT. NODE THREE - SAME

           Alexey sneaks his way into Node Three. 

           He flips, reorienting himself toward a panel on what was the 
           “ceiling” a moment ago.  

           A label reading “COMMS” has been scribbled across it in 
           Sharpie marker. 

           He removes one of the plates, uncovering a series of wires. 

           He sifts through them, looking for something specific.

           Alexey makes his selection, choosing a blue wire with black 
           stripes running its length. 

           Satisfied with his selection he reaches into his jumpsuit and 
           draws the SCISSORS that we’ve seen before -- swiped from the 
           food prep table.  

           He lines them up and then --

           He pauses. 

           Alexey pulls the scissors back, conflicted. 

           He begins to say a prayer in Russian and then attempts to 
           line the blades up once again. 

           Before we see if he makes the snip, we --

                                 KIRA
                        What about me?

                                 GORDON
                        Why'd you wanna be an astronaut?

                        'Thought Sandra Bullock looked good

                        Really? Because I did see your file, 
                        y'know? Looked like a hard left turn 
                        from a promising biology track, then 
                        you raced through the space program.

                                 GORDON
                        What's it matter? How about it keeps 
                        me from thinking about the fact that 
                        I'm crawling across the outside of a 
                        space station wearing a glorified

                        C'mon, Williams...

           Kira hesitates. Then --

                                 KIRA
                        ...I spent seven years or so 
                        researching organ replacement. I 
                        thought there could be an easier way 
                        to manufacture what people needed 
                        rather than die on a waitlist. Our 
                        work was promising, you’re right 
                        about that... And I was able to work  
                        with my best friend and fiancé every 
                        day during our research phase. 
                                 GORDON
                        So there is a boyfriend in the 
                        picture? 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Not a boy... 

           Gordon pauses his climb to wince. 

                                 GORDON
                        ...I’m an idiot. 

                                 KIRA
                        Yeah, maybe, but don’t worry about 
                        it. 

                                 GORDON
                        Take it this story doesn’t have a 
                        happy ending?

                                 KIRA
                        Not for me... They found each other 
                        one night while I was working 
                        late... And apparently every night 
                        after that.
                             (beat)
                        I guess they decided that they’d put 
                        too much time into our research to 
                        let it all go away if I decided to 
                        walk. 

                                 GORDON
                        What happened?

                                 KIRA
                        They published everything early, all 
                        under their names. 

           Oof...

                                 GORDON
                        ...Did you fight it?

                                 KIRA
                        Yeah. For which I was rewarded with 
                        a cease & desist and plagiarism 
                        accusations from every one of our 
                        mutual colleagues. 

                                 GORDON
                        Shit, Williams... So you’re telling 
                        me, right now they’re sitting pretty 
                        on a pile of your work?
           A melancholy smirk appears on Kira’s lips. 

                                 KIRA
                        Not exactly. They published too 
                        early. Our research only worked in 
                        theory. Every attempt at practice 
                        had failed.
                             (beat)
                        Because there was too much weight on 
                        the cells. They could never hold 
                        together properly.  

           In an instant Gordon realizes what she’s doing up here. 

                                 GORDON
                        But up here you don’t have that 
                        problem... Sneaky. 

           Kira smirks. 

           She clocks CHRISTIAN as he enters The Node. 

           INT. NODE THREE - SAME

           Alexey bites his lip hard. He holds his breath and --

           SNIP!

           INT. NODE ONE - SAME

                                 GORDON
                        Closing in on antenna. I can see it  
                        from --

           EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE --

           FEEDBACK rockets through Kira’s earpiece. She seethes as the 
           line goes dead. 

                                 KIRA
                        Gordon?! GORDON?!

           Weronika takes notice from the other side of the room. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        What happened?

           Kira ignores Weronika and turns her attention to Christian 
           instead. She doesn’t need to say anything for him to know 
           what’s happening. 

           Christian turns toward Nicholai and Weronika. 
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Where’s Alexey?

           They shrug. 

           Christian pulls his way toward The Node’s hatch, when --

           Alexey appears in the space’s entryway, cutting him off. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian - weak)
                        What’s wrong?

           Christian looks to Kira, worried. She looks back, helpless. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Keep trying the radio. 

           With that, Christian moves past Alexey, disappearing deeper 
           into the station. 

           Suddenly, Kira finds herself alone in The Node with the eyes 
           of every Russian crew member fixed on her. It’s 
           uncomfortable. 

           Trying her best to play it cool, Kira turns her back and sets 
           her attention on the radio. 

           NICHOLAI AND ALEXEY exchange a look. Weronika takes notice. 

           Nicholai exits The Node. 

           INT. ISS - NODE ONE - CONTINUOUS

           We follow Nicholai as he hastily pulls his way through the 
           station until he finally stops. 

           We match his gaze to find --

           A monitor station with a joy stick-like device labeled 
           "Canadarm Control." 

           INT. NODE THREE - SAME

           Christian enters the empty node. His eyes race around the 
           room and then set on the collection of panels that we last 
           saw with Alexey. 

           Frantically, he begins to pull their covers off, searching 
           for something. 
           EXT. ISS - SAME

           Once again we find Gordon on his spacewalk in complete 
           silence. 

           It’s a curious juxtaposition to that of the boiling tension 
           within the station. 

                                 GORDON
                        Kira?
                             (beat)
                        Kira, you read me?
                             (beat)
                        God I hope this is just a busted 
                        transmission. 
                             (switching attention)
                        Approaching radio antenna. 

           Gordon moves on his way. 

           We can see what looks like it could be the radio antenna, but 
           it’s not close enough for us to get a good look at yet.  

           He moves closer. The antenna begins to become clearer to us, 
           and Gordon alike, then --

           CLICK. 

           Gordon is stopped in place. He pushes again to no avail.

           Confused he checks his tether, to discover --

           It’s completely taut. He’s reached its full extension. 

           Gordon looks from the overstretched cable to the antenna. It 
           seems just out of reach. 

           Tough decision. Then --

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Kira, if you can hear me... Now 
                        would be the time for some words of 
                        encouragement...

           With that... Gordon unbuckles his tether. 

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Gordon? Gordon, do you read me? 
           She flips switches and thumbs buttons, determined to 
           reconnect the line. 

           Weronika watches her from across The Node. 

           We see the shape of her body raise up and slowly begin to 
           approach Kira. It’s a discomforting sight in context. 

           INT. NODE ONE - SAME

           Nicholai boots the computer system, and wraps his fingers 
           around the joystick. 

           INT. NODE THREE - SAME

           Christian searches the same heap of wires that Alexey had 
           been working through moments ago. 

           He spots something. Pushes excess wires out of the way and 
           finally lays eyes on --

           The black and blue wire, but --

           IT’S NOT SNIPPED. It’s perfectly intact. Weird...

           He exhales, his expression is a cocktail of relief and 
           confusion. 

           INT. NODE TWO - SAME

           Kira continues to fiddle with the radio. She’s completely 
           UNAWARE that Weronika is only a few feet away from her now!

           Finally noticing her --

           Defensively, Kira wheels around to face her. And --

           Weronika extends her radio headset from the Russian comms 
           system. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Try ours...

           Kira looks at it, realizing that she’s trying to help. 

           Off the headset --
           EXT. ISS - SAME

           With extreme caution, Gordon claws his way toward the radio 
           antenna. 

                                 GORDON
                        I don’t know if you can still hear 
                        me Kira, but I’m coming up on the 
                        antenna now. It looks --

           He reaches the antenna. Lifts the sun visor on his helmet for 
           a closer look. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        It looks completely fine...

           We hold on Gordon’s face as perplexity turns to fear. He just 
           realized what’s happening.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        THE ANTENNA’S FINE! KIRA --

           FINALLY --

           Kira’s voice CRACKLES though his radio --

                                 KIRA
                        Gordon!

                                 GORDON
                        Kira?! What channel is this?

           Gordon turns back toward the way he came, just as --

           WHAMMM!

           We see the CANADARM’s blazing incoming in the reflective 
           visor of Gordon’s suit before the mechanical appendage comes 
           BARRELING TOWARD HIM, COLLIDING DIRECTLY INTO GORDON AND -- 

           GORDON IS KNOCKED OFF THE ISS ENTIRELY!

           His limp body is sent spiraling into the darkness of space 
           around the station! 

           INT. NODE TWO - SAME

                                 KIRA
                        Gordon?! GORDON, DO YOU READ ME?!

                                 WERONIKA
                             (worried)
                        Let me try!
           Without thinking, Kira gives up the headset. 

           EXT. ISS - SAME

           We see Gordon’s unattached tether floating aimlessly in 
           space. 

           BEYOND IT -- we see the small white shape that is Gordon’s 
           body as it drifts seemingly further off the ISS.

           We CLOSE ON -- Gordon’s visor-veiled face. He’s unconscious, 
           and unable to respond. 

           We hear Weronika’s muffled voice still fighting to make its 
           way through the radio -- 

                                 WERONIKA (O.S.)
                             (over radio)
                        Gordon! Can you hear me?! I need you 
                        to respond. 

           Gordon does not. He continues to drift. 

                                 WERONIKA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                             (less clear this time)
                        Please, Gordon! Say something! 

           No response. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                             (barely audible)
                        ...Please...

           Gordon continues on his course. Which, in turn, is another 
           way of saying toward his death. 

           In a sense we’re watching him drown... And it’s a horrible 
           experience.  

           INT. NODE TWO - SAME

           Weronika looks helpless. She stares at the silent radio 
           unable to process what just happened.

                                 KIRA
                        Weronika...

           Kira doesn’t know how to finish that sentence.

           CHRISTIAN reenters the room, immediately making eye contact 
           with a distraught Kira. 
           Their look says volumes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIRLOCK - SAME

           Weronika stands in the still OPEN airlock, now sporting the 
           second spacesuit and a tether of her own. 

           Kira and Christian watch intently from the room's inner 
           window, as Weronika desperately reels Gordon's tether back 
           toward the station, until finally --

           She lays eyes on the empty carabiner at the other side, 
           confirming for her own eyes that it's no longer clipped to 
           Gordon. 

           Off Weronika, her heart breaking --

           INT. NODE TWO - LIVING QUARTERS - LATER

           Kira enters her dark closet of a sleeping pod. She slides the 
           collapsing door closed and doesn’t bother turning on the 
           small lamp. 

           She grabs the CD Walkman from its Velcroed position on the 
           wall and pops the ear-pods in. 

           With music playing, she presses her head into the wall, 
           frustrated. 

           For a moment we feel she might cry. Then --

           Knock, knock!

           Kira is jostled back to reality. She remains quiet until --

                                 CHRISTIAN (O.S.)
                             (through the door)
                        Kira... I think we should talk. 

           Kira slides the door open, waiting for him to respond. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        ...In private. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Are you kidding me?

           He’s not. 
           Reluctantly, she makes herself as small as she can in the 
           already undersized space, allowing him to slide in. 

           Christian closes the collapsing door behind him, effectively 
           sealing himself in a coffin-sized living quarters with Kira. 

           Off her, tired and not loving this --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RUSSIAN ORBITAL SEGMENT - SAME

           The Pulov brothers are in the middle of a heated argument. 

           Alexey throws the now-crumpled piece of paper back at his 
           brother. 

           They continue to bark at each other in Russian, only to 
           simultaneously fall silent when --  

           Weronika makes her presence known by snatching the piece of 
           paper out of the air between them --

           She upwards it revealing a depiction printed wire schematics 
           ripped, annotated in red marker. 

           Weronika lets her eyes run over the page before speaking up, 
           also in her native tongue.  

                                 WERONIKA
                             (upset)
                        ...What. Happened...?

           They don’t respond. 

           She looks to Alexey. He’s a mess. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        ...Alexey?

                                 ALEXEY
                        I...I didn’t know. Nicholai promised 
                        me --

           Nicholai interrupts, answering for him. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (to Weronika)
                        You wouldn’t have wanted to know. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        What does that mean?!
           Nicholai takes his time answering, before --

                                 NICHOLAI
                        ...Before the radios failed, we 
                        received orders from the ground. 
                        There’s a war brewing between us and 
                        the Americans... We have been told 
                        to take the ISS... at all costs.

           Weronika’s mind reels, processing. 

           Alexey reaches into his pocket, retrieving something. 

           He opens his palm, allowing the two severed sides of the 
           black and blue wire to float into the air between them. 

           Weronika doesn’t need to ask what she’s looking at. She 
           already knows. 

           Tears pool in Alexey’s eyes. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        I replaced it with a dummy... No one 
                        will ever know it was tampered with. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        You didn’t...

                                 ALEXEY
                        Weronika, I didn’t know what 
                        Nicholai was going to do. It was 
                        only supposed to be a precaution!
                             (to Nicholai)
                        Tell her what you told me. The blue 
                        and white wire was just supposed to 
                        be the Americans earthbound comms. 
                        Tell her!

           Nicholai remains silent. 

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                             (to Weronika)
                        You’re my friend... You can’t have 
                        thought I would --

           He trails off, weakly. Then --

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                         ...I’m so sorry...

           She looks at Alexey, in disbelief -- then back to Nicholai. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        I DON’T WANT YOUR “SORRY?!” 
           Nicholai moves closer, towering over Weronika. He speaks, 
           keeping his tone calm. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        The apology is genuine, Weronika... 
                        But as far as anyone’s concerned, 
                        wires die all the time. This was 
                        just an unfortunate accident. No one 
                        signs up for this work without 
                        knowing the risk. 

                                 WERONIKA 
                        THEY SIGN UP ASSUMING THEIR OWN CREW 
                        ISN’T GOING TO TURN ON THEM!

                                 NICHOLAI
                        Maybe they shouldn’t. The ISS is 
                        made up, half and half, by two 
                        countries who have competed over the 
                        stars since the space race. 

                                 WERONIKA
                             (horrified)
                        You’re a monster... 

           Nicholai looks to his brother, curious to see how he's 
           reacting to that statement. Alexey avoids eye contact. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        I’m sorry you don’t want to hear 
                        that right now, but it's the truth. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        No, I don't. I want to know what 
                        we're going to do about it. 

           Alexey and Nicholai look at her, unsure where she's going 
           with this.

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        He isn't dead. If his suit held up, 
                        then his life support should keep 
                        him alive until it fails... If we 
                        don't move quickly he's going to be 
                        drowning out there for the next 
                        eight hours!

           They look at her, but remain silent. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        We need to try! I'm telling the 
                        Americans. If you won't help me, 
                        they will!
                                 ALEXEY
                        Weronika...

                                 WERONIKA
                        We don't have time!

                                 NICHOLAI
                        He's gone! 

                                 WERONIKA
                        No --

                                 NICHOLAI
                        There was no one on the tether, was 
                        there? He must have undone that 
                        himself. We don't have eyes on him 
                        anymore either... It's over. 

           Still hopeful, Weronika looks to Alexey. He responds, 
           reluctantly. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        ...Even if we knew where to start, 
                        with the propulsion from the Manual 
                        Maneuvering Units, he would be too 
                        far now. We won't be able to reach 
                        him and get back... I'm sorry...

           The horror of Gordon’s fate is not lost on the two men. And 
           yet --

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (to Alexey)
                        -- You did what you did for your 
                        country. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        There are two more Americans on 
                        board, you son of a bitch! Do you 
                        intend to murder them too?!

           Beat. Neither man answers. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        What is the value of this mission if 
                        we all tear each other apart for it? 
                        No one deserves what you did to 
                        Gordon... None of us. 

           Nicholai moves to comfort her, but Weronika pushes past him, 
           exiting the room. 

           Off Alexey and Nicholai, watching her go --
           INT. ROOM OUTSIDE THE RUSSIAN ORBITAL SEGMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Weronika leaves her fellow Russians behind, she pulls her way 
           through the station until she is far enough away to feel 
           alone. 

           She stops, breathing heavily. She would let herself drop to 
           the floor if the weightlessness would allow her to. Instead --

           Weronika pulls her legs into her chest, allowing herself to 
           float in the fetal position at the center of the room.

           We watch her back shudder.

           She lets herself begin to cry, but only for a moment. Then --

           Her body rotates toward us, allowing us to see her face. 

           Her expression falls slack. Her eyes seem to have glassed 
           over, suggesting her mind has wandered somewhere far away. 

           INT. RUSSIAN ORBITAL SEGMENT - SAME

           Nicholai and Alexey sit in contemplative silence, until --

                                 NICHOLAI
                        I know you care for her. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        ...Stop Nicholai. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        I see how you look at her --

                                 ALEXEY
                        STOP!

           Nicholai waits a beat. Then --

                                 NICHOLAI
                        I know this is hard for you too, but 
                        it was necessary.   

           He moves out of view, leaving his brother behind. 

           Off Alexey, considering --

                                                                CUT TO:

                        What are you saying exactly?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I don’t know. We just need to talk 
                        about it. We know what Gordon was 
                        told, right? Which means we have to 
                        assume that the Russians got the 
                        same orders as us.  

                                 KIRA
                        Do we?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        What? Yes! Gordon is fucking gone. 
                        Did you notice that?!

                                 KIRA
                             (defensive)
                        I noticed. 
                             (half to herself)
                        It's just been quite a first day up 
                        here... 

           Christian collects himself. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I’m sorry. I don’t mean to put you 
                        on the spot or anything, but I think 
                        we can agree that we're playing a 
                        man down now, right? That means we 
                        need to trust each other. I’m all 
                        you have. You’re all I have. And I 
                        wanna fucking live through this. 

           Kira sighs.

                                 KIRA
                        What if what happened to Gordon was 
                        an actual accident?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Are you kidding me? C’mon, Williams -
                        - you trained to be up here too. You 
                        know what kind of safety protocols 
                        are in place, don’t you?
                                 KIRA
                        I know those safety protocols exist 
                        because being up here is just about 
                        the most dangerous place humanity 
                        has ever had the batshit crazy idea 
                        of putting people.

           Christian looks at her, completely at a loss. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                             (switching tones)
                        I’m not saying it WAS an accident. I 
                        know what this looks like... But I 
                        also know how fucked up and 
                        misguided people can be when they’re 
                        pushed to believe something that’s 
                        not necessarily true... That’s not 
                        just “Team Russia” out there -- 
                        they’re fellow astronauts, who 
                        you’ve lived and worked with for 
                        months now. I don’t know them, but 
                        you do... Are they people who would 
                        have murdered Gordon like that?

           Christian thinks. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        ...I don’t know... 
                             (beat)
                        But I know we don't have the time  
                        to assume they aren't.

                                 KIRA
                        ...If, and I mean IF the Russians 
                        got the same orders as us. And IF 
                        they were able to mobilize a plan 
                        fast enough to kill one of us...
                             (beat)
                        What are you suggesting we do now? 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                             (unsure)
                        ...For starters, I vote we don’t 
                        believe a single thing they say...

           Just then -- we HEAR MOVEMENT outside the sleep pod. 

           Christian and Kira fall silent, listening. 

           They angle their eyes through the thin gaps in the 
           collapsible door to see --

           WERONIKA as she makes her way through The Node, pausing only 
           to wipe a tear from her eye. 
           Kira and Christian exchange a look, unsure what to do. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                             (under his breath)
                        She knows something... 

           OUTSIDE the sleep pod, Weronika disappears from view. 

           Christian looks to Kira, then --

           WOOOSH! The collapsing door of Kira’s sleep pod is yanked 
           open by --

           Weronika. She stares in at Christian and Kira who are 
           awkwardly huddled into the tight space. 

           The group regards each other blankly for a moment. Then --

                                 WERONIKA
                             (to Kira)
                        I need to talk to you.

           Kira looks to Christian -- he’s hesitant. She dismisses him 
           with a nod, prompting --

           Christian reluctantly exits The Node, allowing the two women 
           a moment together. 

           Kira moves out of her sleep pod so they can talk. It’s clear 
           Weronika has been crying, and Kira takes notice. 

                                 KIRA
                        I’m sorry about Gordon...

           Weronika nods, but doesn’t say anything. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        Is there something I can do for you?

                                 WERONIKA
                        I need your help. And I need you to 
                        keep it a secret. 

           Kira considers. This is a dangerous game. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Why me? 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Because you’re new. I know I can’t 
                        trust anyone else now. But I don’t 
                        know for sure that I can’t trust you 
                        yet. So you’re all I have.  
                                 KIRA
                        You see my hesitation. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        I do. And maybe in a few hours we'll 
                        be safe & sound or maybe we'll be 
                        falling out of the sky... But we 
                        have work to do before either of 
                        those things happens, and we don’t 
                        have time for your "hesitation."

           Weronika leans closer, inspecting Kira for any sort of tell. 
           Kira doesn't crack.  

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        I could use your help, but I can’t 
                        do that if I don’t trust you. So can  
                        you please start talking?

                                 KIRA
                        What do you need? 

           Weronika takes a beat to assess the situation before 
           answering anyway --

                                 WERONIKA
                        Your key... In exchange, I’ll give 
                        you mine. 

                                 KIRA
                        I don’t want yours... What do you 
                        need my key for?

                                 WERONIKA
                        I want to open an American lock box. 

                                 KIRA
                             (hesitant)
                        Which one? 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Does it matter?

                                 KIRA
                        Depends.

           Weronika waits for more. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                             (lying)
                        I don’t have it anymore. I haven’t 
                        seen it since we first saw the 
                        flashes. Must have lost it when we 
                        got shaken up. 
           Weronika isn’t falling for it. And as such --

                                 WERONIKA
                        Did the Americans give you orders to 
                        kill us?

           Kira is caught off guard. 

                                 KIRA
                        Excuse me? 

                                 WERONIKA
                        What did they ask to do? 

                                 KIRA
                             (lying)
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. 

           Frustrated, Weronika shows her hand. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        You know you’re not the only 
                        bioengineer on board...  

                                 KIRA
                        Alexey. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Do you know what he’s working with? 

           Kira remains silent. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        A virus's mutation from marsupial to 
                        human.  
                             (beat)
                        The ISS is for science and 
                        experimentation. Not warfare... But 
                        I’ve seen his notes. He thinks he's 
                        working to prevent something, but 
                        you can't cure a sickness without 
                        making sure it exists first. 

                                 KIRA
                        Stop. Even for a potential vaccine, 
                        no government would let anyone come 
                        up here just to make a super virus. 
                        There's no need for it to be in zero-
                        gravity and they'd be endangering 
                        their own astronauts. 

           Weronika cocks an eyebrow. 
                                 WERONIKA
                        If you wanted to build a super virus  
                        and avoid casualties... Where's the 
                        safest place you could possibly do 
                        it?

           Kira's blood runs cold.   

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        Intentionally or not, he’s the 
                        reason we’re all in this position. 
                        If there is a war coming on the 
                        ground, there’s nothing else on this 
                        station that might sway its 
                        direction other than his work... And 
                        so I need your help getting rid of 
                        it. 

           Kira stares at her, understanding the severity of what she’s 
           saying.

           Beat. Then --

                                 KIRA
                             (lying)
                        They didn’t tell us anything. Gordon 
                        never got through.

           Weronika looks at her for a moment. Then --

                                 WERONIKA
                        You’re sure? 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Yes. 

                                 WERONIKA
                             (frustrated)
                        Fine. 

           With that, she shoves her way past Kira, making her way 
           toward the exit. 

           Kira watches Weronika leave in a huff, when something makes 
           her pipe up. 

                                 KIRA
                        They told us to take the ISS...
                             (beat)
                        By any means necessary... 

           Weronika pauses and turns back to face her. 
                                 WERONIKA
                        Why...?

                                 KIRA
                        We don’t know. The transmission cut 
                        early.  

                                 WERONIKA
                             (Russian)
                        Figures. 
                             (English)
                        We received the same orders.

                                 KIRA
                        ...Then you’re saying Gordon --

                                 WERONIKA
                        -- Yes... I never thought Nicholai 
                        and Alexey were capable of doing 
                        something so severe... But now we 
                        both know different. That means they 
                        can do worse too.

                                 KIRA
                        ...If what you’re saying is true 
                        then I want to help you. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        I thought you might say that --

                                 KIRA
                        -- But what if it’s not? Alexey is a 
                        close friend of yours, isn’t he?

                                 WERONIKA
                        ...Yes... And if I’m lying, more of 
                        us may get hurt. Just like Gordon 
                        did. 
                             (beat)
                        But if I’m not, then there could be 
                        death on a scale that can win a war. 
                        So what do you want to do? 

           Kira considers, torn. 

           Beat. Then --

           She raises her key for Weronika to take. They exchange, 
           leaving Kira with its Russian counterpart. 

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        I will create a distraction. You go 
                        to your lab, that's why I need your 
                        key. Use mine on Alexey’s lockbox. 
                                 (MORE)

                        The labels are in Russian, but the 
                        samples you’re looking for have red 
                        labels. Take them to the airlock in 
                        NODE ZERO and get rid of them. Do 
                        you understand?   

                                 KIRA
                        Yes. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Repeat it. 

                                 KIRA
                        Red labels. Node Zero. 

           The women stare at each other for a moment. Then, with a nod, 
           Weronika moves on her way. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        Good luck. 

           INT. ISS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Weronika moves quietly through the ISS, unaware that --

           NICHOLAI catches sight of her. He follows her to --

           INT. NODE THREE - SAME

           Weronika approaches the glovebox that Christian had been 
           working through when we first met him. 

           She slides Kira's key into its allotted slot and turns. 

           With a POP -- the Plexiglas surface opens, allowing Weronika  
           to reach into the box and retrieve --

           The handheld blowtorch. 

           She stares at it in her hands, marveling over it. She’s not 
           looking at this thing the way a mentally/emotionally stable 
           person looks at a random object. 

           After a moment she moves along, disappearing through a nearby 
           hatch. 

           We follow her down to --
           INT. STOWAGE AREA - SAME

           Weronika claws her way toward a panel complete with several 
           dials. We can read the words GAS LINE 1 and GAS LINE 2 on the 
           top of it. 

           This is one of the ISS’s pure oxygen valve systems. 

           She un-Velcroes a large wrench from a tool wall nearby. 

           Letting the blowtorch float in the air around her for a 
           moment, she uses the wrench to go to work on the panel, 
           opening the valves with a TSHHHHHHHHH!

           Just then --

           Nicholai makes himself known. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        What are you doing?

           She looks up to find him standing in the hatchway. 

           We get a good look at Weronika. She’s a mess of tears and 
           anguish.

                                 WERONIKA
                        ...Don’t you get it? We’re supposed 
                        to be scientists. We’re not dogs! 
                        But if it’s this easy to forget 
                        that, what’s the difference? 

           She grabs the blowtorch from the air above her. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        That’s pure oxygen in those vents, 
                        Weronika. If you light that you’ll 
                        torch the whole station. 

           Weronika doesn’t respond. She’s already aware. 

                                 NICHOLAI (CONT'D)
                             (calling out)
                        ALEXEY! GET IN HERE!

           Thinking quickly --

                                 NICHOLAI (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry for what you’re going 
                        through, Weronika. I am. But we can 
                        still talk about this, can’t we?

           Weronika slowly shakes her head. Her mind seems made up. Just 
           then --
           Alexey appears behind Nicholai. Immediately, he understands 
           what’s at risk of happening. 

           Weronika looks wounded by his presence.

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        Weronika... You don’t want to do 
                        this. 

                                 WERONIKA
                        YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT I WANT! GORDON 
                        KNEW ME AND NOW -- 

           Nicholai makes a HASTY MOTION toward her, but --

           WERONIKA SWINGS THE WRENCH AT HIM!

                                 WERONIKA (CONT'D)
                        STAY AWAY FROM ME!

           He backs off. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (Russian)
                        YOU’RE GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED! 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        NICHOLAI, SHUT UP!

           Nicholai looks at him, surprised. Just as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NODE ONE - SAME

           Kira’s eyes run wild, scanning the lab she shares with 
           Alexey. Until --

           She takes notice of a lockbox built into the wall of the work 
           area. The bold Russian letters printed across its surface are 
           enough for us to guess whose this is. 

           She slides Weronika’s key into the latch -- it fits 
           perfectly. She turns it, and --

           Pop. 

           The small door opens, displaying several marked vials -- 
           three of which have red labels. 

           Carefully, she picks them out, when --
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Those are dangerous...

           Startled, Kira wheels around to find Christian staring at 
           her. 

                                 KIRA
                        Christian, good! I don’t have time 
                        to explain everything, but I could 
                        use your help. 

           Christian looks puzzled. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Okay...

                                 KIRA
                        I need to get this to the airlock in 
                        Node Zero as soon as possible. Can 
                        you help me?

           Christian scoffs. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I mean, I would...

                                 KIRA
                        But?!

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        But there is no Node Zero. 

           Something breaks in Kira’s heart because if there’s no Node  
           Zero then that means -- 

                                 KIRA
                        ...She lied. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Who did?

                                 KIRA
                        WERONIKA PLAYED ME! WE NEED TO FIND 
                        HER, NOW!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STOWAGE AREA - SAME

           Weronika moves to light the torch, Nicholai tightens in fear, 
           but --
                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        Wait!

           Weronika pauses. 

           Alexey moves cautiously toward her. Weronika doesn’t stop 
           him. 

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                             (Russian)
                        I know you don’t want to hear this 
                        from me, but just please... listen 
                        for a minute.  

                                 WERONIKA
                             (Russian)
                        Why should I?!

           Alexey thinks, then --

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        Because... “The important thing is 
                        that we stick together?”

           Weronika’s face softens. She lets him talk. 

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                             (Russian)
                        Talk to me about your older sister. 
                        When you’re home you always watch 
                        her kids on weeknights while she 
                        works, right? 

           Weronika nods slowly.  

                                 WERONIKA
                        ...Maxim and Elena. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        That’s right... They look at you 
                        like a second mom, right? They used 
                        to call you every night when we were 
                        in training. Elena still sleeps with 
                        the stuffed giraffe you bought her 
                        from the zoo. That’s one of the 
                        first things you ever told me about. 
                        I know they’re important to you. 

           Off Weronika --

                                                                CUT TO:

           Christian and Kira race through the ISS, as fast as they 
           possibly can. 

           INT. STOWAGE AREA - SAME

           Alexey continues his efforts to calm Weronika.

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        I’m sorry to make you think about 
                        this, but if you light the torch, 
                        you know they wont take that news 
                        well. 

           Alexey moves closer, but --

           Weronika raises the wrench in a defensive manner. 

                                 WERONIKA
                             (Russian)
                        I am doing this for them! Don’t come 
                        closer, Alexey!

           Alexey inches along the wall -- keeping his distance, but 
           moving around her. 

           Her eyes follow him around the room, flashing back to 
           Nicholai every so often. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        Weronika. I understand if I ended 
                        our friendship today. And I really 
                        can’t really blame you if you want 
                        to light that torch because of me 
                        either... But... I don’t believe you 
                        want to hurt anyone. And you’re not 
                        avoiding what’s happening on the 
                        ground by killing us all... We can’t 
                        control that, but we do have control 
                        of what happens up here. We can 
                        still resolve things peacefully. 
                             (beat)
                        Let’s go back to Node One. I’ll make 
                        some tea. We can figure this out 
                        together. Don’t you think that’s 
                        what Gordon would want us to do?

           Weronika considers. She nods through her tears. 
                                 WERONIKA
                        You were always a good friend 
                        Alexey...  
                             (beat)
                        ...But I don’t believe any of that 
                        that. 

           SHE MOVES TO LIGHT THE TORCH!

           Taking his shot, ALEXEY RUSHES HER, but --

           Weronika SWINGS THE WRENCH, CRACKING IT DOWN AT HIM --

           Alexey catches the makeshift weapon on his forearm. 

           He screams, recoiling in pain. Nicholai rushes to his 
           brother's aid. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (worried)
                        ALEXEY!

           Weronika’s face softens when she sees he’s hurt. 

           Her mind seems to clear --

                                 WERONIKA
                             (Russian)
                        Alexey?! I’m so sorry --

           WHACK! 

           OUT OF NOWHERE -- something heavy comes smashing down on the 
           back of Weronika’s skull! 

           Her eyes remain open, but consciousness seems to fade from 
           them. 

           Alexey maintains horrified eye contact with her for a long 
           beat, even as --

           A formless red shape of weightless blood emerges from the 
           back of her head. 

           Nicholai’s jaw drops. Kira covers her mouth in horror. 
           Alexey’s disbelieving eyes shift toward -- 

           CHRISTIAN, who stands behind the now very unconscious 
           Weronika. He still holds the bloodstained metal storage box 
           in hand. 
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I saw the torch. And the gas... She -
                        - she was gonna blow up the 
                        station... We could have died. You 
                        all saw that.

           Kira ignores him, moving to act. 

                                 KIRA
                        One of you give me your shirts, she 
                        needs a compress on the back of her 
                        head!

           Nicholai shoves Kira out of the way. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        Stay away from her!

           Alexey removes his shirt, wrapping it around Weronika’s head.

           The cloth is almost completely soaked within seconds of it 
           touching the back of her head.  

                                 KIRA
                        I -- we can help. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        STAY AWAY FROM HER!

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        It... was -- I didn’t mean to hurt 
                        her like that. 

           Nicholai looks toward Christian, fire burning in his eyes. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (venomous)
                        GET OUT!

           Christian backs up, scared. 

           He moves toward the hatch door, grabbing hold of Kira’s 
           jumpsuit on the way. 

           Kira struggles to take her eyes off Weronika. 

           ALEXEY -- has taken to gently clapping his hand against her 
           cheek in an effort to wake her.

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian -- under his 
                              breath)

                        Weronika! You need to stay awake for 
                        me!

           CHRISTIAN -- pulls Kira’s attention toward him.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        We need to get out of here! 

           Through a daze, Kira reluctantly nods.  

           INT. ISS - MOMENTS LATER

           Christian leads Kira through the ISS with extreme urgency. 

                                 KIRA
                        Where are you taking me?

           INTERCUT -- Nicholai holds his shirt against the back of 
           Weronika's head, while Alexey opens her eyelids and shines a 
           light inside. They exchange a worried look.

                        What are you talking about? We can

                        -- She’s going to die!

           They pause.

                        she lied to you.

                        If she wasn’t trying to destroy the

                        wanted your key so badly? That is 
                        what she asked for isn’t it?

           INTERCUT - Nicholai and Alexey gently wrap a brace around her 
           neck and rush to a flat surface where they can strap her in 
           place.

                                 KIRA
                        I though she was creating a

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        It doesn’t matter now. If she’s not 
                        dead already, her brain is 
                        hemorrhaging. Even if we had the 
                        training to save her, we don't have 
                        the time.

                        We should try to keep us alive, 
                        shouldn’t we? 

           INTERCUT -- Alexey holds Weronika's eyelid open and flashes a 
           small light back and forth through field of vision.

                        obviously teams here. It’s us versus

                        please listen to me? 

           Kira is unsure, but --

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        I know the station. Let’s go. 

           He moves on his way. Kira follows, reluctantly. 

           INT. STOWAGE AREA A - SAME

           WERONIKA’S HAND is wrapped tightly around Alexey’s.

           He cradles her. 

           Nearby, Nicholai empties water from a drinking pouch and 
           attempts to wet a rag -- a task that’s easier said than done 
           up here. 

           He holds it out for Nicholai to take --

           A sticky SQUELCH emits as Alexey removes his hand from the 
           back of Weronika’s head. 

           They both hear the sound. Neither calls attention to it.  

           Alexey’s hand is stained dark red. 

           They speak in Russian. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        Wait...

           Nicholai pauses. 

           Weronika’s fingers go limp, slipping away from Alexey’s.

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                        No...

           He jerks her body.

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                        Weronika!

           Shakes her again. 
                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                        WERONIKA!

           Alexey’s eyes begin to water. 

           He holds her wrists, feeling for a pulse. 

           Beat. 

           We can tell he doesn’t feel one, even before he looks up. 

           Nicholai’s tough exterior fails for the first time since 
           we’ve known him. He attempts to place a comforting hand on 
           his brother's shoulder, but --

           Alexey continues to stare down at Weronika, but there’s not 
           much to look at anymore. She’s gone. 

           Weronika dies.

           Long silent beat, then --

                                 NICHOLAI
                        I’m finishing this. 

           Alexey lets go of Weronika. He stands. Sort of.  

                                 ALEXEY
                        What does that mean?

                                 NICHOLAI
                        You know what it means. 

           Nicholai moves to the wall of Velcroed tools and selects an 
           oversized SCREWDRIVER. 

           He stares at the makeshift weapon for a long beat before 
           moving toward the hatch. But --

           Alexey steps in his way. 

                                 NICHOLAI (CONT'D)
                        Move. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        You’re not a murderer. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        I am a man of my country. Are you 
                        coming with me or not? 
                                 ALEXEY
                        Don’t be an idiot. I've always 
                        listened to you. Look what that got 
                        me! 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        What I got you? Look what you got 
                        me! You're the reason we're in this 
                        situation. Your work. 

           Alexey seems stung. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        I'm trying to save lives. 

           Nicholai scoffs. 

           Nicholai GRABS Alexey, wrapping his massive fist around the 
           bloodstained collar of his brother's jumpsuit!

                                 NICHOLAI
                        You're not up here to make a 
                        vaccine! That's just a byproduct of 
                        the weapon. That's what Russia 
                        wants. That's what the Americans 
                        want. Everyone seems to understand 
                        that, except for you.
                             (beat)
                        These people killed our friend. 

                                 ALEXEY
                        Did they? Who killed her exactly, 
                        Nicholai? Was it Christian when he 
                        hit her thinking she was going to 
                        blow us all up...? Or did a faceless 
                        person in Houston kill her...?

           Alexey drops his voice, stating this next part as coldly as 
           he possibly can --

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                        Or did the person who took her will 
                        to live?

           For a moment Nicholai looks both hurt and stunned, but the 
           moment doesn’t last long. Anger takes over his expression. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        You're not my brother. 

           With that he lets go of his colleague's throat. 
                                 NICHOLAI (CONT'D)
                        But you’re Russian. So, nah zda-rovh-
                        yeh to that, comrade. 

           With that, Nicholai moves past Alexey. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (calling after him)
                        Nicholai!

           Nicholai continues on his way without looking back. 

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                        NICHOLAI!

           No response. 

           Alexey curses in Russian. 

           He’s left alone. He turns back toward Weronika’s lifeless 
           body. 

           Her vacant eyes stare up at him. 

           He cranes down, cradling her again. After a moment, Alexey 
           removes his Mets cap and places it over her head, covering 
           her eyes. 

           He looks away, pained.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK CUTS:

           - Nicholai moves through the ISS like a hunter stalking prize 
           game. 

           - He passes through Node One, where there are still the 
           remnants of food and utensils from earlier Velcroed in place. 

           - Node Two, where the sleeping quarters loom empty. 

           - And Node Three, where only a matter of hours ago his 
           primary focus was maintaining a healthy exercise regiment. 

           INT. STOWAGE AREA A - MOMENTS LATER

           Alexey wipes tears from his eyes. 

           He looks worse than we’ve ever seen him. 

           After a long beat, he lifts his body, pulling aimlessly away 
           from Weronika. 
           INT. NODE ONE - MOMENTS LATER

           From our perspective, Alexey hangs suspended upside down, 
           he’s searching for something tucked deep under a monitor 
           system. 

           After a moment, he finds his target -- the vodka bottle 
           Weronika had mentioned, duct-taped behind a computer system. 

           He fastens a “space-straw” to the bottle then reorients 
           himself so that he’s upright from where we’re looking. 

           He’s about to take a sip, when something catches his eye --

           Alexey drops the vodka bottle, letting it float away behind 
           him. 

           He moves with new intent toward the monitor system. 

           His eyes widen. 

           Finally we match Alexey’s gaze to find -- 

           The Canadarm control system -- last seen operated by 
           Nicholai. 

           The sight looks seemingly insignificant. Until --

           Alexey SLAMS his body against the console. It’s evident that 
           he sees something that we don’t yet. Not until --

           He zooms the camera toward one of the ISS’s many solar 
           arrays. 

           Still we don’t see anything. But -- 

           The camera continues to zoom, until the image blurs. 

           We can barely make out what we’re looking at. 

           Alexey squints, craning his eyes against the screen. Then --

           A blurry white dot peeks out from behind the solar array. 

           It’s hard to say for sure, but if we didn’t know any better 
           we might bet that’s a tiny white dot that looks a lot like -- 

           GORDON!

           Alexey laughs. Nervously at first. Then with excitement! And 
           then with heartbreak, remembering why Weronika is no longer 
           with them...
           He takes a beat to collect himself. Considers his options. 
           Then --

           Alexey wraps his fingers around the joystick. 

           EXT. ISS - SAME

           Silence once again. 

           The station looks unbelievable still. 

           From out here, it’s hard to comprehend the chaos that is 
           ensuing inside it. 

           We move along the station's massive hull, and up one solar 
           array wing, where we finally see --

           Gordon, very much alive! 

           His body is clinging to the side of one of the panels. He 
           looks insignificantly small in comparison to the gigantic 
           vessel.

           Even now, knowing he’s alive, our hope for him is not 
           promising. Not until --

           The CANADARM BEGINS TO MOVE once again! This time not as a 
           weapon, but rather as a life preserver. 

           It reaches toward him, becoming a much-needed bridge for the 
           lost astronaut. 

           We can’t hear Gordon, but his body language tells us he’s 
           aware of what’s happening. 

           Wearily, he repositions himself. 

           The arm continues to extend itself until it’s stretched at 
           full length, but --

           The arm is still several meters from Gordon’s position, 
           unable to reach all the way. 

           Gordon pulls himself up, balancing carefully on the solar 
           array. Then --

           HE JUMPS!

           Before we see if he makes it from the solar array to the 
           Canadarm, we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. PERMANENT MULTIPURPOSE MODULE - SAME

           We find ourselves looking at an empty room. 

           Dozens of mismatched/mis-sized bags of garbage and storage 
           sit net-trapped in various crevasses of the room. 

           We hold on one of the heaps. Several seconds pass before we 
           notice --

           Kira’s eyes poking out from between the bags. 

           Beat. Then --

           We hear the entry hatch slide open. SOMEONE IS COMING. 

           Kira nestles deeper into her hiding spot, narrowly avoiding -- 

           NICHOLAI -- as he enters view. 

           He surveys the room. Above him, we catch sight of --

           CHRISTIAN, hiding in one of the adjacent stowage chambers on 
           the ceiling. Well, it’s the ceiling from our current 
           perspective at least...

           He catches sight of the screwdriver as Nicholai tucks it into 
           his jumpsuit, concealing it. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (calling out)
                        Christian? Doctor Williams? I think 
                        it’s time we all have a talk, don’t 
                        you? 
                             (lying)
                        Too many people have been hurt and I 
                        think we can all agree this isn’t 
                        what we’re up here for... 

           No response. 

           The hulking Russian moves slowly and meticulously through the 
           room, pausing every so often to move garbage bags out of the 
           way of his search. Then -- 

           He sets his focus on the chamber where we know Kira is 
           hiding. Something about it piques his interest. 

           He moves closer. 

           Nicholai places one hand inside his jumpsuit, presumably 
           wrapping his fingers around the screwdriver. With the other, 
           he reaches toward the foam box that may be right in front of 
           Kira’s face!
           Seeing this --

           CHRISTIAN -- reaches into his own jumpsuit, unearthing the 
           small Rubik’s Cube. 

           He cranes his body momentarily out of his hiding spot.

           If Nicholai chose to turn his head in this moment, he would 
           spot Christian for certain. 

           With all his might Christian hurls the Rubik’s Cube. 

           It sails through the air at a glacially slow pace. 

           Christian tucks himself back into his hiding spot, 
           disappearing from view. 

           NICHOLAI -- tugs on the storage box, but --

           It’s stuck. 

           He furrows his brow, confused. He removes his other hand from 
           his jumpsuit. He’s about to yank the box out of place with 
           full 220 pounds of Russian strength in 3... 2...

           CLUNK -- the Rubik’s Cube finally taps against one the room’s 
           far walls. 

           Nicholai’s head whips toward the sound. He lets go of the box 
           and moves toward the noise. 

           With Nicholai’s attention elsewhere --

           BEHIND HIM -- Kira pushes her way out of her hiding spot!

           She moves toward the room’s exit as fast as she possibly can 
           without causing a sound. 

           She can see the exit. She looks back to ensure Nicholai isn’t 
           looking. 

           Just as she’s about to be home free, she turns her attention 
           back toward the doorway, and --

           SHE COMES FACE TO FACE WITH ALEXEY! 

           Kira looks horrified. Despite being clearly distraught over 
           the loss of Weronika, Alexey looks surprised. 

           They both realize the situation immediately -- which is to 
           say, that as far as Kira is concerned, she’s fucked... 

           Then --
           Remaining silent, Alexey extends his hand for her to take.  

           Kira hesitates.

           Alexey glances past her at Nicholai, who seems to be losing 
           interest in the sound he had heard. 

           Concern builds in Alexey’s eyes. 

           Kira tightens her jaw, and --

           She takes Alexey’s hand. 

           BEHIND NICHOLAI -- we can see Alexey unlatch a compartment 
           above them, guide Kira inside it, and close it behind her. 

           Nicholai turns around, just missing the action. 

           He sets his eyes on Alexey, who is now alone at the end of 
           the room. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        Did you find anyone yet?

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (Russian)
                        Does it look like it?

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        No. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (Russian)
                        Have you come to your senses, or are 
                        you going to continue to get in the 
                        way?

           Alexey shrugs. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        I’m not going to get in the way...

           Nicholai considers. Then --

                                 NICHOLAI
                             (switching to English)
                        That’s very good to hear. Very good.  
                             (calling out -- lying)
                        If anyone is in here. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICHOLAI (CONT'D)
                                 NICHOLAI (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to let you know Alexey 
                        has just informed me that Weronika 
                        is going to be okay... We were able 
                        to stop the bleeding. She’s 
                        conscious and resting in her sleep 
                        pod. It's a nasty concussion, but 
                        nothing out of control. I think when 
                        she’s feeling a bit better soon we 
                        should discuss what’s become of us 
                        and how to sort this out peacefully. 
                        What do you say? 

           Nicholai scans the room with his eyes. With the exception of 
           the life support’s LOW HUM, the space seems quiet and empty. 

           He looks to Alexey, who stares back at him with a tired and 
           blank expression. 

           Off this, Alexey makes a show of looking around the room. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        We should check the Soyuz. If they 
                        find a way to detach the hooks they 
                        might be able to escape the station.
                             (beat)
                        It’s where I would go. 

           Nicholai thinks. Satisfied enough, he nods. 

           Alexey turns to leave the module. 

           Nicholai moves ever so slightly to follow, only to then stop 
           dead in his tracks.  

           Alexey seems to take notice. 

                                 ALEXEY (CONT'D)
                        Nicholai...?

           Nicholai doesn’t respond. His eyes are fixed on something --

           He follows it, until we see --

           The RUBIK’S CUBE comes floating back into view, inches from 
           Nicholai’s nose! 

           A cold shiver runs up Alexey’s spine. They both know what 
           that means. 

           Nicholai looks directly up above him, laying eyes on --

           CHRISTIAN peeking out from inside his hiding spot! 
                                 NICHOLAI
                             (Russian)
                        Son-of-a-bitch!

           He launches his body upward, grabbing hold of Christian by 
           the collar and tearing him out of his crevasse.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        No -- please! 

           Nicholai forces Christian against the wall, and draws the 
           screwdriver. 

           Alexey rushes to help. 

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        NICHOLAI STOP! THIS ISN’T US!

           Without taking his eyes off Christian, Nicholai THROWS a hard 
           elbow behind him, BLASTING his brother in orbital bone and 
           sending him tumbling away. 

           Nicholai forces an elbow down on Christian’s windpipe, using 
           a nearby grip-pole to apply the pressure without the help of 
           gravity. 

           Christian struggles in vain. 

           With his free hand Nicholai raises the screwdriver, and 
           BRINGS IT DOWN HARD! Just as --

           KIRA COMES SLAMMING INTO HIM, forcing the weapon to miss its 
           target and blast into a button panel inches from Christian’s 
           face. 

           Nicholai is forced to release the pressure on Christian’s 
           windpipe. But --

           He sets his gaze on Kira. 

                                 KIRA
                             (through coughs)
                        CHRISTIAN, RUN!

           She tries desperately to make a break for it as well.  

           Nicholai pursues.

           Foot by foot, she claws her way toward the room’s exit. 

           Nicholai comes barreling after her, pulling himself toward 
           her, with both hands. 
           He’s closing in! 

           Kira passes the room’s threshold, but she’s only about a foot 
           into the next node when --

           Nicholai grabs hold of her ankle. In a matter of milliseconds 
           he yanks his way up her body. 

           Rearing up like a cobra, he raises the screwdriver again and -
           -

           WHAM!

           Nicholai is sent FLYING BACK into the module AS THE BUTT OF 
           THE HEAVY METAL DRILL IS BLASTED INTO HIS FACE LIKE A 
           SLEDGEHAMMER!

           Disheveled looks from all around the room turn toward --

                                 GORDON
                             (to Nicholai)
                        I owed you that one, comrade. 

                                 KIRA
                        Gordon!

                                 GORDON
                        Hey, Williams. 

           Gordon notices someone’s missing. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        ...Where’s Weronika?

           Kira doesn’t know how to answer that, but the look she gives 
           him says it all. 

           Gordon swallows hard, suppressing the heartbreak as much as 
           he can. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        ...I wasn’t here...

           ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MODULE, NICHOLAI BEGINS TO RECOVER. 

           Gordon takes notice. And --

           Sorrow turns to anger as he looks up. Gordon’s ready for a 
           fight.  

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                             (to Kira)
                        Get out of here. 
           Both recovering, ALEXEY -- helps Christian up and out of the 
           room. 

                                 KIRA
                        We can’t leave you. 

                                 GORDON
                        I told you already. Guy’s a teddy 
                        bear. How bad can he be?

           ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM -- 

           Nicholai turns a bloodstained face toward his fellow 
           astronauts.  

           He SPITS OUT A TOOTH, allowing it to float off into the air 
           above him. A trail of blood follows it like a tiny red comet 
           tail. 

           GORDON -- sighs. 

           He looks to Kira with a half-smile, then --

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Don't you have some work to finish 
                        or something? 

           With that, Gordon DROPS THE HATCH DOOR between them! 

           He pulls the lever on his side, pressure locking it, and 
           sealing himself in the module with Nicholai. 

           Kira bangs on the glass in protest, but it’s too late. 

           With a nod, Gordon turns to face Nicholai. 

           THROUGH THE WINDOW -- Kira watches, helpless, until Christian 
           and Alexey pull her away, leaving Gordon truly on his own. 

           Nicholai white-knuckles the screwdriver. 

           Gordon REVS the drill. 

           INT. ISS - OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SAME

                                 KIRA
                        We can’t leave him. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        We don't have a choice! 

           Kira thinks -- fishing for something, anything. Then --
                                 KIRA
                        Are there more pistol grip tools 
                        onboard?!

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        What? Yes, of course. 

                                 KIRA
                        Show me!

           Christian, Kira, and Alexey barrel away from the door. 

           INT. PERMANENT MULTIPURPOSE MODULE - SAME

                                 GORDON
                             (to Nicholai)
                        'Bout time we touched gloves, huh?

           Nicholai smiles a SHATTERED TOOTH smile. Ever see videos of a 
           great white shark tearing into a sea lion? Yeah, it’s a bit 
           like that. 

           NICHOLAI PUSHES OFF THE FAR WALL, LAUNCHING HIMSELF TOWARD 
           GORDON. 

           Gordon closes the distance, SWINGING the butt of his drill in 
           the process and KNOCKING Nicholai’s screwdriver out of his 
           hand! 

           It spins away into the air. But --

           Nicholai grabs hold of Gordon’s collar. He SLAMS his forehead 
           into his opponent's face, knocking him back. In the process --

           WE REORIENT OURSELVES -- THE WALL BECOMES THE FLOOR. 

           Nicholai pushes Gordon against the nearest wall, pinning the 
           drill. 

           INT. TOOL CHAMBER - SAME

           Christian, Alexey, and Kira come tumbling into a chamber 
           filled with various tools. 

           Kira grabs one of several drills identical to Gordon’s. 

           She fits the end with a socket bolt and makes her way back 
           out of the room.

           Christian follows suit, as fast as physically possible. 

           Alexey is left alone in the room. 
           He stares at the last drill-tool for a long beat. To pick it 
           up means physically acting against his own brother.  

           His jaw tightens as he struggles with the decision.   

           INT. PERMANENT MULTIPURPOSE MODULE - SAME

           With his free arm, Gordon manages to throw two quick 
           UPPERCUTS to Nicholai’s chin, forcing him back. 

           Gordon uses all his strength to attempt a sloppy hip toss. 

           Nicholai grabs hold of a grip bar above him.

           WE REORIENT -- THE CEILING BECOMES THE FLOOR. 

           Gordon revs the drill and thrusts it towards Nicholai, but --

           The Russian catches the tool by the hilt. He ROLLS, taking 
           Gordon with him. 

           WE REORIENT -- FLOOR BECOMES WALL.

           Gordon is pinned. 

           His hand is still wrapped around the spinning drill as 
           Nicholai forces the tool’s deadly tip toward Gordon. 

           INT. ISS - OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SAME

           Kira and Christian set about removing bolts from the outside 
           of the door. 

           They can’t open it, but they CAN remove the door entirely. 

           INT. PERMANENT MULTIPURPOSE MODULE - SAME

           Gordon fights, but Nicholai is winning. The tip of the drill 
           slowly begins to turn away from Nicholai and toward Gordon’s 
           abdomen. 

           This is like watching the most high stakes arm wrestling 
           match ever. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        This isn’t personal, comrade...
           INT. ISS - OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SAME

           Two thirds of the bolts lay in scattered heaps around the 
           group’s feet like discarded bullet shells. 

           They continue to work on the door, but precious seconds are 
           ticking away fast! 

           It's clear, they're not working quickly enough. Not until --

           Alexey moves into view, a drill of his own in hand as he 
           joins the effort!

           INT. PERMANENT MULTIPURPOSE MODULE - SAME

           Gordon continues to struggle, but then --

           SQUELCH...

           The WHIRRING sound of the drill takes on more of a WET 
           quality...

           The color rushes out of Gordon’s face. His eyes widen, as --

           The oozing red form of his weightless blood floats upward 
           from his abdomen. 

                                 NICHOLAI
                        I am sorry for this...

           Gordon has just lost this fight, but then --

           Something catches his eye. 

           With his free hand Gordon reaches out, SNATCHING THE 
           SCREWDRIVER OUT OF THE AIR AS IT FLOATS BY!

                                 GORDON
                        Me too... 

           SHUNK!

           HE DRIVES IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH NICHOLAI’S NECK, UNTIL IT IS 
           STOPPED BY THE HILT! The blood-soaked tip sticks two inches 
           out the opposite side of the Russian man’s thick neck. 

           The men hold each other’s gaze, each watching the other die. 

           Nicholai forces a pained, choking, smile. Blood trickles in 
           upward droplets from his mouth. 

           Gordon lets out a weak scoff at his opponent's reaction. 
           As their bodies fall limp, they drift off the wall. Just as --

           The DOOR FALLS outward, allowing --

           Kira, Christian, and Alexey to come crashing through. They’re 
           still holding the drill tools of their own, when the group 
           lays eyes on --

           GORDON AND NICHOLAI’S BODIES ARE INTERTWINED, FLOATING IN THE 
           CENTER OF THE ROOM. 

           GEYSERS OF BLOOD SPILL UPWARD FROM THEIR WOUNDS AND EXPAND 
           ABOVE THEM LIKE DYE IN WATER. 

           The room is dead silent. An eerie stillness -- with the 
           exception of the liquid -- has taken over. 

           In the most fucked up way possible, this is actually kind of 
           a beautiful sight... The image of a blooming rose comes to 
           mind. 

           The group's hearts sink, as they stare unblinking at their 
           former colleagues. 

           Alexey swallows a tear at the sight. It's not an easy image  
           for him to take in.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        ...It’s over...

           No one responds. They don’t have to. 

           After a long moment, Kira turns her attention to Alexey.  

                                 KIRA
                             (broken Russian)
                        Thank you. 

           He nods, softly. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           - The group helps each other wrap up Gordon, Nicholai, and 
           Weronika for future burial. 

           - Alexey places his forehead against his brother's one last 
           time. 

           - The bodies each have a respective flag pinned to them. They 
           are left together in one of the stowage areas. The spacesuits 
           are removed to make room. 
           - Alexey takes an extra moment to look at Nicholai and 
           Weronika before leaving. 

           - They hang the TWO spacesuits, temporarily storing them in a 
           small lab-like room we haven’t seen before. They sit in the 
           dark like oversized mannequins. 

           - Alexey moves through the Russian Orbital Segment. It’s 
           empty and more soulless-seeming than it has ever been before. 
           He runs his hand along the wall. 

           - The three sit in silence in Node One. 

           - Each member of the group has retired to their own sleep 
           pod. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KIRA’S SLEEP POD - SAME

           Kira lies half-deep in a sleeping bag that’s been Velcroed to 
           the wall. Once again, music is pumped directly from her 
           Walkman and into her skull. 

           She fiddles with the Rocket Ship keychain. 

           Her eyes trace the strap the tiny vessel has been fastened 
           to. We recognize the material as the same webbing used for 
           the space walk tethers. 

           Holding the end of the strap, Kira lets the toy drift upward. 
           It looks like a retro Buck Rogers-style design, but in the 
           weightlessness of the ISS it’s actually given the illusion of 
           a tiny spacecraft soaring through the air.  

           It’s a melancholy moment. Then --

           She hears something outside the pod. Movement. 

           She collapses her door, just enough to peek through. In doing 
           so --

           She catches sight of ALEXEY as he slowly moves through The 
           Node. 

           His movement is cautious, as if he doesn’t want to be 
           noticed.

           Kira furrows her brow. 

           Once Alexey has vanished from sight, she slides her door 
           further open and slips out. 
           To prevent her ear-pods from floating away, she tucks them 
           into the collar of her jumpsuit and then silently follows the 
           same path that Alexey had moved in. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NODE THREE - MOMENTS LATER

           Alexey drifts through the quiet space, unaware of his 
           pursuer. 

           He disappears around a corner. 

           Beat. 

           Kira appears. She continues after him. 

           INT. ISS - MOMENTS LATER

           Kira sees Alexey open a hatch and disappear into the adjacent 
           room. What the fuck is he up to?

           With extreme caution, Kira moves to the open hatch. 

           She does her best to press against the outer wall. 

           Holding tight to a grip-pole, she peeks around the corner and 
           into --

           INT. STOWAGE AREA B - SAME

           Kira lays suspicious eyes on --

           Alexey cradling Weronika’s body...

           Kira’s face softens. 

           A single tear floats into the air above him. His chest 
           heaves. 

           Her eyes move to Nicholai's body, where we notice an ALENKA 
           chocolate bar has been tucked into his collar.  

           Kira speaks, making her presence known. 

                                 KIRA
                        I’m sorry... 

           Alexey’s attention shoots toward her, flustered. 
                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        What are you doing in here?

           Kira shows her palms. 

                                 KIRA
                        I didn’t mean to startle you!

           Alexey stares at her blankly. There’s a massive language 
           barrier between these two, but even through it, Kira can tell 
           Alexey’s heart is broken. 

           Embarrassed, he gently places Weronika’s body back next to 
           Gordon’s.  

           Her now-blueish face is exposed. She looks more asleep than 
           she does deceased. 

           Alexey doesn’t take his eyes off her. Not even when Kira 
           moves behind him. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        She seemed like a great person... I -
                        - I know I only knew her a little 
                        bit, but... I dunno... She was kind 
                        to me when I got here. 

           Alexey turns to look at Kira. 

           Beat. Then --

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        ...You don’t understand anything I’m 
                        saying, do you?

           He blinks, unsure how to respond. 

           Without knowing what else to do, Kira wraps her arms around 
           him in a hug. 

           Alexey’s body tightens with surprise. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        I’m so sorry...

           Then, slowly, he allows himself to hug her back.

           They hold the embrace for a long beat, before Kira lets 
           herself pull away. 

           He stares at her, grateful. For this moment in time, they 
           understand each other. No language required. 
           With a knowing nod, Kira leaves Alexey to be alone. 

           Off Alexey as he returns his attention to Weronika’s body. 

           INT. NODE TWO - MOMENTS LATER

           An overtired Kira returns toward her sleep pod. 

           She takes a beat before reentering it. Then --

           She REORIENTS herself, placing her body level with an 
           adjacent sleep pod that was above her a moment ago. 

           She knocks. 

           Beat. No response. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Christian?

           Knocks again.

           Nothing. 

           Kira looks perplexed. 

           She moves to The Node’s entryway, opposite the direction she 
           had left Alexey in. She steps through the door and into --

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kira turns a corner and --

           NEARLY BUMPS DIRECTLY INTO CHRISTIAN! 

           Kira jumps, surprised. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Sorry! I wasn’t trying to scare you. 

                                 KIRA
                        Don’t worry about it... What is that 
                        room back there? Gordon never got 
                        the chance to finish his tour... 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Kibo Module. It’s a small lab Japan 
                        sent up a little while back. I’ve 
                        never really used it for much, just 
                        roaming around to be honest. Feeling 
                        pretty restless after all this. 
                                 KIRA
                        I guess I can’t blame you for 
                        that... 

           Christian looks at his watch. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I think I’m gonna give the radio 
                        another shot. It’s already been 
                        twenty-two hours since I set this 
                        thing. If I’m right about the EMP, 
                        then they should be back online 
                        soon. There's still time to get our 
                        message out and get off this thing. 
                        God willing there’s still a world 
                        left for us to go back to... 

                                 KIRA
                        You think it’s gonna be that 
                        different down there?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I know you’re new up here, but don’t 
                        tell me you aren’t ready to get the 
                        hell off this thing. 

           Kira considers for a moment, then --

           She pulls the ear-pods of her Walkman out from where they’ve 
           been tucked in her collar. After fitting them into 
           Christian’s ears, she presses play. 

           We hear Joan Jett’s cover of Crimson and Clover emit from 
           within them. Kira lets the song play for a moment before 
           speaking --

                                 KIRA
                        My ex made me this CD when we were 
                        in high school... I think now I 
                        listen to it more out of habit or 
                        muscle memory than anything else. I 
                        don't really know...
                             (beat)
                        But I do know I came up here for a 
                        reason, and I know I made a choice 
                        to put two-hundred-twenty miles of 
                        space between me and the people I 
                        cared about the most... 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                             (still listening to the 
                              music)
                        Great decision that ended up 
                        being...
                                 KIRA
                        I mean, yeah if I could go back and 
                        do it again, I probably wouldn't do 
                        EVERYTHING the same...
                             (beat)
                        But -- and I can't believe I'm 
                        saying this -- I don't really regret 
                        coming up here... After the last 
                        fucked up twenty-four hours, I sort 
                        of finally feel like -- It's worth 
                        trying to find the people who I 
                        actually can trust. 

           Christian thinks about the statement and then pops the 
           headphones off. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        So, not a complete waste of your 
                        time then, Williams?  

           Kira BLINKS as a spell of DIZZINESS washes over her. 

                                 KIRA
                        Not a COMPLETE waste -- 

           She stifles her reaction, but Christian takes notice anyway. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        ...You okay?

                                 KIRA
                        Just a little lightheaded I guess.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        We’ve been through a lot. I know 
                        this sounds impossible, but you 
                        should try to close your eyes for a 
                        bit. No sense staying up just to 
                        worry. 

           Kira nods again. 

                                 KIRA
                        I think I’ll do that. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Good luck. 

           With that, Christian mindlessly closes the hatch door behind 
           him and moves past her, disappearing through the opposite end 
           of The Node. 

           Kira watches him go. 
           Beat. She’s just about to return to her sleep pod, when 
           something catches her eye --

           The words KIBO MODULE are printed across the door that 
           Christian just closed. However, someone has added downward 
           letters in thick sharpie marker that make the sign read --

                                            N

                                            O

                                            D

                                            E

                                         KIBØ MODULE

           IMMEDIATELY, she pulls back, surprised. Evidently, Node Zero 
           does exist, just not officially.

           Beat. 

           She stares at the door. Then --

           Hastily, she pulls the lever, opening it. Kira steps into --

           INT. NODE ZERO - CONTINUOUS

           Her eyes race around the room in panicked confusion. 

                                 KIRA
                        No...

           We meet her gaze to find --

           Where there had been two perfectly intact spacesuits, ONLY 
           ONE NOW REMAINS. BUT --

           IT’S BEEN TORN TO SHREDS, SLICED APART WITH A BLADE OF SOME 
           SORT, RENDERING IT COMPLETELY USELESS!

           The other one is gone entirely. 

           Kira steps back, worried. Then --

           Her hand rises to one of her eyes. She SEETHES in pain, 
           fighting a nasty headache. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck...
           Suddenly, something clicks in Kira’s mind. 

           She pulls her hand away and cranes her ear listening to --

           Nothing... 

           The LOW HUM that has accompanied the station since she 
           arrived is completely gone!

           Gordon’s words echo in her skull, but she repeats them for us 
           to hear.

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                             (under her breath)
                        “When you don’t hear the hum... 
                        That’s when you panic...”

           Kira takes off like a shot, RACING out of the room. 

           INT. NODE TWO - MOMENTS LATER

           Kira leaps toward Christian’s sleep pod, reorienting herself 
           in the process. 

           She bangs on the collapsible door. 

                                 KIRA
                        CHRISTIAN! CHRISTIAN, GET OUT HERE 
                        NOW!

           No response. 

           Kira pries the door open. Looking in to find --

           THE MISSING SPACESUIT has been tucked safely into the sleep 
           pod.  

           Kira looks at her own horrified reflection in the helmet’s 
           visor. Then --

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                             (warning)
                        Alexey!

           Now fully panicked, she races to the doorway toward the next 
           Node.

           INT. NODE ONE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kira comes BLASTING into the room. Immediately laying eyes on 
           --
           CHRISTIAN AND ALEXEY are both present. They stare at her, 
           blissfully unaware of her alarm.  

           Alexey fiddles with the radio. 

           Christian is in the process of making a sandwich. 

           Kira clocks the SHARP KNIFE in his hand, currently being used 
           to spread mustard on a tortilla.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        ...Everything okay?

           She looks from him to Alexey and then back. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...Just a headache. 

           With a shrug, Christian turns his back on her. His attention 
           returns to working on his sandwich. 

           Kira moves to Alexey. 

           She places herself in front of him, making her presence known 
           without making a sound. 

           Alexey looks up at her. She holds his eye contact. 

           Ensuring that Christian’s attention is not on them, she 
           places a finger to her lips in a silent “shhh” gesture. 

           Alexey’s eyebrows move closer to each other, perplexed. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM -- Christian speaks without looking up from 
           his task. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I’ve been thinking... What’s 
                        happened up here is nothing short of 
                        tragic, don’t get me wrong... But in 
                        a roundabout way, you could look at 
                        things and say we complied with the 
                        orders we were given. The ISS is 
                        pretty much under American control. 

           ON KIRA AND ALEXEY --

           Kira responds to Christian without looking away from Alexey. 

                                 KIRA
                        What’s your point? 

           Kira pulls her earlobe and then points upward in a desperate 
           effort to alert him of the missing life support.
           Alexey stares at her blankly. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM -- 

           Christian CLAPS the knife down on the prep table, Velcroing 
           it in place. The sound causes Kira’s body to tighten with 
           worry.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I just think whoever is still alive -
                        - I.E. us -- stand to gain something 
                        from all this... Last survivors, of 
                        a mission for the good of the 
                        country -- who make it back home 
                        with mere seconds on the clock? 
                        We’re heroes... I don’t know what 
                        your plan was for after the ISS, but 
                        the sky’s the limit now... Just a 
                        little silver lining I guess...  

           ON KIRA AND ALEXEY --

           That resonates with Kira. A matter of hours ago that would 
           have been music to her ears. But a lot has happened since she 
           arrived. 

           She shakes off the allure of the statement. 

           Growing increasingly desperate, she jerks her head toward 
           Christian, who is miraculously unaware of their failing game 
           of charades. 

           FINALLY, a look of understanding seems to cross Alexey’s 
           face. 

           He rises up, and turns toward Christian. Thank God! 

           Alexey moves toward him. 

           Christian takes notice of the approaching Russian. 

           Alexey is two or three feet away now. 

           Christian WRAPS HIS FINGERS AROUND THE KNIFE once again! 

           In anticipation, Kira takes something like a half step toward 
           the men. Then --

           Alexey reaches up and --

           He turns on the TV... 

           Christian and Kira freeze in place.  
           Alexey’s eyes hover on the screen, until the words NO SIGNAL 
           appear in front of him. 

           He turns back toward Kira and shrugs, having completely 
           misinterpreted her message. 

           FUCK! 

           Relieved, Christian SLICES his sandwich in half, covering for 
           picking up the knife in the first place. The sound it makes 
           is a violent one. 

           Alexey returns his attention to the radio. 

           Kira rubs her eyes. The headache is getting worse and 
           thinking desperately isn’t helping it. Then -- 

           New plan. 

                                 KIRA
                             (calling over)
                        Christian?

           He looks over. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        Whatcha making over there? Looks 
                        good. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Ham sandwich... Can’t say I have 
                        much of an appetite, but I realized 
                        we haven’t eaten in about a full 
                        day... I was just about to take it 
                        to bed.  

                                 KIRA
                        Looks good. 

           Christian looks at the sandwich, then back to her. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        ...Do you want one?

           Kira tries extra hard to hide any unwanted inflection in her 
           voice, as she says --

                                 KIRA
                        I can make it myself. 

           Her success in this effort is marginal at best...
           Suspicion begins to brew in Christian, but he steps aside to 
           make room for her. Even in doing so, he is careful to ensure 
           that he is the closest to THE KNIFE. 

           Kira crosses the room. Sifting through the net-trap cabinets 
           until she finds the mustard jar.

           She’s careful not to look back at Alexey. But --

           Christian’s eyes have begun to wander back and forth between 
           them. While they’re set on Alexey --

           KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

           Kira CLAPS the jar against the prep table. Three perfectly 
           syncopated beats. Just like when she was onboard the Soyuz.

           Alexey doesn’t look up from the radio, but his eyes laser-
           focus, taking notice. 

           It’s possible he could be misinterpreting her message again. 
           But we don’t get that impression. 

           Christian looks at Kira. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                             (covering)
                        Lid was stuck... 

           She unscrews the cap.

           Her eyes move from the jar to the KNIFE next to Christian. 

           Here comes the Hail Mary...

           Kira holds out her palm. 

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        Do you mind?

           Alexey watches them. 

           Christian’s hand is already leaning on the prep table. It 
           doesn’t move. 

           His suspicion of her game is skyrocketing, but he’s not ready 
           to blow his cover. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        ...There are disposable butterknives 
                        in that cabinet.  

           He directs her attention toward a cabinet on his other side -- 
           clearly farther than the knife he’s been using. 
           Kira leaves her palm in the air. She’s not exactly hiding her 
           motives anymore. 

                                 KIRA
                             (deadpan)
                        That one’s fine. 

           They stare at each other. 

           Alexey’s eyes rush back and forth between them.  

           Long, long, long beat. Then --

           Christian breaks into a nervous laugh, maintaining his cover. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Sorry. My head's all over the place. 

           He picks up the knife, blade first, and moves to hand it to 
           her. 

           Just before he gives it up --

           He pauses.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        Um. Alexey?

           Alexey perks up. So does Kira, unsure what he’s getting at. 
           Then --

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                             (Russian)
                        Would you mind giving Doctor 
                        Williams and I a moment in private? 
                        There’s something she feels she 
                        needs to tell me.

           He smiles. 

           This fucker has been able to speak perfect Russian this 
           entire time! 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                             (Russian)
                        No offense. 

           Confused, Alexey looks from Christian to Kira. 

           She gives him a nod that, to her, probably means - “You do 
           understand what’s happening, right?” But, to him, more likely 
           means -- “What Christian’s saying is all true.” 

           Beat. Then --
           ALEXEY TURNS HIS BACK on them and begins to move toward the 
           room’s exit. 

           NO!

           Christian flips the knife, placing its hilt in his palm. 

           He looks to Kira as Alexey moves away behind him. 

           With an over-satisfied shit-eating smirk, Christian takes a 
           bite of his sandwich. All the while keeping eye contact with 
           Kira. 

           She thinks. Her mind races, grasping for something. Anything. 
           Then --

                                 KIRA
                             (calling out in broken 
                              Russian)
                        “The important thing is that we 
                        stick together...”

           Alexey pauses and then turns back. 

           Christian takes notice. He looks nervous.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                             (Russian)
                        Alexey. A moment, please. 

           Alexey looks to Kira, now understanding. 

           He moves back toward them.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                             (worried)
                        Alexey!

           KIRA TAKES HER OPPORTUNITY TO RUSH CHRISTIAN! 

           She grabs hold of his wrist, trying to control the direction 
           of the blade, but he doesn’t let go. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        NO!

           Alexey closes in, just as --

           Christian manages to shake Kira off, freeing the knife. 

           Alexey reaches for it, but --
           CHRISTIAN LASHES OUT, slashing at Alexey with the blade, 
           slicing through his jumpsuit and into the skin below! The 
           last standing Russian recoils!

           Taking his opportunity, Christian turns the blade on Kira!

                                 KIRA
                        Christian!

           He drops the blade down on her like a guillotine, but --

           Kira misses the tip... technically. The knife catches the 
           rocket ship keychain, slicing the tether its bound to, 
           allowing --

           Christian frees the knife! Wild-eyed, he cocks his arm back 
           again, and --

           CHRISTIAN STABS TOWARD HER!

           SHUNK!

           Kira’s eyes widen. 

           Christian looks equal parts surprised and nervous. 

           An all-too-familiar red liquid floats up between them. 

           Finally we see where the blade has landed, and reveal --

           IT’S BEEN JAMMED HILT-DEEP THROUGH ALEXEY’S PALM. He managed 
           to get his own limb between Christian and Kira, just in time  
           to sacrifice his hand to save her.

           Christian attempts to yank the blade back, but --

           Using his free hand, Alexey grabs hold of Christian’s wrist, 
           holding him in place. 

           Christian yanks again. And again he fails to free the knife. 

           Worry creeps into his eyes. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                             (Russian)
                        Let go! I froze the life support, 
                        but I can fix it! I know how to 
                        reverse the process!  

           Alexey looks at him, possibly considering the offer. Then --

                                 ALEXEY
                             (Russian)
                        So do I. 
           JUST THEN --

           SNAP!

           In a flash -- Kira appears behind Christian and loops the 
           broken, but sturdy strap of the rocket keychain around his 
           neck! 

           Christian struggles, forgetting about the knife, but unable 
           to free his hands from Alexey. 

           His face turns blue. 

           He looks like he wants to say something, but Kira and Alexey 
           don’t let go of their respective grips. 

           Christian stares into Alexey’s eyes, until finally --

           His body goes limp. 

           Kira lets go. So does Alexey. 

           Christian’s body drifts out of view. 

           They look at each other in disbelief of what’s become of 
           them. 

           After a long beat. 

           Kira finally sighs with relief. An involuntary half-SMILE 
           appears as she does so. 

           Alexey does his best to reciprocate the reaction.  

           MONTAGE

           - Kira wraps Alexey’s hand in a sturdy bandage. 

           - She helps him as he carefully works on fixing the life 
           support. 

           - They hug as the LOW CONFIRMING HUM and subsequent breeze 
           return to the station. 

           - Together they move Christian’s body. Instead of placing him 
           with the others, they leave him in the airlock. Alexey places 
           a notebook, a hard drive, and several RED, LABELED VIALS on 
           Christian’s chest.

           - Kira takes Christian's watch, noting its timer is down to 
           fifty-six minutes -- less than an hour before it will be too 
           late to call for help.  
           - Before they close the airlock’s internal door, Kira doubles 
           back and places her Walkman with the other items in Alexey’s 
           pile before exiting.  

           - Outside the ISS -- a hatch opens. Christian’s body is 
           sucked out into space. We watch his skin instantly freeze as 
           he drifts by us. The comparatively icy Walkman floats past 
           his frozen face...

           INT. NODE ONE - LATER

           Alexey and Kira find themselves in Node One once again. 

           It’s just the two of them now. No activities left to occupy 
           their minds. 

           They rest in silence for a long beat, until --

           Alexey moves back toward the small lab where Kira's cell 
           samples amazingly remain where they were left at the 
           beginning of our story. He peers through, considering 
           something. Then -- 

           Kira watches as he looks up, surprised. 

                                 KIRA
                        ...What is it?

           With a smirk he steps back, allowing her to see. Tentatively, 
           Kira takes a peek for herself. 

           MIRCROSCOPE POV -- MIRACULOUSLY, the tissue cells have begun 
           to bind to one another, with more life than we’ve seen from 
           them! This is what they’re supposed to be doing. 

           Kira steps back, stunned.

                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                             (half to herself)
                        They just needed some time...

           She looks to Alexey, and --

           She laughs. Half with joy, half with disbelief. 

           Alexey smiles, sharing the moment with her, until --

           WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP!

           Alexey and Kira snap their attention toward the radio 
           receiver on the American side of The Node. 

           A blue confirmation light BLINKS in unison with the sound. 
                                 KIRA (CONT'D)
                        The radio’s back online...

           The statement needs to be said out loud. No matter how 
           pointless it may be. 

           INTERCUT -- we see the familiar monitor in the Russian 
           Orbital Segment that Kira had used to record her message 
           earlier. Now instead of the PENDING message, it reads "SENT!" 
           For most intents and purposes... Help is on the way!

           The last two astronauts exchange a glance. Half stunned to 
           hear the sound of the radio at all. Half unsure what to do 
           about it. Then --

           CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG --

           Their heads move toward the other side of The Node, where --

           A call comes in on the Russian radio. In perfect contrast, a 
           red light flashes on that side. 

           The silence of the room has given way to a GRATING cacophony 
           of ringing and siren lights. 

           Both astronauts have a chance to answer the incoming call 
           from their respective governments. Both of them probably 
           should... And yet --

           Kira lifts her hand and slowly places it over Alexey’s. 

           The gesture is friendly in nature rather than romantic, but 
           in this moment it means more to them than anything else in 
           the world... or even two-hundred-fifty-four miles above it. 

           After a moment, Alexey curls his fingers around her hand, 
           reciprocating the embrace. 

           Neither moves to either radio. 

           Without a word between them, these two understand what choice 
           they’re making.  

           The red and blue lights continue to blaze. 

           The calls continue to ring on both sides of The Node, until 
           finally, we --

                                                           SMASH CUT TO 
                                                                 BLACK.

           THE END.
