                    GABI SEEMS DIFFERENT

           INT. RED MERCEDES / EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

           The blue sky is endless, cloudless. Yellow sand toasts in the 
           heat of the afternoon.

           On a sparsely inhabited two lane highway, a SMALL RED 
           MERCEDES speeds along. It’s miniscule compared to the few 
           EIGHTEEN WHEELER TRUCKS it passes.

           Driving the car is a YOUNG WOMAN in a spaghetti strap top, 
           hair blowing in the wind. We only see her from behind, but we 
           can hear she’s listening to AVRIL LAVIGNE’S “Complicated.” 

           That song still fucks.

           WE MOVE BACK from the HIGHWAY. The CARS and TRUCKS become 
           small. But “Complicated” stays with us. THE RED MERCEDES 
           looks triumphant and free on the open road.

           Until, from far off, we hear a TRUCK’S HORN BLARING.

           And in an instant, the RED MERCEDES FLIPS OFF THE SIDE OF THE 
           HIGHWAY.

           “Complicated” ENDS.

           THE MERCEDES VISIBLY CRUSHES AND CRUNCHES as it FLIPS OVER, 
           and lands UPSIDE DOWN. Far from the road. Dust and sand swirl 
           all around it. TRUCKS continue to ZOOM by on the narrow 
           highway. The cloud of dust around the WRECKAGE begins to 
           settle as FLAME erupts in the car. 

           BLACK SMOKE billows out of it. But the RED MERCEDES, and 
           ANYONE inside it, is entirely STILL.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Chyron: FOUR YEARS LATER.

           A plush, neutral-toned bedroom. Silk sheets. Thick cushions. 
           A beautiful mirrored vanity.

           As we move through the space, we hear the voice of a RADIO 
           HOST, a woman’s voice - polished and slick.

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        If you’re just tuning in, you’re 
                        going to want to stay in. Today we 
                        have an incredibly special guest on 
                        the show. Gabi Orvan - or just 
                        Gabi, as we’ve known her since her 
                        teen years...

           We move towards a CLOSED DOOR on the side of the room into -
           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Where we find GABI, 29, in a silk robe, sitting on the edge 
           of the tub. Her hair is up in curlers. Her skin is flawless, 
           even without make up. Her legs have been waxed and oiled into 
           perfection.

           But when we come around to her left side we see a LONG SCAR 
           running along the side of her ear. Even alone in the room, 
           her hand instinctively floats up to it, and she moves her 
           curlers to cover it. 

           She arranges her hair to hide the scar often.

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        It’s difficult to keep track of  
                        the Grammys, the VMAs, the platinum 
                        albums. Hell, she even snuck in an 
                        Academy Award nod for her 
                        performance on the soundtrack of 
                        “Sometimes I Never” -

           GABI’s eyes are wide and open, observant. Always. Like the 
           world she’s looking at just happens to have appeared - and 
           could disappear, in turn, at any moment. 

           GABI leans into her computer screen, much closer than she 
           needs to lean. Hunching her back, like a GLAMOROUS GARGOYLE.

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Top of the chart singles. Over the 
                        top performances. A purported 
                        thousand sit-ups a day. That’s the 
                        Gabi we knew.

           GABI is scrolling through her computer - though we don’t yet 
           see what she’s looking at.

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Until four years ago, it all came 
                        to a halt.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. RADIO STATION - RECEPTION - INTERCUT - DAY

           GABI stands to the side of a STUNNING LOBBY.

           The floors are shiny black, the walls dark and mirrored. GABI 
           glances at her reflection. She’s in white silk - small and 
           singular. Out of place.

                                 LEX (O.S.)
                         (across the room)
                        Great. Twenty-eighth floor?
           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           GABI stares at her computer screen, rapt. And now we see what 
           she’s looking at.

           A FILE OF OLD VIDEOS on her computer. Home videos. Not HD.

           GABI clicks and opens one of them:

           It’s of a CONFIDENT PRETEEN GIRL SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM 
           AT A RODEO. The PRETEEN GIRL is beaming as she hits the last 
           note. So proud. APPLAUSE from the STANDS.

           INT. RADIO STATION - RECEPTION - INTERCUT - DAY

           Back in the shiny black lobby, HEELS CLICK.

           A HAND lands gently on GABI’s back - and we meet: LEX, 40s.

           GABI’S MOM.

           LEX is a presence. Her eyes move like a hawk’s, catching any 
           movement in the room. But the source of her guardedness is 
           always clear: GABI. 

           LEX is GABI’s sovereign protector.

           Beyond this, LEX has a layer of protection around herself - 
           one so strong that she appears to have kept time at bay. Her 
           face is lineless. Hair: blonde. Cleavage: abundant. Jeans: 
           tight. GABI looks visibly relieved to be near her.

                                 LEX
                        Let’s go do it, baby.

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Our headlines were once flooded 
                        with Gabi’s legal battle with a 
                        deranged stalker, who broke onto 
                        Gabi’s compound and stole an 
                        alleged forty-three pairs of thirty 
                        dollar a pop Hanky Panky thongs - 
                        according to police reports. But 
                        that was just the beginning of the 
                        turmoil.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           GABI closes the RODEO VIDEO and clicks ANOTHER. 

           It’s of the PRETEEN GIRL practicing a DANCE ROUTINE in front 
           of the mirror.

           She makes missteps on the choreography but LAUGHS IT OFF. 
           She’s sure of herself, having fun.
           INT. RADIO STATION - ELEVATOR - INTERCUT - DAY

           LEX and GABI take the elevator upstairs. GABI glances over at 
           her mom. LEX can see it in her peripheral vision.

           LEX smiles. She pulls a pretty white sweater out of her 
           shoulder bag. She hands it over to GABI.

                                 LEX
                        You might get cold in there.

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        The world woke on April 24, 2016 to 
                        hear that... Gabi had been in a 
                        devastating car crash. One that 
                        would leave her in a coma for 
                        months. 

           GABI looks at the sweater but doesn’t take it.

                                 GABI
                        Why would I be cold?

                                 LEX
                        Well it’s a radio station and all, 
                        so they probably are gonna have it 
                        pretty cold.

           GABI stares for a moment.

                                 GABI
                        Do you not think I’m wearing the 
                        right thing -

                                 LEX
                        Those places just really crank up 
                        the AC, remember? And -

                                 GABI
                        Mom?

                                 LEX
                        Yeah, baby?

           GABI pauses for a moment, unsure. Nervous.

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        For the last four years, Gabi has 
                        been in recovery. Many believed she 
                        planned to leave the industry for 
                        good after cutting ties with her 
                        label.

                                 GABI
                        What if this is a bad idea?
                                 LEX
                        It’s not.

                                 GABI
                        Okay. But what if I mess it up?

                                 LEX
                        You won’t.

                                 RADIO HOST (O.S.)
                        But now... Gabi is breaking her 
                        silence.

                                 GABI
                         (increasingly anxious)
                        What if I breathe too loud into the 
                        microphone and everyone listening 
                        to the radio just hears me 
                        breathing like some weird out of 
                        breath girl?

           LEX looks at her. She can’t help a tiny smile coming out.

                                 LEX
                        Did that ever happen before?

                                 GABI
                        I don’t think so.

                                 LEX
                        Because it doesn’t happen.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           GABI opens another VIDEO FILE. She’s staring at her screen 
           intently, like someone studying footage. Looking for 
           something.

           In this VIDEO: the PRETEEN GIRL has gotten a bit older. She’s 
           now a TEEN. 

           The TEEN gets up on a small stage at a MALL and waves to the 
           SCATTERED AUDIENCE. She also turns and gives a little wave to 
           the side. To a FAMILY: a DAUGHTER, MOTHER, and FATHER. They 
           wave back, giddy.

           GABI rewinds. She plays back the wave to the FAMILY.

           Then she plays it back again.

           INT. RADIO STATION - ELEVATOR - INTERCUT - DAY

           LEX leans over and gives GABI a kiss on the cheek.
                                 RADIO HOST (O.S.)
                        She’s ready to get back to the 
                        commotion again.

                                 GABI
                        What if I’m not as good as I was 
                        before? And everyone notices?

                                 RADIO HOST (O.S.)
                        There’s a new Gabi in town. And 
                        you’re about to hear from her 
                        yourselves!

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           In the VIDEO: THE TEEN sidles up to a microphone -

                                 TEEN (ON VIDEO)
                        Hi I’m Gabi Orvan, and here’s a 
                        little song -

           INT. RADIO STATION - ELEVATOR - INTERCUT - DAY

           LEX turns to get out of the elevator.

                                 LEX
                        You show people what you want them 
                        to see, baby. Everything else is 
                        just yours.

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. RADIO STATION - RECORDING ROOM - DAY

           The ON AIR light is RED. 

           GABI, nervous, sits across a table from RADIO HOST - who does 
           not just have a face for radio. She is beautiful, polished, 
           glossy, and beyond comfortable in her own skin. Her 
           confidence is almost over-powering.

           Behind a SOUND-PROOFED WALL with a GLASS WINDOW is LEX, 
           watching everything.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        We can’t believe how lucky we are 
                        to have Gabi on our little program.
                         (aside, fast)
                        Tiny, right? Thanks California for 
                        making us NUMBER ONE for the sixth 
                        year running. 
                         (back to normal)
                        Gabi’s got her first show in four 
                        years coming up this week. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
                        It’s a small, but landmark public 
                        performance. 
                         (turning to GABI)
                        Gabi, as soon as that sale for 
                        tickets went on - it was over! Sold 
                        Out. Done! What did that feel like? 
                        To see the public’s response to 
                        your return?

           GABI looks shrunken by the pressure of the interview, but 
           when she opens her mouth to speak, words comes out like a 
           politician’s. Diplomatic, humble, and smooth.

                                 GABI
                        I feel really lucky. Even though I 
                        haven’t been on tour in so long, 
                        it’s been the fans who kept me 
                        going.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Well there were a lot of vigils for 
                        you, a lot of prayers, lot of well 
                        wishers. All over the world. And 
                        you guys, you should see her now. 
                        She’s got a new lease on life. Even 
                        a new look.

           We can see GABI doesn’t love this new look comment. RADIO 
           HOST keeps eyes glued to GABI - a steady, glossy smile on.

                                 RADIO HOST (CONT’D)
                        Tell us a little bit about what the  
                        last four years have been like for 
                        you, Gabi. There’s only so much 
                        tabloids and press releases can 
                        tell us.

                                 GABI
                        Well it’s been a lot of healing. A 
                        lot of hard work. A lot of trying 
                        to find myself again.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        And what do you mean by that? 
                        Finding yourself again.

                                 GABI
                        You know, I had a lot of injuries. 
                        Honestly, when I woke up after the 
                        crash, I didn’t even know who I 
                        was.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        You know I heard about that. Just 
                        no idea? 
                                 GABI
                         (with a shy smile)
                        Basically no idea.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        That’s gotta be a trip. You wake up 
                        and have no clue you’re this huge 
                        celebrity. When did you find out? 
                        You see your face on the side of a 
                        bus?

           GABI smiles, kind of confused.

                                 GABI
                        I mean, I found out I guess how 
                        anyone would.
                         (how?)
                        People told me.

           RADIO HOST squints her eyes at GABI.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Which people?

                                 GABI
                        Well, my mom especially. She was 
                        amazing. And then it was just a lot 
                        of... physical therapy. And therapy 
                        therapy. Watching hours of home 
                        videos. And eventually, things 
                        started to come back.

           GABI glances over at LEX behind the glass, who is trying to 
           conceal her nerves. LEX doesn’t like being separated by this  
           wall from her daughter.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        And now that things are back, are 
                        you writing again? Working with any 
                        of your old collaborators? Or are 
                        you going in a different direction?

           GABI squirms, but she has an answer prepared for this.

                                 GABI
                        Right now what matters most is 
                        reconnecting with the community. As 
                        far as new stuff... we’ll have to 
                        wait and see.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Got it.
                         (to the mic)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
                        Now even if you can’t make it to 
                        Gabi’s upcoming show in LA, you’re 
                        gonna get a chance to chat with 
                        her. We’re taking questions from 
                        listeners here starting now - 

           RADIO HOST taps a flashing button and smiles big.

                                 RADIO HOST (CONT’D)
                        Caller Number One, you are on with 
                        Gabi.

           An excited, almost breathless CALLER #1 comes on the line.

                                 CALLER #1 (V.O.)
                        Gabi, I love you so much, I just 
                        wanted you to know I am so happy 
                        you’re okay and showing people what 
                        it’s like to be a fighter. I was in 
                        an ATV crash and still have neck 
                        pain - and I just think you’re 
                        amazing for coming back, we’ve 
                        missed you so much.

                                 GABI
                        Thank you. I feel stronger than 
                        I’ve felt in a long time and I 
                        can’t wait to see you out there.

                                 CALLER #1
                        You’re amazing, thank you!

           RADIO HOST hangs up the call. GABI glances back at LEX behind 
           the glass - who gives an encouraging smile. 

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Let’s see who else we’ve got.

           RADIO HOST clicks another flashing red button.

                                 RADIO HOST (CONT’D)
                        You’re on with Gabi.

           CALLER #2 has a sweet, soft voice.

                                 CALLER #2 (V.O.)
                        Hi Gabi.

                                 GABI
                        Hey there.

                                 CALLER #2 (V.O.)
                        I’m so excited I’m getting to talk 
                        to you.

                                 GABI
                        Well me too.
           A little beat. GABI is patient. RADIO HOST is not.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        You got a question, hon?

                                 CALLER #2 (V.O.)
                        Gabi, you’ve always had the most 
                        amazing skin. What’s your secret?

           GABI’s surprised at this, almost embarrassed.

                                 GABI
                        Oh god, you know I don’t know. I 
                        try to drink a lot of water. But 
                        believe me I’ve had plenty of bad 
                        break outs.

           CALLER #2 laughs.

                                 CALLER #2 (V.O.)
                        Water. Okay got it. There’s one 
                        other thing.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah?

                                 RADIO CALLER #2 (V.O.)
                        Well, I just wanted to say. I went 
                        through a really hard time when I 
                        was in tenth grade. My sister died.

           GABI’s face twitches a bit. She doesn’t respond.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        So sorry to hear that.

                                 CALLER #2
                        I know you went through that too. 
                        With your sister.

           GABI nods, listening.

                                 CALLER #2 (CONT’D)
                        And I wanted to know... How did 
                        you..? Get through it?

           GABI clears her throat.

                                 GABI
                        I’m sorry. 
                         (then)
                        I think it’s just time. Time can 
                        fix a lot. That’s how it’s been for 
                        me. I’m sorry though. I wish water 
                        could be the trick for that too.
                                 CALLER #2 (V.O.)
                        Yeah, that’d be good.

           GABI nods, not thinking that CALLER #2 can’t see her. RADIO 
           HOST keeps it neutral -

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Thanks so much, Caller - and good 
                        luck. I think we’ve got time for 
                        one more.

           RADIO HOST hangs up the call and clicks the new blinking 
           light abruptly.

                                 RADIO HOST (CONT’D)
                        Hey there, you’re on with Gabi.

           RADIO HOST gives GABI an encouraging nod. GABI tries to perk 
           up and sound cheerful, but the call has clearly dampened her.

                                 GABI
                        Hey there. Thanks for calling in.

           There’s some STATIC over the line for a moment. Then a VOICE 
           comes on. CALLER #3 is an OLDER MAN, with a gruff voice. It’s 
           surprising after the previous callers.

                                 CALLER #3 (V.O.)
                        Phoning in.

                                 GABI
                        Right, thanks for phoning.

                                 CALLER #3 (V.O.)
                        Phoning it in.

           GABI looks at RADIO HOST, confused.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        What’s that now, bud?

                                 CALLER #3 (V.O.)
                        You’re not even trying.

                                 GABI
                         (hesitating)
                        Sorry, I -

                                 CALLER #3 (V.O.)
                        This isn’t Gabi.

           Now GABI looks back to LEX, who watches with confusion and 
           concern. RADIO HOST has a gleam in her eye. She loves this 
           weirdness for her show. And we can tell she’s getting 
           pleasure out of GABI’s discomfort.
                                 RADIO HOST
                        You’re not Gabi. This is Gabi right 
                        here across from me in the studio.

           We hear the breath of CALLER #3. GABI sits up, listening to 
           it. Almost like she can recognize it.

                                 RADIO HOST (CONT’D)
                        Caller? Or should I call you Not 
                        Gabi? Was there something you 
                        wanted to ask while you’ve got the 
                        real Gabi?

                                 CALLER #3 (V.O.)
                        Well.
                         (then, hard)
                        She’s not Gabi.

           We hear the click as he HANGS UP. 

           RADIO HOST shrugs with a smile at GABI. A light flashes red, 
           and RADIO HOST clicks it, but we move in on GABI - uneasy.

           INT. LEX’S CAR - DAY

           LEX drives, GABI sits beside her with a BIG BOUQUET OF 
           FLOWERS laid across her lap that she picks at. LEX tries to 
           encourage her.

                                 LEX
                        You were so gracious, so sweet, so 
                        cool and collected. Really, baby.

                                 GABI
                        She asked a lot about my new look. 
                        I think she was staring at my ear -

           GABI puts her hand up to her left ear, covered by her hair.

                                 LEX
                         (reflexive, instant)
                        You can’t see it. At all. And you 
                        had headphones on.

           GABI nods. Okay.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        You’re just wearing your hair 
                        different these days, baby.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah.

                                 LEX
                        It’s been growing back so healthy.
                                 GABI
                        Yeah.

                    GABI (CONT'D)
                                                    LEX
               (hesitantly)
                                           (talking over her)
           What about that caller guy?  
           I thought they screened -
                                         You know it’s just like your 
                                         Nana always used to say.

                                 GABI
                        No -

           But LEX talks louder than GABI.

                                 LEX
                        She always said after the chemo was 
                        the best her hair ever looked. She 
                        said she was like a new person.

           GABI shakes her head and sighs.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah she did say that a lot.

                                 LEX
                        I think she liked to find the 
                        positive in a situation.
                         (then)
                        Too bad your father didn’t get any 
                        of that.

                                 GABI
                        Mom -

                                 LEX
                        Well, I never saw any positivity at 
                        the hospital when - in fact, I 
                        don’t recall seeing him in any way 
                        while you were lying there -

           LEX takes a sharp breath, catching herself.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

                                 GABI
                        It’s okay.

           LEX throws a look at GABI, seeing she’s still bothered. LEX 
           tries to reassure her.

                                 LEX
                        The station probably has people 
                        they pay to ask questions and stir 
                        up drama. I mean, what exactly was 
                        that guy trying to say? That you’re 
                        an impersonator?
                                 GABI
                        Maybe.

                                 LEX
                        So next stop Hollywood Boulevard? 
                        You can set up next to the Captain 
                        Jack Sparrows.

           It’s LEX’s way of trying to lighten things up, but GABI is 
           still puzzled.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 GABI
                        No, I just... I guess maybe it’s 
                        more that... 

           Now GABI turns to look at LEX. Trying to find the words to 
           say what’s really bothering her.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t expecting anyone to ask 
                        about Evie. Were you?

           Silence. There’s a flash of real anguish on LEX’s face. She 
           reaches across to GABI and takes her hand, but looks straight 
           ahead, away from her daughter. 

           GABI watches her mom - and guilt overcomes her.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.
                         (then, an offering)
                        You know, it was pretty cold in 
                        there.

           LEX nods.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad we brought a sweater.

                                 LEX
                        Yeah. Radio stations really crank 
                        up the AC.

           LEX gives GABI’s hand a squeeze. Grateful to her daughter for 
           giving her the little win.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           GABI and LEX walk into the beautiful MID-CENTURY house in the 
           HILLS. GABI awkwardly holds the bouquet of flowers, as LEX 
           looks through the mail in her hands, discarding most. Until 
           she gets to ONE PIECE that clearly AFFECTS her. GABI sees.
                                 GABI
                        What is it?

           LEX shakes her head and smiles up at GABI.

                                 LEX
                        It’s all good.

           She tucks the mail under her arm and gives GABI a kiss.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Later. 

           GABI stands by the GRAND PIANO, singing one of her SONGS: 
           “DOUBLE DOWN”. She works with SINGING COACH, who plays the 
           piano. The song is CLEARLY POP but to the piano, it’s 
           stripped bare and really pretty. GABI is really, really good.

           From the doorway, LEX watches. She looks at peace, proud of 
           her daughter. The song is going really well - until GABI and 
           SINGING COACH approach a note that GABI doesn’t QUITE REACH.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        And there...
                         (singing the note)
                        There, there, meet me here, meet me 
                        here!

           GABI reaches for the note - and doesn’t get there.

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        Mhmm. It’s just that pesky F. Flat.

                                 GABI
                        Why’d I put it in if I can’t even 
                        reach it?

           GABI, frustrated, tries again, sliding up from a lower note. 
           But it doesn’t work.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Can we try again?

           SINGING COACH starts to play the song again.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Hours later. 

           It’s dark now, but GABI paces by the piano.  She’s still 
           practicing singing the song. LEX comes down the stairs and 
           sees GABI working in the near dark.

           She switches a light on and comes towards GABI.
                                 LEX
                        You’re allowed to rest, you know.

           LEX sits down on the piano bench.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s a lot. Getting back out 
                        there. We’ve gotten to be little 
                        hermits the last few years.

           GABI smiles at this, amused. LEX sees the smile.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 GABI
                        Hermits.
                         (off LEX)
                        Hermit crabs. The only pet we were 
                        ever allowed to have.

           This nearly melts LEX - it’s a touching memory to her.

                                 LEX
                        Cape Cod.

                                 GABI
                        I remember that. Digging in the 
                        sand. Building houses for them. 
                        Thinking we were saving them.

                                 LEX
                        You built them really nice houses.

           GABI smiles, but it’s sad.

                                 GABI
                        I think they only lived for about a 
                        day once we took them home. They 
                        would’ve been better left alone. 

                                 LEX
                         (dead pan)
                        Well that’s why you weren’t allowed 
                        to have a dog.

           GABI can’t help a smile spreading at LEX’s jab. LEX smiles 
           back, with a little nudge. Then she moves forward, careful.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        We could stay hermit crabs, you 
                        know. We don’t have to go back to 
                        it all.

           GABI looks up at her mom, with more determination than we’ve 
           seen. She seems sure of herself for a moment.
                                 GABI
                        I want to start my life again.

                                 LEX
                        Good, baby. I think you’re ready.

                                 GABI
                        Just -

           She stops herself.

                                 LEX
                        What?

                                 GABI
                        I wish I could remember more. How 
                        to do this. 

                                 LEX
                        I know. But I’m here. I can 
                        remember for you.
                         (then, really inquiring)
                        I know your headaches have mostly 
                        eased up. But... have you been 
                        feeling again like you’re 
                        forgetting things? New things?

                                 GABI
                        I don’t think so. Just -

                                 LEX
                        Just from before the crash.
                         (off GABI’s nod)
                        It’ll keep coming back. Things will 
                        come back. Hey, like the hermit 
                        crabs. You remember them. We’ll 
                        keep filling in.

           GABI nods and sits down next to LEX, wanting to believe it’s 
           true. She touches the keys of the piano lightly.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        It’s a perfectly natural side 
                        effect of the trauma.

           GABI doesn’t respond. LEX looks at GABI’s hands on the white 
           keys of the piano.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        That too. That’ll come back too.

           GABI holds down a note on the piano. She hums the note. Then 
           keeps humming. A few simple notes. 

           A little tune. 

           It’s simple and sweet. LEX listens, trying to place it.
                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

           GABI pulls her finger off the key.

                                 GABI
                        I’m not sure. It’s been stuck in my 
                        head. You don’t recognize it?

           LEX shakes her head, no.

                                 LEX
                        But it’s pretty, baby.

           INT. PRIVATE GYM - DAY

           The next day. GABI and LEX work out with a PERSONAL TRAINER. 
           PEOPLE all around eye them. They recognize GABI.

           EXT. PRIVATE GYM - DAY

           GABI and LEX walk to their car. A FITNESS GIRL comes up to 
           them in the parking lot.

                                 FITNESS GIRL
                        I’m so sorry. Seriously. But, do 
                        you think I could get a photo?

           GABI smiles.

                                 GABI
                        Sure.

           GABI and the FITNESS GIRL pose for a selfie together. GABI 
           moves her hair to block her scar. LEX hands her a pair of 
           sunglasses and she puts them on.

                                 FITNESS GIRL
                        Ugh thank you. I literally got my 
                        assistant to get up at four AM to 
                        get me tickets to your show. I’m so 
                        excited.

                                 LEX
                        We can’t wait to see you there.

           LEX leads GABI away. 

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           GABI practices with SINGING COACH. The doorbell rings - and 
           SINGING COACH and GABI stop working at the sound of it. But 
           LEX swoops in from the kitchen - waving them back to work.
                                 LEX
                        You keep at it.

           SINGING COACH starts playing the piano again.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        Okay let’s try humming through that 
                        verse one more time.

           GABI hums along as LEX opens the door. We see CLEARLY:

           A POLICEMAN. LEX steps outside to speak to him.

           GABI keeps singing, but her EYES ARE GLUED TO THE DOOR. After 
           a moment, LEX comes back inside. GABI stops singing.

                                 GABI
                        Everything okay?

           LEX smiles warmly at her. Giving nothing away.

                                 LEX
                        Perfect.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Later. The singing lesson is over. GABI, anxious, comes into 
           the kitchen to find LEX. 

                                 GABI
                        Who was at the door before?

                                 LEX
                        It was nobody.

                                 GABI
                        Who’s nobody?

                                 LEX
                        Baby, there’s some stuff you can 
                        let me handle. Okay? 

           LEX is wound up a little tight. And her tone is very 
           different than the night before. More LEX as a MANAGER, less 
           as a doting mother. But GABI doesn’t budge. She stares.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Okay. You want to know?
                         (with a sigh)
                        It’s been eighteen months.

           GABI knows immediately what LEX is saying. Even if we don’t.
                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Parole is up. I got a letter a few 
                        days ago. The police came to check 
                        in, to make sure we knew.

           GABI is shaken, worried by the news.

                                 GABI
                        Why didn’t you tell me before?

                                 LEX
                        Because you’re safe here, honey. 
                        And I didn’t want to pile on.

                                 GABI
                        Are we sure our address isn’t out 
                        again...? Could someone get in? Or -
                        is all that going to happen again? 

                                 LEX
                         (stern reassurance)
                        No. Okay? No. You need to let me 
                        handle this stuff. You focus on 
                        you. On performing.

           GABI takes it in.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to let anyone near 
                        you. Ever. Okay?

                                 GABI
                        Okay.

           LEX gives a little final smile, pleased GABI is subdued.

                                 LEX
                        Good, baby.

           LEX is ready to change the subject.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        How about I get started on some 
                        dinner?

           GABI looks to her.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah.

                                 LEX
                        Yeah? There’s some salmon I can 
                        throw on -

                                 GABI
                        Could we go out?
           LEX is surprised by this.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I think I want Mexican.

           We can see on LEX’s face that this is not a usual suggestion 
           from GABI.

                                 LEX
                         (thrown)
                        Mexican?

                                 GABI
                        Yeah, what was that place we used 
                        to go? With those big leather 
                        booths? There’s the back area? It’s 
                        in Hollywood, I think.

           GABI reaches for her laptop and starts looking stuff up. LEX 
           watches, confused. GABI scrolls, looking for the place...

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. EL MITOTE - NIGHT

           GABI and LEX sit in a big red leather booth, a bowl of salsa 
           and a giant basket of chips between them. The restaurant is 
           kitschy in the absolute best way. Low-hanging pendant lights, 
           murals on the walls.

           GABI munches on the chips. LEX peruses the menu, very 
           skeptical. It’s new and unwelcome to her.

           At the booth NEXT TO THEM, a COUPLE whispers. The WOMAN turns 
           her head to look at GABI, trying to look sly. Then quickly 
           turns back. The MAN smiles like, “See?”

           GABI sees them and shrinks into herself.

           INT. EL MITOTE - BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT

           GABI finishes peeing, gets up, and gets a head rush.

           INT. EL MITOTE - BATHROOM SINKS - NIGHT

           GABI washes her hands at a row of sinks and dries them. She 
           reaches into her purse and pulls out a chapstick.

           But when she looks up to put it on, she’s not there. After 
           the initial shock, she realizes there’s no mirror at the 
           sinks. We REALIZE that her part of the bathroom is only HALF 
           OF THE BATHROOM. There are two identical sides, with two rows 
           of sinks in the middle facing each other. GABI is standing on 
           one side of a perfectly mirrored room.
           She smiles. It’s a pleasantly disorienting feeling. She walks 
           around the row of sinks to the other side - just to confirm 
           the sensation. Then puts her chapstick away.

           INT. EL MITOTE - NIGHT

           GABI walks back to her table, but gets stuck behind a WAITER 
           putting TWO GIGANTIC MARGARITAS down on a table. She waits 
           patiently, when a FLASH goes off. An EMBARRASSED WOMAN 
           standing nearby shoves her phone in her bag and walks quickly 
           away from GABI. A clandestine CELEBRITY PHOTO OPP gone wrong.

           GABI is left feeling exposed and awkward. She looks over to 
           the nearest booth and almost like an AUTOMATIC REFLEX, she 
           SPURTS OUT -

                                 GABI
                        Julie?

           GABI is staring at JULIE, 30, long dark hair, no make-up, in 
           a comfy sweater and a leather jacket. 

           JULIE is sharp, quick. But with a directness about her that 
           can be either completely amazing or totally hurtful. The kind 
           of person who would actually tell you if a dress looked bad 
           on you. Even if you didn’t ask. 

           JULIE’s eyes move up to GABI at the sound of her name. At the 
           sight of GABI, there’s a shift to JULIE. Tiny, but JULIE’s 
           eyes go DARK and her jaw LOCKS. Almost like for a split 
           second she’s sick to her stomach. 

           JULIE sits next to a BEAUTIFUL BLONDE, but in this moment, 
           her eyes are entirely glued to GABI. She seems entirely lost 
           for words. GABI tries again.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Julie.

           JULIE snaps to action. She plasters a smile on, but there’s 
           something behind it. Something that’s not a smile.

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi. I - for a second, I didn’t 
                        recognize you.

           JULIE can see GABI is a little stung by this.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You look healthy.

           Almost as though JULIE is just remembering the BEAUTIFUL 
           BLONDE next to her, she turns and shifts towards her.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        This is Nya.
           NYA smiles at GABI.

                                 NYA
                        I’m a big fan. Really good to meet 
                        you.

                                 GABI
                        Oh thanks. You too. Good to meet 
                        you too.
                         (to JULIE)
                        You know, I’ve been - I feel like -
                         (awkward, trying)
                        How - or, what’ve you been up to?

           JULIE is unmistakably guarded.

                                 JULIE
                        Same, really. Writing. Recording.

                                 GABI
                        That’s great.

           JULIE just nods. She’s not giving GABI anything to work with, 
           even though GABI is clearly trying. Resigned -

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt 
                        your dinner. 

                                 NYA
                         (jumping in, sweet)
                        That’s totally fine. This is kind 
                        of amazing you guys running into 
                        each other, right?

           GABI is grateful for NYA’s good manners.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah, it is. 
                         (then, friendly)
                        Julie wrote all my best songs, you 
                        know.

           NYA smiles and nudges JULIE intimately. 

                                 NYA
                        She’s kinda talented.

                                 GABI
                         (agreeing)
                        I’d still be singing Rodeos in 
                        Tucson if it weren’t for her.

           Now JULIE looks up.
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                         (a little emboldened)
                        You know, I was actually just 
                        watching a few old videos. I think 
                        I found the first time I sang 
                        “Double Down.”

                                 NYA
                        God, you guys go back forever. I’d 
                        love to know what high school Julie 
                        was like.

           But JULIE shakes her head.

                                 JULIE
                        Just me with a worse haircut.

           There’s something about her tone that’s final. And with that, 
           JULIE leans back and puts her arm around NYA’s waist, pulling 
           her in. It’s brief - and small - but a flash in GABI’s eyes 
           tells us unmistakably that seeing this little gesture of 
           intimacy... It stings.

                                 GABI
                        I’ll stop... hovering. Sorry. It 
                        was good to see you.
                         (to NYA)
                        It was really nice to meet you.

                                 NYA
                         (with a warm smile)
                        You too.

           GABI turns to go, then turns back, awkward.

                                 GABI
                        The enchiladas are really good.

           JULIE doesn’t skip a beat.

                                 JULIE
                        They’re the best.

           GABI nods.

                                 GABI
                        See you around.

           GABI heads off, walking back through the dark restaurant to 
           her booth with LEX. LEX finishes signing the check and grabs 
           her bag to scoot out. But when she looks at GABI she sees her 
           daughter’s in a different mood.

                                 LEX
                        Good?
           INT. LEX’S CAR - NIGHT

           Quiet as the car moves smoothly up into the Hollywood Hills. 
           LEX glances at GABI.

                                 LEX
                        She was just a few tables over?

           GABI nods.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        How weird.

           GABI nods again.

                                  GABI
                        I think she was the one who used to 
                        take me there. To that restaurant. 
                        But I’m not totally sure...

           LEX takes GABI’s hand in hers.

                                 LEX
                        People grow apart all the time, 
                        honey.

           GABI looks out the window. We’re on GABI’s face as the lights 
           in the hills bounce back at her.

                                 LEX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And I bet it was Julie that took 
                        you there. The food was gross.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Later that night.

           GABI lies in bed with her computer on her stomach. She types 
           her name into Google.

           Gabi Orvan 

           And a ton of suggestions come up:

           Gabi Orvan... 2020

                     ... songs

                     ... net worth

                     ... boyfriend

                     ... stalker

                     ... sister
                     ... car crash

           And -

                     ... dead

           But she doesn’t click any.

           Instead, she reopens that file of VIDEOS. 

           She clicks on one: 

           It’s a video from a LOW RENT BATTLE OF THE BANDS. TEEN GABI 
           sings on stage and next to her, there’s a SULKY LOOKING 
           GUITAR PLATER. It’s TEEN JULIE.

           And with the sound on, we recognize an early version of 
           “Double Down”.

           GABI watches the video, a little bit of peace coming over her 
           at the sight of it.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           The next day.

           SINGING COACH and GABI work on “Double Down” again. GABI goes 
           for that same HIGH NOTE -

           But it comes out totally flat. GABI stops singing, abruptly.

                                 GABI
                        I can’t do this.

           SINGING COACH nods, agreeing. Plainly.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        It’s too high for you.

           GABI braces herself to be told how absolutely shit she is. 
           But SINGING COACH just smiles and plays a few notes.

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        So fuck it.

           GABI smiles at this unexpected turn.

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        How about...

           SINGING COACH plays back the same part of the song. But ends 
           on an unexpected C Sharp instead of the F. Lower. Easier. But 
           it still sounds pretty good.
                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        Wanna try?

           GABI sings along to the piano. Again, really strong. She ends 
           on the new note. SINGING COACH smiles, proud of how good it 
           sounds. GABI looks relieved. But -

                                 GABI
                        Can I do that? Just change it?

           SINGING COACH laughs as she shuts the music book.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        It’s your song, you sing it how you 
                        want to sing it.

           But GABI doesn’t look convinced. SINGING COACH sighs -

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        Singing is so painfully about our 
                        heads. You know how much our minds 
                        can sabotage us? How much they can 
                        trick us? Make us think we can’t 
                        reach a note? Make us think we 
                        don’t know how to do it? Half of 
                        singing is just not letting those 
                        thoughts win.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           GABI stands in front of the full-length mirror in her room, 
           studying herself with cold objectivity. She plasters on a 
           big, fake smile - and practices.

                                 GABI
                        Thanks so much, LA!

           In the silence of her bedroom, it’s weird. Flat.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I missed you LA!
                         (then)
                        Thank you for the -

           She looks at herself, dissatisfied.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                         (defeated)
                        Yeah.

           GABI looks into the mirror and something catches her eye. A 
           little imperfection in the glass. She sees there is a barely 
           perceptible PLASTIC COVERING still stuck to it. She peels it 
           off the big, full-length mirror. The glass below is shiny.
           But GABI still looks dissatisfied with what she sees. She 
           picks up her PHONE and looks for a name.

           JULIE.

           She stares at it a moment. Hesitates. Then calls.

           It rings. And JULIE picks up. It’s LOUD on the line.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Hey - hello?

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Gabi?

                                 GABI
                        Yeah -

           The phone HANGS UP.  GABI sits, confused. But a moment later, 
           JULIE calls. Now it’s quiet on her end. But JULIE is rushed -

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        What’s going on?

                                 GABI
                        Oh, hey. Just calling to say hi.

           There’s silence for a beat. GABI bites her lip. Thinking.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to ask you something.
                         (then)
                        It’s about Double Down. The song.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        I know the song.

                                 GABI
                        I know. Sorry.

           JULIE waits again.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I was wondering if you would mind 
                        if I changed something in it? Just 
                        for now. Just change a few notes.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Why would I mind that? What? You 
                        can do whatever you want with it.

                                 GABI
                        Okay. Cool.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Okay, is that it?
                                 GABI
                        Well. I was also wondering. Are you 
                        busy tomorrow?

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 GABI
                        I don’t know if you’re busy.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

           GABI is visibly disappointed. But tries to sound cheerful.

                                 GABI
                        Right. Yeah, that makes sense. 
                        Tomorrow is soon. It’s like one 
                        day’s notice. Less, really. Sorry. 
                        Sorry I should have called earlier.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        It’s fine.

                                 GABI
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        It’s fine.

           GABI tries to be conversational. It doesn’t work.

                                 GABI
                        So like... It was so good to see 
                        you the other night. And -
                         (voice tightening)
                        Nera seems really nice.

                                 JULIE
                         (correcting)
                        Nya.

                                 GABI
                        Oh, sorry, it was loud in there.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Look I think I need to go back 
                        inside though.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah. Of course. Yes.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Okay.

           But before JULIE can hang up -
                                 GABI
                        It’s just, it’s my first show back 
                        tomorrow. I haven’t performed since 
                        the whole - since the accident - 
                        and, so. Yeah, it’s the first show.

           Silence.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Do you think I can do it?

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Do I think you can... medically?

                                 GABI
                        The doctors said I’m doing well and 
                        my mom thinks it’s a good -

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        I think they probably know best.

                                 GABI
                        But I think you also know best.

           Beat.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        You’ll do great. 
                         (then)
                        It’s you.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Okay.

                                 GABI
                        Okay. Thanks. Thank you.

           Another beat. Then, curiosity getting the better of her -

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        What are you changing in Double 
                        Down?

           GABI can’t help take her interest as encouragement, but she’s 
           also embarrassed.

                                 GABI
                        Oh just, a note. It’s just been a 
                        little hard to get to.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        That F in the chorus?

           GABI nods. JULIE acknowledges with a huff.
                                 GABI
                        What?

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Nothing.

                                 GABI
                        No, what?

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        No, it’s a hard note. I get it.

                                 GABI
                        But it was never hard for me 
                        before. That’s what you’re 
                        thinking.

           A pause.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

           GABI takes it in. That’s what’s been weighing on her too.

                                 JULIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’ll do great. You always do.
                         (then)
                        I’ve gotta go.

                                 GABI
                        Okay.

           But JULIE doesn’t hang up. They stay on the line. GABI can 
           feel JULIE there. 

           It’s the most intimate moment of the call. They both breathe. 

           A smile flickers on GABI’s face, just knowing JULIE is there - 
           that neither of them is hanging up.

           GABI lies down with the phone to her ear. The comfort it’s 
           bringing her is obvious. She looks supported, relaxed - as 
           though someone were really there holding her, arms wrapped 
           around her tight.

           GABI’s eyes start to close, when JULIE speaks -

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry.

           The phone hangs up. GABI’s eyes open. She lies still for a 
           moment, but she’s interrupted by the sound of HARD FOOTSTEPS 
           and her mom’s FLUSTERED VOICE passing by her bedroom door -

                                 LEX (O.S.)
                        ... No, please. Reasonably, there 
                        is a way to work this out, I...
           But her voice FADES AWAY as she passes the door.

           GABI sits up. Concerned. Curious.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           GABI snakes around the corner of the Hallway, towards LEX’s 
           room, where the door is cracked. She looks through at LEX on 
           the phone -

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - LEX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           LEX bites her thumbnail, phone to her ear, STRESSED.

                                 LEX
                         (into the phone)
                        And that payment was good to the 
                        end of the month.
                         (listening)
                        No, it was transferred to the lower 
                        interest account after the deferred 
                        payment. There are going to be big 
                        advances coming after this week and 
                        that’s what I’ve been saying -

           But LEX stops herself, STARTLED, as she sees GABI lurking in 
           the doorway. Quickly, LEX covers. Adjusting her expression. 

           A false calm.

           She tilts the phone away from her mouth and pulls a face like 
           she’s talking to someone crazy.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                         (into the phone, with a 
                          new casual tone)
                        Can you give me one second?

           She hits MUTE on the call and walks towards GABI.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        What’re you still doing up, baby? 
                        You should be asleep.

                                 GABI
                        I’m just not tired yet.

           LEX nods and walks over to her side table. She pulls out a 
           BOTTLE, snaps a TABLET in half, and brings it over to GABI.

                                 LEX
                        Just a half. You’ve gotta get a 
                        good night sleep tonight, baby. 
                        It’s a big day tomorrow.
           GABI takes the pill in her palm. But LEX keeps her eyes on 
           GABI until she swallows it. LEX smiles and gives her a kiss.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight, baby.

           GABI gives LEX a little smile.

                                 GABI (PRELAP)
                        Ha - Ha - Ha - Ha!

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           STAGE HANDS buzz around, PAs talk into WALKIES. 

           GABI does vocal warm-ups with SINGING COACH. LEX stands with 
           them, texting, glancing up at GABI intermittently. Keeping 
           watch on her. 

           IT’S THE NIGHT OF GABI’S CONCERT. 

           And the show is clearly coming up soon. NERVOUS JITTERS are 
           everywhere. Lots of energy and excitement. It feels BIG.

           GABI is in HEAVY STAGE MAKE UP and a TIGHT, somewhat sexy 
           outfit. It doesn’t look quite right.

           A round of CHEERS from the UNSEEN AUDIENCE beyond the 
           curtain. GABI and SINGING COACH exchange jittery smiles. LEX 
           looks up from her phone.

                                 LEX
                        I’m gonna run up front and see how 
                        we’re doing.

           GABI gives LEX a nervous little smile.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Back in two secs.

           She heads off. And GABI turns to SINGING COACH.

                                 GABI
                        You know, I actually thought no one 
                        was gonna come.

           SINGING COACH smiles at this sweet, modest thought.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        It’s just... All those people knew 
                        Gabi. Me. Then. And now...

           GABI cranes her neck towards the sound of the CROWD and 
           absentmindedly starts SINGING a little TUNE under her breath,  
           patting her thighs to the beat. It’s THAT SAME LITTLE TUNE 
           she was humming with LEX earlier. The one she couldn’t place.
           SINGING COACH notices.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        That’s pretty, is it one of yours?

           GABI didn’t even notice she was singing.

                                 GABI
                        Oh, no. I don’t know actually. It’s 
                        just been stuck in my head.
                         (with a smile)
                        It’s sort of been driving me crazy. 
                        I can’t place it.

           GABI lets out a self-deprecating laugh.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Just another thing I can’t place.

           SINGING COACH looks at GABI with admiration. This girl’s been 
           through a fucking crazy amount to get here.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        You know it’s amazing to everyone 
                        how hard you’ve worked. How far 
                        you’ve come. When we met... Well, 
                        you sound incredible now.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah. Thank you. I guess that’s 
                        right?
                         (then, suddenly)
                        You know I was in a coma? For 
                        like... months?

           Now SINGING COACH is taken aback. But she goes with it.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        I remember. Your mom told me.

                                 GABI
                        Induced. Because of the swelling in 
                        my brain.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        Thank god for modern medicine.

           GABI smiles at this thought.

                                 GABI
                        I also broke my jaw. And fractured 
                        my skull. And my ear got cut off. 
                        They rebuilt it.

           GABI’s hand instinctively, lightly, reaches up to her ear, 
           where hair covers the left side.
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        And a bunch of my teeth got knocked 
                        out.

           SINGING COACH is clearly unsettled. She tries to nod along, 
           in praise of modern medicine. But it’s getting weird. CREW 
           still walks around them, oblivious to the subject matter of 
           their conversation.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        My mom found a really good dentist.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        They look real.

                                 GABI
                        Thanks.
                         (but)
                        Sometimes I suddenly get this panic 
                        like woah where are my teeth! I 
                        think before the accident I always 
                        knew there would be teeth there if 
                        I opened my mouth. But I guess it’s 
                        hard to remember a feeling?

           SINGING COACH takes it in. 

                                 SINGING COACH
                        You know, it’s all this stuff that 
                        makes you stronger, not weaker.

                                 GABI
                        People keep saying that. I mostly 
                        just feel pretty exhausted though.

           SINGING COACH thinks for a second. Then takes on a new tone. 
           Matter-of-fact. Powerful.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        Hey, Gabi. You don’t have to 
                        compete with that other girl. That 
                        other Gabi, from before. You don’t.

           This snaps GABI back to SINGING COACH. It’s like SINGING 
           COACH was reading her mind. 

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        You’re you. It’s your show, it’s 
                        your voice.

           SINGING COACH speaks with a lot of conviction and it’s 
           bolstering GABI. Without thinking, GABI pulls SINGING COACH 
           into a hug. They separate warmly. GABI smiles and rolls her 
           eyes at herself.
                                 GABI
                        Sorry. Thank you. Really. It means 
                        a lot to have someone to talk to. I 
                        mean... I didn’t mean to just talk 
                        to you about my missing teeth for 
                        like an hour. But... thank you.

           SINGING COACH smiles and waves it off. She relaxes a bit.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        Fuck what you think other people 
                        think. And just be you. You’re 
                        gonna kill it. 

           GABI smiles, believing her. SINGING COACH smiles back. A 
           little cheeky look comes over her.

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        And plus, no matter how you do out 
                        there.
                         (almost laughing)
                        It’s great for a dead girl.

           Beat. 

           ...... What? 

                                 GABI
                        What?

                                 SINGING COACH
                         (blank)
                        What?

                                 GABI
                        What do you mean? Dead for a good 
                        girl?

                    SINGING COACH
                                                GABI (CONT'D)
           No -
                                         I mean -
               (then)
                                           (correcting herself)
           Oh -
                                         Good for a dead girl.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        Oh sorry, it was just a joke - I 
                        thought it was obvious.

                                 GABI
                        What do you mean?

                                 SINGING COACH
                         (awkward rambling)
                        It’s just that like, internet 
                        thing? I was kidding. You know, 
                        because of like... you versus old 
                        you... It’s just that... joke thing 
                        about you.
                                 GABI
                        What though?
                         (then)
                        I don’t Google myself.

           Now SINGING COACH really starts to get uncomfortable.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        It’s that whole... conspiracy 
                        theory? It’s dumb.

                                 GABI
                        Which?

           SINGING COACH’s eyes dart around, like she’s looking for 
           someone to save her. She didn’t mean to get into this. Around 
           them, the sound of the AUDIENCE FILLING THE VENUE is growing.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        That you’re...

                                 GABI
                        That I’m what?

           A LIGHT is SHUT OFF BACKSTAGE as the CREW moves around, even 
           faster now. The change startles SINGING COACH, but GABI is 
           focused SOLELY on SINGING COACH’s words.

                                 SINGING COACH
                        That you’re dead.

           They stare at each other in SILENCE.

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                         (trying to clarify)
                        That you’re actually dead.

           It obviously doesn’t help. 

           It makes no sense to us. But something on GABI’s face tells 
           us: it means something to her.

           LIGHTS and SHADOWS cast around in the backstage area as 
           STAGEHANDS make their way bustling about. Purple stage light 
           seeps through the curtains. But in all the flashing lights 
           and shifting shadows - GABI IS STILL.

                                 SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        It’s obviously - it’s just a joke.

           OUT OF THE SHADOWS - we see LEX approach. 

           GABI doesn’t know she’s there yet. She looks like she’s 
           trying to figure something out. SINGING COACH’s words are 
           playing over and over in her head.

           “That you’re dead.”
           But GABI’s reverie is interrupted as LEX places a hand around 
           her waist.

                                 LEX
                        Ready baby?

           INSTANTANEOUSLY - a SMILE appears on GABI’s face. SINGING 
           COACH just looks between them, confused. Alarmed. 

           GABI just puts an even bigger smile on.

                                 GABI
                        Totally.

           LEX leads GABI away from SINGING COACH, who’s left looking 
           guilty and entirely... BEWILDERED.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - STAGE - NIGHT

           Moments later. 

           LOUD CHEERS come from an AUDIENCE that we can barely see in 
           the harsh spotlight shining directly at us on STAGE.

           But there are signs held up and can make out words:

           WE MISS YOU GABI

           GABI SURVIVOR

           GABI 4 LIFE

           The applause SWELLS and it’s time -

           GABI WALKS OUT ONTO THE STAGE.

           She looks beautiful. LIKE A TRUE POP STAR.

           As she heads towards the mic, the CROWD’S APPLAUSE GROWS EVEN 
           GREATER. It’s amazing. They are so excited to see her.

           GABI looks back at her BAND and gives them a little nod - 
           they start the opening CHORDS of “Double Down”. GABI looks 
           out into the audience. The BAND makes its way towards the 
           moment where GABI sings her first line, BUT INSTEAD OF 
           SINGING -

                                 GABI
                        Thank you so much, LA! You guys are 
                        the best!

           As she finishes speaking, we hear a HARSH EXHALING BREATH in 
           the microphone from GABI. It’s weirdly loud.

           The BAND keeps playing. They loop back around to the 
           beginning of the song. 
           But again as they approach her cue... SHE DOESN’T SING.

           The GUITARIST, now really showing his confusion, leads the 
           BAND back and replays the entry to GABI’s first verse.

           And this time, GABI COMES BELTING IN. It’s GREAT. She sings 
           the first lines - poppy, fun, and energetic.

           She even dances a little. Hips swinging, head rocking. It’s 
           really solid. She gets through the verse and hits the chorus 
           with MASSIVE APPLAUSE FROM THE CROWD.

           But JUST AS THEY APPROACH THE DIFFICULT SECTION -

           SHE STOPS SINGING.

           The BAND keeps playing, moving into the next verse. But GABI 
           is... FROZEN.

           She wears a big, bewildered smile - like she doesn’t know how 
           she found herself standing up on stage. Like it’s a JOKE 
           someone is playing on her. The BAND just keeps playing.

           Like a deer in headlights, GABI blinks into the crowd.

           On a sign: GABI LIVES!

           And as the BAND plays behind her, a compulsive and INSANE 
           LAUGHTER erupts from her. It’s isn’t joyful, it’s more in the 
           vein of someone VOMITING EVERYWHERE.

           And she cannot stop.

           The CROWD laughs too at first. This is SO WEIRD. But then... 
           it keeps going. GABI KEEPS LAUGHING. Hysterically. And it 
           becomes less funny and more... freaky. 

           A few AUDIENCE MEMBERS try to CHEER her out of it - but then 
           that fades. And we’re left with her LAUGHTER. A painful quiet 
           from the audience as GABI’s eyes scan the tops of their heads 
           - barely seeing them. UNTIL - 

           GABI turns and walks off the stage. Little WAVES of NERVOUS, 
           UNCONTROLLABLE laughter still coming out of her.

           There is an empty noisiness left with the AUDIENCE and the 
           BAND until we -

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. BLACK CAR - NIGHT

           COMPLETE QUIET.
           GABI stares out the window, all her make up still on. LEX 
           sits next to her, looking out her own window. Fingers just 
           brushing her own lips. 

           In disbelief.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           GABI and LEX walk inside. Neither of them turns lights on. 
           LEX starts to walk upstairs. GABI stops.

                                 GABI
                        I’ve never done that before.

           LEX turns around and looks at her, shaking her head.

                                 LEX
                        No.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           LATER. GABI lies in bed, in the same clothes, the same make 
           up. She’s lit by her computer screen -

           Scouring a FACEBOOK PAGE. It’s called “R.I.P. GABI”

           GABI clicks a VIDEO. It’s of a GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS 
           passionately speaking into a webcam.

                                 GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS
                        Everyone knows, on April 24, 2016, 
                        Gabi Orvan was in a car crash. 
                        Official reports say she left the 
                        hospital months later. But how 
                        could she have left... if on that 
                        day... the REAL Gabi Orvan... was 
                        killed.

           The screen goes black and in pink lettering we see: 

                                R.I.P. GABI ORVAN

                         October 11, 1990 - April 24, 2016.

           GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS continues.

                                 GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS (CONT’D)
                        It doesn’t take a forensic 
                        scientist to see that the “Gabi” 
                        who paparazzi have caught glimpses 
                        of in the past few months is very 
                        clearly NOT Gabi Orvan. And we need 
                        to look at that VERY closely. We’re 
                        going to look at the clearly 
                        constructed face. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to look at how Gabi’s 
                        family has covered up her death for 
                        YEARS. We’re going to look at why. 
                        We’re looking at the EMPIRE OF GABI 
                        and why one MOMAGER would risk it 
                        all just to keep the cash flowing 
                        in -

           GABI pauses it, OVERWHELMED. She takes a beat. Then starts to 
           look through the comments.

           You were an angel and you needed your wings.

           Clearly a diff person.

           Did she have a twin sister or something?

           Ur rotting in hell for ur music.

           Now that they replaced her with a double, can they at least 
           make her sing in tune?

           wat about her fucked up chin?

           Looks like she had a miscarriage.

           GABI looks around the page - her face unreadable. 

           She finds on the page the BUTTONS to: MESSAGE or REPORT the 
           PAGE. She hovers over them - CONSIDERING.

           But then her mouse goes elsewhere...

           To a PHOTO GALLERY on the page. She hesitates.

           And then... CLICKS.

           For the FIRST TIME - we see the FULL-FLEDGED POP STAR THAT 
           WAS: GABI BEFORE THE CRASH. 

           (We’ll call pre-crash GABI OLD GABI.)

           OLD GABI is ELEGANT, CONFIDENT, SHINY. She’s GLAMMED UP in 
           every photo. Her confidence alone DISTINGUISHES HER 
           UNDOUBTEDLY from the GABI before us.

           But more than confidence... there are physical differences. 
           BIG ONES. In the photos, OLD GABI seems all symmetry and 
           graceful lines. But the GABI we see looking at her laptop is 
           not so even. Not so perfect.

           In fact, if you squint, GABI and OLD GABI could be completely 
           different people.

           And. If you don’t squint... 

           They could be completely different people.
           GABI stops at a SELFIE of OLD GABI. OLD GABI has her tongue 
           out (still looking crazy beautiful) and she’s wearing a 
           BRIGHT PINK cast. It makes GABI pause for a moment. Then she 
           keeps clicking.

           GABI goes through photo after photo of OLD GABI. Hungrily. 
           UNABLE TO STOP NOW THAT SHE’S STARTED.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           The next morning.

           GABI still has her make up on from the night before. It’s 
           stage make up, built to last. She walks into the kitchen and 
           finds LEX, chipper, making a smoothie.

                                 LEX
                        ‘Morning, honey.

           GABI is immediately thrown by LEX’s cheerfulness.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                         (casual)
                        You sleep good?

           LEX turns the BLENDER on - it’s LOUD. When it’s done, she 
           grabs two glasses.

                                 GABI
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 LEX
                        Okay, babe. What’s up?

           GABI breathes, trying to bolster herself. Then lets it out. 

                                 GABI
                        I can’t pretend that I can do this. 
                        Because I can’t.

                                 LEX
                        Do what?

           LEX’s tone is extremely bizarre and off-putting - for us and 
           GABI. She’s acting as if the disaster of last night just - 

           Didn’t happen at all.

                                 GABI
                        I don’t remember how to do this. I 
                        don’t remember ever doing it.

                                 LEX
                        I told you. I’m here. To help you -
                                 GABI
                        No. It’s like I’m trying to fit 
                        myself into some... uniform. That 
                        doesn’t belong to me. And it 
                        doesn’t fit.

           This gets LEX’s attention. She looks up, a hint of concern.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I think... I need to figure out who 
                        I am. Who I really am. I think we 
                        both just wanted to move on from 
                        the crash and rush into -

                                 LEX
                        Rush? We did a lot of things. 
                        Rushing was not one of them.

                                 GABI
                        I need to go back and -

           Now LEX gets stern. Really stern.

                                 LEX
                        No. I’m sorry. I’m sorry but, 
                        frankly, you are not the clearest 
                        judge of what is best for you. You 
                        need to live your life and get back 
                        to the real world. Not squirrel 
                        away to dwell on... all that stuff.

                                 GABI
                        The crash.

                                 LEX
                         (now openly frustrated)
                        What about the crash? You were in a 
                        car crash. You nearly died. But you 
                        didn’t. You lived. So now you have 
                        to live.

           LEX stares GABI down. She’s stronger than GABI is. But GABI 
           still tries.

                                 GABI
                        I -

                                 LEX
                        I’m not going to let you crumple up 
                        and quit. And if that means telling 
                        you that you don’t have a choice, 
                        then so be it.

           GABI doesn’t know how to respond - LEX has her genuinely 
           intimidated. GABI looks to the floor.
                                 GABI
                        I think I maybe just need a 
                        break...

           Now LEX softens again. Back to MOM MODE. She pours the 
           smoothie that’s been sitting in the blender into the two 
           glasses. She passes one of the glasses to GABI.

                                 LEX
                        We can figure out something 
                        relaxing to do later.

                                 GABI
                        I think maybe more though...

                                 LEX
                        Well, baby, you’ve got a voice 
                        lesson, so we’ll figure it out 
                        after.

           GABI’s thrown immediately - what?

                        GABI
                                                LEX (CONT'D)
           I -
                                         What?

                                 GABI
                        I can’t do a voice lesson.

                                 LEX
                        Of course you can.

                                 GABI
                        But after last night -

                                 LEX
                        You know what comes after last 
                        night, baby?

           She gives GABI a smile. It’s FINAL.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Everything else in our lives.

           The door bell rings.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        That’s her.

           LEX walks out of the kitchen to get the door. GABI wavers for 
           a second, confused. But she gathers herself and follows LEX -

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           The door swings the door open and NEW SINGING COACH smiles at  
           LEX - and GABI, hovering behind her.
           NEW SINGING COACH looks a lot like SINGING COACH.

                                 NEW SINGING COACH
                        Hi, sorry I’m a few minutes early.

           NEW SINGING COACH catches the eye of the bewildered GABI.

                                 NEW SINGING COACH (CONT’D)
                        So great to meet you, Gabi.

                                 LEX
                        Can we get you anything?

           NEW SINGING COACH turns to LEX.

                                 NEW SINGING COACH
                        Oh, a water would actually be 
                        great, thank you.

                                 LEX
                        Fab.

           LEX heads out of the Foyer, leaving GABI and NEW SINGING 
           COACH together. They look at each other for a moment. Silent. 
           GABI gives a polite nod then follows LEX into the kitchen.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           LEX fills up a glass of water as GABI comes in.

                                 GABI
                        Who..?

                                 LEX
                        I thought it might be time for 
                        something new.
                         (then, a statement of 
                          fact)
                        You agree a change will be good.

           GABI is stunned. LEX cuts a slice of lemon and puts it into 
           the glass of water for NEW SINGING COACH.

           GABI takes the glass, unsure for a moment. Then goes.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           GABI practices with NEW SINGING COACH. Her voice is really 
           shaky. They do breathing exercises.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           That night.
           The lights are all off. GABI sits at the piano, but she’s not 
           practicing. LEX comes downstairs and sees her.

                                 LEX
                        You liked her, right?

           GABI nods. LEX walks over to GABI at the piano bench, 
           standing over her.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Honey. No one is forcing you to do 
                        anything.
                         (then, but)
                        This is all a part of your getting 
                        healthy again. Finding your normal. 
                        Getting back to you.

           GABI looks up at LEX, imploring. Almost begging.

                                 GABI
                        But it’s not me.

                                 LEX
                        I’m gonna need you to stop saying 
                        that, honey. It’s not good for your 
                        confidence.

           LEX pulls her up from the bench, gently. Holding her hand and 
           walking her across the room. She lands with GABI in front of 
           a tall mirror by the door. LEX places GABI in front of it and 
           STANDS BEHIND HER, resting her chin on GABI’s shoulder. She 
           meets GABI’s eyes in the reflection.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Look at that girl. She’s so strong. 
                        She’s worked so hard. She has so 
                        much life left in front of her.

           GABI nods. LEX’s tone takes on a tiny hint of edge.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        And there’s so much I need to 
                        protect her from. Because there’s 
                        so much that’s so scary out there. 
                        But I’m not going to let her stop 
                        just because she’s afraid.
                         (then, almost stern)
                        I’m not going to let her get in her 
                        own way.

           We see LEX’s hand tighten around GABI’s arm. She reaches down 
           GABI’s arm and finds her PHONE in her hand. Without 
           resistance from GABI, SHE TAKES IT.
                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna hold onto this I think. 
                        Remember, too much screen might 
                        give you some more of those nasty 
                        headaches?

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - GABI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Later that night.

           GABI and LEX lie in GABI’s bed watching a movie on GABI’s 
           computer. It’s dark in the room, just the light of the 
           computer. GABI looks dazed. LEX watches the movie peacefully.

           LATER -

           LEX sleeps in GABI’s bed, the computer beside her, dark now. 
           GABI walks out of the room -

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - LEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           GABI comes into her mom’s incredibly neat bedroom. 
           Carefully... she starts looking through LEX’s stuff. Looking 
           for something.

           Her phone? Maybe. Anything.

           She’s trying to stay quiet but she works herself up into a 
           frenzy. She pulls drawers, looks through LEX’s bag. LEX’s 
           bedside tables. LEX’s make up drawers. She even pulls towels 
           out of cabinets.

           Until, she opens a drawer and finds -

           LETTERS. Piles and piles of letters.

           FROM BANKS.

           Overdraft. Past Due. Credit Decrease. Debt Collection. Past 
           Due. Past Due. Overdraft. Default on Loan. 

           Past Due. 

           GABI looks through them, shocked. But her mind is turning. 
           Something is shifting.

           INT. ORVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           It’s dark, quiet. GABI finds the HOUSE PHONE on the kitchen 
           counter. She DIALS A NUMBER off her bright computer screen.

                                 GABI
                         (in a whisper)
                        Hi. I need to order a car.
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS STREET - NIGHT

           It’s the middle of the night. But the sky in LA is ORANGE 
           with pollution and street lights. 

           GABI walks quickly, looking behind her, back to the HOUSE. 
           Nervous as she goes. Her stage make up still on.

           As she walks, she hums, anxious and jittery. It’s THAT SAME 
           TUNE. The one she can’t place.

           HEADLIGHTS of a car flash at her as it turns a corner. For a 
           moment, these lights are even brighter than the lights were 
           on stage. The DRIVER rolls down the window.

                                 DRIVER
                        For Gabi?

           GABI winces into his lights, shielding her eyes. She walks 
           towards the car.

           EXT. JULIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A bungalow on the East Side of LA. GABI walks up to the front 
           door and KNOCKS. 

           JULIE comes to the door. When she sees GABI standing there, 
           her face FALLS. GABI doesn’t know exactly what to say. The 
           silence goes on a beat too long. From inside we hear NYA’s 
           voice -

                                 NYA (O.S.)
                        All good, Jules?

           JULIE blinks.

                                 GABI
                        Can we go somewhere?

           JULIE keeps staring.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I need your help.

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. LA DINER - NIGHT

           JULIE and GABI sit at a brightly lit diner. A LATE NIGHT 
           CROWD around them.

                                 GABI
                        Thank you again. For paying the 
                        driver.
                                 JULIE
                        Why didn’t you just take an Uber?

                                 GABI
                        She took my phone.

           JULIE stares, in disbelief.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. I mean she’s done it before. 

                                 JULIE
                        Jesus.

           GABI shrugs, trying to downplay her worry. It’s an evasive 
           move. And JULIE knows it.

                                 GABI
                        She can be hard to deal with.

           To JULIE this is the most obvious statement in the world.

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah. Your mom is fucking batshit.

           GABI’s shoulders tense up, in another little shrug.

                                 GABI
                        I was thinking maybe I should talk 
                        to my dad. I was hoping maybe you 
                        might be able to take me... bring 
                        me...

                                 JULIE
                        Take you where?
                         (then, realizing)
                        What? To your dad’s?

                                 GABI
                        Yeah.

                                 JULIE
                         (come on)
                        Gabi.

                                 GABI
                        What? 

           They stare at each other.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        You’re the only person I have.

           JULIE is struck by this. Confused by it.
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Or... used to have. Everyone is 
                        gone. It’s just my mom. It’s just 
                        me and her. After the crash, 
                        everyone else who was there... 
                        disappeared.

                                 JULIE
                        Disappeared?

           GABI shrugs again.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Is that what you think happened? 
                        Everyone disappeared?

                                 GABI
                        That is what happened. People just 
                        didn’t know how to act around me. I 
                        get it. I get that it’s hard to be 
                        around someone who doesn’t even 
                        know what their first name is. 
                        But... yeah.

           JULIE doesn’t know what to do with this thought - clearly her 
           mind is turning.

                                 JULIE
                        I can’t take you to your dad’s. I 
                        can’t just drop my life so you can 
                        run away from your mom.
                         (then, seriously)
                        Gabi. You know I have not heard 
                        from you. In four years.

           GABI nods, retreating back into herself. And JULIE’s eyes 
           snap to GABI’s plate, noticing GABI’s just been pushing her 
           food around.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not eating your potatoes.

                                 GABI
                        They have rosemary on them.

                                 JULIE
                        You don’t like rosemary?

                                 GABI
                        It tastes like soap.

           A FLICKER of something across JULIE’s face.
           EXT. EAST SIDE LA - STREET - NIGHT

           JULIE and GABI walk on a quiet, dark block. JULIE holds a to-
           go box from the diner. It’s silent between them. But it’s a 
           strangely easy silence. They turn a corner and as they do -

           GABI FREEZES. 

           She sees an SUV parked on the street outside JULIE’s house. 
           JULIE turns to GABI -

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi, come on -

           But GABI grabs hold of JULIE’s wrist. JULIE looks down at 
           where GABI is touching her. Like it hurts.

                                 GABI
                        That’s her.

           JULIE looks up to where GABI is looking. 

           GABI’s right. It’s LEX. Waiting in a car with the lights off. 

           It’s fucking creepy.

           GABI is visibly tense, almost scared. JULIE is freaked too.

                                 JULIE
                        What is she doing?

           GABI can’t take her eyes off the SUV.

                                 GABI
                        She’s waiting for me.

           JULIE looks between GABI and the PARKED CAR. She’s trying to 
           puzzle out what to do...

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. JULIE’S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           LATER.

           JULIE and GABI drive down a DARK HIGHWAY. They’re clearly out 
           of LA. 

           Desert on either side of them.

           EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

           JULIE gets out of the driver’s seat. GABI gets out of the 
           passenger’s. JULIE pulls out her wallet to fill her tank.
           GABI looks embarrassed.

                                 GABI
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s fine. I think you can get me 
                        back.

           GABI nods. But -

                                 GABI
                        I don’t have a bank account.

           GABI shakes her head, no.

                                 JULIE
                        Who has your money?
                         (then, off GABI)
                        She does? Seriously, all of it?

                                 GABI
                        It’s court ordered.

                                 JULIE
                        But -

           GABI shrugs, helpless. JULIE’s mind turns.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, shit. Because of the 
                        conservance... atorship.

                                 GABI
                        Conservatorship.

                                 JULIE
                         (turning away, frustrated)
                        We’re about to cross state lines. 
                        Oh fuck, I don’t wanna end up in 
                        family court.

                                 GABI
                        I think it would be real court.

           GABI thinks a moment.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t know actually.

                                 JULIE
                        Great.

           The tank fills. JULIE passes GABI her water bottle, annoyed.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You should have some water.
                                 GABI
                        I’m okay.

           JULIE rolls her eyes.

                                 JULIE
                        Jesus Christ.  Would you please 
                        have some water? You ambushed me, I 
                        think you’re making me break the 
                        law, the least you can do is have 
                        some water instead of just standing 
                        there like some deranged, dead-
                        eyed, dehydrated pop star.

           Gabi looks at JULIE. Then at the water. A little smile 
           escapes her. She takes the bottle from JULIE.

           INT. JULIE’S CAR / EXT. PHOENIX CUL DE SAC - DAWN

           The next morning.

           JULIE and GABI sit PARKED in the car on a QUIET CUL DE SAC. 
           Purple morning light hits the bare, rocky mountains in the 
           distance - just NORTH OF PHOENIX, ARIZONA.

           Even with the cookie cutter Phoenix houses in the foreground, 
           it’s beautiful. GABI looks out at the mountains. She’s 
           exhausted, like she’s going to nod off. But more than that... 
           she looks almost at peace. With JULIE. Away from LEX.

                                 GABI
                        Do you ever wish you could go back 
                        to being a kid? We could go back? 

                                 JULIE
                        I thought you didn’t remember being 
                        a kid.

           GABI smiles a little, looking out the window.

                                 GABI
                        I don’t. But I know it happened 
                        with you.

           JULIE looks at GABI as GABI’s eyes close.

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. JULIE’S CAR / EXT. PHOENIX CUL DE SAC - DAY

           HOURS LATER - 

           Everything looks COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. BRIGHT BLINDING WHITE 
           LIGHT. The mountains are WASHED OUT WHITE and ORANGE in the 
           harsh light of day.
           GABI’s eyes fly open and she sits up, disoriented. 

           JULIE is awake next to her. They look at each other.

           EXT. DAD’S HOUSE - DAY

           GABI and JULIE stand on the DOORSTEP of a SWEET HOUSE at the 
           center of the cul de sac.

           From somewhere behind the house, VOICES and SPLASHING WATER 
           fill the air.

           GABI straightens her shirt. And reaches for the doorbell. It 
           buzzes. FOOTSTEPS. And...

           STEP MOM OPENS the DOOR. She’s cute, tidy looking. She also 
           looks... a lot like LEX. Her eyes move from GABI to JULIE and 
           back again.

                                 STEP MOM
                         (confused, not pleased)
                        Gabi!

           EXT. DAD’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           STEP MOM leads JULIE and GABI through a sliding glass door 
           out onto an IMMACULATE GREEN LAWN with a GLISTENING POOL. 

                                 STEP MOM
                        So he’s... I’ve just got a few 
                        things inside I’ve got to...

           STEP MOM goes without finishing her excuse for leaving.

                                 JULIE
                        Forgot about her charm.

           GABI smiles.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        When’s the last time you saw them?

                                 GABI
                        Last year? No. It must have been... 
                        two years ago? I’m not sure 
                        exactly.

           JULIE is clearly surprised by this. 

           GABI and JULIE look out towards the POOL, on the other side 
           of the long lawn. A sturdy, handsome man, DAD, 50s, plays 
           with a LITTLE GIRL, 6, in a blue bathing suit. The sun is 
           behind GABI and JULIE - DAD and LITTLE GIRL don’t see them.
                                 DAD
                        This time, tea party on the bottom.

           LITTLE GIRL nods enthusiastically. Both DAD and LITTLE GIRL 
           let all the breath out of their lungs.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                         (pushing air out)
                        All the way out or we’ll float up.

           They duck under water, sinking to the bottom of the pool. We 
           see their squiggly forms from above. It’s quiet now that DAD 
           and LITTLE GIRL are under water.

                                 JULIE
                        Where’s the oth -

           But she’s interrupted as SOMEONE PUSHES THEM BOTH FROM 
           BEHIND. Running from the house straight towards the pool is 
           SECOND LITTLE GIRL, 6.

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                         (yelling, not looking back 
                          at GABI and JULIE)
                        Sorry!

           SECOND LITTLE GIRL, in a pink bathing suit, CANON BALLS into 
           the pool - DAD, LITTLE GIRL and SECOND LITTLE GIRL all come 
           up for air. The LITTLE GIRLS splash in the pool and DAD 
           watches them. His back still turned to JULIE and GABI, not 
           knowing they’re there.

                                 JULIE
                        Don’t you wanna...?

           She gestures over to the pool. But GABI doesn’t move. JULIE 
           gets it. GABI doesn’t want to interrupt them.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                         (not a compliment)
                        It looks exactly the same.

           GABI doesn’t respond.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                         (skeptical)
                        You want to stay here?

           GABI clearly isn’t sure. JULIE stares out at the adorable 
           family pool party happening. But she’s not impressed.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        How old are those girls now? I feel 
                        like they were just born.

                                 GABI
                        I think three?
           And now JULIE turns to GABI. She can’t help laughing.

                                 JULIE
                        Three? Gabi, they’re not three.

                                 GABI
                        Okay so how old are they?

                                 JULIE
                        I don’t know. Like, twelve? Or...

           Now GABI laughs - and JULIE can’t help smiling again too. 
           It’s a moment of just getting along. Something we haven’t 
           really seen between the two of them. But they fall into it 
           easily once it begins.

                                 GABI
                        You don’t have any idea.

           JULIE shrugs a little smile. But their moment is broken as - 

           SECOND LITTLE GIRL turns and points at GABI and JULIE.

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        Who’re they?

           From the pool, IT’S HARD TO MAKE OUT GABI AND JULIE with the 
           sun behind them. DAD looks up at them, blocking his eyes from 
           the light - squinting.

           A FEW MINUTES LATER -

           GABI sits with her feet in the pool. JULIE very much still 
           wearing her shoes, sitting on a deck chair.

           The LITTLE GIRLS play on their side of the pool, whispering 
           instructions, carrying out a game we don’t understand.

           DAD cleans up TOYS and generally doesn’t stop moving. HE 
           DOESN’T LOOK AT GABI.

                                 DAD
                        Well you look really great, really, 
                        really great, Gabs.

           He remembers JULIE is there.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and you too, Julie. You look 
                        great.

                                 JULIE
                        I’ve gained some weight since I 
                        last saw you.
           DAD is thrown by this, but again, GABI smiles. JULIE is just 
           trying to make DAD squirm.

                                 DAD
                        I’ve been saying to the girls that 
                        it’d be great to get the three of 
                        you together, they love your music, 
                        you know. Really, they idolize you 
                        as a big sister.

           GABI, who is starting to look objectively like absolute shit - 
           lips cracking, foundation splitting - looks down at the 
           LITTLE GIRLS who are paying her absolutely no attention.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        They’re shy.

                                 GABI
                        I’m sorry for coming unannounced.

                                 DAD
                        Oh please, oh please, please. 
                        You’re welcome anytime.
                         (to JULIE)
                        And... you too Julie. You both are.
                         (back to GABI)
                        I know you just don’t get to 
                        Phoenix much these days.
                         (then)
                        But actually, you know, the girls 
                        were telling me you’re having a 
                        concert. Maybe we could come up for 
                        that.

           GABI almost corrects him. But doesn’t. JULIE clocks it.

                                 GABI
                        Sure.

                                 DAD
                        Good. So should we go inside and -

                                 GABI
                        There was actually something I 
                        wanted to ask you.

                                 DAD
                        Oh?

           He sits down in a pool chair. There’s an awkward distance 
           between them so he moves onto the ground to be eye level with 
           GABI. He leans an arm against the pool chair, uncomfortable.

           He looks over at JULIE. Almost like - Am I in trouble?
                                 GABI
                        Lately, or - for a while now... I 
                        have felt a little weird.

           JULIE butts in.

                                 JULIE
                        She means aside from the traumatic 
                        brain injury.

                                 GABI
                        Right. 

                                 DAD
                        Right.

                                 GABI
                        Right. So I’m just trying to figure 
                        some things out about what 
                        happened. After the crash. 

           DAD nods. Confused.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Were you there? At the hospital 
                        afterwards?

           He clears his throat and throws a guilty sort of look towards 
           JULIE. Like he thinks she’s JUDGING HIM.

                                 DAD
                        Oh. Um, well, you know, I was in 
                        Dallas. But I got on a flight as 
                        soon as your mom called me.

                                 GABI
                        Had she already... do you know... 
                        did you see me?

           DAD glances towards the LITTLE GIRLS. He doesn’t want them to 
           hear any of this. But they’re not listening.

                                 DAD
                        No. I didn’t see you until the next 
                        day. You were in surgery.

                                 GABI
                        So she was the only one - Mom? Who 
                        saw me? Right after the crash? Who 
                        told the doctors I was me?

           DAD nods, not getting what she’s driving at but also not 
           caring to get it. JULIE is listening intently too.

                                 DAD
                        Well, yes. She was. And say what 
                        you will about your mom... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAD (CONT'D)
                        but - I don’t know that I could 
                        have done it. She rose to it. She 
                        did.
                         (then, solemn)
                        And it was the worst day of all of 
                        our lives.

                                 GABI
                        What about after surgery? You saw 
                        me then?

           He nods.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        How did I look?

           DAD looks down at the ground.

                                 DAD
                        Well, you looked... 

                                 GABI
                        What?

           JULIE has a sympathetic flash towards DAD, who is floundering 
           badly. He’s clearly back in that moment - and it’s painful.

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi...

                                 DAD
                         (flustered)
                        You didn’t look. You were covered 
                        in blood and bandages. They’d 
                        shaved your head. You were swollen. 
                        You were missing an ear for God’s 
                        sake. You were broken. What is this 
                        about?

                                 GABI
                        I’m just trying to figure out -

           GABI throws a hesitant look to JULIE.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Do you think there is any chance - 
                        if it was just Mom there - that 
                        there might have been a mistake?

           DAD and JULIE both look at her, totally confused.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Just a mistake, and maybe I -

                                 DAD
                        You...?
                                 GABI
                        If bodies were misidentified at the 
                        hospital in the crash. Just a mix 
                        up. And it turned out I wasn’t 
                        actually... Gabi. I was someone 
                        else completely who they just 
                        thought was Gabi. It happens you 
                        know. People get the wrong blood 
                        type in transfusions. People have 
                        the wrong kidney taken out. 
                        Hospitals mix things up. They mix 
                        people up. And like you said, I was 
                        wrecked. So if it was just Mom who 
                        was there to say I was me, then -

                                 JULIE
                        Wait, Gabi -

           But GABI ignores her.

                                 GABI
                         (more casual than it 
                          deserves)
                        I mean it’s possible, I could 
                        really be anyone - 

           DAD looks down, shaking his head. He looks up, face wracked 
           with emotion. And he brings GABI to a total halt -

                                 DAD
                        You’re upset with me.

           Suddenly the dynamic SHIFTS. GABI is thrown at DAD’s sudden 
           GRIEF and REMORSE. So is JULIE.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        I should have stayed with you in 
                        recovery. I know your mom didn’t 
                        want me there, she told me I was 
                        complicating things, that I was 
                        making it harder. And after 
                        everything... well. But - I’m a 
                        grown up too. I should have stayed.

           There’s a silence now that no one knows how to break.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Does she know you’re here?

           GABI shakes her head, no. She looks at him. Like a kid again.

                                 GABI
                        Please don’t tell her.

           DAD looks extremely uncomfortable with this request. GABI 
           looks out at the LITTLE GIRLS still playing in the pool. 
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        They seem really happy.

           DAD looks out at them too. They bring him a little peace.

                                 DAD
                        They are.

           GABI studies him.

                                 GABI
                        You’re acting like you’re a really 
                        good dad.

           DAD doesn’t take his eyes off the LITTLE GIRLS.

                                 DAD
                        People changing doesn’t mean 
                        they’re acting, Gabi.

           INT. DAD’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           STEP MOM, DAD, LITTLE GIRL, SECOND LITTLE GIRL, JULIE, and 
           GABI sit around the dining table, eating a really wholesome 
           lunch. The LITTLE GIRLS ramble without pause.

           But GABI and JULIE eat in silence.

           HALF AN HOUR LATER -

           GABI and JULIE sit at the cleared table. We can hear DAD and 
           STEP MOM in the next room doing dishes. 

           GABI can feel JULIE’s skeptical eyes on her. 

                                 GABI
                        What?

                                 JULIE
                         (are you kidding?)
                        What?

           GABI pushes her chair away from the table and gets up. She 
           doesn’t want to talk. She walks towards -

           INT. DAD’S HOUSE - HALLYWAY - DAY

           A dark hallway. Even though it’s sunny out, there’s barely 
           any natural light in here. The light that comes in shines 
           from under the BEDROOM DOORS.

           It’s quiet back here. JULIE comes up next to GABI. 
                                 JULIE
                        Gabi, come on.

           JULIE looks at GABI’s face. She sees the uncertainty on it.

           GABI is looking at the doors, trying to figure something out. 
           JULIE gets it. She points to the second door.

           GABI walks to it and pushes the door open. We see inside: A 
           HOME GYM. JULIE comes up behind GABI, looking in. JULIE is 
           muted now. Even if there aren’t clear memories here for GABI, 
           there obviously are for JULIE. Being at the house is bringing 
           back a lot.

           GABI looks at JULIE, seeing it all play on her face. But 
           JULIE doesn’t want to be studied. She clears her throat - and 
           points to the right side of the room, instructional.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Your bed.

           JULIE points to the left side of the room.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Her bed.

           JULIE looks back to GABI, who nods. Now JULIE speaks softly.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You really don’t remember living 
                        here?

           GABI isn’t sure. We can see it on her face. She’s mixed up.

           GABI turns around in the doorway to face JULIE. Their faces 
           are close, both cast in shadow in the dark of the hallway. 

                                 GABI
                        I don’t know.

           GABI is looking at her with a longing that we can’t quite 
           understand. Like she’s yearning for her past. For her 
           memories. For her friend. Or something more.

           JULIE stares back into GABI’s eyes. Taking her in. Almost 
           like she’s searching for something in the details of GABI’s 
           face. The two of them just look at each other in the quiet. 

           Still. It’s so intimate and quiet we almost feel like 
           intruders watching them.

           But beyond just that - there’s a tension building in the 
           space between them. JULIE makes a micro-movement, her lips 
           parting - maybe to say something, but before she can -

           The LITTLE GIRLS appear from the LIGHT END of the hallway. 
           The real intruders.
                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        You’re not supposed to go in 
                        Mommy’s sweat room.

                                 LITTLE GIRL 
                        Why are you in there?

           JULIE’s softness VANISHES at the sight of them. She clearly 
           has no patience or soft spot for children.

                                 JULIE
                        We’re not in there, we’re in the 
                        hallway.

           The LITTLE GIRLS feel her resistance and turn to GABI.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Will you give us a concert?

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        I’ll do back up. Or I can be the 
                        main one and you can be my back up.

                                 GABI
                        Maybe later.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Are you sleeping over?

           But before GABI answers, the LITTLE GIRL points at JULIE.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Where is she gonna sleep?

                                 JULIE
                        I’m not staying.

           GABI looks to JULIE.

                                 GABI
                        Julie, you’re not gonna drive back 
                        to LA tonight.

           The LITTLE GIRLS are relentless. They move at their own speed 
           and ask their own questions, no matter JULIE and GABI’s 
           answers.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is that your real ear?

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        I thought it fell off.

           GABI’s hand flies up. She covers her ear with her hair.

                     LITTLE GIRL
                                          SECOND LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
           Can you still hear stuff?
                                         Ew.
                                 JULIE
                         (to GABI)
                        I can just find a hotel tonight.

                                 GABI
                         (to JULIE)
                        That doesn’t make any sense.

           The LITTLE GIRLS keep barreling ahead on questions.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is it true you still have to live 
                        with your mom even though you’re a 
                        grown up?

                                 GABI
                         (to JULIE)
                        Wait, stop.

                                 JULIE
                        Stop what? I’m not doing anything.

                                 GABI
                        Julie -

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi, I came, right? But I can’t 
                        stay. I can’t be here. 

                                 GABI
                        I just need a little longer, to...

           The LITTLE GIRLS are getting to JULIE and she’s losing her 
           patience. She’s harsh with GABI.

                                 JULIE
                        To what? You’re not being straight 
                        with me.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        So you do have to live with your 
                        mom?

                                 GABI
                         (to shut her up)
                        Yeah. Sort of.
                         (to JULIE)
                        What do you mean? How am I not 
                        being straight?

                                 JULIE
                        What were you saying to your dad? 
                        What was that about?
                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        That’s really weird about how you 
                        live with your mom because you’re 
                        so old.

                                 GABI
                        I don’t know! I don’t know. I am 
                        trying to figure things out.

                                 JULIE
                        But what kind of things? 

                                 GABI
                        Who I am!

                                 JULIE
                        You’re Gabi, Gabi! You -

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        Daddy says you have to go back to 
                        the hospital.

           GABI and JULIE both STOP.

           THEY TURN SLOWLY TO THE LITTLE GIRLS.

           The LITTLE GIRLS are satisfied they finally have the 
           attention they’ve been wanting.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        That’s what Daddy said.

                        GABI
           What?
                                                   JULIE
                                         Stop saying that.

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        That’s what he told Aunt Lex.

                        GABI
                                                   JULIE
           What?
                                         What, when?

           The LITTLE GIRLS have a little aside.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Lex is not our aunt.

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        She’s not?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                         (pointing at GABI)
                        No, she’s just her mom.

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        So she’s our Step ... Mom?
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        No. Wait... 
                         (then, thinking hard)
                        Maybe.

           JULIE interrupts -

                                 JULIE
                         (harsh)
                        What did you say?

           Both LITTLE GIRLS give JULIE a look like “You are very rude 
           and we are not cooperating with you.”

                                 GABI
                        What did you say?

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                         (officious)
                        My dad -

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Our dad -

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        Said to our mom that your mom said 
                        she’s gonna take you to the 
                        hospital.

           GABI looks like she’s been hit by a ton of bricks. She pushes 
           out of the dark hallway and back towards -

           INT. DAD’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - SAME

           The CLOSED DOOR to the kitchen. GABI can hear STEP MOM 
           speaking, but can’t make out the words. The LITTLE GIRLS have 
           trailed her in. JULIE is behind them.

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        Your mom is probably gonna be here 
                        any second.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        How long is the flight from LA, 
                        Daddy said it’s really short.

                                 SECOND LITTLE GIRL
                        It’s like fifteen minutes.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is it that short, how come you 
                        never visit?

           GABI looks at JULIE with panic.
                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Is she gonna bring us anything?

           GABI can’t register anything they’re saying. LITTLE GIRL 
           comes up to GABI, holding an iPhone.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Just wondering, is this you? It 
                        doesn’t really look like you.

           The phone is playing A VIDEO OF OLD GABI PERFORMING a super 
           sexy and elaborate concert. JULIE, almost as edgy as GABI 
           now, LOOKS AT THE VIDEO - then to GABI. Even in the chaos of 
           the moment, something FLASHES on JULIE’s face when she sees 
           the video.

           It’s true. It doesn’t really look like her.

           But GABI just pushes it away. She tries to listen in on the 
           kitchen. It’s really frustrating as the CONCERT VIDEO PLAYS, 
           WATER RUNS, DISHES CLANK - DAD and STEP MOM’s voices are 
           unintelligible.

           GABI grabs a SERVING DISH left on the table. With the dish, 
           SHE WALKS INTO -

           INT. DAD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           STEP MOM and DAD immediately STOP SPEAKING. JULIE trails in.

                                 DAD
                        Hi muffin.

           Muffin comes out weird, like “Muffindd??” He’s uncomfortable.

                                 GABI
                        Did you call her?

                                 DAD
                        Call who?

           GABI gives a blank look. DAD is a terrible fucking liar. STEP 
           MOM responds to the look on GABI’s face -

                                 STEP MOM
                        Gabi, your father is just worried -

                                 GABI
                         (to DAD, ignoring her)
                        Did you?

                                 DAD
                        I think you might be going through 
                        some things that need more than we 
                        can really take on. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAD (CONT'D)
                        And it’s so nice you have your 
                        friend, but it’s probably more than 
                        Julie can -

                                 GABI
                        You don’t even know who you’re 
                        sending away.

           STEP MOM looks to DAD, confused. What is GABI talking about?

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Do you really not see it? You can’t 
                        recognize your own daughter? 

           GABI points back at the LITTLE GIRLS spying in the doorway.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Can you tell them apart?

                                 DAD
                        Gabi -

                                 GABI
                        I don’t think you know me at all. 

           It deflates him. He looks at her, open, acknowledging.

                                 DAD
                        I know. I don’t.

           It lands heavy in the room. GABI looks from DAD to the dish 
           in her hands. Simply releasing her grip, GABI DROPS IT on the 
           ground and it SHATTERS. STEP MOM and DAD are STARTLED.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

           STEP MOM and DAD rush towards the broken pieces.

                                 STEP MOM
                         (actually)
                        Gabi, what is wrong with you?

           The LITTLE GIRLS run into the kitchen. DAD holds a firm hand 
           up to them, stopping their entrance.

                                 DAD
                        Stop! Stop right there! No bare 
                        feet in here!

           DAD and STEP MOM bend over to pick up pieces of the plate. 
           GABI watches them scramble for a moment.

           Then she walks out.
           JULIE waits a beat. She watches this family scrambling to 
           clean up the broken pieces of ceramic. Even in the scuffle, 
           they look so normal just the four of them. 

           But GABI doesn’t fit in here.

           EXT. PHOENIX CUL DE SAC - DAY

           GABI walks out into the driveway, taking a breath of air. 
           Like she was suffocating inside.

           She scans the street, just trying to think. When she spots A 
           CAR across the street.

           It has California plates. 

           We can’t see who’s in it, but GABI starts to walk towards it. 
           As she does... the car FLIES INTO REVERSE. AND DRIVES OFF 
           AROUND THE CORNER. 

           Like it was spotted by its mark. 

           But just then - JULIE comes out, finding GABI standing in the 
           middle of the street, staring off in the direction of the 
           car. GABI looks... crazy.

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi, you look crazy.

           GABI nods, resigned. She knows how she looks.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        But your mom’s still worse.

           She unlocks her car.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           INT. JULIE’S CAR - DAY

           JULIE drives down a PHOENIX STREET. GABI is twitchy next to 
           her, looking back behind them. PARANOID. JULIE pulls off to 
           the side of the road.

                                 JULIE
                        Tell me what’s going on.

           GABI is silent.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t about not wanting to 
                        sing.
                                 GABI
                        I can’t sing.

           They both stare straight ahead.

                                 JULIE
                         (getting irritated)
                        Tell me why you had me drive you 
                        all the way to fucking Phoenix. I 
                        don’t even come home for Christmas 
                        anymore. I don’t want to be here. I 
                        need to go home, Nya is freaking 
                        out and... 
                         (taking a breath)
                        I saw what it’s like with them. I 
                        don’t think you want to be here 
                        either. So what is it? Why?

           Looking at GABI, JULIE can’t help soften. She looks so lost.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Why did we come here?

           GABI looks at JULIE, totally raw.

                                 GABI
                        I thought if I asked, he might tell 
                        me. I thought he might know.

                                 JULIE
                        Know what?

                                 GABI
                        I think...

           But she doesn’t finish. She hasn’t yet fully said out loud 
           what she wants to. Even if she’s heard other people say it.

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi.

           The sound of her name makes GABI snap to attention.

                                 GABI
                        No. See that’s it exactly.

                                 JULIE
                        What is?

           GABI shifts to face JULIE in the car.

                                 GABI
                        That I’m not Gabi.

           JULIE stares.
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I think Gabi is dead.

           JULIE is blank.

                                 JULIE
                        What is this?

                                 GABI
                        What’s what?

                                 JULIE
                        This. What you’re doing.

                                 GABI
                        I’m not doing anything, I’m just 
                        telling you. You asked. So I’m 
                        trying to tell you.

                                 JULIE
                        That you’re dead.

                                 GABI
                        Yeah.

           Now JULIE shifts to fully face GABI, trying to feel this out.

                                 JULIE
                        You’re dead. So, you’re what... a 
                        zombie...? I mean you look like 
                        shit, but not that shit.

                                 GABI
                        No. This isn’t like iZombie or 
                        whatever, I mean that -

           JULIE stops her.

                                 JULIE
                        Wait. iZombie??

           Without missing a beat -

                                 GABI
                        I was alone in the hospital for a 
                        long time. I watched a lot of TV.

           GABI resumes.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I mean that Gabi died.

                                 JULIE
                        Okay, sorry, so - you’re dead and 
                        this is... Heaven?

           JULIE indicates her car.
                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        This is Heaven?
                         (then)
                        Doesn’t it kind of fuckin’ smell 
                        weird in here to be Heaven?

                                 GABI
                        You just need to use a deodorizer 
                        in your shoes.

                                 JULIE
                        I know.

                                 GABI
                        The smell is something you could do 
                        something about.

                                 JULIE
                        I know.

           JULIE looks away, annoyed. Almost like it’s a fight they’ve 
           had before. But neither of them take notice of that.

                                 GABI
                        It’s not Heaven. We’re not dead. 

                                 JULIE
                        Oh, good.

                                 GABI
                        Only she is.

           It sits for a moment.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Julie. I’m. Not. Me.
                         (then)
                        I’m not Gabi. Gabi is dead.

           JULIE SWINGS the car door open and GETS OUT. 

           EXT. PHOENIX - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

           GABI follows JULIE out of the car. She tries to smile at 
           JULIE, but it’s just weird - in her cracked stage make up. 
           JULIE looks more than annoyed now, she’s creeped out.

                                 JULIE
                        Stop.

                                 GABI
                        Gabi died.

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi didn’t - you - stop.
                                 GABI
                        She didn’t survive the crash. I’m 
                        sorry, I -

                                 JULIE
                        You have one bad show and you come 
                        to me after years of nothing 
                        with... this?
                         (then, getting emotional)
                        Gabi, I haven’t heard from you - I 
                        didn’t... I tried. I tried for 
                        years to be there for you. After 
                        everything with the crash, after... 
                        Evie. But at a certain point - I am 
                        a person too. And it’s not always 
                        just about you. I lost someone too. 
                        And then the person I thought I 
                        could turn to... I don’t hear from 
                        you for years - and then, this 
                        is...

           But GABI cuts her off. She matches JULIE’s strength for the 
           first time -

                                 GABI
                        I woke up from a coma covered in 
                        bandages and casts, at a hospital. 
                        I had no idea where I was. I had no 
                        idea who I was. Someone gave me a 
                        name and I took it. And someone 
                        told me a way to be and I was it. I 
                        spent months learning how to walk 
                        again. And months looking at 
                        photos, watching home videos, 
                        watching performances. Learning how 
                        to be a person again. Learning 
                        exactly which person to be. But you 
                        see it. Right? Look at me. I’m not 
                        Gabi. Gabi was... she was... 
                        something. I could be anyone.

           It’s the first time we’ve heard it fully from her 
           perspective. And the truth is... it’s not that crazy. JULIE 
           feels it too. But all she can say is -

                                 JULIE
                        Anyone.

           GABI continues -

                                 GABI
                        Anyone who was injured badly enough 
                        on that day, at that hospital... 
                        could have been swapped out -

           Now JULIE puts her hands up. No. The details of GABI’s theory 
           are genuinely insane.
                                 JULIE
                        You believe that Gabi really died 
                        the day of the crash. And instead 
                        of admitting her death, your mom 
                        found a random injured woman and 
                        convinced that random injured woman 
                        that she was Gabi? And that random 
                        injured woman is you?

                                 GABI
                         (yes)
                        They rebuilt my face. Surgeons 
                        rebuilt my face. I’m an 
                        approximation. Jaw line, nose, 
                        cheek bones. Constructed from a 
                        face made of crushed bone. Whoever 
                        I was before was gone. I was a 
                        blank canvas. They could make me 
                        into Gabi.

                                 JULIE
                        And where is the real Gabi?

                                 GABI
                        In a grave. Somewhere. With someone 
                        else’s name on it.

           Something flickers again across JULIE’s face. Doubt. 
           Uncertainty. Pain. But what comes out is a hard line -

                                 JULIE
                        I think your dad was right, Gabi. I 
                        think you’re more fucked up than 
                        any of us knows how to handle.

           GABI acknowledges it, doesn’t try to fight. But she deflates.

                                 GABI
                        Okay.

           JULIE looks like she wants to shake GABI’s shoulders in 
           frustration. But she doesn’t. Instead she just leans against 
           the hood of her car. GABI looks back at her. Imploring.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Something is missing.

                                 JULIE
                        Well. Yeah. I mean, you have... 
                         (yelling, suddenly!)
                        Serious head trauma, Gabi!

           GABI shakes her head.

                                 GABI
                        There are things I remember. Or I 
                        think I remember. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GABI (CONT'D)
                        Us, playing in your backyard as 
                        kids. I think I remember it. But, I 
                        don’t know. I may have just filled 
                        it in. I saw a thousand photos of 
                        us as kids, photos of us writing 
                        songs, then photos of us from when 
                        we first got to LA. But how come 
                        the only clothes I can remember are 
                        the ones we’re wearing in the 
                        photos?
                         (then, again)
                        I just know something is missing.

                                 JULIE
                        But you don’t know what it is.

                                 GABI
                        No. But...

                                 JULIE
                        What?

                                 GABI
                        I know we were supposed to be best 
                        friends.

           GABI lets out a sad little smile.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        And I know I’m homesick for it. 
                        Whatever it is. I can feel it in 
                        the pit of my stomach. I’m homesick 
                        for it.

           JULIE thinks for a moment. Then shakes her head. Annoyed. Or, 
           something else. Furious. Seething.

                                 JULIE
                        I think about that fucking crash 
                        every day.

           GABI’s caught off guard by this.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I told you not to drive that 
                        weekend.

           GABI is stunned by this. A new piece of information.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You were already all freaked out 
                        because of your arm, and Jesus, you 
                        are such a bad driver anyway -

                                 GABI
                        What about my arm?
                                 JULIE
                        What?

                                 GABI
                        What about -

                                 JULIE
                        Your broken arm.

           GABI has no idea what she’s talking about.

                                 GABI
                        What broken arm?

           JULIE shakes her head, impatient. She opens her phone and 
           scrolls for a minute. Then she pulls up a photo. 

           It’s of OLD GABI WEARING A BRIGHT PINK CAST. And next to her, 
           with a sharpie, is JULIE.

                                 JULIE
                        You wouldn’t let me draw a dick on 
                        it.

           A smile creeps out of GABI. JULIE sees it.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        And then a week later.

                                 GABI
                        This was a week before the crash?

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah.

           GABI puts her bag down, mind racing.

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. RED MERCEDES / EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

           We’re back on the highway BEFORE THE CRASH. Only this time, 
           we see a little bit more. 

           We are still behind the YOUNG WOMAN in a spaghetti strap top.

           By now we know this is OLD GABI. 

           OLD GABI’s hair blows in the wind of her open window. But 
           now, we see her hand catching the breeze out the window too. 
           Her fingers dance along to “COMPLICATED” by Avril Lavigne - 
           and those fingers sprout out of a BRIGHT PINK CAST. 

           On the cast, “JULIE WAS HERE” is scrawled in Sharpie.

                                                        CUT TO:
           EXT. PHOENIX - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

           Back with JULIE and GABI.

                                 JULIE
                        What?

                        GABI
           So when Gabi was brought into 
           the hospital -
                                               JULIE (CONT'D)
                                         - when you were brought into 
                                         the hospital -

           GABI speaks as JULIE corrects.

                                               JULIE (CONT'D)
                        GABI
           The real Gabi already had a 
           broken arm.
                                         ......You already had a 
                                         broken arm. 

                                 GABI
                        The real Gabi had a broken arm. If 
                        I’m really Gabi, it’ll say I had a 
                        broken arm in my medical reports. 
                        And if I’m not...

           JULIE looks dumbstruck again. Each time GABI goes back to the 
           theory, JULIE can’t help be shocked.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I have to go to Banner U Hospital. 
                        It’s where -

                                 JULIE
                        I know what it is.

                                 GABI
                        I have to find out what happened 
                        after the crash.

           GABI stares at JULIE, pleading.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        You’ve already come this far. Come 
                        with me.

                                 JULIE
                        You mean... drive you.

                                 GABI
                        Julie, what if I’m right. What if 
                        I’m not her? What if she actually 
                        died?

                                 JULIE
                        What if what if? What if what? What 
                        then? What happens?
                                 GABI
                        Well. Then... you don’t have to 
                        hate Gabi anymore.

           The paradoxical reasoning of this is strangely affecting. 
           JULIE speaks, careful, controlled. She feels herself on 
           unsteady ground.

                                 JULIE
                        Tell me the truth. If you aren’t 
                        Gabi. Who exactly is it that you 
                        think you are?

                                 GABI
                        That’s what I’m trying to find out.

           INT. BANNER U HOSPITAL - HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT - DAY

           GABI and JULIE fill out a form across from a tired looking 
           ADMINISTRATOR sitting at a desk piled with papers. GABI tilts 
           the clipboard towards JULIE, looking for approval. JULIE 
           checks over GABI’s work. And nods.

           GABI gets up to hand the form to the Administrator.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I.D.?

           GABI pulls out her drivers’ license. Administrator looks 
           between GABI and the photo a few times. 

                                 GABI
                        It’s an old photo.

           ADMINISTRATOR stands up with the I.D. and paperwork. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        And it’s expired.

                                 GABI
                        Oh, sorry. Is that...

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        It’s fine. You’re not driving. 
                        Identity doesn’t just void itself.

           She gathers some papers.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get this copied. And then 
                        you’re set.

                                 GABI
                        Okay, great.

           ADMINISTRATOR walks into the back room. GABI turns to JULIE.
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for coming with me.

           But JULIE isn’t looking at her. In fact. We see in this 
           moment clearly that since their last conversation: 

           Something has shifted in JULIE.

           It’s as if - as GABI has been bolstered, JULIE has taken on a 
           piece of GABI’s restraint and shyness. JULIE keeps her eyes 
           mostly down, avoiding eye contact with her.

           ADMINISTRATOR comes back.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        We’ll notify you when the records 
                        are ready. Around thirty business 
                        days.

                        GABI
                                                   JULIE
           What?
                                         What?

                                 GABI
                        Well... Wait is there anything you 
                        can give us? From that day? Is 
                        there anything like... A list. A 
                        roster? Of people who got brought 
                        into the hospital that day? April 
                        24, 2016?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        So now you want someone else’s 
                        hospital records?

           ADMINISTRATOR is not having it. They’re at a dead end.

           INT. BANNER U HOSPITAL - BATHROOM - DAY

           GABI washes her face at a sink. Scrubbing her stage make up 
           off. As this scene starts, her make up looks worse than ever, 
           smudged all over from the water. But as it goes on, the make 
           up comes all the way off. 

           JULIE leans against the tile wall. Eyes to the ground. Only 
           throwing the occasional glance in GABI’s direction.

                                 JULIE
                        What now?

           GABI scrubs her face. She’s frustrated.

                                 GABI
                        I don’t know. I know you don’t 
                        believe me. So I’m sorry. That 
                        you’re here, dealing with this.
                                 (MORE)
                                 GABI (CONT'D)
                         (then)
                        I know it’s not your problem.

           JULIE doesn’t respond. GABI looks up at JULIE. She has soap 
           and water all over her face.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        That’s kind of the thing though.

                                 JULIE
                        What is the thing?

           GABI smiles. Soap still all over her face.

                                 GABI
                        Like I’m living someone else’s 
                        problem. Like this isn’t really all 
                        about me. I’m some side character. 
                        Or not even. I’m someone who passes 
                        through a room and interrupts a 
                        conversation. It’s all... someone 
                        else’s.

           JULIE doesn’t respond. But she nods.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        What? Does that sound crazy too?

                                 JULIE
                        No. It’s just... it feels like the 
                        first not crazy thing you’ve said 
                        to me all day.
                         (then)
                        That’s what it’s like. 

                                 GABI
                        What do you mean?

                                 JULIE
                        Gabi, I lost... everything I cared 
                        about that day.

           This is the most open JULIE has been with her - and GABI 
           stares. Not knowing what to say. Some of the soap bleeds into 
           her eye and she leans into the sink to scrub more. 

           JULIE sees she’s stinging. She grabs a paper towel and hands 
           it to GABI to wipe her eye. It’s a small gesture, but it’s 
           caring. Personal.

           GABI goes on with uncertainty -

                                 GABI
                        But you’re okay. I listen to 
                        everything you write. You have your 
                        life. And -
                                 (MORE)
                                 GABI (CONT'D)
                         (with that tightness 
                          again)
                        You have Nya.

           JULIE shakes her head. Like all of that is literally nothing.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s stuff. It’s good stuff. It’s 
                        just...
                         (then)
                        Not my story. My story was 
                        everything before the crash. So. 
                        Yeah. I know what you mean.

           GABI finishes wiping water from her face and looks to JULIE. 
           Her face clean and bare for the first time.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for washing that off.

                                 GABI
                        It was clearly bothering you.

           INT. BANNER U HOSPITAL - ELEVATOR - DAY

           JULIE and GABI ride an elevator in silence with an ORDERLY. 
           The elevator doors open and the ORDERLY gets out on his 
           floor. JULIE taps her foot, impatient. Ready to get out of 
           the hospital. But GABI stops the elevator doors from closing.

                                 JULIE
                        This isn’t the ground floor, Gabi.

           But GABI gets out. Reluctantly, JULIE follows.

           INT. BANNER U HOSPITAL - CRITICAL CARE UNIT - DAY

           Even by the elevators, we can feel this is a quiet floor. 
           GABI looks around like she’s trying to figure something out. 
           JULIE is ILL AT EASE.

                                 GABI
                        This is where I woke up.

           GABI sits down on a linoleum bench. JULIE sits next to her. 
           She hesitates for a second, then asks a question -

                                 JULIE
                        You haven’t told me why.

                                 GABI
                        Why what?
                                 JULIE
                        Why - if the real Gabi died - your 
                        mom would say she didn’t.

           It’s not accepting the theory - but it’s the least resistant 
           to it that JULIE has been. She’s engaging it. 

                                 GABI
                        Money. Gabi is an empire.

                                 JULIE
                        But, exactly. There was enough 
                        money to last three lifetimes, so -

                                 GABI
                        The bank accounts are empty. There 
                        were no savings. Everything is 
                        debt. Everything is credit. 
                        Everything is waiting for me to 
                        finally perform and start it all 
                        going again.

           It seems impossible to JULIE, but GABI is calm, sure. JULIE 
           starts to speak again when -

                        JULIE
                                               CLAUDIA (O.S.)
           Gabi -
                                         Gabi?

           They both look up, STARTLED, to find CLAUDIA, 50s, a nurse - 
           vibrant and warm - absolutely BEAMING down at her. 

           CLAUDIA lets out a SCREAM of delight, so happy to see GABI. 
           She lifts GABI up from the linoleum bench and spins her 
           around. Then pulls her into a tight hug.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh Gabi, Gabi, Gabi, Gabi.

           She pushes GABI out and looks at her.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Look at you. Look at you. You’re so 
                        beautiful.

           GABI has recognized this woman immediately.

                                 GABI
                         (truly happy to see her)
                        Claudia.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        What are you doing here, miss? 
                        Shouldn’t you be off being a super 
                        star dancing around in some kind of 
                        belly something showing it all off?
                                 GABI
                        I’m just taking a little break.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You know, you deserve it whatever 
                        you want. But the people miss you, 
                        honey. We want Gabi on the radio.

           CLAUDIA fully clocks JULIE now. Her eyes widen. 

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Julie. Julie!

           CLAUDIA grabs JULIE’s hands and pulls her up from the bench 
           too. Another enormous hug. CLAUDIA basically engulfs JULIE. 
           Then she turns to GABI.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        This is a friend. A true friend.

                                 GABI
                        You know each other?

           CLAUDIA lets out a big laugh, but JULIE is embarrassed.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Couldn’t get rid of the girl. 
                        Couldn’t. She didn’t let a day go 
                        by without coming to see you.

           GABI is stunned. JULIE tries to shrug it off.

                                 JULIE
                        You were basically a mummy. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        She was a little source of God’s 
                        light. Plus she always brought 
                        candy, ugh, I’m still hooked on 
                        those peanut butter cups. 
                         (turning to JULIE)
                        But you know, Julie, I found some 
                        with stevia, they taste almost like 
                        the real thing.

                                 JULIE
                        I’ve tried those. They taste weird 
                        to me.

           CLAUDIA shrugs and laughs. She’s so happy to see the two 
           girls. GABI’s still staring at JULIE, and JULIE’s 
           uncomfortable with it.

                                 GABI
                        I didn’t know you came.
                                 JULIE
                        Yeah.

                                 GABI
                        Why don’t I remember that?

                                 JULIE
                        Once you were out of the coma, your 
                        mom stopped letting visitors come.

           GABI looks almost heartbroken.

                                 GABI
                        She never told me. She didn’t tell 
                        me you came.

           JULIE tries to shake off the sentimentality.

                                 JULIE
                        Fuck me, I feel like Ryan Gosling.

           GABI looks at her, blank. Not getting the Notebook reference.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                         (eyes rolling at GABI)
                        Jesus Christ.
                         (then, appalled)
                        But iZombie??

           CLAUDIA lets out a big laugh at JULIE’s acerbity. Then she 
           goes stern, suddenly.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Okay now. Why are you two here, go 
                        on tell me. We like people to leave 
                        this floor here and not come back.

           GABI looks away from JULIE, to CLAUDIA. Business-like.

                                 GABI
                        Claudia, honestly... I’m trying to 
                        figure out what happened when I got 
                        brought in. That day.

           CLAUDIA’s shakes her head, somber.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        It was a terrible day.

           GABI seizes the opportunity.

                                 GABI
                        Do you remember - when I came in, 
                        did I have a cast on? A bright pink 
                        cast?

           CLAUDIA shakes her head, thinking.
                                 CLAUDIA 
                        No. No pink cast.

           GABI glances at JULIE but JULIE ignores it, frustrated. This 
           doesn’t prove anything to her. CLAUDIA catches the exchange. 
           She goes on, looking to JULIE -

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        I remember exactly what she looked 
                        like coming in. So small and young 
                        compared to how we knew her. She 
                        was always this big gigantic woman 
                        figure on stage and then lying 
                        there it was like looking at a 
                        little child.

           GABI and JULIE both take it in. 

                                 GABI
                         (to JULIE)
                        And no cast.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        But EMTs and trauma unit take 
                        things like that off. They might 
                        have been worried about swelling. 
                        Who knows. Your records would have 
                        that information though.

           Right. Those records GABI can’t get. CLAUDIA looks between 
           JULIE and GABI, knowing she’s missing something.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Why? What about a cast?

                                 GABI
                        I’m trying to...

           She’s sick of beating around the question. She blurts it out.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Was there anyone else brought in 
                        that day who I could have been 
                        mixed up with?

           And instead of the confusion that GABI has been met with all 
           along - CLAUDIA is CRYSTAL CLEAR on this question.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Oh, I see.

           CLAUDIA gives GABI a little conciliatory nod, but she turns 
           wistful quickly.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Yes a cast would have been helpful.
           GABI is STUNNED by her immediate understanding.

                                 GABI
                        What do you mean?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I guess your mom must have told you 
                        about that confusion.

           It hangs in the air. What?

                                 GABI
                        Told me about what confusion?

           CLAUDIA looks sad. But GABI is rapt.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Well. You know, we had to mark you 
                        as two Jane Does.

           It hangs in the air.

           Two Jane Does.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Until your mother arrived. There 
                        was no way to know who was who. All 
                        we had to go on was the most recent 
                        phone call on one of the phones. It 
                        was unlocked, thank God. So we 
                        could get your mother. You were so 
                        similar. So, so alike. And both so 
                        broken.

           GABI doesn’t know what to say. For the first time, SOMEONE IS 
           CONFIRMING HER BELIEF. And she looks sick over it.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Just... One of you had a shot of 
                        pulling through. And one of you was 
                        already gone.

           CLAUDIA’s eyes filled with pity looking at GABI. JULIE grows 
           increasingly fidgety, anxious, looking between them.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        But once your mother got here, she 
                        knew. She knew right away it was 
                        you. She could see through the 
                        blood and the swelling. She said 
                        she could hear it in your 
                        heartbeat. That faint heartbeat. 
                        That you were you. And who better 
                        to trust? A mother knows her 
                        daughter.
                                 GABI
                        Who was the other body?

           Now for the first time, CLAUDIA is stuck. JULIE looks 
           nervously at CLAUDIA. Like she’s afraid of what is coming.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Darling, what?

                                 GABI
                        Who was it?

           CLAUDIA looks to JULIE, for help. But JULIE has no help to 
           give. Again - she looks almost like she’s going to be sick. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        It was your sister, Gabi. 

           GABI is completely lost. JULIE looks at her. Waiting for 
           recognition. But it doesn’t come.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Your sister. Evie.
                         (then)
                        She died in the crash.

           And we can see on GABI’s face... 

           SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT CLAUDIA IS TALKING ABOUT.

           INT. BANNER U HOSPITAL - ELEVATOR - DAY

           GABI and JULIE are both silent as the elevator descends.

           Dazed.

           Exhausted.

           A loud DING! and -

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. RED MERCEDES / EXT. HIGHWAY, DESERT - DAY

           We’re back on the highway before the crash. 

           We see the PINK CAST hanging out the window, fingers dancing 
           in the wind. Scrawled on it is “JULIE WAS HERE”. But so is...

           “TESTIC EVIE TOO”. It’s nerdy as shit.

           SUDDENLY, next to OLD GABI - AN ARM shoots over from the 
           passenger seat and hits NEXT SONG on the stereo. 
           “Complicated” turns off.

           We turn and find: EVIE. 

           We’ll call her OLD EVIE too. She’s been there the whole time, 
           we just haven’t seen her. OLD EVIE turns on a song. It’s 
           “Double Down” by GABI. OLD EVIE laughs. OLD GABI turns, 
           smiling. 

                                 OLD GABI
                        No. 

           Seeing them together - an indisputable truth arises: they are 
           extremely similar looking. The same actor could [and does] 
           play both of them.

           GABI could be EITHER OF THEM.

                                                        BACK TO:

           INT. BANNER U HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

           GABI and JULIE walk down a hall. GABI looks light-headed.

                                 GABI
                        I need to sit.

           JULIE nods, she puts her hand on the small of GABI’s back and 
           leads her into -

           INT. BANNER U HOSPITAL - CHAPEL - DAY

           A small room with pews set up, facing stained glass windows. 
           The glass gives the room a reddish glow.

           The chaos and bright light of the hospital are gone without a 
           trace once the door shuts behind GABI and JULIE.

           In the quiet of the chapel, JULIE notices her hand on GABI’s 
           back. She pulls it away. Quickly. Like GABI’s back was white 
           hot. GABI sits. JULIE looks at her.

                                 JULIE
                        You had to know.

           GABI looks up to her. An imperceptible shake of her head. No. 
           She didn’t know.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        How?

                                 GABI
                        I knew she was gone. But... when I 
                        see the crash in my head, I just... 
                        I’m alone.
                                 JULIE
                        I just don’t get that.

           GABI turns to JULIE.

           GABI turns to face up to JULIE, who stands above her.

                                 GABI
                        Can I tell you? How you have to 
                        build a memory?

           JULIE nods.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        So it starts with a story. A story 
                        that you’re apparently in. And once 
                        you hear it enough times, you know 
                        it so well it’s like you were 
                        there. Because you were. It becomes 
                        real again.
                         (telling a story)
                        You’re on the beach. Your family 
                        goes every year. The tide is out so 
                        you can’t really go in beyond 
                        sitting in the still water and 
                        getting your butt wet. But it’s 
                        hot. It smells like seaweed. There 
                        are little bugs jumping out of the 
                        sand. And a hermit crab inching 
                        across your purple towel. Because 
                        you put it there. Your mom’s 
                        holding a bottle of that bright 
                        green Coppertone Color Block 
                        sunscreen. Your dad’s reading one 
                        of her trashy magazines, pretending 
                        it’s his only option. It’s all 
                        super clear, because you’ve talked 
                        about it enough, you’ve talked 
                        about being there - it’s actually 
                        become real. Hard and shiny and 
                        real. And you remember picking up 
                        the hermit crab again and again, 
                        putting it at the edge of your 
                        towel, watching it walk slowly back 
                        across. It’s yours. It’s clear.

           JULIE nods, slowly.

                                 JULIE
                        Cape Cod.
                         (then)
                        You used to go every year.

           GABI nods again.

                                 GABI
                        And then one day, you see a photo 
                        of that day. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GABI (CONT'D)
                        It’s of that day you now remember 
                        perfectly. And there you are. 
                        There’s your mom. There’s your dad. 
                        There’s your hermit crab. You can 
                        see it right there on the towel, 
                        trying to get away.

           JULIE listens. Anticipating.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        And then... there she is. 

           GABI almost smiles. It’s like she’s talking about astronomers 
           finding a new star.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        This person. This whole other 
                        person. Sitting right there, her 
                        shoulder against your shoulder, 
                        taking up half your faded towel. 
                        Staring at your hermit crab. Or 
                        maybe it was her hermit crab the 
                        whole time. You realize everything 
                        you remembered is wrong. You 
                        actually didn’t remember anything - 
                        because you didn’t remember her. 
                        And it’s not about the beach 
                        anymore, it’s just about knowing 
                        you got it all wrong. Knowing more 
                        has to be missing. And that missing 
                        stuff is so important that without 
                        it...
                         (but she doesn’t know how 
                          to finish)
                        It’s been so much... it’s been much 
                        easier to just be alone with the 
                        hermit crab.

                                 JULIE
                        So you didn’t forget everything. 
                        You just forgot her?

                                 GABI
                        No that’s the thing, Julie. I 
                        didn’t forget her.

                                 JULIE
                        But you just said...

                                 GABI
                        No. Julie. 
                         (then)
                        I am her.

           It lands HEAVY. GABI is still. 
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why my mom wouldn’t let 
                        you in to see me? Because she was 
                        terrified. For this to work, for me 
                        to be Gabi - everyone had to be 
                        gone. Coaches, record label, 
                        choreographers, you - gone. Because 
                        no matter how much I learned, how 
                        hard I worked at it... I’m not 
                        really Gabi. And my mom - she was 
                        too afraid they would be able to 
                        see it. That you would be able to 
                        see it. 

           JULIE looks up at GABI. For the first time, we see JULIE 
           truly letting emotions get the better of her.

                                 JULIE
                        I get you feel guilty. I get that. 
                        Evie died and you didn’t. Maybe you 
                        want to give her some kind of 
                        second chance at life. I don’t 
                        know. But there are other people... 
                        Other people who lost her too. And 
                        I can’t...

           But she starts to waver and can’t get the words out. Her 
           voice starts to break.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t.

                                 GABI
                        You can’t what?

                                 JULIE
                        I can’t... un-bury her.

           JULIE shakes her head, tears in her eyes. We see now fully 
           that JULIE’s denial is more than that she doesn’t believe 
           GABI. It’s that she won’t let herself believe GABI.

           JULIE sits down on the pew. A few feet from GABI. They sit 
           separately like that for a moment - both looking spent. 
           Until... GABI starts to say something under her breath. JULIE 
           turns to her. Trying to hear.

           But we realize, she’s not saying anything. 

           She’s singing.

           It’s that same tune again. The same little tune.

           The one that’s been stuck in GABI’s head. It’s just da-da-
           das. Incredibly quiet. Barely more than breath. 
           And now suddenly... JULIE LOOKS LIKE SHE’S STARING AT A 
           GHOST. GABI keeps going but JULIE looks APPALLED -

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 GABI
                        It’s why I came to you. It’s why... 
                        I think it’s why you’ll barely even 
                        look at me.

           JULIE wipes a tear away from her face.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I saw it on your face. At El 
                        Mitote. You knew who I was. It just 
                        took me until now to get it.

           JULIE shakes her head, hard. In absolute denial of this. When 
           she looks up to GABI, she has that same look from before. 
           Like she’s seething mad. But tears rim her eyes.

                                 JULIE
                        That song wasn’t for you. It wasn’t 
                        for anyone else.

           GABI can’t get out more than a whisper.

                                 GABI
                        You wrote it for me.

           JULIE shakes her head again.

                                 JULIE
                        No, I didn’t.
                         (then)
                        I wrote it for her.

           For EVIE. That little tune was EVIE’S TUNE.

           We see on GABI’s face that she knows this. Carefully, GABI 
           inches towards JULIE on the pew. Her hand moves just slightly 
           across the linoleum bench. It comes within an inch of JULIE’s 
           hand. JULIE stares at it.

           She looks up at GABI. Like she’s begging her not to come an 
           inch closer - like she’s begging her to stay away. But GABI 
           doesn’t stay away. She reaches her finger tip forward, just 
           to the edge of JULIE’s. She just barely brushes it. Gently. 
           There is something in GABI’s eyes that says all she wants is 
           to touch JULIE, to be closer to her. But -

           JULIE BOLTS UP. Again, like GABI is white hot. Like even a 
           sliver of physical contact with GABI is too much to take -
                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t fair. I already did 
                        this. I’ve already done this. And 
                        now you’re just fucking with me.

                                 GABI
                        I’m not.

                                 JULIE
                        Is this because we didn’t tell 
                        you??

                                 GABI
                        What?

                                 JULIE
                        It was just one thing... that 
                        wasn’t about you. It was just ours. 
                        You always had to know everything - 
                        And... 

                                 GABI
                        I know.

                                 JULIE
                        No you don’t! You don’t know, Gabi!

                                 GABI
                        I’m not -

                                 JULIE
                        Stop! Stop!

           GABI rises to her heat, she stands up too, pissed.

                                 GABI
                        You stop! Can’t you accept for one 
                        second that when you lost me, I 
                        lost you too??? That I woke up one 
                        day and didn’t have you anymore?? 
                        And I learned how to sing and I 
                        learned how to dance and I learned 
                        how to be this person, but all I 
                        really knew was that I wanted you?

           They’re both exasperated. Both spent.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.

           GABI’s mouth is dry. She can only speak quietly when she 
           starts again.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Julie... I need someone. Someone. 
                        Just one person. To be honest with 
                        me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I need someone to say to me that I 
                        am not insane. I need someone to 
                        help me. I need someone to believe 
                        me. I need you to tell me you know 
                        who I am.

           JULIE just looks down at her feet.

                                 JULIE
                        I can’t.

           We stay on JULIE. There are tears streaming down her cheeks 
           but she doesn’t wipe them away now. It’s quiet. 

           Until we hear the sound of a DOOR, swishing gently. JULIE 
           looks up -

           And GABI is gone.

           INT. BANNER UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - NURSE’S STATION - DAY

           GABI stands at a quiet Nurse’s Station. A NURSE hands her a 
           telephone.

                                 NURSE
                        You just dial six-zero to get out.

           GABI nods.

                                 GABI
                        Thanks.

           GABI dials. She waits as the line rings. And then a click -

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I know... you’re here. Can we 
                        meet?

                                                        CUT TO:

           EXT. HOT SPRING DINER - SUNSET

           The parking lot of a DUSTY ROADSIDE DINER. Although it’s 
           really less a PARKING LOT and more a PATCH OF DIRT.

           GABI waits, fidgety - standing a few feet away from a very 
           annoyed CAB DRIVER, who leans against his BEAT UP CAB, 
           smoking a cigarette and glaring at GABI.

           GABI feels his eyes. She looks over, awkward and apologetic. 
           CAB DRIVER flicks the tip of his cigarette at her.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        My meter’s still on.
           GABI nods.

                                 GABI
                        I know.

           Just then, GABI looks up, towards the ROAD and we hear the 
           sound of a CAR approaching. An SUV.

           The sun is behind the SUV and it KICKS UP DUST as it comes.

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        This is her. It won’t take long. If 
                        you can wait?

           CAB DRIVER gives her a grumpy shrug, but GABI’s gaze is 
           elsewhere. She shields her eyes from the sun with her hand.

           We have no idea who’s driving. But we’ve seen GABI in this 
           position a few times. Meek, tense, drawn inwards. We can’t 
           help assuming it’s LEX driving towards her.

           But as the car pulls up and parks - SOMEONE ELSE steps out.

           And we REVEAL: THE GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS.

           From the FACEBOOK CONSPIRACY VIDEOS. 

           THE GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS stands backlit by the sun and the 
           bright road, staring at GABI. Silence between them. UNTIL -

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        It’s already fifty-three bucks, 
                        that’s without tip.

           INT. HOT SPRING DINER - NIGHT

           Inside the rundown diner.

           There’s some BUSTLING from the kitchen. But other than that, 
           just a table with TWO TEENAGERS finishing sodas and fries.

           HEATHER - The Girl With Pink Cheeks - 30s, long hair, shifty 
           eyes - sits across from GABI. She has a plate of fries in 
           front of her and looks up at GABI in starts.

           And there’s something in her glances. Something in the way 
           she SIGHS as she dips her french fries in the ketchup. It’s 
           the unmistakable appearance of... DISAPPOINTMENT.

           And the mood between them is... really fucking awkward.

                                 GABI
                        Thanks. For meeting me.

           HEATHER shrugs.
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I was worried at first you weren’t 
                        going to respond to my messages.

                                 HEATHER
                        I try to get back to people.

                                 GABI
                        Right, yeah.

                                 HEATHER
                        I get a lot of messages so I try to 
                        be democratic about it.

                                 GABI
                        So there are a lot of people... 
                        who...

                                 HEATHER
                        Yes. Well, not a lot. But, some.

                                 GABI
                        I think maybe one of them called in 
                        when I did a radio interview -

           HEATHER looks up at GABI.

                                 HEATHER
                        That was me.

           GABI’s confused.

                                 GABI
                        No, sorry, I mean - there was a man 
                        who -

                                 HEATHER
                        I know who you mean.

           HEATHER pulls out her phone. She brings an APP up. It’s a 
           CELEBRITY VOICE CHANGER.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        You can choose anyone’s voice 
                        really. Justin Timberlake... 
                        Obama... Gabi.

           HEATHER speaks into the phone -

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for meeting me.

           She hits a button and the phone PLAYS THE WORDS BACK. IN A 
           DIFFERENT VOICE.

                                 GABI PHONE VOICE
                        Thanks for meeting me.
           It sounds a LOT like GABI’s voice. It’s creepy.

                                 HEATHER
                        It’s pretty easy to fool people 
                        these days. People are so asleep.

           It looks like GABI may speak again when the TWO TEENAGERS 
           from the other table approach GABI and HEATHER.

                                 GIRL TEENAGER
                        Um, are you Gabi?

           GABI looks up at them. HEATHER does too - with an icy gaze.

                                 BOY TEENAGER
                        You totally are.
                         (then)
                        She used to be obsessed with you. 
                        Obsessed.

                                 GIRL TEENAGER
                         (to BOY)
                        Stop, you were too.
                         (to GABI)
                        He was obsessed too. Do you... 
                        sorry but, could we get a photo?

           GABI hesitates. GIRL TEENAGER turns to HEATHER.

                                 GIRL TEENAGER (CONT’D)
                        Will you take it?

           HEATHER takes the camera, with a sneer. GABI obeys the 
           COUPLE’s wishes. HEATHER takes the photo. Not a good one.

                                 GIRL TEENAGER (CONT’D)
                        Thank you so much.

           The two start to walk away as GABI sits back down with 
           HEATHER. As the TEENAGERS leave, we overhear them -

                                 GIRL TEENAGER (CONT’D)
                         (low voice, to BOY)
                        In person I’m prettier than her?

                                 BOY TEENAGER
                        Yeah, no shit, babe.

           The bell on the door JINGLES as the TEENAGERS leave. GABI and 
           HEATHER are alone now. There’s something intense in HEATHER’s 
           gaze. She picks up a french fry, dips it in ketchup.

                                 HEATHER
                        Did you ever have to go to Sunday 
                        school?

           GABI starts to answer but HEATHER waves it off.
                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        No. I know you didn’t. I did. Or I 
                        got to go. Better than home.

                                 GABI
                        Right.

           HEATHER looks off.

                                 HEATHER
                        I think there’s a lot in the Bible 
                        that’s really good. Really good. 
                        And then there’s a lot that is such 
                        a mind screw.

           She puts her fry in her mouth.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        When I first heard - 

           She CHOKES on her fry. GABI, alarmed, pushes water towards 
           her, but HEATHER waves it off, COUGHING WILDLY. Tears in her 
           eyes. She stands up and walks the length of the restaurant. 
           Coughing. She opens the door and steps OUT OF THE DINER 
           briefly. We hear the coughing from outside. Then it stops.

           GABI has no idea what to do. TIRED WAITRESS approaches GABI.

                                 TIRED WAITRESS
                        Kitchen’s closed. That gonna be it? 

           GABI nods and TIRED WAITRESS heads to the back. She switches 
           some LIGHTS OFF - DARKENING the back of the restaurant. 
           There’s a distinct change in the atmosphere. 

           HEATHER walks back in to the darkened space. And we see on 
           GABI’s face - SHE IS NERVOUS. HEATHER sits back down.

                                 HEATHER
                        So, Sunday School.

           HEATHER leans in.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        One of those stories... that never 
                        made sense to me. Jacob and Esau. 
                        You know it? The mom likes Jacob 
                        more than Esau. But the dad likes 
                        Esau more than Jacob. And the dad 
                        is going to leave everything to 
                        Esau. The land, his blessing, 
                        everything. And so when the dad is 
                        dying and sick... the mom dresses 
                        Jacob up to trick the dad into 
                        thinking he’s Esau. So Jacob can 
                        get the blessing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        She puts Jacob in a hairy shirt, 
                        because Esau is hairy. And she 
                        makes Jacob smell bad, because Esau 
                        smells bad. And stuff like that. 
                        And the dad buys it. He believes 
                        it. And he gives Jacob the blessing 
                        instead of Esau.

                                 GABI
                        Okay.

                                 HEATHER
                        I hated that story. It just 
                        undermined things. The dad was only 
                        like, fifty. And, sure, maybe it’s 
                        easier to believe than God’s son 
                        rising from the dead - but the way 
                        I see it, that stuff’s supposed to 
                        be magic. This was just... some 
                        kind of prank.

           Now HEATHER looks kind of pissed -

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        It just cheapened everything.

           GABI tenses at HEATHER’s tone. HEATHER shakes her head.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        I just remembered the dad was like 
                        two hundred years old actually. I 
                        don’t know, there are a lot of 
                        holes in that story.

           GABI shifts in her seat, not knowing how to contribute.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        But it doesn’t matter. Because it 
                        turned out... the Jacob and Esau 
                        thing wasn’t bullcrap at all. 

           HEATHER stares at GABI with laser focus.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        But it was still cheap.

           GABI meets her eye now. She gets what HEATHER is driving at. 
           HEATHER looks at GABI with CLEAR DISTASTE.

           GABI is the one who’s cheap in HEATHER’s eyes.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        I prayed that I would meet Gabi. 
                        Meet her. Watch her as she met me. 
                        Get to know her as she got to know 
                        me. I mean, I went to prison for 
                        it. Prison.
           GABI shifts in her seat. And we understand. HEATHER isn’t 
           just the GIRL WITH PINK CHEEKS.

           HEATHER is: GABI’S STALKER.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        For a few pairs of underwear.

                                 GABI
                        It wasn’t just about the underwear.

                                 HEATHER
                         (snapping)
                        What would you know about it?

           HEATHER laughs a mean little laugh. She spits with disdain as 
           she speaks to GABI now. And we start to feel something new in 
           HEATHER. Something distinctly vicious.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        Answered prayers, right? God’s 
                        laughing at my prayers. It’s some 
                        kind of joke to him. Another cheap 
                        prank. I’ll never get to meet Gabi.

                                 GABI
                        I know.

                                 HEATHER
                        Of course you know.

           GABI bites her lip. But then something erupts from it. A 
           smile. HEATHER hates this smile. It’s OFFENSIVE, WRONG.

                                 GABI
                        You really know too.

                                 HEATHER
                        You think it’s funny?

                                 GABI
                        No, it’s not that. You are just the 
                        only person who -

           But HEATHER is furious.

                                 HEATHER
                        She was the only person who I ever -
                        I felt it. Before I even heard 
                        about the crash, I felt it. Lying 
                        on my cot, in that cell - that cell 
                        was the only thing that could have 
                        kept me from sprouting wings and 
                        flying to her. It was like I 
                        couldn’t breathe. And then like an 
                        electrocution. I knew she was gone. 
                        I felt it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HEATHER (CONT'D)
                         (then)
                        I died that day too.

           This is the first full fucking crazy HEATHER has really gone. 
           And GABI can’t conceal her feelings - her eyes are wide, and 
           she is clearly freaked out by HEATHER’s instability. HEATHER 
           sees the look in GABI’s eyes.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        You always looked like her.

           This catches GABI off guard. HEATHER sees it too.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        Enough to fool people. Even before. 
                        But you were always... so much 
                        less.

           GABI doesn’t know what to say. And HEATHER can see her 
           struggling. She likes the feeling of GABI back on her heels. 
           HEATHER likes to be in control.

                                 GABI
                        I... I’m know you’re upset, I -

                                 HEATHER
                         (then, mocking, dripping 
                          with disdain)
                        Evie. 

           It startles GABI.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                         (still mocking)
                        Evie knows I’m upset.

           The voice she uses is shrill. It’s unsettling. HEATHER shakes 
           her head again.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        Why did you even come here?

                                 GABI
                        I wanted the truth.

           HEATHER nods, knowingly - then looks back to GABI, her mean 
           smile creeping back.

                                 HEATHER
                        You know about the other body, 
                        don’t you? The body they pretended 
                        was hers. The body buried in your 
                        grave.

           But the words are followed by the SCREECH of GABI’s chair 
           against the ground as she LURCHES her chair away.
           It’s too much for her. It doesn’t feel how she thought it 
           would. Instead - it’s terrifying. HEATHER stays put, staring. 
           That vicious look in her eye. GABI gets up from the table.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        She was so full of life, I don’t 
                        know how anything could hurt her 
                        more than you. When you’re so... 

           HEATHER looks GABI up and down. Cold and calculating.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        She looked beautiful in anything.

                                 GABI
                        I should go. The driver’s waiting 
                        for me.

           GABI walks quickly away from HEATHER, through the darkened, 
           emptied-out restaurant. She wants to get away as quickly as 
           she can - knowing she’s made a huge mistake coming here.

           Behind her, HEATHER stands up slowly. She puts cash down on 
           the table. She’s calm. Eerily calm.

           The BELL of the restaurant door DINGS as GABI pushes out into 
           the night. HEATHER walks slowly towards the door, following 
           her out.

           EXT. DUSTY ROADSIDE DINER - NIGHT

           The lot is dark now. Empty save for HEATHER’s CAR. 

           The CAB DRIVER is gone.

           HEATHER walks out. She smiles at the sight of GABI all alone.

                                 HEATHER
                        I sent him back.
                         (then)
                        I can drive you.

           HEATHER walks a few steps closer to GABI. And as the door of 
           the diner CLOSES BEHIND HER, the rest of the LIGHTS INSIDE GO 
           OUT. Moments later: we hear a CLICK.

           The door locking shut from the inside. GABI turns. She’s 
           scared. Plainly. And this time there’s reason for it. She’s 
           all alone with HEATHER.

           HEATHER keeps walking towards GABI. And GABI is... immobile.

           HEATHER is the only one in control.
                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                         (quietly)
                        Do you think she’s watching us 
                        right now?
                         (still walking)
                        I think about it all the time. If 
                        she watches you. Singing her songs.  

           HEATHER is an arm’s length from GABI.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        Wearing her clothes. Her face.

                                 GABI
                        I don’t know.

                                 HEATHER
                        It has to be hard for you. Don’t 
                        think I don’t pity you.

           GABI takes a step backwards, accidentally backing up against 
           HEATHER’s car. 

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        You could never be worthy of her.

           GABI is sandwiched between HEATHER and her car now.

                                 GABI
                        I should get inside and call the 
                        cab company back...

                                 HEATHER
                        But I thought you wanted me to give 
                        you a ride? That’s why you came to 
                        me, wasn’t it? Because you have 
                        nowhere else to go?

           This quiets GABI.

           Because it rings true. No one believes her. Everyone thinks 
           she’s insane. Is she even sure of who she really is?

           HEATHER reaches around GABI and pulls the passenger door open 
           for GABI. GABI looks towards it.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        We’ll drive slow, Evie.

           HEATHER isn’t touching her. She isn’t forcing or threatening. 
           What’s terrifying is... GABI is looking at the door - torn.

           She doesn’t want to run anymore.

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have anyone else.
           An almost imperceptible nod from GABI. HEATHER nods with her. 
           It looks for a moment like GABI is GOING TO GET INTO THE CAR 
           WITH HER, WHEN -

           HEADLIGHTS APPEAR ON THE DARK ROAD. AND A CAR COMES BARRELING 
           TOWARDS HEATHER AND GABI.

           And before HEATHER or GABI can move a muscle - stepping out 
           of it in a FURY IS -

           LEX.

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. RENTAL CAR / EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           LEX drives her RENTAL CAR on a long desert highway. GABI sits 
           beside her. It’s quiet. Until -

                                 GABI
                        How did you...

                                 LEX
                        I looked on your computer. The 
                        messages between you and Heather. 
                        Where she asked to meet you.

           GABI nods. Right.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have to talk about it. All 
                        I care about is that you’re okay. 
                        That’s all I care about.

           GABI is silent... they drive on.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           A BLACK CAR pulls up outside of the house in LA. It’s an 
           Uber, back from the AIRPORT. GABI and LEX get out as the UBER 
           DRIVER goes around to a pull a small suitcase out for LEX.

                                 LEX
                        Thanks so much.

           LEX starts to walk towards the house - her movement lighting 
           up the MOTION-SENSOR SAFETY LIGHTS.

           But GABI stops. She’s not taking another step.

                                 GABI
                        I know.

           LEX turns around, realizing GABI is not right behind her. She 
           finds her in cold white light.
                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        I know.

           There’s a moment of stillnesss between them. As terrified 
           recognition starts to dawn on LEX’s face...

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. UBER / EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           GABI rides in the back of an Uber. Alone. 

           The car winds through quiet streets until it stops at - 

           EXT. JULIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The bungalow has a single light on inside. GABI gets out of 
           her Uber. She hesitates for a moment, then walks up to the 
           door. And knocks.

           Within seconds, JULIE appears in the doorway. Her eyes are 
           pink-rimmed. She’s been crying.

           But she doesn’t say anything. They look at each other, both 
           as laid bare as we’ve seen them. And without warning -

           JULIE pulls GABI into her arms. 

           It’s the moment we haven’t known we’ve been waiting for. 

           The moment that GABI’s skin alone doesn’t seem to burn JULIE 
           at the touch of it. The moment that the tension and space 
           between them finally melts away. It’s the moment that JULIE 
           and GABI both just let themselves fall into each other. JULIE 
           folds into and around GABI’s whole body. She’s breathing into 
           her hair, feeling the curves of her back, of her shoulders.

           It’s so deeply intimate and giving - nothing either of them 
           has let anyone see before. JULIE laughs into GABI’s neck.

                                 JULIE
                        You’re you, aren’t you?

           And the girl JULIE is holding laughs back. And in JULIE’s 
           arms everything about her feels different. She’s not GABI 
           anymore.

           She’s someone else. 

           She’s EVIE. 

           EVIE laughs, muffled, half crying. Really touching and 
           holding someone she loves. Getting to be who she really is 
           for the first time since the crash.
           She nods her head: Yes. Into JULIE’s hair, into JULIE’s neck - 
           as they keep holding each other.

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - JULIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           JULIE and EVIE lie in bed under the covers staring at each 
           other in the dark.

           JULIE traces the lines of EVIE’s face, taking every inch of 
           her in. She holds onto EVIE’s lip for a second, pulling it 
           away from the gum. EVIE smiles. JULIE smiles back. JULIE 
           looks almost high - so relaxed and comfortable. So in 
           amazement of EVIE lying next to her.

                                 EVIE
                        Tell me the truth.

                                 JULIE
                        I’ll tell you anything.

                                 EVIE
                        When did you know?

           JULIE bites her lip, thinking.

                                 EVIE (CONT’D)
                        At El Mitote?

           JULIE shakes her head. No. EVIE’s surprised.

                                 JULIE
                        I wished it before that. At the 
                        hospital, right after the crash. I 
                        knew it was wrong. We were lucky 
                        Gabi made it at all. And she was my 
                        oldest friend... but I wished every 
                        day that they’d take the bandages 
                        off and it would be you underneath.

           JULIE smiles again.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        And then I felt that again. At the 
                        diner. Your potatoes. Your soapy 
                        rosemary potatoes. You weird, 
                        perfect, strange girl. And I missed 
                        you so badly I wanted to flip the 
                        table into your face.

           EVIE smiles. So does JULIE. EVIE moves her body towards 
           JULIE’s until their noses touch.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        But it was your song. I didn’t 
                        think I’d ever hear it again.
           EVIE nods. A weight falls over them, just knowing how much 
           they’ve both had to go through to find each other again. They 
           fall into kissing. It’s intense. They can’t get enough of 
           each other. Until JULIE pulls away.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        What now?

                                 EVIE
                        This for now.

           But JULIE pulls further away, looking at EVIE.

                                 JULIE
                        Out there though. What are we going 
                        to say?

           Off the two of them lying in bed, facing one another, 
           thinking about the confusion of the future, we -

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. RADIO STATION - RECORDING ROOM - DAY

           MONTHS LATER.

           EVIE wears BIG HEADPHONES - at the RADIO STATION, sitting 
           across from RADIO HOST, who’s as glossy and shiny as ever.

           Only this time, EVIE doesn’t look so out of place. She 
           doesn’t look like a deer in headlights. She’s comfortable, at 
           ease. Smiling.

           A TRACK is just finishing playing. And we recognize the tune. 
           It’s that same little tune. The one JULIE wrote for EVIE. The 
           one that was stuck in her head all along.

           But it’s built out now, into a REAL SONG. Sung by EVIE. And 
           it’s really good. As it finishes -

                                 RADIO HOST
                        I don’t know about you guys, I’ve 
                        had this song on repeat for days. 
                        The latest track from her new 
                        album, that’s You’re Mine. 

           EVIE smiles.

                                 EVIE
                        That’s sweet, thanks so much.
                                 RADIO HOST
                        It’s out right now - produced by 
                        her longtime collaborator, Julie 
                        Meade - the one and only Gabi is 
                        back on the road with a show here 
                        in LA this week.

           EVIE smiles big. And we have our answer about what she’s 
           decided to say: EVIE is staying GABI to the outside world.

           But for the first time ever, it seems like it suits her.

           As RADIO HOST lists details of the event, EVIE turns to give 
           a little look to SOMEONE behind the glass.

           We turn to find: JULIE. Standing right where LEX did last 
           time we were here. JULIE’s beaming, in her own low-key way. 
           She can’t take her eyes off EVIE.

                                 RADIO HOST (CONT’D)
                        And you’re feeling good about the 
                        show coming up, Gabi?

           EVIE nods, warm.

                                 EVIE
                        I’ve never felt better.

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           JULIE and EVIE walk in the door, in good spirits. JULIE holds 
           the awkwardly large arrangement of flowers from the Radio 
           Station, just like GABI once did, as EVIE sifts through mail.

           She frowns at one piece. JULIE sees.

                                 JULIE
                        All good?

           EVIE looks up and smiles, tucking the mail under her arm.

                                 EVIE
                        Yep. Some stuff that got forwarded 
                        with the change of address.

           JULIE leans in and kisses her.

                                 JULIE
                        I like that my address is legally 
                        your address.

           EVIE kisses her back.

                                 EVIE
                        I like that too.
           JULIE walks towards the bedroom.

                                 JULIE
                        I’m gonna go for a quick run. We 
                        can warm up when I’m back?

                                 EVIE
                        Sounds good. Did you -

                                 JULIE
                        Sprayed my shoes. Yes.

           EVIE smiles jokily.

                                 EVIE
                        Wow everyone’s learning.

           JULIE rolls her eyes.

                                 JULIE
                        Stop thinking about my feet. Start 
                        thinking about you. Big night 
                        tonight.

           JULIE leaves for the bedroom. And EVIE looks back at the PILE 
           OF MAIL in her hand, her face falling just slightly.

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Later.

           EVIE sits on the edge of the tub looking at the mail. She’s 
           perched just how we found GABI when we met her. A glamorous 
           gargoyle in a silky robe, studying something in front of her.

           And we see what it is. An ENVELOPE from BANNER UNIVERSITY 
           HOSPITAL. It’s the MEDICAL RECORDS her and JULIE requested. 

           The medical records that could tell her about her broken arm. 
           The ones that could tell her if she was GABI or EVIE.

           She starts to open the envelope and as she does, we -

                                                       INTERCUT:

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           We’re back to MONTHS BEFORE. The night LEX and GABI got home 
           from Phoenix. 

           LEX rolls her rolly bag up towards the house, lighting up the 
           FRONT STEPS. But GABI just stares. Refusing to go further.

                                 GABI
                        I know.
           LEX looks at GABI’s steely resolve. She shakes her head, her 
           eyes filled with regret.

                                 LEX
                        I know you probably hate me. I 
                        deserve it. I should never have 
                        pushed you the way I did. I thought 
                        I was doing what was best.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           EVIE warms up, doing breathing exercises with JULIE. Working 
           on her diaphragm. EVIE looks as much like a TRUE POP STAR as 
           we’ve ever seen her. 

           All around them, the energy is buzzy and incredible.

           It’s the night of EVIE’S RETURN CONCERT. As GABI.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - FOYER - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           GABI gathers her resolve. Ready to be straight with LEX.

                                 GABI
                        I know Gabi is the one who died in 
                        the crash.

           LEX stares for a moment. She starts to look sick. Dizzy. GABI 
           is sure -

                                 GABI (CONT’D)
                        You lied to me. Again and again.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           JULIE watches EVIE warming up, encouragingly. Both of them 
           look towards the CURTAIN as a SWELL OF APPLAUSE comes from 
           the UNSEEN GATHERING AUDIENCE.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           LEX looks at her daughter for a moment. And speaks.

                                 LEX
                        I’m sorry.

                                 GABI
                        It’s all just... It’s fake.

                                 LEX
                        I’m so sorry.
           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           JULIE squeezes EVIE’s hand. Encouraging. EVIE smiles.

                                 EVIE
                        You think they’ll believe me?

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           But GABI doesn’t want to hear apologies.

                                 GABI
                        You picked the daughter who could 
                        keep your life the way it was. Even 
                        if it wasn’t the truth.

           LEX searches for how to say what she needs to say.

                                 LEX
                        Oh god.

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           Back to the bathroom and the MEDICAL RECORDS.

           EVIE pulls out the papers from BANNER UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. We 
           don’t see what they say, but her eyes scan, quickly. 

           Until they land somewhere - and stay.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           GABI continues with LEX -

                                 GABI
                        You’ve had us living this loop, 
                        this lie, everyday. Everyday, you -

           But now LEX doesn’t let her finish.

                                 LEX
                        Every day I have you. You are what 
                        I have.

           GABI is still.

                                 LEX (CONT’D)
                        Gabi.

           It’s the first time we’ve heard LEX call her by her name. 
           GABI bucks at it. Her voice rises now, ACCUSATORY -
                                 GABI
                        You kept everyone away. And you let 
                        me believe I was alone in the 
                        crash. So I wouldn’t ask questions.

           LEX is stunned, with the same expression GABI had with 
           HEATHER. Truly concerned. When she speaks, she tries to be as 
           measured as possible -

                                 LEX
                        When you came out of the coma, you 
                        screamed until you were raw. Gabi, 
                        you begged me to keep people away.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           JULIE and EVIE still hold hands.

                                 JULIE
                        They’ll love you more than ever.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           GABI doesn’t believe LEX.

                                 GABI
                        No.

                                 LEX
                        You knew Evie was in the crash. Of 
                        course you did. It was everywhere. 
                        There was no - there was no secret. 
                        There was just...

           LEX is horrified.

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           EVIE puts the papers down on the counter. She breathes. 
           Thinking hard about what she’s read.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           EVIE shakes her head.

                                 EVIE
                        You know I won’t be as good as she 
                        was.

                                 JULIE
                        You’ll be you.
           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           LEX chooses her words carefully.

                                 LEX
                        I tried to build us a world we 
                        could survive in. I took down 
                        pictures. And I stopped saying her 
                        name. And I realized that on the 
                        days we didn’t say her name, you 
                        didn’t have headaches. And I could 
                        go to the grocery store without 
                        needing to sleep for three hours. 
                        It’s what I thought we needed to 
                        build a new life. One that was just 
                        ours. I didn’t know you wrote her 
                        out of the story when you rebuilt 
                        it, Gabi. I didn’t get that.

           GABI can’t respond.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           EVIE nudges JULIE.

                                 EVIE
                        And you’ll still like me no matter 
                        what?

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           LEX continues, open and honest.

                                 LEX
                        I didn’t know this was the only way 
                        she could come out. I didn’t know 
                        that. How could I know that?

           LEX reaches into her bag. She pulls out GABI’S COMPUTER and 
           puts it next to her on the PLANTER BED. GABI is obstinate.

                                 GABI
                        That doesn’t explain it all. It 
                        doesn’t explain things.

           LEX opens the laptop and pulls up the FILE OF OLD VIDEOS. She 
           looks to GABI before clicking any.

                                 LEX
                        Gabi, I think you loved her so 
                        much.
           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           JULIE smiles.

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah you’re kind of stuck with me.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           LEX clicks one of the VIDEOS:

           It’s of TEEN GABI, rehearsing her choreography. But this 
           time, TEEN GABI goes off screen for a moment and comes back, 
           laughing. She’s holding onto: TEEN EVIE. 

           TEEN GABI wiggles TEEN EVIE’s arms, trying to get her to 
           dance. TEEN EVIE just laughs, letting TEEN GABI make her a 
           rag doll. Just two sisters being goofy. It’s painfully sweet. 

           GABI watches. Her resolve still strong.

                                 LEX
                        And you miss her.

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           EVIE puts the papers back inside their envelope. Her 
           expression inscrutable.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT - DAY

           Another SWELL of APPLAUSE from the UNSEEN AUDIENCE. EVIE 
           looks towards the curtain. JULIE lets go of her hand, with a 
           nod. IT’S TIME.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           LEX clicks ANOTHER VIDEO:

           GABI and EVIE are older. GABI sits at her PIANO BENCH, 
           noodling the keys. She’s looking at EVIE, who’s self-
           conscious, in a nearby chair.

                                 GABI (ON VIDEO)
                        How does it go? Come on.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - STAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           EVIE walks out on stage. The APPLAUSE is DEAFENING as she 
           approaches the mic.

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           EVIE picks up a box of matches. And lights one.

           EVIE’S BAND starts to play the opening notes of a SONG -

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           GABI’s eyes are glued to the video:

           GABI looks into the camera, a big smile on. Teasing.

                                 GABI (ON VIDEO)
                        She’s like a little wind up music 
                        box. I’ve gotta record it so it can 
                        be her ringtone.

           We know what the song is going to be before GABI hits the 
           first key on the piano...

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           EVIE looks up, still holding her match, and sees a small, 
           old, framed photograph - hung above the sink sweetly.

           It’s of CHILD EVIE and CHILD GABI. On the beach in Cape Cod. 
           Shoulder-to-shoulder, watching a HERMIT CRAB crawl across 
           their towel. Grinning ear to ear, they look like twins.

           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           GABI watches the video. Her face blank. Taking it in, as...

           Sitting at the piano - GABI starts to play EVIE’S SONG. 

           “You’re mine”.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - STAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           And in tune with GABI ON VIDEO, EVIE’S BAND on stage starts 
           to play along, the opening notes of “You’re Mine” -
           EXT. ORVAN HOUSE - INTERCUT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           GABI stares at the video, the truth playing out fully in 
           front of her. Is it a truth she’s known all along?

           That EVIE and GABI both knew JULIE’s song.

           GABI ON VIDEO keeps playing the song, the UNMISTAKABLE notes 
           as -

           INT. JULIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERCUT - DAY

           EVIE picks up the ENVELOPE and carefully... LIGHTS IT ON 
           FIRE. The smoke billows out the open window.

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - STAGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT

           EVIE sings along to the song, the tiniest bit shaky - but it 
           evens out. Into confidence. Calm. 

           She approaches the chorus, one we haven’t heard before. And -

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. RED MERCEDES / EXT. DESERT ROAD - FLASHBACK - DAY

           OLD GABI clicks the radio, TURNING OFF “Double Down”. She 
           puts AVRIL LAVIGNE’S “Complicated” back on.

                                 OLD GABI
                        I’m sick of hearing me.

           OLD EVIE leans back, peaceful. Listening to the music. They 
           don’t have to talk. OLD GABI watches her for a second.

           When, THE SOUND OF A HORN BLARES -

                                                        CUT TO:

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - STAGE - INTERCUT

           EVIE BELTS OUT A HIGH NOTE. An F. She hits it crystal clear.

           She closes her eyes and lets the sound of the CROWD’S CHEERS 
           come over her. 

           Who the fuck is she.

                                                        THE END.
