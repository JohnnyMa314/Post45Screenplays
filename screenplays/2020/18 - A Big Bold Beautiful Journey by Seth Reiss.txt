                                 FEMALE CASHIER (V.O.)
                        Can I help you?

           Pause.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        Yes.

           A beat.

           And we OPEN ON:

           INT. THE CAR RENTAL AGENCY--NEW YORK CITY

           We are in THE CAR RENTAL AGENCY, a cheap, bland, depressing 
           looking car rental agency on 243rd street in Manhattan. 
           Overhead florescent lights give the place a feeling like, if 
           you took someone’s picture in here, the photograph would look 
           like that person’s been dead for 3 days.

           A FEMALE CASHIER talks to DAVID KIMMEL, mid to late 30s. 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        Do you have a reservation?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, it should be under David 
                        Kimmel. I ordered a mid-size sedan 
                        with-- 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        Your car’s going to be a 1996 
                        Volkswagen Passat.

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        1996 Volkswagen Passat. That’s the 
                        only type of car in our fleet. 

                                 DAVID
                        You call it a fleet?

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        What would you fucking call it?

           David is struck by the “fucking,” and he looks at the logo of 
           The Car Rental Agency behind the cashier. 
                                 DAVID
                        Is this place really just called 
                        “The Car Rental Agency?”

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        Yeah. 

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t you think that’s a little 
                        weird? 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        Yeah. I do. I do think that’s 
                        weird.  

           Beat.

                                 FEMALE CASHIER (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, do you want the GPS with 
                        that?

                                 DAVID
                        No, I’ll just hook my phone up with 
                        a USB. 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        These cars don’t have USBs, David. 
                        There were no USBs in fucking 1996.

                                 DAVID
                        Then I’ll just listen to the GPS on 
                        my phone. 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        What if your phone craps out on 
                        you?

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        What if your phone craps out on 
                        you?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t think my phone will “crap 
                        out” on me. 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        But what if it does crap out on 
                        you? People’s phones crap out. They 
                        crap out on them all the time. 
                                 DAVID
                        My phone has never crapped out on 
                        me. 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        But say it does, David. Won’t you 
                        remember this specific 
                        conversation. And won’t you think, 
                        “Fuck me. Fuck me so very very 
                        hard.”

           David looks at the cashier, the cashier looks at him. David 
           looks around at this placid, kind of gross establishment.

                                 DAVID
                        What is this place? 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        The Car Rental Agency. You think 
                        it’s weird. 

                                 DAVID
                        I think the place is weird, I think 
                        the amount you casually swear in 
                        front of your customers is weird, 
                        and I think you’re weird. 

           Beat. No real response. 

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                        You want the GPS? 

                                 DAVID
                        Fine.

                                 FEMALE CASHIER
                             (OVERLY excited)
                        FUCK YEAH!

           David reacts to the weird excitement.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE CAR RENTAL AGENCY PARKING GARAGE--CONTINUOUS

           David stands in front of a 1996 Volkswagen Passat. A PARKING 
           ATTENDANT, about 75, sets up the GPS, and inspects the car. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        There are dents all over this piece 
                        of shit. But I know where they all 
                        are so if you add another dent I’ll 
                        know. Got it?
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        The GPS is all set up. That was a 
                        good fucking choice getting the 
                        GPS, man. Fuck yeah! 

                                 DAVID
                        There’s a lot of weird, unexpected 
                        swearing going on here. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Well, it’s a weird place. 

           David looks at his phone, and his USB chord. 

                                 DAVID
                        Kind of a bummer. I was looking 
                        forward to listening to my music on 
                        the way down. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Here at The Car Rental Agency we 
                        provide you with 7 CDs you can 
                        listen to. They include the 
                        soundtracks for the broadway 
                        productions of “Joseph and the 
                        Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” 
                        “Les Miserables--The original 
                        London Cast,” “The Pajama Game,” 
                        “How to Succeed in Business Without 
                        Really Trying,” “Fiddler on the 
                        Roof,” “Crazy for You,” and 
                        “Anything Goes.” 

                                 DAVID
                        All showtunes?

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Don’t you know and enjoy all these 
                        shows? Don’t you know all these 
                        songs word-for-word, top to bottom?

           Pause.

                                 DAVID
                        Is the Joseph and The Amazing 
                        Technicolor Dreamcoat...

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        The Donny Osmond version? 
                                 PARKING ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
                        Of course. Is there any other?

           David gets into the car. The parking attendant looks in 
           through the window. A little warmer than he was before.

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
                        Looking forward to your trip?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s a wedding. In Maryland. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        That sounds nice. 

                                 DAVID
                        For a former coworker. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        A good friend?

                                 DAVID
                        Not really. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        So why are you going to the 
                        wedding?

                                 DAVID
                        Honestly, I gotta get out of my 
                        apartment. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        No date?

                                 DAVID
                        Nope. I’m alone. Happily.  

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Me too! No responsibilities! No one 
                        telling me what to do! 

                                 DAVID
                        That’s right! You get it!

           They aggressively lock hands like brothers in arms! But 
           then...

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Now, that said, I do miss my wife 
                        who died last May with every fiber 
                        of my being.

                        We were together for 60 years and 
                        sometimes the thought of her no 
                        longer being alive literally brings 
                        me to my knees...  But, hey, 
                        nothing like being alone!

                                 DAVID
                        I did not see that coming.

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        How old are you?

                                 DAVID
                        Thirty six. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        It’s time isn’t it?

           On DAVID’S FACE. He knows exactly what the parking attendant 
           is talking about. 

                                 DAVID
                        I gotta get going. 

           David turns on the car. The GPS whirs to life with an odd 
           rotating Earth and an 8 bit fireworks display exploding over 
           the planet. The GPS’s VOICE sounds like the woman we are used 
           to hearing on a GPS. 

                                 GPS 
                        Welcome, David Kimmel. 

           David looks at the parking attendant.

                        We personalize it for you. 

                                 DAVID
                        Huh. Cool. 

           David enters the address of the wedding. 

                                 GPS
                        Exit garage and make a left onto 
                        Jay Street. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Alright, my man. I’ll seeya Sunday. 

           David Drives off.

           When we come back we see the Parking Attendant who is then 
           joined by the cashier. 

                                 CASHIER
                        That is one sad motherfucker. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        Do you think we play it fast and 
                        loose with our swearing here?

                                 CASHIER
                        Yeah, but I like it. 

                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        I like it too.

           OVERHEAD We see the Passat driving down the highway

           INT. THE PASSAT

           David drives. It’s silent and a little boring. He opens up 
           the glove compartment and sees the CDs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE PASSAT--A LITTLE LATER

           David sings the opening of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor 
           Dreamcoat

                        new...

           DISSOLVE, a passage of time. David drives.

           David takes the other disks out of the glove compartment. He 
           finds the “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” 
           soundtrack starring Matthew Broderick. He smiles at this CD. 
           He clearly has a certain affection for it. 

           A Beat.

                        making contacts/ 

           He sings the following refrain perfectly:

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (singing)

                        expense account zoo-OOOOOM. 

           David drums the steering wheel.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        This book is all that I need! How 
                        To, how to Suceeeeeeeeeed.....

           EXT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS

           David pulls into the parking lot of the hotel. 

                                 GPS
                        You have arrived at your 
                        destination. 

           David parks. He’s about to turn off the car when:

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        Have a good one!

           David looks at the GPS. That was odd. 

           He gets out of the car, stretches, gets his bag, and walks 
           into the main entrance. 

           We stay ON THE PARKING LOT. 
           A car enters the lot: ANOTHER 1996 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. We can 
           hear the same song David was just listening to from the “How 
           to Succeed in Business” soundtrack.  

           SARAH HILLAND, also mid-to-late 30s, sings along to it as if 
           continuing from where David left off. 

                                 SARAH
                        How to, How to, SUCCEEEEDDD!

           The car parks and we can hear:

                                 GPS
                        You have arrived at your 
                        destination. 

           A beat.

                        Have a good one!

           Sarah looks at the GPS. That was odd. 

           Sarah is wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette. She gets 
           out of the car. She scopes out the Holiday Inn Express. 

                                 SARAH
                        Fucking depressing.  

           She gets her bag, and walks into the main entrance. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHUTTLE TAKING DAVID TO THE WEDDING.

           David, now dressed in a suit, sits alone. He sees others get 
           on the bus. Other couples enjoying themselves. 

           EXT. THE WEDDING VENUE

           We are outside near a LAKE. David exits the shuttle. He goes 
           to the table with the guest’s name placards that indicate 
           where they sit during the reception. His single name sticks 
           out. It makes it easier to find, actually. But that’s a 
           depressing trick he’s learned.   

           He takes his card and leaves frame. 

           As he leaves, Sarah enters the same frame. Her single-name 
           placard also sticks out. She grabs it. 

           Everyone is filing down to the lake where the ceremony is. 
           David finds a single seat in the back row, alone. On the 
           other side of the aisle is Sarah, alone. David notices her. 

           The wedding begins. It’s a beautiful ceremony. And we see 
           snippets of it: the welcome, the vows, etc. There is 
           laughter, tears...

           David looks over at Sarah at one point, and she’s watching 
           stoically, but, there is a hint of a tear. He’s enamored.  

           We see the bride and groom kiss, everyone cheers, and they 
           walk up the aisle. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE WEDDING RECEPTION

           Everyone is gathered under a tent. David approaches the 
           groom, MIKE, who is already talking to Sarah. 

                                 MIKE
                        David! So glad you could make it, 
                        man. 

                                 DAVID
                        Great ceremony. I loved all that 
                        stuff about what you shout out in 
                        your sleep. Really funny. 

                                 MIKE
                        It’s fucked up right?!? I once 
                        shouted out that I wanted to 
                        strangle Amanda’s dad. I like 
                        Amanda’s dad so I dunno... 
                        Anyways... 

           Mike notices Sarah. 

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, David, this is Sarah. She’s 
                        from New York, too. 

           They shake hands. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hello. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hi. 

                                 DAVID
                        Where are you from? In the city?
                                 SARAH
                        Manhattan. You?

                                 DAVID
                        Brooklyn. 

                                 SARAH
                        Great.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you like it?

                                 SARAH
                             (not giving him much)
                        Sure.

                                 DAVID
                        I like where I live.  

                                 SARAH
                        Okay.

           So the three of them just stand there. All three at the same 
           time. Not talking.  

                                 MIKE
                        Well, I’m gonna get another drink. 

                                 DAVID
                        No you’re not. You just want to get 
                        out of here. 

                                 MIKE
                        True! It’s my wedding! I don’t have 
                        to stand in awkward groups of non-
                        talking people! Bye bye!

           He leaves David and Sarah there by themselves. Silence.

                                 DAVID
                        You know when I realized I’ve been 
                        to too many weddings alone?

                                 SARAH
                        When?

                                 DAVID
                        When I learned the trick of finding 
                        your name card. 

                                 SARAH
                        What do you mean, name card?
                                 DAVID
                        You know the one that tells you 
                        what table you’re sitting at during 
                        the reception. 

                                 SARAH
                        What’s the trick?

                                 DAVID
                        The single named ones are easier to 
                        spot because all the ones around it 
                        have two names.  

                                 SARAH
                        Huh. I hadn’t really thought about 
                        that.

           Beat.

                                 DAVID
                        You ever get tired of coming to 
                        weddings alone?

                                 SARAH
                        No.

           And she walks away. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE WEDDING RECEPTION--A LITTLE LATER. 

           Everyone is dancing, including Sarah. She looks like she is 
           having a great time. David, who is not dancing, watches her. 
           Sarah leaves the dance floor and sits a couple of tables away 
           from David. She needs a breather. They notice each other.

           Sarah lights up a cigarette. 

           Beat. (The following dialogue is somewhat shouted because 
           they are kinda far away and the music is loud)

                                 SARAH
                        I feel like you’re going to talk to 
                        me at some point so let’s get this 
                        show on the road!

                                 DAVID
                        Should I talk to you?!?

                                 SARAH
                             (weirdly chipper)
                        Probably not!
           David begins to stand... 

                                 DAVID
                             (shouting)
                        And that’s unfortunately my cue... 

           He begins walking over to her.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (still shouting)
                        to come over to your table...

           He’s much closer, but still shouts. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                         And sit next to you...right...now!

           And he sits. He’s now right in front of her face. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (still shouting)
                        HI!!

                                 SARAH
                        Cute. But stop it. 

                                 DAVID
                             (not annoying, sweet)
                        You’re tough. 

                                 SARAH
                        I am and I’m not. Aren’t you tough 
                        sometimes?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. Sure.

                                 SARAH
                        And aren’t there other times when 
                        you’re mush?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes. 

                                 SARAH
                        Just depends on the person you’re 
                        with, I guess. 

                                 DAVID
                        I bring out the tough side of you? 

                                 SARAH
                        All the good ones do.  
                                 DAVID
                        So I’m good.

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t you think you’re good, David?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. 

                                 SARAH
                        I’m not. 

           She smokes. Beat. No answer.

                                 DAVID
                        You look beautiful. Dancing. You 
                        looked beautiful. 

                                 SARAH
                        That’s not gonna untoughen me, you 
                        idiot. 

                                 DAVID
                        Well, whether it does or doesn’t, 
                        you do. 

                                 SARAH
                        Thank you. 

           Beat. Sarah looks at him, really looks at him. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You are handsome. You look handsome 
                        in your suit.

                                 DAVID
                             (slight surprise)
                        Thank you. 

           But no smile from Sarah, who nods. 

                                 SARAH
                        Everyone looks handsome in a suit 
                        though. 

                                 DAVID
                        Ha! So what do you think about Mike 
                        and Julie. Think they’re going to 
                        make it?

                                 SARAH
                        No. 
                                 DAVID
                        Jesus!

                                 SARAH
                        It’s what I think. I hope they do. 
                        I just don’t think they will. 

                                 DAVID
                        Do you believe in marriage?

                                 SARAH
                        Ugh, really? You seem smarter than 
                        this conversation.  

                                 DAVID
                        Come on, it’s kind of fun to talk 
                        about. 

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t think I could get married 
                        even if I wanted to do it. I’m 
                        meant to be alone. That’s probably 
                        best for everyone.

           Beat.

                                 DAVID
                        You know, at one point, I was 
                        totally fine never being married, 
                        and my thinking was...

                                 SARAH
                        Are you about to get reflective? 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, I’m getting a little 
                        reflective. 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s annoying, but fine. 

                                 DAVID
                        So my thinking was, “Since I’m 
                        having this thought at 34, maybe 
                        this is the thought I’ve landed on 
                        for the rest of my life.” But now 
                        I’m 36, and I’m not so sure. 

           She looks dead into his eyes. 

                                 SARAH
                        Do you want to marry me, David?
                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        Will you marry me?

           Is she serious? She looks serious. There’s almost a sense of 
           longing, like she wants him to say yes. This throws him off.

                                 DAVID
                        Um...

                                 SARAH
                        You’re terrified.  

                                 DAVID
                        I just met you. 

                                 SARAH
                        I think you’d know immediately if 
                        you’d wanted to marry me. I think 
                        you would have known when you were 
                        staring at me at the wedding. 

                                 DAVID
                        You noticed? 

                                 SARAH
                        I notice everything. 

                                 DAVID
                        Can we get dinner first?

                                 SARAH
                        No. 

                                 DAVID
                        Wow... You have destroyed some men, 
                        huh? 

           She smokes. 

                                 SARAH
                        And men have destroyed me. And I’m 
                        willing to bet, David, since you 
                        are still single, and you are 
                        handsome, and you do present as 
                        open and warm and funny, that you 
                        have done some destroying of your 
                        own.

           Pause. She’s right. 
                                 DAVID
                        You think I’m funny? 

           She rolls her eyes. 

                                 SARAH
                        I said you present as funny. Who 
                        knows what you’re really like when  
                        you’re alone and your suit is 
                        hanging in the closet, and you’re 
                        sitting on the foot of your bed 
                        wondering where the time went. 

                                 DAVID
                        That’s a pretty vivid visual. 
                        Experience that lately?

           She smokes, smiles.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s time to dance!

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t dance. 

                                 SARAH
                        I do!

           She gets up to leave and David calls out to her.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey!

           She turns around, and David, resolute, says:

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Yes. I’ll marry you. 

           And he’s serious. And she can tell he’s serious. And this 
           sincerity throws her off her game. But she plays it off...

                                 SARAH
                        Ha!!

           And she goes to the dance floor. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WEDDING RECEPTION--A LITTLE LATER

           David gets another drink at the bar. He sees Sarah dancing 
           with one of the GROOMSMEN. She’s flirting with him, heavily. 
           She doesn’t seem like the girl he was talking to earlier. 
           She seems a little, well, ditzier. And the guy she’s dancing 
           with seems like kind of a meathead.  

           David’s expression is one of, “Why him and not me?” 

           David watches as Sarah and the groomsman look intensely into 
           one another’s eyes. No doubt they are going to have sex that 
           night. And again, why him and not me, he thinks. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WEDDING SHUTTLE ON WAY BACK TO HOTEL

           David sits alone. Sarah and the groomsman sit across the 
           aisle and a few rows up from David. Sarah lays her head on 
           the groomsman’s shoulder. It stings David. Why she is she 
           being so intimate with him? 

           EXT. HOLIDAY IN EXPRESS PARKING LOT--CONTINUOUS

           David watches as Sarah and the groomsman exit the bus 
           together. 

           INT. HOLIDAY IN EXPRESS--CONTINUOUS

           Sarah and the groomsman enter the hotel and drunkenly enter a 
           room together. Before they do, David, who is just about to go 
           into his hotel room, locks eyes with Sarah. 

           And in that moment, she is more herself. The giggly person 
           she’s been acting like immediately transforms into a kind of 
           stoic sadness. She lets him see it. David waves to her. She 
           doesn’t wave back, but stares. And then, as she enters her 
           hotel room she lets out a forced laugh. Her door shuts. 

           David enters his room. His door shuts. 

           We see an empty hallway. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DAVID’S HOTEL ROOM--LATER

           Flash cuts of David getting ready for bed--hanging his suit 
           in his closet, brushing his teeth, taking his contacts out. 
           He sits on the foot of his bed, thinking. It’s silent. He’s 
           acutely alone. We can feel it. Something is building inside 
           of him. He BOLTS UP to his feet and we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY--THE NEXT MORNING

           David, looking like he’s barely slept, wheels his suitcase to 
           reception. 

                                 DAVID
                        Checking out of 108. 

           He returns the key card and we can see some DEEP BRUISES on 
           his knuckles. 

                                 CASHIER
                        And how was your stay with us?

                                 DAVID
                        Great. 

           David gets into his car. When he turns it on, the GPS makes a 
           TRUMPET sound as if a king has returned from a long trip. 

                                 GPS
                        Good morning, David!!! 

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s get the fuck out of here. 

           David punches in his apartment’s address. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DAVID’S PASSAT

           David drives in silence. 

                                 GPS
                        In 1000 feet, stay in left hand 
                        lane to merge onto I-95 North. 

           David stays in the left lane. 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        Merge onto I-95 North. 

           David Merges.

                        Remain on I-95 North for 124 miles. 

           Beat. 

           Beat. 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        124 long, arduous miles. 

           David looks curiously at the GPS. He continues driving.

           Silence.

           David continues to drive. 

           Beat.

           Beat.

           Beat.

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        David.

           David looks a little weirded out. 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        David.

                                 DAVID
                        Um, yes?

           Beat.

                                 GPS
                        David, do you want to go on a big, 
                        bold, beautiful journey?

                                 DAVID
                        What? 

                                 GPS
                        Do you want to go on a big, bold, 
                        beautiful journey?

                                 DAVID
                        Are we talking to each other?

                                 GPS
                             (loud, startling)
                        DAVID, I AM ASKING YOU A QUESTION: 
                        Do you want to go on a big, bold, 
                        beautiful journey?
           David continues to drive. 

           He looks less freaked out now and more serious. Like it’s a 
           question he needs to seriously entertain before he answers. 

           Pause. We get closer on David’s face. The beginnings of a 
           tear? 

                                 DAVID
                             (soft)
                        Yes.

                                 GPS
                        What’s that, David?

                        Yes. Yes I do.

                        What do you want to do, David?

           Tears now.

                        Say it again, David. Like you mean 
                        it. 

           Through tears:

                                 DAVID
                        I WANT TO GO ON A BIG, BOLD,

                        of passion signifying that before 
                        you die, you need to experience 
                        what it feels like to be BIG, 
                        bigger than Earth itself. No more 
                        of this “we are all specks of dust

                                 GPS
                        Turn right. Now, David. Turn right 
                        now. 

           David abruptly turns the car right. A SHOT OF THE CAR pulling 
           wildly into the turning lane, almost tipping over, re-setting 
           driving into the parking lot, and parking. 

           WE SEE DAVID. He is shocked. The car almost crashed. 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        You have arrived at your 
                        destination. 

                                 DAVID
                        What do I do now?

           No response from the GPS. 

           INT. BURGER KING INSIDE REST STOP 

           David eats at Burger King. It’s really good. He’s really 
           enjoying it. He’s eating with a weird sense of hope. 

           A tray is set down in front of him. He looks up. It’s Sarah. 

                                 DAVID
                             (surprised)
                        Hello?

           Sarah is also a little surprised, a little off her game. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hello.

                                 DAVID
                        What are you doing here?

                                 SARAH
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DAVID
                        Eating Burger King. 
                                 SARAH
                        Why are you eating Burger King?

                                 DAVID
                        I like Burger King. 

                                 SARAH
                        When’s the last time you ate Burger 
                        King?

                                 DAVID
                        Like, 12 years. 

           She sits. 

           Sarah opens up her burger and takes a bite of it. It’s good.

           David eats. 

           Silence. 

                                 SARAH
                        So, are you going back to New York?

                                 DAVID
                        Um...yeah. I may take, like, a 
                        little detour first. 

                                 SARAH
                        Oh? 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, I like scenic routes. What 
                        about you?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, I’m driving back. 

           Beat. She’s holding something back, as she does. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        But I’m not in any rush. 

                                 DAVID
                        Right. 

           They eat. Sarah watches him. And when she eats he looks at 
           her.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (a smidge judgmental)
                        Did you have fun last night?
                                 SARAH
                             (a quick snap)
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 DAVID
                        I mean did you have fun at the 
                        wedding? It’s a simple question. 

                                 SARAH
                        That’s not what you meant. Say what 
                        you meant. 

                                 DAVID
                        Did you have fun with the guy you 
                        met. Did you guys fuck? Did you 
                        cum? Did he cum? Did you swallow 
                        his cum? Did you cum on his face? 

           Sarah is nonplussed.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t remember. 

                                 DAVID
                        Fine.

           David goes back to eating.

                                 SARAH
                        What’s really on your mind?

                                 DAVID
                        Nothing.

                                 SARAH
                        You have no poker face. None 
                        whatsoever. What’s on your mind?

                                 DAVID
                        Okay. Why him and not me?

           She smiles. 

                                 SARAH
                        Question for the ages. 

                                 DAVID
                        So answer it.

                                 SARAH
                        David, you don’t want that guy to 
                        be you.
                                 DAVID
                        Yes I do! I really, really do! Once 
                        in my fucking life I want that guy 
                        to be me. 

                                 SARAH
                        Either way you’re waking up alone. 
                        The only question is: How guilty 
                        will I feel leaving you there. 

                                 DAVID
                        How guilty did you feel leaving him 
                        there? 

                                 SARAH
                        Not at all. 

                                 DAVID
                        And how guilty would you have felt 
                        leaving me there?

           She takes a bite. 

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know you very well, but I 
                        do get the sense that I don’t want 
                        to make you feel too bad. 

                                 DAVID
                        Then don’t. 

           They go back to eating. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I don’t think I want to make you 
                        feel bad either.

                                 SARAH
                        How could you make me feel bad?

                                 DAVID
                        By not giving you your due.  

           He stares at her, and she back at him. He lets that sink in.  

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        You’re formidable. Aren’t you? 
                        You’re a force.  

           On HER as she takes this in. 
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        And if you don’t want to hurt me, 
                        you must know, in the dark recesses 
                        of that addled mind of yours, that 
                        I’m formidable in some way too. 

           Does this, maybe, a touch, frighten her for a second? 

                                 SARAH
                        Eat your fucking Whopper. 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s a Double Whopper. I’m not 
                        fucking around, Sarah.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BURGER KING

           They exit the normally lit Burger King and step outside, and 
           when they do...

           EXT. BURGER KING REST STOP PARKING LOT. 

           ...there is a DRAMATIC SHIFT in the look and feel of the 
           outside. EERILY AND MAGICALLY SO. It’s as if a night fog has 
           appeared after a rainstorm.

           The parking lot is desolate. The inside of the Burger King 
           and the outside look like TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. 

           David and Sarah’s cars are the only ones that remain in the  
           parking lot. Two 1996 Passats parked next to one another. 
           They look at their cars, and then at one another. They walk 
           back to their respective cars in eerie silence. 

           When they get to their front doors, David breaks the silence. 

                                 DAVID
                        Did you get the GPS?

                                 SARAH
                        Yes. Because...

                                                          DAVID
                           SARAH (CONT'D)
           Sometimes your phone craps 
           out on you.
                                              Sometimes your phone craps 
                                              out on you.

           Pause. 
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Sarah? 

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Are you currently on a big, bold, 
                        beautiful journey?

           Beat.

                                 SARAH
                        ...Yes. You?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes. 

           They stare at each other. Maybe with a little more feeling 
           and understanding than before.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Did you think it was weird how much 
                        they swore there? At The Car Rental 
                        Agency?

                                 SARAH
                        And not angry swearing. Very casual 
                        and tossed off swearing. 

                                 DAVID
                        Weird place.

                                 SARAH
                        Very weird.

                                 DAVID
                        This is probably a weird 
                        coincidence. 

                                 SARAH
                        Totally. 

                                 DAVID
                        Um, okay, well, enjoy your big bold 
                        beautiful journey. 

                                 SARAH
                        You, too.

                                 DAVID
                        Bye, Sarah. 
                                 SARAH
                        Bye, David. 

           They both get into their cars, mildly stunned.  

           INT. DAVID’S CAR

           David turns on the ignition. 

                                 GPS
                        Recalculating.

           David drives off and waves to Sarah who doesn’t wave back, 
           but again, some longing in that face.

           David begins driving. He drives toward the BP gas station 
           that’s right before you merge onto the highway... 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        Make right turn at end of gas 
                        station. 

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 GPS
                        Make right turn at the end of gas 
                        station.

           David makes right turn.

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        Make another right turn to drive 
                        behind gas station. 

           David drives behind the gas station. He looks confused. 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        In 50 feet make a right turn in the 
                        first lane of the Burger King 
                        parking lot.

           David makes a right turn in the first parking lot lane. 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        Pull into the third spot in the row 
                        of the first parking lot lane. 

           David pulls into the third spot in the row. He’s essentially 
           made a square around the entire rest stop. And he’s back in 
           the same spot he was. Right next to Sarah’s car. 
                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        You have arrived at your 
                        destination. Pick up Sarah. 

           Sarah is standing next to her car. 

           She knows David being back means something. David knows him 
           being back means something as well. 

                                 SARAH
                        My car won’t start. 

                                 DAVID
                        Mine told me to pick you up. 

           She’s almost a little breathless, and she nods her head. 

                                 SARAH
                        Okay. 

           Sarah gets into David’s car. 

           And now we see them, in the car together--basically homebase 
           for the rest of their big, bold, beautiful journey. 

           David stares at her, she stares straight ahead. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I can tell, even though I don’t 
                        know you very well, that you are 
                        the type who would really want to 
                        dig deep and analyze what this 
                        means, but the thought of that 
                        makes me want to throw up, so can 
                        you just drive? 

                                 DAVID
                        Okay. 

           AERIAL SHOT of the car as David begins driving away from the 
           Burger King and onto the highway.

                        Stay on I-95 for 15 miles. 
                                 SARAH
                        Do you have any clue where we’re 
                        headed?

                                 DAVID
                        None whatsoever. 

           Beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        It’s interesting, isn’t it?

                                 SARAH
                        What is?

                                 DAVID
                        That we both said yes.

                                 SARAH
                        I told you I didn’t want to dig 
                        deep and analyze...

           Pause.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        But what do you mean?

                                 DAVID
                        That a machine asked us if we 
                        wanted to go on a big, bold, 
                        beautiful journey, and we both said 
                        yes. 

                                 SARAH
                        I haven’t really thought about 
                        that.

                                 DAVID
                        I feel like when you say, “I 
                        haven’t really thought about it,” 
                        you’ve definitely thought about it. 

           Silence. Sarah notices David’s bruised knuckles.

                                 SARAH
                        What happened? 

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, nothing. 

                                 SARAH
                        You didn’t have those at the 
                        wedding reception.
                                 DAVID
                        You noticed?

                                 SARAH
                        I told you, David, I notice 
                        everything.

                                 DAVID
                        So do I.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh yeah?

                                 DAVID
                        I noticed you crying at the 
                        wedding. Doesn’t seem very you. 

                                 SARAH
                        Well, you’re an idiot because it is 
                        VERY me. I’m a romantic.  

           David looks at her, like, “What the fuck?

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I am! I asked you to marry me for 
                        Christ’s sakes. At a wedding. At a 
                        beautifully lit wedding. 

                                 DAVID
                        But that was bullshit. 

                                 SARAH
                        Was it? Was it bullshit when you 
                        said you would?

           Silence.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I believe in true love, David. I 
                        just don’t believe I’m capable of 
                        giving or receiving it. 

           David gives a look, like, “Jesus Christ.”

           A SPOT LIGHT begins periodically shining through their 
           windshield and shining on their faces. It’s very bright. 

           David stretches his neck to look under the windshield to see 
           where it’s coming from.

           It’s a LIGHTHOUSE. 

           David recognizes it. 
                                 DAVID
                        Holy shit. 

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        The light’s coming from a light 
                        house. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is that weird?

                                 DAVID
                        A lighthouse in the middle of I-95 
                        with no ocean in the immediate 
                        area? Yeah, it’s weird. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is that where we’re going?

           He looks at the GPS and sees the car getting closer to the 
           checkered flag. 

                                 DAVID
                        I think so.  

           ON DAVID. He knows something, and Sarah notices. 

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Nothing. 

           EXT. I-95

           The car pulls onto the gravel area off the side of the 
           highway.

                                 GPS (V.O.)
                        You have a arrived at your 
                        destination. 

           They get out of the car and, in the middle of a pull off area 
           on I-95, is a beautiful New England lighthouse. It looks so 
           weird and out of place. Gross highway weeds are all around 
           it. And yet there is this lighthouse. It looks like a 
           surrealist painting. 

           David hears something. 
                                 DAVID
                        Do you hear that?

           Faintly, what they hear sounds like waves. 

                                 SARAH
                        What is it?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s the ocean. 

                                 SARAH
                        Where are we?

           David doesn’t respond. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Where are we, David?

                                 DAVID
                        Sarah, we are at The National 
                        Lighthouse Museum in Cape 
                        Elizabeth, Maine. 

                                 SARAH
                        Pardon?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. That’s where we’re at.

                                 SARAH
                        That’s 500 miles from where we 
                        were. 

                                 DAVID
                        Yup. Did you know the National 
                        Lighthouse Museum is not part of 
                        the National Parks Service?

                                 SARAH
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 DAVID
                        Come on. 

           David and Sarah enter the building. 

           The bottom floor is a museum dedicated to lighthouses. They 
           are approached by an OLD WOMAN.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                             (To David)
                        Are you two here for the 2:30 tour? 
                                 SARAH
                        No. 

                                 DAVID
                             (correcting)
                        Yeah, we are. I’m David Kimmel. 

           She looks on her list. 

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Ah, here you two are. David and 
                        Sarah?

           David looks at Sarah. 

                                 DAVID
                        That’s us.  

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Let’s begin then shall we. 

           They begin walking. 

                                 OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Now, most people don’t know this, 
                        but the National Lighthouse Museum 
                        is not part of the National Parks 
                        Service. 

           Sarah shoots a look at David. David looks at Sarah...

                                 DAVID
                             (to the Old Woman)
                        Oh, is that so?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        It is. It’s actually a privately 
                        funded museum by the...

           David mouths the next part of what the Old Woman says 
           directly to Sarah as if he’s filling in the rest of her 
           sentence. 

                                                          DAVID
                                                (mouthing along)
                        OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
           ...Cape Elizabeth Historical 
           Society.
                                              ...Cape Elizabeth Historical 
                                              Society

           Sarah is in disbelief. 

                                 SARAH
                        Are you some sort of weird 
                        lighthouse freak?
                                 DAVID
                        Nope.

                                 SARAH
                        What’s going on? 

                                 DAVID
                        Not yet. I kind of like seeing you 
                        on your heels a little bit. 

                                 SARAH
                        I hate being on my heels. 

           The Old Woman continues the tour. 

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        So, do either of you know what a 
                        lighthouse is used for?

           Pretty obvious question. 

                                 SARAH
                        Um...to help captains of ships 
                        steer their boats at night?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        That’s correct. Very good Very 
                        good. Let’s continue...

           She walks them into a small room.

                                 OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        This is a room with pictures of 
                        different light houses. 

           ON THE PHOTOS of light houses. 

                                 OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Over there is a glass case with a 
                        bunch of miniature lighthouses.

                        And we are currently in a light 
                        house. 

           Beat.

                                 OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        And that’s the end of the tour. 
                        Questions?
           David and Sarah look at one another. Sarah points to a 
           picture of a light house on the wall.

                                 SARAH
                        Is that a picture of a light house?

           David stifles a laugh. 

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Yes.

                                 SARAH
                             (to David)
                        You get that?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Well, I’ll let you two walk to the 
                        top by yourselves. I’m too old, and 
                        it’s a view that’s best shared in 
                        private.  

           David and Sarah walk up the spiral staircase to the top of 
           the lighthouse. As they walk up...

                                 SARAH
                        David, do you think I’m the type of 
                        person who likes walking up a lot 
                        of steps to get to the top of 
                        something?

                                 DAVID
                        I would assume you are not. 

                                 SARAH
                        You’d be correct.

           They keep walking up the steps. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Um, so that tour was not the--

           And they get to the top. It’s sunset, it’s beautiful, and the 
           breathtaking view stops Sarah from saying whatever she was 
           about to say. 

           They are looking out over the coast of Maine. They have a 
           view of the what feels like the entire ocean before them. And 
           behind them it’s gross I-95. It’s surreal. 

           They take it all in. 
                                 DAVID
                        It’s amazing isn’t it. 

                                 SARAH
                        It is. It is entirely amazing. 

           David looks at Sarah enjoying the view. He smiles, and then 
           looks out towards the ocean some more. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You want to tell me what the fuck 
                        is going on?

                                 DAVID
                        I came here three years ago. I was 
                        on a trip by myself through Maine. 
                        Same woman, same tour.  

                                 SARAH
                        Why were you by yourself?

                                 DAVID
                        I travel by myself all the time. 

                                 SARAH
                        Me too. 

                                 DAVID
                        Sort of a romantic idea of travel, 
                        right? Doing it by yourself? You 
                        pack all these books. Novels. Big 
                        novels. And you plan to read and 
                        think and observe, like you’re 
                        fucking Walt Whitman.  

                                 SARAH
                        Right. And make friends with 
                        locals. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve never made a friend with a 
                        single local. 

                                 SARAH
                        I’ve slept with locals. Many 
                        locals. But never made a friend 
                        with one. 

           David smiles at her. 
                                 DAVID
                        And no matter where you travel, 
                        right, you always end up going to 
                        the top of something and looking 
                        down at something. Each place has a 
                        thing like that. You go all the way 
                        to the top and you look out and 
                        down and you’re supposed to have 
                        some sort of epiphany about who you 
                        are and where you are in life and 
                        how you’re going to move forward.

                                 SARAH
                        And did you have an epiphany the 
                        last time you were here? 

                                 DAVID
                        No. What I did was I walked to the 
                        top, looked out at the ocean for 
                        about three seconds, and walked 
                        right back down to my car and left. 

                                 SARAH
                        You didn’t take it all in.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t think I was really able to. 

                                 SARAH
                        What about now? Are you able to 
                        now?

           He looks at her, smiles, and then back out at the ocean.

                                 DAVID
                        Absolutely. I think I’m taking it 
                        all in. 

           They take a seat on a bench and look out at the ocean. And 
           the sunset is incredible and we can hear the waves lapping up 
           against the rocks. And we see these two people, not touching, 
           but sitting next to one another, sharing something. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Did you like it? The National 
                        Lighthouse Museum?

                                 SARAH
                        I’d say the tour was a little 
                        lackluster, but yeah...
                             (lets her guard down)
                        I loved it.
           Beat. Sarah, as always when she actually puts herself out 
           there, is more timid when she asks:

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                             (Insecure)
                        What about you? Did you like it? 
                        This time?

           David smiles big at her.  

                                 DAVID
                        I loved it. It was fun taking that 
                        tour with you. Really fun.  

           Sarah ekes out a smile and nods. 

           Beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Also, you’re funny, Sarah. 

                                 SARAH
                        Thank you.

           Long beat. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You’re not. 

                                 DAVID
                        HA!!

                                                              CUT TO:  

           INT. THE PASSAT

           David and Sarah get back in the car and turn on the ignition.

                        Where the fuck are we going now?

                                 DAVID
                        No clue.

           They drive off. After driving for a little bit, Sarah looks 
           in the glove compartment and sees all the CDs from broadway 
           productions. She takes them out, looks at David, and...

                                                                CUT TO:
           Both sing along to “Sunrise, Sunset,” from Fiddler on the 
           Roof. Very in character.

                        Is this the little girl I carried. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is this the little boy at play. 

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t remember growing older.

           In olden days, a glimpse of 
           stocking
           Was looked on as something

                        It’s a great fucking song. 

           A beat...David begins brightly singing...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Wonder of wonders, Miracle of 
                        miracles...
           The GPS cuts him off. 

                                 GPS
                        In .5 miles, you will arrive at 
                        your destination. 

           David turns the radio down. They look at each other. What 
           will happen next? 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        Your destination is on the right.

           The car pulls off the side of the road. 

           Again, like the lighthouse appeared to be out of place in the 
           middle of a highway pull-off section, this building does too. 
           They are the only car in front of it. 

           Sarah looks at the building.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh. 

                                 DAVID
                        What is this place?

           Beat. She looks at the GPS, as if to say, “How the fuck...” 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s the Chicago Art Institute. 

           She’s deeply affected, and then wipes that feeling away. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Alright, lets go. 

           INT. CHICAGO ART INSTITUTE. 

           They are the only ones in the museum, except for the staff. 
           It’s eerily quiet, but also peaceful. David goes to the line 
           to buy tickets. Sarah stops him. 

                                 SARAH
                        I’m a member here. 

           She reaches into her wallet to get her ID. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        And I have a bunch of unused guest 
                        passes. 

                                 DAVID
                        Okay. 
           Sarah shows her ID to a security guard, it scans...

                                 SARAH
                        And one guest. 

           The guest pass is scanned. 

           They enter the IMPRESSIONISTS wing.

                                 DAVID
                        What are we doing here, Sarah?

                                 SARAH
                        We’re going to look at paintings. 
                        What else would we be doing here?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, but clearly...

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t push me, David. It always 
                        comes out, just don’t push me. 

           David smiles and nods.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay. Let’s look at paintings then. 

           David looks at paintings. Sarah watches him. She’s fighting 
           back what she wants to say, but then she just says it. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hey, David? 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

                                 SARAH
                        What I’d like to do is this: I’d 
                        like, in each room, if we looked at 
                        the paintings by ourselves and then 
                        we came together in the middle of 
                        the room and said our favorite 
                        painting. Does that sound stupid?

                                 DAVID
                        No, of course not. 

                                 SARAH
                        It sounds kind of fun, right?

                                 DAVID
                        I think it sounds great.
                                 SARAH
                        Okay, let’s do that then. 

                                 DAVID
                        Okay. 

           We see a nice, long scene of them quietly walking around an 
           exhibition room and looking at paintings. It kind of plays 
           out like a choreographed slow ballet of looking at a painting 
           and moving to the next one. When Sarah gets to Renoir’s 
           “Girls at the Piano,” she takes a moment and looks at it 
           deeply. David sneaks a glance at her and she moves on. David 
           moves to the next painting as well. And Sarah sneaks a glance 
           at him. She looks at him with warmth and then concern. Who is 
           this guy supposed to be in my life?  

           They finish looking at all the paintings. David is on one 
           side of the room, Sarah on the other. And then they take 6 or 
           seven uniform steps and meet in the middle. 

                                 SARAH
                        Okay, so what’s your favorite?

                                 DAVID
                        This is going to sound cliche. 

                                 SARAH
                        There are no wrong answers, David. 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s the--

                                 SARAH
                             (like a buzzer)
                        EH. WRONG. 

                                 DAVID
                        You’re an asshole. 

                                 SARAH
                        Sorry, what’s your favorite?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s the Van Gogh self portrait. 

           Angle on the painting. It is incredible.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        It’s amazing isn’t it? 

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, it’s entirely amazing. 
                                 DAVID
                        What about you?

                                 SARAH
                        I like Monet. The one of the 
                        haystack.

                                 DAVID
                        You took a long time looking at 
                        another one though, the one with 
                        the two girls at the piano. 

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        So what about that--

                                 SARAH
                        It always comes out. Don’t push...

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, but...

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t push, DAVID.

           They go to the next room, and look at paintings. One catches 
           David’s eye, and he looks at it more carefully. We don’t see 
           what he sees. He moves on...They meet in the middle. 

                                 DAVID
                        So what’s your favorite?

                                 SARAH
                        My mom died. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not sure that one’s hanging in 
                        this room. 

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t joke. 

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry. 

                                 SARAH
                        No jokes now. 

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.
                                 SARAH
                        She died. When I was 19. I’m from 
                        here. I grew up around here. In Oak 
                        Park. I’d come to this museum with 
                        my mom every Sunday...and then when 
                        she died I’d come here every 
                        week...

                                 DAVID
                        Alone?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry.

           She makes a little gesture like, “Whaddaya gonna do?”

           Pause.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Well, my mom’s alive!

                                 SARAH
                        Oh, great!

                                 DAVID
                        Yup! Not dead. 

                                 SARAH
                        That’s so awesome for you!! 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, it really is. When I call 
                        her, she answers because she’s 
                        alive. 

                                 SARAH
                        I remember doing that. When My mom 
                        was alive. Calling and her 
                        answering. She’d talk to me because 
                        she was alive.  

                                 DAVID
                        And now when you call her... 

                                 SARAH
                        She doesn’t answer because my mom’s 
                        dead. 

                                 DAVID
                        Right. Now my dad on the other 
                        hand...
                                 SARAH
                        Dead?

                                 DAVID
                        No, also alive. 

                                 SARAH
                        My dad, I think he’s alive. But I 
                        wish he were dead. 

                                 DAVID
                        Ha!

                                 SARAH
                        No, that’s not a joke. That’s real.

           Beat. Both become serious.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        It is nice to share this place with 
                        someone again.

           She takes in the paintings. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, what’s your favorite 
                        painting in this room?

                                 DAVID
                        The one that’s moving.

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        The one that’s moving. Come here...

           David takes Sarah to the Pissarro painting, “The Boulevard 
           Montmartre on a Winter Morning.” They look closely at it, and 
           it’s clear the people in the painting and the horse drawn 
           carriages are moving. Sarah and David look at one another. 

                                 MUSEUM GUARD (O.C.)
                        Would you like to step into the 
                        painting?

           PAN OVER to reveal a Museum Guard watching David and Sarah.

                                 DAVID
                        What?
                                 MUSEUM GUARD
                        Usually we don’t let people touch 
                        the paintings, but today we are 
                        allowing members and their guests 
                        to step inside them. 

           Silence. 

                                 MUSEUM GUARD (CONT'D)
                        So would you two like to step 
                        inside the painting?

           David and Sarah look at the painting, each other, and smile. 

                           DAVID
                                                          SARAH
           Yes.
                                              Yes.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Have you ever been to Paris? 

                                 DAVID
                        I have. 

                                 SARAH
                        Alone?

                                 DAVID
                        Alone.

                                 SARAH
                        Me too.  

                                 DAVID
                        Well...let’s go to Paris together. 

           And they step into the painting. The following sequence looks 
           like the Pissarro oil painting they are in. And they can tell 
           they look like paintings. It’s very weird, but cool. 

           Also, all of the following dialogue is in French. It’s 
           subtitled. 

                                 SARAH
                        Holy fuck. 

                                 DAVID
                        You just spoke French.

                                 SARAH
                        So did you. 

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t speak French. 
                                 SARAH
                        Neither do I.

                                 DAVID
                        What should we do? 

           Sarah smiles. 

                                 SARAH
                        I know exactly what we should do.

           David smiles.

                                 DAVID
                        Up?

                                 SARAH
                        Up. 

           And they walk the streets of Montmartre in 1890s Paris, the 
           cold chills them and Sarah clutches David close, and there 
           they are, in Paris, walking together. 

           And they go up, up, up until they reach Sacre Coeur, the 
           iconic church overlooking the entire city. 

                                 DAVID
                        What do we do?

                                 SARAH
                        We do what people do when they go 
                        to the tops of things.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s that?

                                 SARAH
                        We take it in. 

           So they sit on the steps of Sacre Coeur, and they look out 
           over the city. There they are, again, sitting together. But 
           this time David takes Sarah’s hand, and she rests her head on 
           his shoulder.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s amazing isn’t it?

                                 SARAH
                        It’s entirely amazing. 

           Beat. The following is delivered soft and sweet, and still in 
           French:
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        The Renoir painting...from 
                        before...that was my mom’s favorite 
                        painting. 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s a beautiful painting. 

                                 SARAH
                        Yup... It always comes out, David. 
                        Eventually. I just need a minute. 

           Beat.

                                 DAVID
                        Sarah?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah?

                                 DAVID
                        I was kidding before. My mom is 
                        dead. 

                                 SARAH
                        No she’s not. 

                                 DAVID
                        You’re right she’s not. 

           Beat.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re funny, too.

           And they sit there and they stare some more. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                             (abrupt)
                        Okay, I’m freezing, how do we get 
                        the fuck out of this painting?

           They look at a street lined with horses and buggies and 
           amidst all of them... is their Passat. 

                                 DAVID
                             (shocked)
                        Motherfucker. 

           They get into the Passat. 

                                 GPS
                             (in French)
                        Recalculating. 
           They drive the Passat according to the directions. Lots of 
           lefts and rights, as it’s in Paris. 

           WE SEE A SHOT OF THE PAINTING from INSIDE THE MUSEUM and we 
           see a tiny Passat driving inside of it. 

           The GPS guides them...towards the Seine river. Sarah and 
           David can tell they are driving towards the river. But they 
           just instinctually trust the GPS...

                                 SARAH
                        David?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, Sarah?

                                 SARAH
                        Are we about to die in an 
                        Impressionist painting?

                                 DAVID
                        I have no clue. If it’s okay, 
                        though, and if you don’t think I’ll 
                        come off to un-manly, I am going to 
                        scream at the top of my lungs the 
                        closer we get to this river. 

                                 SARAH
                        I understand, and I’ll join you. 

           They are closer to the river and driving. The GPS is not 
           showing any directional changes. 

                           DAVID
                                                          SARAH (CONT'D)
           Ahhhhhh!!!!!
                                              Ahhhhh!!!!!

           The “Ahhhhh!!!!!”s Are subtitles exactly like that. 

           And at the moment it appears they are about to fly into the 
           river they are BACK ON I-95.

           They are both shellshocked. Silent. They exchange a look with 
           one another....and then stare straight ahead...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (in a mangled, weird 
                              french accent)
                        Now that is something...
                             (correcting himself)
                        We don’t speak French anymore. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. PASSAT--A LITTLE TIME HAS PASSED

           Cut to a little later...

                                 DAVID
                        Favorite movie?

                                 SARAH
                        Moonstruck. 

                                 DAVID
                        So good. 

                                 SARAH
                        The whole dinner scene at the 
                        end...

                                 DAVID
                        Olympia Dukakis...

                                 SARAH
                        She’s so beautiful and sturdy and 
                        vulnerable at the same time (to 
                        herself) How do you do that?

                                 DAVID
                        Why are you single?

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Why are you single? You’re 
                        wonderful.

                                 SARAH
                        No I’m not. 

                                 DAVID
                        You are.

                                 SARAH
                        I cheat, David. I cheat all the 
                        time. Even when I don’t want to 
                        cheat I cheat. Even when I know the 
                        man is perfect, I cheat. 

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 SARAH
                        I’m always looking for a way out. 
                        Cheating lets me feel like I’m not 
                        anchored down.  
                                 DAVID 
                        You know, sometimes anchoring can 
                        be a good thing. It keeps you from 
                        drifting. 

           She’s getting irked. Who the fuck is this guy...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I mean, I bet there’s a deeper 
                        reason why you don’t want to be 
                        anchored down...

                                 SARAH
                             (snaps back)
                        You always want to overanalyze. 
                        Maybe the answer is simple. Maybe 
                        because being alone is great. Maybe 
                        because the idea of coming home to 
                        someone like you every night makes 
                        me want to break out into fucking 
                        hives. Maybe because it’s nice not 
                        to have to worry about anyone but 
                        myself.

                                 DAVID
                        I get it...

                                 SARAH
                        Why are you single, David? Huh?

                                 DAVID
                        I--

                                 SARAH
                        You’re there dispensing advice so 
                        you must have it all figured out. 
                        Why are you single?

                                 DAVID
                        Look, I didn’t mean--

                                 SARAH
                        No, come on, expert. You’re 
                        moderately handsome and moderately 
                        funny, pretty moderate across the 
                        board if you ask me, which 
                        unfortunately is basically the bar 
                        for a lot of women, so why are you 
                        single?

                                 DAVID
                        Sarah...
                                 SARAH
                        Maybe you’re a little fucked up, 
                        too? Huh? You present as kind and 
                        together, but I’m looking at a 37 
                        year old man who seems to be 
                        yearning to settle down but hasn’t. 
                        And in my experience, when a man 
                        wants to settle down, he settles 
                        down. So what’s wrong with YOU?

                                 DAVID
                        I like being alone too.

                                 SARAH
                        But not like me. You need people. I 
                        can tell. You’re weak. 

                                 DAVID
                        You’re acting like a cornered 
                        animal right now. I was just trying 
                        to get to know you better.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re right. I just said what I 
                        felt, and it was brutal and I guess 
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 DAVID
                        You guess or you are...

                                 SARAH
                        I guess.

           She takes out a cigarette and lights it. 

                                 DAVID
                        Here’s what I do know, we’re not 
                        old, but lately I’ve been feeling 
                        like I’m on the razor’s edge of not 
                        being young anymore. Like a new 
                        phase is about to begin, and I’m 
                        not ready for it. Not even close.

                                 SARAH
                        Well, I’m fine. 

                                 DAVID
                        Bullshit. 

                                 SARAH
                        We’re all fine, David. Everyone’s 
                        fine. No one’s dying. Everyone’s 
                        fine. 
                                 DAVID
                        But you’re wrong, Sarah... We are 
                        dying. 

           She laughs and looks at him. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (serious)
                        We are. 

           Beat. He’s serious. And perhaps he’s right.

                                 DAVID
                        Holy shit...

                                 SARAH
                        Let me guess? Your high school. 

                                 DAVID
                        Go Falcons. 

           INT. CONNELLSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL--NIGHT

           Sarah and David enter the high school. It’s bustling. 
           Students and adults are headed into the auditorium. The scene 
           looks very familiar to David, who is jaw-dropped shocked.  

                                 DAVID
                        No fucking way...

                                 SARAH
                        What?

           David sees a flyer on the ground and he picks it up. It’s for 
           opening night of Connellsville High School’s 2001 spring 
           musical “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.” A 
           calendar on the wall indicates that tonight is opening night…

                                 DAVID
                        This can’t be. 

           The school’s musical director MERLE STUTZMAN approaches 
           David, frantic. 

           NOTE:During this sequence, David does not look 16. Everyone 
           just treats him as if he is 16. 
                                 MERLE
                        David, what are you doing? Why 
                        aren’t you in costume?

                                 DAVID
                        Mr. Stutzman? 

                                 MERLE
                        Yes. 

                                 DAVID
                        You’re dead. 

                                 MERLE
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        You’re dead. I went to your 
                        funeral...in 2005.

                                 MERLE
                        That’s only four years from now. 

           He can tell Merle looks horrified. 

                                 DAVID
                        I could be wrong. Maybe it was 
                        someone else.  

                                 MERLE
                        Look, I don’t know if this is some 
                        pre-show routine you’re doing, but 
                        the show starts in 30 minutes.

           David looks at Sarah, and then back at Mr. Stutzman. 

                                 DAVID
                        How old am I?

                                 MERLE

           David looks at Sarah. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m 16 years old.

                                 SARAH
                        Cool. 
                             (to Stutzman)
                        How old am I?

                                 MERLE
                        40? 
                                 SARAH
                        Fuck you, dude. 

           At this point, David drifts away from both of them, and looks 
           down a corridor where students who are part of the musical 
           are frantically getting their wardrobe, putting on makeup, 
           etc. David hones in on a 16 YEAR OLD GIRL...

           Back on Stutzman and Sarah.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Wait, do I look like I could be his 
                        mom?

                                 MERLE
                        Aren’t you? 

                                 SARAH
                        I’m gonna be the one who kills you 
                        four years from now. 
                             (shouting over to David, 
                              who is looking at the 
                              girl)
                        Thus far, David, this is my least 
                        favorite stop! 

           She walks over to David and sees him staring down the hall. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Who’s that?

                                 DAVID
                        Lauren Schroyer. She plays 
                        Rosemary.

                                 SARAH
                        Who do you play?

                                 DAVID
                        J. Pierpont Finch. 

                                 SARAH
                        I fucked our J. Pierpont Finch. 

                                 DAVID
                        You did this show?

                                 SARAH
                        No. Musical groupie. 

           David continues looking down the corridor at the girl. 
                                 DAVID
                        Before we go on for the song, “Been 
                        a Long Day,” I tell her I love her. 

                                 SARAH
                        You really are a romantic. 

                                 DAVID
                        She says, “I don’t love you. I love 
                        Geoff Turosak.” And I’m devastated. 

                                 SARAH
                        Who’s Geoff Turosak. 

                                 DAVID
                             (aggressive, percussive)
                        Fucking asshole college freshman 
                        prick who treats her like shit.

                                 SARAH
                        Whoa. Are you okay right now?

           He looks at her, almost as if in pain. 

                                 DAVID
                        I feel like I felt that night...But 
                        this time I know she’s going to 
                        destroy me all over again. 

                                 SARAH
                        Maybe don’t tell her you love her. 

                                 DAVID
                        I have to. 

                                 SARAH
                        You said you know she’s not going 
                        to say she loves you back.

                                 DAVID
                        But maybe she will. 

                                 SARAH
                        She won’t. 

                                 DAVID
                        I have to tell her. 

           At this point, the musical director whisks David away to hair 
           and makeup. Sarah watches him go down the corridor.  

                                 SARAH
                        Idiot. 
           But maybe her face says otherwise.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Brave idiot. 

           INT. CONNELLSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL--BACKSTAGE MAKEUP ROOM

           And there is David, a man getting makeup alongside 15 and 16 
           year olds. He’s getting ready to be in a high school musical.

                                 DAVID
                             (to a boy he’s sitting 
                              next to)
                        Eric Swink?

                                 ERIC
                        Dave, why are you saying my full 
                        name?

                                 DAVID
                        I dunno... You finger Jennifer 
                        Hodge tonight.

                                 ERIC
                        Cool.

           Eric leaves.

           FRONT OF THE HOUSE. Sarah takes a seat in the back of the 
           auditorium. The pit orchestra is warming up. She sits next to 
           SOME RANDOM DAD.

                                 SARAH
                        How old do I look?

                                 RANDOM DAD
                        40? 

                                 SARAH
                        Fuck you, dude.

           BACK STAGE. David is doing vocal warmups in a rehearsal room. 
           Lauren finds him. He stops cold. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hi. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Hi. I thought you might be back 
                        here. 
                                 DAVID
                             (remembering)
                        This is where I come. Before the 
                        show. And this is where you come to 
                        find me. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Yeah. 

                                 DAVID
                        It feels so normal. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Why wouldn’t it? 

                                 DAVID
                        You look beautiful, Lauren. You 
                        were always so beautiful.

                                 LAUREN
                        Thank you, David. You look 
                        handsome. In your suit. Have fun 
                        out there.

           She leans in and kisses him tenderly on the cheek, but it’s a 
           somber kiss. Almost like a goodbye kiss. And David can tell. 

                                 DAVID
                        You, too. 

           FRONT OF THE HOUSE. The lights come down, and the pit begins 
           to play the overture for “How to Succeed in Business Without 
           really Trying.” When the overture is over, the curtain parts, 
           and everyone eagerly awaits the lead to come on stage for the 
           opening number. David, stands horrified in the wings. 

                                 ERIC
                        Dude, what the fuck are you doing? 
                        Get out there. 

                                 DAVID
                        My name is David Kimmel and I am a 
                        16 years old boy and I am the lead 
                        in our high school musical.

                                 ERIC
                        Are you saying that to yourself or 
                        are you saying that to me?
                                 DAVID
                        Both. Do you know the part in the 
                        Bourne Identity when Jason Bourne 
                        is able to be an assassin even 
                        though he doesn’t remember that he 
                        is one?

                                 ERIC
                        What’s Jason Bourne. 

           David takes a confident beat. 

                                 DAVID
                        This is Jason Bourne. 

           And David, among all these 15 and 16 year olds, steps out 
           onto the stage, holding the PROP BOOK titled, “How To Succeed 
           in Business Without Really Trying.” He looks at the audience 
           in silence and the audience looks at him.

                                 SARAH
                             (to herself)
                        Jesus Christ. 

           He takes one more beat, and then... goes into it.

                                 DAVID
                             (singing)
                        How to apply for a job.
                        How to advance for the mail room.
                        How to sit down on a desk.
                        How to dictate memorandums.

           And as he sings, he gingerly nails the choreography at first 
           until he realizes, he knows this shit!

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (singing)
                        How to develop executive style.
                        How to commute in a three bottom 
                        suit,
                        With that weary executive smile.

           David starts to really get into it. And we see Sarah in the 
           audience, pretty impressed. He begins waltzing with the prop 
           book, and then triumphant. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (singing bigger, more 
                              confident)
                        This book is all what I need.
                        How to... How to... succeed...

                                                                CUT TO:
           We see snippets of David acting in the musical. He’s having a 
           great fucking time. This man among children just killing it. 

           Sarah loves it. 

           INT. CONNELLSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM--A LITTLE LATER

           David is backstage watching a scene from the wings. And he 
           finds himself backstage with Lauren before the song, “Been a 
           Long Day”...He’s nervous, but he’s going through with it. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, before we go out there, I just 
                        want to say...

                                 LAUREN
                        David...

                                 DAVID
                        Lauren, I love you. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Thank you. 

           ON DAVID, who is just fucking devastated. 

                                 DAVID
                        I knew you’d say thank you. And I 
                        knew when you said thank you I’d 
                        want to bash my head into that 
                        wall. 

                                 LAUREN
                        David, I care about you, but...

           David joins her for this next part because he’s heard it 
           before. 

                          LAUREN (CONT'D)
           Geoff and I are going to try 
           to make it work and look I 
           know he can be awful 
           sometimes, but I have to try.
                                                          DAVID
                                              Geoff and I are going to try 
                                              to make it work and look I 
                                              know he can be awful 
                                              sometimes, but I have to try.

           Lauren is shocked that David joined her word for word.

                                 LAUREN (CONT'D)
                        How did you--

                                 DAVID
                        Why do you have to try? I’m right 
                        here. You don’t have to try. You 
                        don’t have to work. I’m right here. 
           The STAGE MANAGER brings them center stage. They are behind a 
           scrim so the audience doesn’t see them getting into place. 
           They sit across from one another on set.  

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t you pick me? Why can’t 
                        you pull the trigger on me? 

                                 LAUREN
                        I don’t want to be with you David. 
                        Not now anyway.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 LAUREN
                        I don’t know. 

                                 DAVID
                        You two break up in 6 months. 

                                 LAUREN
                        That doesn’t change how I feel now 
                        though. 

                                 DAVID
                        WHY??

           The scrim lifts. David and Lauren are now visible to the 
           audience. Lauren is in character, but David isn’t done. The 
           scene begins:

                                 LAUREN
                             (blushing)
                        J. Pierrepont Finch, why are you 
                        looking at me that way? 

           Long silence. ON DAVID, who looks stoic, close to enraged, 
           like we saw in the beginning of the movie when he bolted up 
           from his hotel bed. 

           ON SARAH in the audience. She notices...

                                 SARAH
                             (quietly to self)
                        Oh fuck. 

           And she says to the guy next to her...

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        This is gonna be good. 

           Lauren repeats the line, this time more nervous who looks to 
           be in a seething rage. 
                                 LAUREN
                        J. Pierrepont Finch, why are you 
                        looking at me that way?

                                 DAVID
                        He breaks your heart. 

                                 LAUREN
                             (breaking character)
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Geoff. He breaks your heart. He 
                        fucks Amanda Soisson during Easter 
                        break. 

           Cut to a girl in the audience, presumably Amanda Soisson. 

                                 LAUREN
                        David, what are you doing?

                                 DAVID
                        You also don’t get into The 
                        American Academy of Dramatic Arts. 
                        You go to a Penn State branch 
                        campus, and you end up a dental 
                        hygienist. You marry Tyler Hopkins. 

           Cut to Tyler Hopkins in the wings. He looks weirded out. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        And then you get divorced to Tyler 
                        Hopkins. 

           Cut back to Hopkins. 

                                 TYLER HOPKINS
                        I can’t imagine myself getting 
                        married or divorced at this point 
                        but now I guess I will do both 
                        things. 

                                 DAVID
                        Your life fucking sucks…Why don’t 
                        you love me? Why don’t you give a 
                        shit about me?

           And then Lauren looks at David, and she doesn’t seem 16 
           anymore. She almost seems part of the big, bold, beautiful 
           journey, part of whatever unseen force that’s guiding David. 
           Lauren appears dead eyed, but severe. 
                                 LAUREN
                        Why do you keep going where you’re 
                        not wanted? Isn’t that a better 
                        question to ask? Why are you going 
                        after something you know you can’t 
                        have? After someone who refuses to 
                        love you. 

           And that lands like a hammer. And David knows she’s right. 

           ON SARAH...she knows Lauren is right, too. And perhaps this 
           is why our David is single. He can’t pick em.  

           Sarah also sees that David is devastated. 

           With that, the conductor begins the song because the show 
           must go on. And the character who plays SMITTY sings...

                                 SMITTY
                        Now she’s thinking...

           And this is where Lauren is supposed to sing, but instead of 
           singing, she calmly gets up, and we can hear the footfalls of 
           her character shoes as she walks off stage. David is left 
           sitting there, destroyed. 

           Not knowing what to do, Smitty repeats...

                                 SMITTY (CONT'D)
                        Now she’s thinking...

           There is a pause...David continues to sit there... 

                                 SMITTY (CONT'D)
                             (more nervous)
                        Now she’s thinking...

           From the back of the auditorium we hear...

                                 SARAH (O.C.)
                             (singing the song)
                        I wonder if we take the same bus.

           And all the heads in the auditorium turn IN UNISON to Sarah 
           And David and Sarah lock eyes. 

                                 RANDOM DAD 
                        Why are you singing? You’re not in 
                        the show. 

                                 SARAH
                             (to him)
                        Shutup. He’s in trouble.  
                                 SMITTY
                             (singing)
                        And he’s thinking...

           Beat...and then...

                                 DAVID
                        There could be quite a thing 
                        between us. 

                                 SMITTY
                        Now she’s thinking...

                                 SARAH
                        He really is a dear. 

                                 SMITTY
                        And he’s thinking...

                                 DAVID
                        But what of my career. 

                                 SMITTY
                        And she says...

                                 SARAH
                        Hmm.

                                 SMITTY
                        And he says...

                                 DAVID
                        A hum, heh...Well it’s been a long 
                        day. 

           Sarah and David together:

                                 SARAH AND DAVID
                        Well, it's been a long,
                        Been a long, been a long,
                        Been a long day.

           David softly smiles...and then...out nowhere...the ENTIRE 
           AUDIENCE SINGS...

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Well it’s been a long day. Well 
                        it’s been a long, been a long, been 
                        a long day. 

           David and Sarah are like, “What the fuck?” Sarah makes a 
           gesture with her head, like, “Let’s get out of here.”
           The audience is totally quiet and watches as David nods, gets 
           off his seat, walks into the audience and down the aisle. 
           Sarah joins him and they are at the auditorium door.

           It’s again, totally quiet. 

                                 SARAH
                             (to David)
                        Again?

                                 DAVID
                        Sure. 

           They both cue the audience:

                                 DAVID, SARAH, ENTIRE AUDIENCE
                        Well it’s been a long day. Well 
                        it’s been a long, been a long, been 
                        a long day.

           And David and Sarah leave the auditorium. And run to the car. 

           INT. PASSAT--CONTINUOUS

                                 DAVID
                        How did you--

                                 SARAH
                        A good musical groupie knows all 
                        the songs. 

                                   DAVID
                        Well, thank you for the save.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re welcome.

           They drive off.

                        Recalculating. 

           INT. PASSAT--A LITTLE TIME HAS PASSED

                                 DAVID
                        Do you want to listen to anything? 
                        We haven’t even touched this 
                        “Chorus Line” CD.

                                 SARAH
                        She wasn’t wrong, you know? 
                                 DAVID
                        Who?

                                 SARAH
                        Lauren.

                                 DAVID
                        How so?

                                 SARAH
                        You make life hell for yourself.

           David is silent. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        David, if you go where you’re not 
                        wanted... 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not that she didn’t want me, 
                        it’s--

                                 SARAH
                        No that’s exactly what that was. 
                        She didn’t want you. 

                                 DAVID
                        She did. She just didn’t know it. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is she with you now? Are you 
                        married to Lauren Schroyer? 

           This stings a little. David is silent. She keeps going. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I mean, why not put yourself in a 
                        situation where you’ll be happy 
                        rather than go so hard after one 
                        where you know you’ll get 
                        destroyed? 

           David is silent. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I asked you a question. 

           Pause.

                                 DAVID
                        I guess, if I’m being honest, maybe 
                        I don’t feel happy in situations I 
                        should feel happy in.
                                 SARAH
                        Well, like I said earlier, you’re 
                        fucked up, David.

                                 DAVID
                        Isn’t this exactly what you do?

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Go after the wrong thing?

                                 SARAH
                        Yes! It’s exactly what I do. But I 
                        knowingly avoid the right thing.

                                 DAVID
                        Isn’t that fucked up?

                                 SARAH
                        Oh it’s entirely fucked up. But I 
                        know it. I go after the wrong thing 
                        because I don’t have any 
                        expectation it’ll end up being 
                        right. That groomsman at the 
                        wedding? That was wrong. But he’s 
                        not going to disappoint me. It’s 
                        when the right thing goes wrong, 
                        that’ll fucking kill ya. 

                                 DAVID
                        What if it doesn’t go wrong? 

                                 SARAH
                        IT ALWAYS GOES WRONG, DAVID. A man 
                        you love with everything you’ve got 
                        cheats, or a dad leaves, everyone 
                        does what they’re not supposed to 
                        do, and you’re the fucking idiot 
                        because you put your faith in 
                        these...people. These tremendously 
                        flawed people. And the worst thing 
                        is, they’re fine. The people who do 
                        the hurting they’re fine. They go 
                        on, they live their lives, and you 
                        carry around the pain they caused. 

                                 DAVID
                        So you avoid good things because 
                        they might turn bad, and I go after 
                        bad things because I hope they’ll 
                        turn good. I guess we’re doomed, 
                        huh?
                                 SARAH
                        You’re still doing it.

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        Saying “we,” “us,” you’re hoping so 
                        hard that it’ll change. It won’t 
                        change. Not now. We baked in who we 
                        are in our 20s and 30s and now 
                        we’re set. We’re too old.  

           This lingers in the air. Long pause. It seems like the scene 
           is going to end. Like Sarah has won this battle. And then...

                                 DAVID
                        I disagree.  

           The GPS starts to GLITCH a little. 

                                 SARAH
                        What’s going on?

                                 DAVID
                        I dunno. 

           David taps it two times. It comes back. It’s fine...for now. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Huh.

           EXT. I-95--SOME TIME HAS PASSED 

                                 GPS (V.O.)
                        You have arrived at your 
                        destination. 

           The car pulls off the side of the road in front of what 
           appears to be a HOSPITAL. 

           INT. PASSAT--CONTINUOUS

           Sarah is silent. 

                                 DAVID
                        What’s this one? 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s for me.

           She takes a beat. 
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Alright, let’s go. 

           INT. HOSPITAL--CONTINUOUS

           We follow Sarah and David into the hospital. She knows 
           exactly where she’s going--what hallways to go down, what 
           elevator banks to use. She’s been here before. David remains 
           silent. He can feel that this is serious. 

           They get into an elevator, Sarah pushes a floor number. They 
           are silent during the elevator ride. 

           The elevator opens and Sarah walks to the nurse’s station. 
           The nurse NAN knows her.

                                 NAN
                        Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        Hi, Nan. This is David. 

                                 NAN
                        Hello, David. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hi. 

           Sarah looks at the Word of the Day calendar on Nan’s desk and 
           notes the date. She closes her eyes and takes a breath.

                                 SARAH
                        Just curious, Nan, how old do I 
                        look right now?

                                 NAN
                        17, 18? 

                                 SARAH
                        Awesome. And how old does he look?

                                 NAN
                        40?

                                 SARAH
                        Perfect.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m 37

                                 NAN
                                 NURSE
                        I’ll get Dr. Vernon. Why don’t you 
                        two take a seat. 

           They walk over to a to a couple of empty seats in the waiting 
           room. David and Sarah sit. 

                                 DAVID
                        What’s happening here? 

                                 SARAH
                        I can tell you one thing, David, 
                        this big, bold, beautiful, journey 
                        fucking sucks. 

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 SARAH
                        What’s about to happen is going to 
                        be rough. 

           David grabs her hand and Sarah jerks it away. He doesn’t let 
           her, though, and he grabs it again and won’t let go. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You’re a glutton for punishment.

                                 DAVID
                        That might be true, but I’m not 
                        going anywhere. 

           A doctor comes out. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hi, Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        Hi, Dr. Vernon. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        How’s everything at school?

                                 SARAH
                        I’m probably fucking a lot of 
                        people I shouldn’t. Can we get to 
                        it?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Sure. Your mom passed away about 
                        two hours ago. 

           Sarah nods at the doctor and keeps her composure, BUT ON HER 
           HAND AND DAVID’S she has noticeably increased her grip.
                                 SARAH
                        Was she comfortable? That’s what 
                        people ask right? 

                                 DOCTOR
                        She was. 

                                 SARAH
                        No pain?

           She squeezes David’s hand harder. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        None.

                                 SARAH
                        Fucking swear? 

                                 DOCTOR
                        I fucking swear. 

                                 SARAH
                        Did um...

                                 DOCTOR
                        No, your father hasn’t been here in 
                        months. 

           Harder squeeze of the hand. 

                                 SARAH
                        So she was alone when she died?

                                 DOCTOR
                        I assure you she was on a lot of 
                        medication. 

                                 SARAH
                        So, she was alone when she died?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes. Do you want to see her?

                                 SARAH
                        Can you give me a minute?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Absolutely. 

           The doctor leaves Sarah and David alone in the waiting room. 

           Beat.
                                 DAVID
                        I gotta say, it’s pretty fucked 
                        that I get to relive my high school 
                        musical...

                                 SARAH
                             (through tears)
                        ...And you kind of nailed it. 

                                 DAVID
                        I did. Nail it. I really did, but 
                        it’s not very fair that you have to 
                        relive the moment you were told 
                        your mom died. 

                                 SARAH
                        I’m not reliving it. This is 
                        happening for the first time. 

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        The day she died, I didn’t come to 
                        the hospital. I avoided it. 

           Beat.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        When I got the call that she was 
                        going to go soon, I didn’t come. 
                        You know where I went?

                                 DAVID
                        The Chicago Art Institute.

           He’s exactly right. 

                                 SARAH
                        Who are you? Why aren’t you getting 
                        in the car and getting the fuck 
                        away from me?

           He raises her hand up to his mouth and kisses her hand.

                                 DAVID
                        Because I’m doing the complete 
                        wrong thing, obviously. And also, 
                        if I leave you here I’m not sure if 
                        I’m leaving you in some sort of 
                        netherworld where everything 
                        collapses into a wormhole.

           And now she pulls her hand away. 
                                 SARAH
                        I’m a monster.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re not. 

                                 SARAH
                        I fucking am. I’m a coward. 

                                 DAVID
                        You’re here now.  

                                 SARAH
                        This isn’t real.

                                 DAVID
                        Isn’t it? 

           Beat.

                                 SARAH
                        I need to take a walk. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll be here when you get back. 

           And she looks into his eyes and she knows he will be. 

           And then Sarah takes David’s hand and kisses it. 

           From David’s perspective, we see Sarah talk to the doctor. 
           She goes through the double doors, and we follow her to the 
           outside of a room, presumably her mother’s. We see Sarah 
           through the glass of the room. She is about to enter, but 
           walks out of frame. A few beats and then, she comes back into 
           frame, opens the door, and enters her mom’s room. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SARAH’S MOM’S ROOM--CONTINUOUS

           We can’t even really make out Sarah’s mom because of the 
           number of tubes going in and out of her body. We do see a few 
           photos of her and her mom that were presumably placed in the 
           room to make it more pleasant. 

           Sarah stands as far away from the bed as possible, and looks 
           at her mom. As she says the following she gets closer and 
           closer to the bed. 

                                 SARAH
                        You know what I’m remembering right 
                        now? It’s so weird.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        But all I’m thinking about right 
                        now is the time that “Big” was 
                        supposed to be on TV one night 
                        after swim practice. Do you 
                        remember that? It was supposed to 
                        be on TBS, and it was a big deal 
                        when a movie was on TV because we 
                        didn’t have HBO. And I remember 
                        saying to you, “Mom, what I really 
                        want is to come home from swim 
                        practice and eat mashed potatoes 
                        while I watch ‘Big.’” And do you 
                        know what you said? Without 
                        hesitation, without a hint of 
                        annoyance,  you said, “Sure thing, 
                        sweetheart.”... You were never 
                        going to say no. That word never 
                        crossed your mind. And then when I 
                        asked you to sit and watch the 
                        movie with me, you stayed through 
                        the whole thing. You just...gave... 
                        Why couldn’t I have been more like 
                        you?

           She gets into her mom’s bed. She’s the small spoon to her 
           mother’s big one. She puts her mom’s arm around her body.

           Silence. 

           Long beat.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I met a boy, mom. I’d love to talk 
                        to you about him. He’s here. I get 
                        the sense he’ll always be here if I 
                        let him...

           Through the glass windows she sees someone who looks like 
           HERSELF walk past. Her hair is up though, she looks younger--
           an actual 19-year old Sarah.

           Curious. 

           Then she sees another someone who also looks like herself 
           walk past the window. This one looks a little older, closer 
           to Sarah’s current age. 

           What?

           She kisses her mom’s hand that’s around her and gets up from 
           the bed...
           EXT. SARAH’S MOM'S ROOM--CONTINUOUS

           She leaves the hospital room and when she leaves THE HALLWAY 
           HAS CHANGED. It’s almost as if she is in a different building 
           altogether. 

           Sarah sees a door at the end of the hallway. She enters. 

           INT. NEW WAITING ROOM--CONTINUOUS

           It’s a totally empty waiting room except for two people, TWO 
           SARAHs, who are waiting to be called. There is some FAMILY 
           PLANNING literature around, etc.  

           SARAH 1 looks younger, like, 21. And SARAH 2 looks closer to 
           Sarah’s current age. 

           Sarah isn’t even shocked when she sees them. She gives them a 
           head nod, they nod back, and she plops down in between them. 

           She holds Sarah 1’s hand with her right hand. She holds Sarah 
           2’s hand with her left hand. 

           And the three just sit there in silence. 

           A nurse enters, looks at her clipboard and says...

                                 NURSE
                        Sarah?

           The Sarah’s indicate that Sarah 1, the younger one, should go 
           ahead. Sarah 1 gets up, goes to the nurse, and before she 
           goes with the nurse, looks back and says:

                                 SARAH 1
                        Why are we here alone?

           ON the TWO other Sarahs as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM--CONTINUOUS

           Sarah, our Sarah, is walking back to the waiting room and 
           David is there with an exorbitant amount of gifts: bouquets 
           of flowers, a huge teddy bear, chocolates, mylar balloons...

           Sarah smiles. 

                                 SARAH
                        How much money did you spend?
                                 DAVID
                        About 600 dollars. But I’m not sure 
                        if this big, bold, beautiful 
                        journey is real or not real so I’m 
                        not sure if I actually spent the 
                        money. 

                                 SARAH
                        You know we’re not taking any of 
                        this with us. 

                                 DAVID
                        I know. 

                                 SARAH
                        Except this guy, we’ll take this 
                        guy.

           She picks up the huge teddy bear.

                                 DAVID
                        What about the chocolates?

                                 SARAH
                        Does the food we eat on the big, 
                        bold, beautiful journey have real 
                        calories?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know.

                                 SARAH
                        Let’s bring it.

           David grabs the bear, and begins to walk away...

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        David?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah?

                                 SARAH
                        Thank you for being here.

                                 DAVID
                        Of course. 

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 SARAH
                        I miss Paris. 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah we haven’t been to the top of 
                        anything and looked down at 
                        anything in a while.

                                 DAVID
                        The onslaught continues. 

                                 SARAH
                        This is like Jumanji. It seems fun 
                        at first, but it’s just horrifying.

           Pause. Silence.

                                 DAVID
                        Robin Williams killed himself. 

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. 
                             (little beat)
                        Wait, why did you say that?

                                 DAVID
                        You said “Jumanji” and that’s the 
                        only thing I was thinking about.  

                                 SARAH
                        “Mrs. Doubtfire.”

                                 DAVID
                        Yup. Same.

                                 GPS
                        There is an alternate route, one 
                        that is filled with much beauty, 
                        but will add some time to your 
                        journey. Would you like to take it?
                                 SARAH
                        I think we could use that, don’t 
                        you?

                                 DAVID
                        Definitely.

                        What?

                                 GPS
                        In (gibberish) minutes. 

                                 DAVID
                        Whatever, let’s just enjoy the 
                        drive. 

           TIME PASSES. They are driving. And the exterior looks 
           beautiful. Almost otherworldly. Like they are driving on a 
           highway through the majesty of the Grand Canyon and the 
           cherry blossoms of Washington D.C. have just bloomed.

           Sarah looks relaxed and is looking at the window. 

                                 SARAH
                        Where are we?

                                 DAVID
                        I have no idea...You okay?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah...Thanks for asking.

           She looks back out the window. For the first time they look 
           like two people who know one another on a road trip. 

           It’s quiet. No music. All we hear are the occasional rivets 
           in the road. 

           A few beats and then Sarah, while still looking out the 
           window, says:

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I lied before. I don’t like going 
                        alone.
                                 DAVID
                        To where?

                                 SARAH
                        Weddings. 

           And David continues driving. 

           ON THE GPS, again we see some GLITCHING happening. 

           TIME PASSES...

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Hey, what do you do?

                                 DAVID
                        Huh?

                                 SARAH
                        Like, for work, what do you do?

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, um, like, media stuff. Stuff 
                        with media. You?

                                 SARAH
                        Me too. Yeah. Media stuff. 

                                 DAVID
                        ...great.

                                 SARAH
                        Yup.

           TIME PASSES...

                                 DAVID
                        Do you ever get lonely?

                                 SARAH
                        Classic out-of-nowhere David 
                        question. 

                                 DAVID
                        Well do you?

                                 SARAH
                        Not really.

                                 DAVID
                        Me neither...Do you ever get tired 
                        of being alone?
                                 SARAH
                        What’s the difference?

                                 DAVID
                        Big difference. Loneliness is dark. 
                        Bleak. Sometimes necessary. Being 
                        alone can be rich and fulfilling.  

                                 SARAH
                        So you like being alone...

                                 DAVID
                        I do...but I feel like I want to be 
                        able to tell someone about stuff 
                        now? You know? I want to tell 
                        someone about stuff that happens to 
                        me when I’m alone. And maybe I’d 
                        like to ask someone to come along 
                        once in a while. 

           ON SARAH, and we read on her face that she absolutely gets 
           it, but, classic Sarah says...

                                 SARAH
                        I guess I’ve never really thought 
                        about it like that. 

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t think that’s true at all. 

                                 SARAH
                        I think you give me too much credit 
                        for what I think about and don’t 
                        think about. 

                                 DAVID
                        I think I give you the correct 
                        amount of credit. I think you gotta 
                        lot going on in there. 

           Sarah looks at him. 

                                 SARAH
                        Do you remember at Burger King when 
                        you called me formidable?

                                 DAVID
                        I do.

                                 SARAH
                        That was one of the most lovely 
                        things anyone has ever said to 
                        me...And I didn’t know it was true 
                        until you said it. 
           TIME PASSES...

                                 GPS
                        You have arrived at your 
                        destination.

           The Passat is outside of a pristine, sterile building that 
           could only be described as a futuristic scientific facility. 
           Think something out of 2001.  

                                 SARAH
                        What is this place?

                                 DAVID
                        I have no idea. 

           INT. THE F.D.C.C.F.W.W.H.D.A.W.T.C.D.A.A.T.D.K

           They are greeted by a terse-seeming nurse. Very angular. Very 
           crisp. Very Norwegian.

                                 NURSE
                        Are you David Kimmel? 

                                 DAVID
                        I am. 

           Another nurse, basically identical to the first, comes up 
           from behind David and stabs him in the neck with a needle. He 
           falls into the arms of two orderlies who appear out of 
           nowhere to catch his fall. 

           ON SARAH. 

                                 SARAH
                        Huh. 

                                 NURSE
                        Are you Sarah Hilland?

                                 SARAH
                        Yes.

           She immediately looks to the side to see if anyone is about 
           to inoculate her. Nothing. 

                                 NURSE
                        Come with me? 

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sorry. Where are we?
                                 NURSE

                        .K.

                                 SARAH
                        Uh huh. Which is?

                                 NURSE
                        The Formal Dating Complaint Center 
                        For Women Who Have Dated And Wish 
                        To Complain Directly About And To 
                        David Kimmel. 

           Sarah looks around. 

                                 SARAH
                             (matter of fact)
                        Fun. Where am I going? 

                                 NURSE
                        To our observation deck. 

           The screen goes BLACK.  

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK

           We hear a massive switch turning the lights ON. From David’s 
           POV it’s blurry at first and as it comes into focus we see a 
           stadium-style symposium-like room filled with women. 

           Then we reveal David, who in a hospital gown. He’s on the 
           stage looking out at the crowd. He’s shackled to a wall and 
           splayed out as if someone were about to throw knives at him.  

           He’s also hooked up to electrodes. 

           A distinguished older looking doctor, think Max von Sydow, 
           slowly walks to the middle of the stage, addresses the women, 
           and says...

                                 OLDER DOCTOR
                        You may begin. 

           And he slowly walks off stage. 

           A woman stands. 

                                 WOMAN 1
                        Why did you ghost me?

                                 DAVID
                        Amy?
                                 WOMAN 1
                        Why did you ghost me? We went out 
                        over five times. We had sex. Why 
                        did you ghost me? 

                                 DAVID
                        Um...

                                 OLDER DOCTOR
                        Answer the question. 

                                 DAVID
                        I just thought it had fizzled. 

           The doctor flips a switch. An electric current shocks David. 

                                 OLDER DOCTOR
                        Answer the question, honestly. 

                                 DAVID
                        You didn’t really like me.  

           Another shock. 

                                 OLDER DOCTOR
                        Honestly. 

                                 DAVID
                        I didn’t want to disappoint you.

                                 WOMAN 1
                        And yet I was extremely 
                        disappointed. Also, my name’s not 
                        Amy. 

           ON SARAH, who is like, “What a fucker.”

           Another Woman, WOMAN 2 steps up.  

                                 WOMAN 2
                        Do you remember how you felt when 
                        you broke up with me?

                                 DAVID
                        I was devastated.

           A shock. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Relief. I was relieved. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        Why?
           David doesn’t want to answer. 

                                 WOMAN 2 (CONT'D)
                        WHY?

                                 DAVID
                        I felt burdened. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        But you made such a show in the 
                        beginning about letting me in and 
                        sharing your life with me...so I 
                        thought you wanted me to be present 
                        in your life.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re right.

                                 WOMAN 2
                        And when I was...

                                 DAVID
                        I pulled back.

                                 WOMAN 2
                        So...I never had a chance...Fuck 
                        you.

           Woman three stands.

                                 WOMAN 3
                        Fuck you, David.  

           Woman 4 stands

                                 WOMAN 4
                        Fuck you, David. 

           Woman after woman stands, and there is a cacophony of “Fuck 
           You’ Davids” it builds and builds and then one woman comes 
           forward, ANDREA, and the cacophony stops. 

                                 DAVID
                        Andrea.

                                 ANDREA
                        Hi David. 

           David can’t help but smile. 

                                 ANDREA (CONT'D)
                        I loved you. I would have married 
                        you. 
                                 DAVID
                        I know. 

                                 ANDREA
                        You asked, remember? It was a 
                        “joke,” proposal, early on in our 
                        relationship, but you said at a 
                        time when we were very much in 
                        love. 

                                 DAVID
                        I remember... At your coworker’s 
                        wedding in Savannah.  

           ON SARAH, who reacts.

                                 ANDREA
                        It’s a cruel thing to dangle out 
                        there, David. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m very sorry. 

                                 ANDREA
                        So why did you end things with me?

                                 DAVID
                        Because you were perfect for me and 
                        I was too scared. 

           ON THE OLD DOCTOR.... No switch flip...that’s the truth.

                                 ANDREA
                        Do you get lonely, David? 

           David looks up at Sarah. And back to Andrea...

                                 DAVID
                        No.

           A shock.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Yes.

                                 ANDREA
                        And whose fault is that?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know.

           A shock.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Mine...It’s my fault... I’m sorry. 

                                 ANDREA
                        Apologize to all of us.

                                 DAVID
                        I’M SORRY EVERYONE! I’M FUCKING 
                        SORRY!

                                 ANDREA
                        We don’t accept. You should know 
                        better. 

           Andrea steps aside revealing an OLD WOMAN in her 70s.

           Silence again. 

           David squints. 

                                 DAVID
                        Mom?

           David’s MOM doesn’t answer. She just walks up the steps, 
           stands in front of her son, and then calmly rears back and 
           CLOCKS DAVID SQUARE IN FACE. HARD. 

           And David is, again, unconscious. 

                                 SARAH
                        Did not see that coming. 

                                                              FADE OUT:

           FADE IN:

           INT. PASSAT--A LITTLE TIME HAS PASSED

           Sarah is driving. David is passed out in the seat next to 
           her. He has pretty brutal-looking BLACK EYE. 

           He eventually comes to...

                                 DAVID
                        I think my mom punched me in the 
                        face. 

                                 SARAH
                        You deserved it. 

           Beat.
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        So not only do you go after women 
                        who don’t love you... 

           David looks at Sarah. That stung.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        But you destroy and reject the 
                        women who do.

           Pause.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You might be worse than me. At 
                        least I never pretend to be 
                        charming, and warm, and a good 
                        listener, and whatever this act is.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not pretend...

                                 SARAH
                        You like the beginning, but, like a 
                        fucking child, you can’t handle the 
                        middle...

                                 DAVID
                        I’m ready to figure that out now.

                                 SARAH
                        That’s exactly what someone like 
                        you would say to someone like me. I 
                        mean, hypothetically, after this 
                        entire thing is over, say we start 
                        dating and get married and have 
                        kids... 

                                 DAVID
                        I’d be terrified of hurting you.

                                 SARAH
                        You think I’m going to be one of 
                        those women at the 
                        F.D.C.C.F.W.W.H.D.A.W.T.C.D.A.A.T.D
                        .K. 

                                 DAVID
                        Absolutely not. 

           Silence...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Sarah?
                                 SARAH
                        Yeah?

                                 DAVID
                        Do you really not love me?

           No answer...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I’m going back to sleep now. 

           David falls asleep. 

           INT. PASSAT--LATER

           When David wakes, the car is turned off and in a suburb. 
           Sarah, behind the wheel watches a MAN emerge from the house. 
           He’s taking out the trash. 

                                 DAVID
                        Where are we?

           Sarah seems deeply affected by the sight of this man. A tear 
           wells in her eyes. She looks at the GPS.

                                 SARAH
                        You are something else.

                                 DAVID
                        Who is that?

                                 SARAH
                        Come on. You got yours. So it’s 
                        time to get mine. 

           They get out of the car, walk up to the front steps, and 
           Sarah knocks on the door. 

           The MAN opens it up. He’s shocked. It’s as if all his blood 
           has left his face and all his air has traveled down his body 
           and out through his toes. 

           He hugs her. She wasn’t expected that. 

                                 MAN
                        Come in. 

           INT. THE MAN’S HOUSE. 

           All three of them sit at a table. The man doesn’t take his 
           eyes of Sarah. He’s intense. And for this entire scene Sarah 
           is definitely on her heels in a way we haven’t seen. 
                                 MAN
                        Start. 

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 MAN
                        Start. Go. 

           Beat.

                                 SARAH
                        I am so sorry. 

                                 MAN
                        You just left. 

                                 SARAH
                        I know. I’m so sorry. 

                                 MAN
                        We were together for two years, and 
                        you just left. In the middle of the 
                        night. Didn’t return a phone call 
                        or a text. 

                                 SARAH
                        It was a horrifying thing to do. 

                                 MAN
                        I assume you had an abortion. Or do 
                        I have a daughter I don’t know 
                        about.  

           Beat.

                                 SARAH
                        I had an abortion. 
                             (to David)
                        I’ve had two. The first one made 
                        sense... the second one...

                                 MAN
                        Why are you telling him?

                                 SARAH
                        He should know, I dunno...

                                 MAN
                        What happened to his eye?

                                 DAVID
                        My mom punched me in the face. 
                                 SARAH
                        We’re on a big, bold, beautiful 
                        journey. It sucks. 

                                 MAN
                        You left me in the middle of the 
                        night and you had an abortion. 
                        Clean slate, right? You’re totally 
                        free? 

                                 SARAH
                        Something like that.

                                 MAN
                        Do you feel free?

           No response.

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        Why would you do that to someone?

                                 SARAH
                        Because I’m messed up. 

                                 MAN
                        You’re 37. Figure your shit out. 
                        You had a bad dad who left. Lots of 
                        people have bad dads who leave. I 
                        had bad dad who left.

                                 DAVID
                        My dad was bad and he stayed, so...

                                 SARAH
                        David.

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry. 

                                 MAN
                        Figure out why you’re fucked up and 
                        fix it before you hurt more people. 
                        That’s what adults do. 

                                 SARAH
                        I’m doing that. I think.  

                                 MAN
                        I loved you with all my heart. I 
                        gave you everything I’ve got. 

                                 SARAH
                        I loved you, too. 
                                 MAN
                        When did you stop? No, that’s the 
                        wrong question. Why. Why did you 
                        stop. 

           She just stares at him. 

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know. I’m not good at this. 

           She sees a photo of the Man with his 2-year-old son. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Are you a good dad?

                                 MAN
                        Yes, and husband. 

           DAVID reacts to that. He admires the confidence.

                                 SARAH
                        I knew you’d be great. At both.  

                                 MAN
                        I didn’t. You would have been a 
                        good mom, too. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hopefully I still will be some day?

                                 MAN
                        If you choose to be, you will. You 
                        can make good choices. You are not 
                        doomed to make bad ones, Sarah. 

           Pause. On David, who reacts to that. 

                                 MAN  (CONT'D)
                        Did you cheat?

                                 SARAH
                        Not physically. 

                                 MAN
                        Emotionally’s worse. With who? 

                                 SARAH
                        An idiot. 

                                 MAN
                        Did you get the dopamine hit you 
                        wanted out of that?

           She nods. 
                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        How long were you checked out 
                        before you left?

           Sarah doesn’t answer. 

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        Come on, you came all this way. How 
                        long? 

                                 SARAH
                        4 months. 

                                 MAN
                        Why didn’t you talk to me? 

                                 SARAH
                        You would have broken my heart in 
                        some way. If I didn’t break yours 
                        first. 

                                 MAN
                        Ha! No I wouldn’t have. 

                                 SARAH
                        Yes you would have. 

                                 MAN
                        No I wouldn’t have! 
                             (beat)
                        So who’s right? We don’t know what 
                        will happen until it happens. Until 
                        that time, we live in uncertainty. 

                                 SARAH
                        I can’t handle that. All the bad 
                        stuff happens in uncertainty. 

                                 MAN
                        All the good stuff happens in 
                        uncertainty, Sarah. My marriage 
                        happened in uncertainty. My baby 
                        was born in uncertainty. We, you 
                        and me, fell in love in 
                        uncertainty. If you run away from 
                        uncertainty you’re just running 
                        away from life! 

           Pause. ON DAVID AND SARAH...

                                 SARAH
                        I’m really sorry. 
                                 MAN
                        I forgive you.

           Silence.

                                 SARAH
                        Is this it? Are we done here?

                                 MAN
                        We’re done. 

                                 SARAH
                        I thought you were going to unload 
                        on me. 

                                 MAN
                        I did. I just didn’t do it the way 
                        you thought I would.

                                 SARAH
                        I want you to yell at me. I want 
                        you to tear into me. I deserve it.

                                 MAN
                        No.
                             (to David)
                        Good luck. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--CONTINUOUS

           They exit the house and Sarah is walking very fast to the 
           car. David lags behind. 

                                 SARAH
                        Let’s go!

                                 DAVID
                             (calling after her)
                        Do you want to talk about that?

                                 SARAH
                        Not everything needs to be fucking 
                        talked about, David. You were in 
                        there. You saw it. Like I said, I’m 
                        a monster.

                                 DAVID
                        No one’s a monster, Sarah. 

                                 SARAH
                        You’re delusional. Still want to be 
                        on a big, bold, beautiful journey 
                        with me?
                                 DAVID
                        Yes. Do you still want to be on a 
                        big, bold, beautiful journey with 
                        me? 

                                 SARAH
                        NO!

           This stings. She can tell. She gets into the car.

           INT. PASSAT--CONTINUOUS

                                 SARAH
                        Your whole...approach is naive, 
                        like a 4-year-old. 

                                 DAVID
                        I think your approach is cynical. I 
                        think this part of you 
                        is...extremely unattractive. I 
                        think it’s fucking ugly. 

           David turns on the car. The GPS doesn’t turn on. It just 
           says, “ENTER DESTINATION.”

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (to self)
                        That’s new.

                                 SARAH
                        Well, it’s the most defining part  
                        of me. You asked why I’m single? 
                        Because I run away. From 
                        everything! I couldn’t even show up 
                        to my mom’s hospital bed!  

                                 DAVID
                        You thinking this is your most 
                        defining characteristic is part of 
                        your problem. 

           He smacks the GPS, which still just says, “Enter 
           destination.”

                                 SARAH
                        What do you think my most defining 
                        characteristic is? 

                                 DAVID
                             (angry)
                        YOUR EYES!
           He hits the GPS AGAIN. ON SARAH-huh, that was unexpected and 
           nice.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (to self)
                        What the fuck is going on with this 
                        thing? 

                                 SARAH
                        You think that line’s gonna get me 
                        to change how I’m wired?

                                 DAVID
                             (to GPS)
                        Hey! Tell us where to go.
                             (to Sarah)
                        Sarah, see, that’s the difference 
                        between you and me: I think this 
                        whole thing is about us coming 
                        together and you think this whole 
                        thing is about us learning we 
                        should be apart! 

                                 SARAH
                        David, we are DOOMED.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you love me?

                                 SARAH
                        It doesn’t matter. 

                                 DAVID
                        Of course it matters! We can make 
                        different choices if we choose to 
                        make different choices. 

                                 SARAH
                        We’re DOOMED.

                                 DAVID
                        WE ARE NOT FUCKING DOOMED!

           He grabs the GPS off the console and slaps it, bangs it...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (to GPS)
                        Fine!

           He aggressively punches in a destination. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (to GPS)
                        YOU HAPPY?!?
                                 GPS (V.O.)
                        Recalculating. 

           This surprises David and Sarah. It took his destination. It’s 
           quiet in the car. He puts the GPS back on the console. 

                                 SARAH
                        David, where are we going? 

           David just looks at her, and then pulls away from the street. 

           Time passes. They are on the highway driving in silence. 

           It’s tense. 

           Sarah sees the end flag on the GPS and sees that their car is 
           heading towards it. 

           They exit. They are on a rural road. The road is going up a 
           hill. It feels like a massive hill. They keep going up, up, 
           and up.

           And Sarah looks out her window and she sees...stars? At eye 
           level? Just floating there.  

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Where are we going, David?

           They get to a clearing. 

                                 GPS
                        You have arrived at your 
                        destination. 

           David parks. He turns the car off. 

           Silence for a few beats.

                                 DAVID
                        What if our biggest problem is that 
                        we’re stuck in our own heads. That 
                        we’re so aware of everything and 
                        who we typically are and what we 
                        typically do, that we can’t choose 
                        the goodness that’s right in front 
                        of our faces.

           There is a cliff about 20 feet in front of them. They are 
           surrounded by these stars. Sarah watches David get out of the 
           car, walk to the cliff, and sit down. We don’t see what’s in 
           front of him. 
           Sarah gets out of the car. She is stunned. In awe. She is 
           surrounded by stars and touches one. It pulsates. She gets to 
           the end of the cliff, and sits next to David. 

                                 SARAH
                        What did you type in the GPS?

                                 DAVID
                        Outer space. 

           And now we see what’s in front of them--A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF 
           EARTH.

                                 SARAH
                        Why did you type that?

                                 DAVID
                        We seem to do well when we go to 
                        the tops of things and look down at 
                        things. 

           She nods.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s always quieter, huh?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. More clear.

           She puts his arm around him and he puts his arm around her. 
           They look at the view.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        It’s amazing isn’t it?

                                 SARAH
                        It’s entirely amazing. 

           Beat.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry for earlier. Of course I 
                        want to be on a big, bold, 
                        beautiful journey with you.  

           They look at the Earth, and in this moment these two people, 
           who would typically be insignificant from space, are very 
           significant, very important. And the planet looks small.  

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Hey.

           And he turns toward her, they look at each other, and, with 
           the Earth in background, they kiss. 
           They watch the sun come up.  

                                 DAVID
                        Shall we?

                                 SARAH
                        We shall. 

           And they walk back to the car hand in hand. 

           End of Act 2.

           INT. PASSAT

           They turn on the car and GPS whirs to life again. 

                                 GPS
                        Welcome David and Sarah. 
                        Recalculating. You will arrive at 
                        1004 Lake Drive in 35 minutes.

                                 DAVID
                        That address sounds familiar. 

                                 SARAH
                        Isn’t it...

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. 

           They smile at one another. 

           We see various shots of the Passat driving on the highway.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        We’re gonna have to change 
                        somewhere. 

                                 SARAH
                        I know a Burger King on the way 
                        where we can stop.

           The car pulls into the Burger King from the beginning of the 
           movie right next to Sarah’s Passat, which is still in its 
           spot. 

           They get out of the car and take a second to look at the two 
           cars together. 
           They enter the Burger King, time passes, and they exit 
           wearing their wedding clothes from the beginning of the 
           movie. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE WEDDING SHUTTLE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE

           David and Sarah sit together. David is more at ease than he’s 
           been this entire time. And Sarah is enjoying it too, 
           experiencing the whole thing as a couple. 

           EXT. THE WEDDING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE--CONTINUOUS

           David and Sarah get off the shuttle together. 

           They go to the table to find their name placards.

           It’s not as easy for David to find his name because it looks 
           like all the others...with two people on it. He picks up a 
           placard that says, “David Kimmel and Sarah Hilland.”

                                 DAVID
                        Found it. How do you feel about 
                        being at a wedding with someone 
                        else? 

                                 SARAH
                        Well I simply don’t like coming to 
                        these things alone. 

                                 DAVID
                        Shall we? 

           And David extends his arm and they walk to where the wedding 
           is about to take place. And they sit together. And they laugh 
           together during the ceremony. And they exchange meaningful 
           glances at one another during serious parts of the ceremony. 

           Shots of them sitting at the reception, eating, laughing. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna get a drink. Do you want 
                        anything? 

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, white wine? Something dry?

                                 DAVID
                        Sure. 

           He kisses her forehead. Like a couple.
           She watches David leave, and as she watches him, Sarah 
           catches the eye of the GROOMSMAN from earlier in the movie. 
           He’s staring at her. And she can’t help but stare back. We 
           can tell that she is oddly drawn to him. She doesn’t want to 
           be, but she is. Sarah looks away. 

           She looks at David, her date, her boyfriend, getting their 
           drinks at a bar across the room. Is she getting a little 
           anxious?

           She looks back at the groomsman, who has started flirting 
           with another girl. This stings. Why? 

           And she looks across the room at David, and she sees him, and 
           for a second it almost looks as if she’s repulsed by him. She 
           forces a smile at him and he smiles back...but we can tell 
           the fear and distancing is starting. 

           He returns with her wine. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Here. 

           She takes a sip. 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s not that dry. 

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, sorry, you want me to get 
                        another one?

                                 SARAH
                        No, no. It’s fine. This is fine. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WEDDING SHUTTLE--LATER THAT NIGHT

           Sarah, sitting next to David, watches the groomsman again 
           with another woman. They are laughing and flirting like 
           idiots. They are going to fuck. Carelessly. Nothing at stake. 
           Sarah admires this, is maybe jealous of this. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOLIDAY IN EXPRESS

           Everyone gets off the shuttle and enters the hotel. The 
           groomsman enters the other girl’s room. She seems so 
           carefree. 
           Sarah and David enter David’s room, and it’s...

           INT. DAVID'S HOTEL ROOM--CONTINUOUS

           DESTROYED. Completely and utterly destroyed. 

                                 SARAH
                        What the fuck?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t think our big, bold, 
                        beautiful journey is over just yet. 

                                 SARAH
                        What happened in here?

                                 DAVID
                        I destroyed the room. 

           We see a flashback sequence with no sound of David bolting up 
           from his hotel bed from earlier in the film, and this time we 
           see what he did. He takes the lamp from the bedside table and 
           throws it up against the wall...

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        When?

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        The night of the wedding. The real 
                        wedding. Not the fake slash real 
                        one we’re currently attending. 

           David overturns the desk...

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        Why?

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        I was so angry. 

           David pulls down the hotel mirror hanging over the dresser. 

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        Who were you angry at? 

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        You...Me.

           He punches the wall where the mirror was. The pain leads him 
           back to the corner of the bed from where he bolted up.  
           THE SEQUENCE IS OVER and he and Sarah are on the bed in the 
           same spot. He leans into her chest and she holds him. ON 
           SARAH... We can see this is maybe too much to handle for her. 

                                 DAVID
                        Sarah?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t want to be alone anymore.

           She does’t respond. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PASSAT--THE NEXT MORNING

           David drives. He reaches over and takes Sarah’s hand. He’s 
           happy. She’s someplace else. 

                                 GPS
                        In 1.5 miles, your destination will 
                        be on the right. 

           Sarah looks at him. She looks like she’s maybe in pain. He 
           looks over and meets her gaze. He smiles, and she smiles 
           through the pain. We’re headed towards something...

                        on the right. 

           The destination is coming into view. And they can tell it’s 
           the Burger King from earlier. On Sarah...she looks like she 
           wants to crawl out of her skin...

                        Turn right into first lane of 
                        parking lot. 

           David does this. He parks right next to Sarah’s Passat.

           A beat.

                                 DAVID
                        What?
                                 GPS
                        Drop off Sarah. 

           David is confused.

                        Drop off Sarah. 

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t want to drop off Sarah. 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s time to drop me off, David. 

                                 DAVID
                        But I don’t want to drop you off. 

           Sarah goes to open the door. David locks it. 

                                 SARAH
                        Did you just lock the door? 

                                 DAVID
                        Yes. Why are you doing this?

                                 SARAH
                        I have to go. 

                                 DAVID
                        Why.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m not ready. It’s too much.

                                 GPS
                        Drop off, Sarah.

                                 DAVID
                             (to GPS)
                        Shut the fuck up!
                             (to Sarah)
                        What’s too much. Being with me? 
                        Look, I’m sorry about the hotel 
                        room. I had a bad night, I--

                                 SARAH
                        I will ruin this. Do you 
                        understand? I’ll ruin it. So better 
                        I run from you now. Because if not 
                        now, I will do it in the worst way 
                        possible. I’ll do it with no 
                        warning.

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I’ll do it on a night where we have 
                        a great dinner, and we go home, and 
                        we have sex, and you think 
                        everything is great, but I know...I 
                        KNOW... in my head, that I’m gone. 
                        That I’ve been gone for weeks, and 
                        you will not have had a clue. 
                        You’ll be devastated. And you won’t 
                        deserve that. 

                                 DAVID
                        So don’t do it. Don’t do it to me.  

                                 SARAH
                        This has nothing to do with you. It 
                        has everything to do with me. 

           David’s eyes grow wide. But she’s right.  

           David unlocks the door. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I’ll miss you every day. That’s the 
                        fucked up part. I will miss you SO 
                        much. 

                                 DAVID
                        That’s a cruel thing to say. You 
                        think it’s kind, but it’s cruel.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 DAVID
                        Do you love me?

           Sarah doesn’t answer. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I love you. 

                                 SARAH
                        You knew I wouldn’t say it back so 
                        why did you say it?

                                 DAVID
                        Because I love you and I know you 
                        love me and I don’t want to be 
                        alone anymore. And I want to be 
                        with you.   

                                 SARAH
                        You’re desperate and it’s pathetic.  
           That was a lash out. 

                                 DAVID
                        You’re a fucking coward. You were 
                        miserable before this trip and 
                        you’re gonna be just as miserable 
                        after it.

                                 SARAH
                        At least I’m the only one who gets 
                        to be miserable in that situation.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh you’re a goddamn hero. You know 
                        what? You could also not check out. 
                        You could do the work. You could 
                        tell me when you’re on the verge of 
                        it so we can talk about it. I’d 
                        listen. I’d care. 

                                 SARAH
                        And the fucked up think is: I know 
                        you’re right. 

                                 DAVID
                        Do you want to be alone for the 
                        rest of your life?

           No response. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Because the moment for you to 
                        decide that is right now, with me. 
                             (a beat)
                        Your future’s right here in front 
                        of you and you’re running away from 
                        it. 

                                 SARAH
                        You think you’re my future? 

                                 DAVID
                             (definitive, calm)
                        Yes. I do.  

           And this stops her cold.

                                 SARAH
                        And how do you know you won’t fuck 
                        up? That you won’t feel smothered 
                        and bogged down, and want to leave 
                        me. 
                                 DAVID
                        I don’t. But I know this is 
                        different. 

           He gestures to the GPS.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        How could it not be?

                                 SARAH
                        I’m leaving. 

           She closes the door. 

           She gets into her Passat. She sees David just staring at her. 

           She turns her car on. It, somehow, magically works.

                        Hello, Sarah Hilland! 
                        Recalculating. 

           Sarah drives off. 

           David is left by himself in his car. 

                                 DAVID
                             (to self)
                        I’m not gonna bang on my steering 
                        wheel and scream. I am not going to 
                        be someone who bangs on his 
                        steering wheel and 
                        screams...DAMMIT!

           He bangs on his steering wheel. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        FUCK!!!!!!!

           Beat. He calms himself. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        So now I get why people do that. 

           INT. SARAH’S PASSAT

           She is crying, but relieved as well. She’s escaping! She 
           laughs to herself, and then cries a little more.

                        Thanks for stopping.

                                 SARAH
                        No problem. Where are you headed?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Away. 

                                 SARAH
                        Me too.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Is there any better feeling? Than 
                        getting away?

                                 SARAH
                        Nothing better. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        NOTHING BETTER!

                                 SARAH
                        NOTHING. FUCKING. BETTER.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        HA!!! TO GETTING AWAY!!!
                                 SARAH
                        TO GETTING AWAY!!!!

           And they look at each other and laugh. And this is the first 
           time Sarah has gotten a good look at the man. And Sarah’s 
           wild laugh dies down and changes into something a little more 
           disconcerting, almost terrified. She’s mildly 
           hyperventilating. 

           She looks at the GPS, like, how the fuck...ANGLE ON THE 
           GPS... No response, just a silent 2-d car driving. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        So, where ya from?

           No response. 

                                 SARAH
                        Sorry what?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Where ya from?

                                 SARAH
                        Ah, New York. You?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Does it matter?

                                 SARAH
                        Nah, I guess not. 

           Pause. Sarah doesn’t want to ask this question, but she does. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Got any family?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        No.

           This fucking stings. 

                                 HITCHHIKER (CONT'D)
                        You?

                             (definitive)
                        No. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        That’s good. No one to disappoint. 
                        No one to hold you back. 
                                 SARAH
                        Hold you back from what?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        All that life has to offer. 

                                 SARAH
                        What kind of life do you have?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        What kind of question is that?

                                 SARAH
                        I’m just curious, hypothetically, 
                        if you had a family, what life 
                        would they be holding you back 
                        from?

           Beat.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        One of freedom. 

                                 SARAH
                        Freedom to do what?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Truth?

                                 SARAH
                        Sure.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        To not have to worry about anyone 
                        but myself. 

                                 SARAH
                        Ha!

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        That’s the first time I’ve ever 
                        heard anyone say that who wasn’t 
                        me.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Oh yeah?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah...

           A beat.
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        It sounds fucking pathetic. 

           Sarah pulls off the side of the road. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        That’s enough. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        You need to get out of my car. Now. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Are you serious? What did I say?

                                 SARAH
                        You just need to get out. 

           She just sits there. Waiting. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Okay, fine. 

           The hitchhiker gets out. Pause... before he closes the door 
           he leans into the car. We see his face clearly, and he sees 
           her face clearly.

                                 HITCHHIKER (CONT'D)
                             (surprisingly warm)
                        Good luck.  

           He closes the door. He’s gone. Sarah lets out a shocked 
           breath, almost as if she’s gasping for air.

                        You will reach home in 25 minutes 
                        with normal traffic. 

           We cut back and forth between Sarah and David driving. 

           David pulls up to a house. He doesn’t recognize it. 

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        You are home. 

           Sarah pulls up to a DIFFERENT house than David. She, however, 
           recognizes it.

                                 GPS (CONT'D)
                        You are home. 

                                 SARAH
                        Wrong home, asshole. 

           David gets out of his car.

           Sarah gets out of her car. 

           David enters the front door of the house. He walks into the 
           living room, and he sees a print of the Pissarro painting he 
           and Sarah entered in the Art Institute. And he sees other 
           photos of he and Sarah, but he doesn’t remember any of the 
           events being photographed: She and him at the National 
           Lighthouse Museum in Maine, she and him in the Chicago Art 
           Institute, she and him in Paris... the photos are more real. 
           There are other people around. It’s not surreal at all. It 
           looks like it’s just from a normal trip. And another photo of 
           them looks very real: Them getting married at City Hall. 

                                 SARAH (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        Hey! Did you get cucumbers?

           Sarah, or some future version of Sarah, enters the living 
           room. David is speechless. Shocked. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Well did you?

                                 DAVID
                        Um, no... I didn’t get cucumbers. 
                                 SARAH
                        You fucker. Hi!

           She walks up to him and kisses him...almost as if this ritual 
           has happened a hundred times before. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hi.

           INT. LIVING ROOM--THE HOUSE OUR SARAH ENTERED.

           Sarah, the original, the one we know and love, is inside a 
           house she knows very well. There are pictures of her as a kid 
           with her mother, the same ones that were in her mom’s 
           hospital room. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hello?

                                 SARAH’S MOM (O.C.)
                        Hello!!

           Sarah’s mom enters the living room. She’s been cooking 
           dinner. Sarah hasn’t seen her mom alive in years. 

           She’s so very close to crying. 

                                 SARAH
                        Mom? 

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        Yeah, who else would I be?

                                 SARAH
                        You’re not dead. 

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        What the hell kind of thing is that 
                        to say?

           Sarah walks up to her mom and hugs her. HARD. 

                                 SARAH’S MOM (CONT'D)
                        Ha! Everything okay?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. 

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        I made the mashed potatoes. 
           Sarah looks at her mom. And then at the TV... 

           ON THE TV we see a promo: “Next Up: Big starring Tom Hanks”

                                 SARAH
                        Will you sit and watch the movie 
                        with me?

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        Did you think I’d let you watch all 
                        alone?

                        We’re married.

                                 SARAH
                        Yes David, we’re married. 

           Beat.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

           He takes a bite of food. He’s just going to roll with this.

           INT. SARAH’S CHILDHOOD HOME.

           She eats mashed potatoes in a makeshift table chair 
           positioned directly in front of the TV. Her mom sits on a 
           couch off to the side.  

           We see snippets of Tom Hanks acting in “Big.” They are both 
           enjoying the movie. Sarah looks over at her mom. Her mom 
           notices her staring and smiles.

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        What honey?

                                 SARAH
                        Nothing.

                        What are you staring at?

                        Like mother, like daughter. 

                                 SARAH
                        These mashed potatoes are so good.

                                 SARAH
                        For the most part.

                                 DAVID
                        Sometimes you’re not?

                                 SARAH
                        And sometimes you’re not. Sometimes 
                        you feel bogged down and you 
                        withdraw. And I think about leaving 
                        you once every six months...
                                 DAVID
                        You do?

                                 SARAH
                        I do...but I don’t. 

           David nods...

                                 DAVID
                        And when I withdraw...

                                 SARAH
                        I find you.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah?

                                 SARAH
                        And I hug you so hard. 

                                 DAVID
                        How?

                                 SARAH
                        Like this.

           And she gets up from her seat and sits in his lap and hugs 
           him so hard. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        And then I look into your eyes. 

           And she look into his eyes. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        And I say...Would you really want 
                        this to be any different? And then 
                        you ask me...

                                 DAVID
                             (completing the thought)
                        Would you really want this to be 
                        any different?

                                 SARAH
                        And we look at each other and we 
                        shake our heads no. 

           And they shake their heads no. And they kiss.

           Sarah is in bed. David enters from the bathroom, and he gets 
           in bed next to her and holds her.

                        Goodnight, sweetheart. 

                                 SARAH
                        Mom, can you lay next to me for a 
                        minute.

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        Of course. 

           And her mom lays down next to her. They look like how they 
           looked Sarah’s mom’s hospital bed.

           And Sarah turns around and faces David and she kisses him and 
           begins taking off her clothes and David his.

                        Are we still pretending that you’re 
                        older or is this real.

                                 SARAH
                        Pretending.

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        Okay, what’s he like?

                                 SARAH
                        I get the sense he’ll always be 
                        here. If I let him.

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        Then you should let him. Is he 
                        kind?

                                 SARAH
                        Very kind.

                        That’s important. Is life better 
                        with him around?

                                 SARAH

                        Tell me why I shouldn’t run away

                        Yes.

                                 SARAH’S MOM
                        Because every fiber of your being 
                        is telling you that you should.

           Sarah’s mom tucks Sarah in, and kisses her on the forehead.

           They both get into their cars, turn on the engines, and at

                        I don’t know.

                        destination.

           David gets out of the car. He is met by the cashier and the 
           parking attendant. 
                                 PARKING ATTENDANT
                        So, how’d she run. 

                                 DAVID
                        Fine. 

                                 CASHIER
                        Did your phone crap out on ya?

                                 DAVID
                        No. 

                                 CASHIER
                        It didn’t?

                                 DAVID
                        No.

                                 CASHIER
                        Ya sure?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sure. 

                                 CASHIER
                        But what if it had? Then you 
                        would’ve been fucked. 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. Hey did a woman come here and 
                        return a car? 

                                 CASHIER
                        Woman? No. 

           David is a little bummed. 

                                 DAVID
                        Alright. 

                                 CASHIER
                        Do you want to wait here for her?

           A BEAT. CLOSE ON DAVID.

                                 DAVID
                        No.

           He’s about to leave...he turns around...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        And, ya know, thank you. 
                                 CASHIER
                        You’re welcome. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CAR RENTAL AGENCY RETURN GARAGE--A LITTLE LATER

           Sarah is at an intersection, about to make a left turn into 
           the return garage. 

                                 GPS
                        You have a arrived at your 
                        destination. 

           The light turns green. An arrow indicates she can turn left. 

           She doesn’t turn. 

           She’s thinking. A car behind her honks. She’s unfazed. 

           Sarah gets out her CELL PHONE. She finds David’s number. 
           She’s about to hit the call button, but then all of the 
           sudden her phone dies. 

                                 SARAH
                        What the fuck!

           She presses the power button on her phone over and over.

           Nothing. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        FUCK!!

           Silence. She looks at the GPS. The GPS “looks” back at her. 

           ON SARAH.

           ON THE GPS.

           ON SARAH. It’s as if her face is begging for something. 

           And suddenly the GPS screen changes to, “Enter Destination.”

           Sarah types something...

                                 GPS
                        Recalculating. 

           She’s relived. It worked!

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. DAVID’S BROWNSTONE IN BROOKLYN

           David is sitting on the top step of his stoop. 

           A 1996 Passat turns right onto his street. 

           We see on David’s face an exhale of relief. The car pulls up 
           to David’s brownstone.

           Sarah is about to turn off her car and we hear...

                                 GPS
                        You have arrived at your final 
                        destination. 

           Sarah gets out, and stands at the bottom of the stoop. She 
           looks smaller from where David is, a little powerless.

                                 SARAH
                        Hello. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hello. 

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t want to be alone anymore 
                        either. 

                                 DAVID
                        Oh yeah?

                                 SARAH
                        I told you, it always comes out. I 
                        just...I can’t be pushed. 

                                 DAVID
                        How did you find me?

                                 SARAH
                        Well, my phone crapped out on me...

           David reacts...

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        And so...

           She refers to the GPS.

                                 DAVID
                        Right.

                                 SARAH
                        Can I come up there and sit with 
                        you?
                                 DAVID
                        Of course. 

           And she sits next to him. And there they are, like on top of 
           the lighthouse, like in Paris, like on the cliff overlooking 
           the Earth. But this time they are sitting on top of a normal 
           stoop in Brooklyn. And instead of looking down at the view 
           below, they look at each other, and take each other in.  

                                 SARAH
                        It’s amazing isn’t it?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s entirely amazing. 

           THE END.
