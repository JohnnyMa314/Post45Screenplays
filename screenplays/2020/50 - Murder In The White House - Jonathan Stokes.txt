           A WOMAN’S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM...

           INT. OFFICE – NIGHT

           MIA PINE (30s) sits up in the dark, terrified. She’s on a 
           couch, her hair disheveled. Her eyes sharpen into focus.

                                 MIA
                        Did you hear that?

           An unseen MAN lying on the couch responds.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        It’s your guilty conscience.

           His hand reaches to pull her back down on top of him.

           THE SCREAM SOUNDS AGAIN. LOUDER. HORRIFYING.

                                 MIA
                        How about that? Was that my 
                        conscience?

           MIA LEAPS OFF THE COUCH. She snatches her weapons belt from 
           the end table and buckles it on. She straightens her blouse 
           over her bulletproof vest and tugs on her blazer.

           INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           MIA RACES DOWN A WIDE HALLWAY. Vaulted ceilings, delicate 
           crown moldings, marble busts on plinths. Something about this 
           building, familiar...

           MORE SCREAMS. CRIES FOR HELP. SHOUTING VOICES.

           MIA SPRINTS TOWARD AN ORNATE SET OF DOUBLE DOORS INTO...

           INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           THIS IS THE WHITE HOUSE. Mia buttons her blazer, pulling her 
           hair back into a ponytail. Smoothing the bumps.

           FIVE PRIVATE DINNER GUESTS – in suits and dresses – surround 
           the Resolute desk in gaping shock. The FIRST LADY, in a 
           cocktail dress, is screaming hysterically. The VICE 
           PRESIDENT, in formal dinner wear, holds her by the shoulders.

           A sixth dinner guest, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF HOLLAND 
           ATKINSON (late 30s) races in from the corridor, buttoning his 
           sweater vest.
                                 HOLLAND
                        Dear god in heaven...

           The President of the United States – HENRY WOOD – sits behind 
           the desk. A KNIFE IN HIS NECK. His face is blue and white, 
           red blood drenching his dress shirt.

           An ALARM CLANGS somewhere in the distance.

           FIRST LADY GAIL WOOD WAILS IN SOBBING GASPS...

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                             (hysterical)
                        He got up from dinner to make a 
                        phone call-

           Mia circles behind the desk, pushing through the group.

                                 MIA
                        -Ma’am-

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        -He was gone so long, I got up to 
                        check on him!

                                 MIA
                        -Ma’am, has anyone touched the 
                        president?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I, I don’t know.

           SECRET SERVICE AGENT THOMAS STONE (20s), corn-fed and 
           earnest, appears at Mia’s side. Like Mia, he wears a 
           conservative suit and his issued sidearm is the Glock 19.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, contact the White House 
                        Medical Unit. Dr. Cheng is on duty 
                        for the executive residence.

           Agent Stone presses a finger to his earpiece and repeats 
           Mia’s rapid-fire instructions into his emergency channel.

                                 MIA
                        Find Dr. Clay Silver – he’s a 
                        medical examiner from the Metro PD. 
                        Get him any clearance he needs: 
                        just get him here. Tell him I need 
                        a tox screen.

           UNIFORM DIVISION OFFICERS JOSTLE INTO THE OVAL OFFICE in SWAT 
           body armor, gripping assault rifles.
           THE FIRST LADY SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY.

           Mia marks the time on her cell. 10:45pm. SHE SNAPS PHOTOS OF 
           THE PRESIDENT, THE DESK, THE SURROUNDING ROOM.

           VICE PRESIDENT JAMES STEELE is built like a linebacker. A 
           silver crew-cut with tufted white eyebrows and one glass eye. 
           HE SHOUTS AT MIA WITH A VOICE FOR THE BATTLEFIELD.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        What are you, paparazzi? What the 
                        hell are you doing?

                                 MIA
                        Sir, I am cataloging a crime scene 
                        before it’s trampled. You could 
                        help me by clearing away the dinner 
                        guests-

           Agent Stone breaks in-

                                 AGENT STONE
                        -I can perform CPR.

           The president’s face is bone white - drained of all blood. 
           Mia gives Agent Stone a look.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        We have a duty to try.

           Mia snaps two last photos of the crime scene.

                                 MIA
                        Do it.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Make a hole!

           UNIFORM DIVISION OFFICERS PULL THE PRESIDENT OFF HIS CHAIR 
           and lay him on the ground. AGENT STONE RIPS OPEN THE 
           PRESIDENT’S SUIT JACKET and examines the ruptured neck. Three 
           stab wounds.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Do we remove the knife?

                                 MIA
                        Absolutely not. Just keep pressure 
                        on the wound. You touch that knife 
                        with bare hands, I will stab you 
                        myself.

           Agent Stone presses his ear to the president’s chest.
                                 AGENT STONE
                        I got no heartbeat!

           He straddles the president, doubles his hands against the 
           president’s chest, and begins compressions.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        One, two, three, four, five! Breath 
                        for him!

           A UNIFORM DIVISION OFFICER pinches the president’s nose shut 
           and breathes into his lungs.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Keep it going!

           DR. CHENG’S WHITE HOUSE MEDICAL TEAM BURSTS INTO THE OVAL 
           OFFICE, PUSHING A CRASH CART.

           Nurses take over for the Uniform Division. MIA SHOUTS TO THE 
           CROWDED OVAL OFFICE.

                                 MIA
                        If you are wearing a black tie or 
                        an evening gown, I need you to back 
                        up ten feet!

           MIA PULLS AGENT STONE OFF THE PRESIDENT. She sets a hand on 
           his shoulder, calming him down.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, look at me. I need Nancy 
                        Garcia from Metro for the crime 
                        scene before it gets completely 
                        fucked. We keep that knife pristine 
                        for fingerprinting. It’s probably 
                        clean, but this was a crime of 
                        opportunity so you never know.

           Mia takes deep, slow breaths to lower her pulse. Her eyes 
           sweep the room, seeing through the chaos.

           She scans the president’s desk – everything appears 
           undisturbed, the phone in its cradle. She drops to her knees 
           and scans underneath the desk. Clean.

                                 MIA
                        Check the security alarm logs – see 
                        if the door to the Rose Garden or 
                        the Secretary’s office were ever 
                        opened tonight.

           THE CRASH CART HUMS. THE DEFIBRILLATOR WHINES, POWERING UP.
                                 DR. CHENG
                        Clear!

           The President’s body arcs and convulses from the shock 
           paddles. No result.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        We gotta move these guests, right?

           Mia is wide-eyed, overwhelmed. THE ROOM IS A CHORUS OF SHOUTS 
           AND SOBS. THE DEFIBRILLATOR CHARGING AGAIN...

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Ms. Pine?

           Mia focuses on the dripping blood, not yet dry.

                                 MIA
                        The assassin is on the grounds.

           Mia rubs a hand on the back of her neck.

                                 MIA
                        Open all channels for me.

           Stone taps a dial on his radio and hands Mia his earpiece.

                                 MIA (ON COM)
                        White House U.S.D., this is 
                        H.A.I.C. Pine. I am invoking 
                        Protocol 141. We are locking down 
                        the White House. No one enters the 
                        grounds without my authority. And 
                        no one, no one, leaves. Repeat, 
                        nobody leaves the White House.

           ALARM KLAXONS BLARE ACROSS THE GROUNDS. THROUGH THE WINDOWS, 
           FLOODLIGHTS ILLUMINATE THE ROSE GARDEN.

           THE DARK SHADOWS OF UNIFORMED SERVICE OFFICERS IN FULL BATTLE 
           RATTLE RACE ACROSS THE LAWN, SECURING COMMAND POSTS, SLAMMING 
           GATES, AND RAISING ARMORED BARRIERS.

           THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOCKED DOWN.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           MURDER IN THE WHITE HOUSE
                               Chapter One: The Vice President

           INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Mia strides to the East Wing, leading all six of the 
           president’s dinner guests, whom we will soon meet. The first 
           lady, wobbling in her high heels, struggles to keep pace.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Where are you taking us?

                                 MIA
                        The Presidential Emergency 
                        Operations Center.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Why the bunker?

                                 MIA
                        It’s the safest place for you. The 
                        PEOC is where they protected Bush 
                        on 911.

           Chief of Staff Holland Atkinson catches up to Mia. His khakis 
           and boat shoes reflect a WASP prep school pedigree. This is a 
           guy who knows his way around Martha’s Vineyard.

                                 HOLLAND
                        You’re locking us in? We need to 
                        get out of here! If there’s a 
                        killer on the loose, we need to 
                        save ourselves.

           SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE TERRA BROOKES (50s) is formidable in her 
           heels and business suit. She has a gray witch’s streak in her 
           updo and speaks with a proud southern lilt.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        No, we need to stay here and keep 
                        the country running. We do our 
                        duty. Tonight more than ever.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I should be with my husband. Is he 
                        going to make it?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        He’s getting the best medical 
                        attention in the world.
           Mia reaches the East Wing elevator and hustles the dinner 
           guests in. A UNIFORMED DIVISION OFFICER holds the door.

           RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR PYOTR KAMENEV (40s) wears an impeccable 
           double-breasted suit. His eyebrows are waxed, his fingernails 
           manicured. His only physical flaw is a scar that curls one 
           lip into a slight sneer.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I’ve always wanted to see this 
                        bunker.

           The Vice President glares down at the Russian.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Should we let him in? Isn’t this a 
                        state secret?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        You have fewer secrets than you 
                        think.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           The group squeezes in to make room for the door to close. Mia 
           struggles to control her breathing in the confined space.

           The first lady cries softly. Speaker Brookes wraps an arm 
           around her.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        We are herrings in a barrel.

           Holland, the Chief of Staff, wipes his phone screen off on 
           his cardigan and holds it up toward the ceiling.

                                 HOLLAND
                             (panicking)
                        I can’t get any signal in here.

           Vice President Steele radiates the cool command of a battle-
           tested Marine.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        We’re going five stories deep. If a 
                        nuclear bomb can’t penetrate, 
                        neither can Verizon.

           ANXIETY WARPS MIA’S VISION. THE WALLS PRESS IN ON HER. VOICES 
           TURN TINNY IN HER EARS.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Are you all right?
                                 MIA
                        Yes. Thank you. Just enclosed 
                        spaces.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

           The group spills out of the elevator and into the low-
           ceilinged hallway of the fabled command center. SITUATION 
           ROOM ANALYSTS AND DUTY OFFICERS BUSTLE PAST WITH LAPTOPS.

           Mia checks over the first lady. She is wide-eyed in shock 
           with a thousand-yard stare, blood still on her hands.

           Mia turns to the sixth and final dinner guest, ADARA LEHAVA, 
           world-renowned Israeli cellist. In concert blacks, she wears 
           a sleeveless top, dark mascara, and a sultry expression.

                                 MIA
                        Ms. Lehava, please take the first 
                        lady to a restroom to freshen up. 
                        Meet us in the War Room.

           Adara tries to take the first lady’s hand, but it is snatched 
           away.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        No! Anyone but her.

           Adara speaks with a strong Israeli accent, unable to 
           pronounce her “H’s.”

                                 ADARA LEHAVA
                        Please. I can ’elp you.

           The first lady regains her self-command, straightening to her 
           full height.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                             (icily)
                        I can help myself.

           The first lady marches to find a restroom. Mia leads the 
           remaining five diners into--

           INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The iconic War Room. Harsh overhead lighting. A long 
           boardroom table emblazoned with the White House seal. 
           American flags in the corners.

           Plush black chairs and flat screens outfit the room. Floor-to-
           ceiling windows to the hallway are covered by drawn blinds.
                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Well, this is cozy. How long we are 
                        staying?

                                 MIA
                        As long as it takes to complete an 
                        investigation and determine your 
                        safety.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Madam, I am an emissary of the 
                        Russian government. I cannot be 
                        held here like prisoner. I have 
                        diplomatic immunity.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Do you have immunity from 
                        assassinating the President of the 
                        United States?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Excuse me?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Who else would do this? I’m just 
                        surprised you didn’t use plutonium.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Do you accuse me?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE 
                        You Russians want to blow up the 
                        Syrian Peace Accord. Killing the 
                        president is the perfect way.

           Chief of Staff Holland takes the Russian ambassador by the 
           elbow, steering him away from the vice president.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Think of the crisis we’re in, Mr. 
                        Ambassador. How would your 
                        government react if this emergency 
                        happened in Moscow? I’m asking for 
                        your diplomatic sensitivity. Worst 
                        case, you lose a night’s sleep, but 
                        gain a story for your memoirs.

           The Russian slowly nods his head.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I need to get upstairs and speak to 
                        the American people. They need to 
                        know about this tragedy, and know 
                        someone’s taking the wheel.
           Mia steps in front of him.

                                 MIA
                        I’m sorry, sir. You cannot leave.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I don’t have time for this. Where’s 
                        the head of the Secret Service?

                                 MIA
                        The Chief is in Brussels preparing 
                        for the upcoming G7 conference.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Where’s number two?

                                 MIA
                        Also Brussels.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Well, I want to speak to the 
                        ranking White House officer!

                                 MIA
                        You’re speaking to her.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Then you should be my nose tackle, 
                        running interference. Not blocking.

                                 MIA
                        The knife, sir-

           The vice president tries to push past. Mia stands her ground.

                                 MIA
                        Sir, if you do not cooperate, I 
                        will be forced to apprehend you.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Apprehend me?

           The vice president’s hulking presence seems to fill the room. 
           Mia’s voice quavers.

                                 MIA
                        I am an Investigative Protection 
                        Officer with full law enforcement 
                        authority-

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        -Sweetheart, I make the laws!

           The Speaker of the House steps into the fray...
              SPEAKER BROOKES            VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
           -No, Jim. Technically,     -What is the point of a vice
           that’s my job-             president if not to take control  
                                      in situations like this! We must
              MIA                     consider ourselves at war! This is
           -Now if you’ll let me      Hannibal at Zama. This is
           explain about the knife-   Churchill at the blitz. I am the
                                      president now and my word is law!

                                 MIA
                        Sir, until the president is 
                        pronounced dead and the Chief 
                        Justice of the Supreme Court puts 
                        your hand on the Lincoln bible, you 
                        are not the president.

           The vice president’s pulse shows in his temples.

                                 MIA
                        I am the ranking officer 
                        investigating the possible 
                        assassination of the President of 
                        the United States and these are the 
                        rules of engagement under-

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        -I don’t have to listen to this-

           Vice President Steele pushes his way toward the door.

                                 MIA
                        Sir, none of you leave this room!

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Why the hell not!

                                 MIA
                        Because of the knife!

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        WHAT GODDAMN KNIFE?

                                 MIA
                        The knife that killed the 
                        president!

           The room is silent. Bewildered.

                                 MIA
                        That pearl-handled serrated steak 
                        knife in the president’s neck. 
                        Didn’t any of you see it?
           The group listens...

                                 MIA
                        It’s from the Kennedy set. Each of 
                        you used one of those knives when 
                        you ate in the president’s private 
                        dining room this evening. They are 
                        unique in the world. And that is 
                        why none of you are leaving. The 
                        assassin is in this room.

           The group stands in stunned silence. The guests size each 
           other up.

           The vice president edges closer to Mia, staring her down.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        The country needs a leader. You 
                        want to keep me hog-tied down here?

                                 MIA
                        All six of you. Until we determine 
                        who is guilty and who is innocent.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You’re sworn to defend me. You work 
                        for me!

                                 MIA
                        I’m sworn to defend everyone in the 
                        White House. I work for all of you.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        What about your oath?

                                 MIA
                        If someone takes a shot at you, 
                        sir, I will jump in front of that 
                        bullet. But until then, sit down.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I am not in the habit of taking 
                        orders from bodyguards.

           The vice president heads for the door.

                                 MIA
                        Sir, there is a presidential 
                        assassin in this room. And only one 
                        person is insisting on leaving.

           Vice President Steele stops. The group stares at him. He 
           slowly turns to Mia.
                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        When I become president, the first 
                        thing I am doing is firing you.

           Mia swallows hard.

                                 MIA
                        If you become president.

           Vice President Steele backs away from the door. He paces the 
           room, a circling shark.

           Holland sits slumped in a chair, hand rubbing his brow. He is 
           handsome but for coke-bottle glasses that give him a certain 
           effete vulnerability.

                                 HOLLAND
                        She’s right. We can’t leave.

           Vice President Steele wheels on him.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You too, now, V-neck?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Think of the optics, sir. You 
                        announce the president has been 
                        stabbed. National panic. Markets 
                        plummet. The Syrian Peace Accord 
                        blows up. The Saudis and the 
                        Iranians take opposite sides. 
                        Russia and the US are officially in 
                        a proxy war. Chocolate and peanut 
                        butter no longer taste good 
                        together. No, Mr. Vice President. 
                        We need to control the narrative.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        This is not a time for spin 
                        doctors!

                                 HOLLAND
                        Do you want to start a world war? 
                        Because this is how you get world 
                        wars. The president might survive 
                        this! We can’t have speculation the 
                        Russians killed the president if 
                        there’s a chance it’s not true.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Of course it’s true! The Russians 
                        manipulate our elections. Brexit, 
                        Spain, Italy.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE (CONT'D)
                        They’ve been destabilizing the west 
                        for years! It’s their national 
                        pastime!

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I am a guest of the president! I 
                        did not fight my way into the White 
                        House with a weapon, I was invited 
                        for cocktails, caviar, and a cello 
                        concert!

           EVERYONE SPEAKS AT ONCE...

                  SPEAKER BROOKES
           If the Russian Ambassador killed
           the president, then we must have proof,
           not a kangaroo court-

                           VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                     -The people have a right to know
                      the president is dead—

                                        ADARA
                            -There’s still a chance ‘enry’s alive!

                                            VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                                       -I’m going on the air tonight-

           SPEAKER BROOKES SMACKS HER PALM ON THE TABLE.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        No! Holland’s right. This is a 
                        crisis and we have no strategy. Now 
                        it’s pushing midnight. Word of this 
                        doesn’t need to get out until – 
                        what – 6am tomorrow, that’s a fair 
                        press-delay, right? That buys us 
                        six hours to figure this out. In 
                        the morning we announce the 
                        assassination attempt, and that 
                        we’ve caught the criminal. If the 
                        president doesn’t make it... The 
                        public will mourn a president, not 
                        panic and start World War Three.
                          Chapter Two: The Speaker of the House

           INT. BUNKER HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mia strides down the hallway. Agent Stone falls into step 
           beside her. 

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Enjoying your evening?

                                 MIA
                        It still beats my prom night. 
                        Tommy, nobody leaves this floor. 
                        Don’t let them make calls out. If 
                        they find a computer, no emails.

           They pass the UNIFORM DIVISION OFFICERS by the elevator, 
           bulky in their body armor.

                                 MIA
                        Guys, don’t let our VIPs escape, no 
                        matter how much they threaten or 
                        charm you.

           The guards nod. The first lady rounds the corner.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        The girl’s room is out of order. I 
                        used the gents.

           Mia looks to Agent Stone who shrugs apologetically.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        We didn’t know there would be an 
                        international emergency tonight.

           The first lady checks her phone: no signal.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                             (slurring her words)
                        We can’t leave, can’t use our 
                        phones, can’t even use the 
                        bathroom.

                                 MIA
                        Just try to make do. I’ll remind 
                        the boys to leave the toilet seats 
                        down.

           The first lady takes a swig from a mug and weaves unsteadily 
           down the hallway.
           Mia eyes her, shakes her head, and proceeds with Agent Stone.

                                 MIA
                        Goldie’s the only server for the 
                        president’s private dining room. 
                        Find her quickly. Ask her which 
                        table setting is missing its knife. 
                        And one more thing: top priority...

           Agent Stone leans in.

                                 MIA
                        Call the chief in Brussels: get him 
                        on a plane. Let him get fired by 
                        the VP. Me? I want to keep my job.

           INT. BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT

           Mia locks the stall and collapses down on the toilet seat. 
           She takes slow deep breaths, trying to fight down a whirlwind 
           of emotions: fear, anxiety, sadness, panic...

           She opens the crime scene photos on her phone...

           THE PRESIDENT’S UNCONSCIOUS FACE. ODDLY PRECISE PUNCTURE 
           WOUNDS IN HIS NECK. ODD BRUISING. LITTLE DETAILS: THE PHONE 
           IN ITS CRADLE... THE CHURCHILL BUST ON THE CREDENZA...

           She zooms in on the president. Wet, dripping blood. A curious 
           stripe of pink on his starched white collar.

           THE BATHROOM STALL BECOMES FISH-EYED AND DISTORTED. MIA 
           SQUEEZES HER EYES SHUT AND FLATTENS HER PALMS AGAINST HER 
           TEMPLES. THE ROOM IS SPINNING, A NIGHTMARE CAROUSEL.

           Mia presses her head against the cold metal stall divider.

           THE BATHROOM DOOR OPENS. HIGH HEELS CLICK ACROSS THE FLOOR. A 
           woman enters the next stall.

           Speaker of the House Terra Brookes’ languorous southern 
           accent evokes sugar cane and peach orchards...

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES (O.S.)
                        Don’t mind the vice president. Some 
                        people were put upon this earth to 
                        be put upon. Jim has an inability 
                        to deal with logical people.

                                 MIA
                        Madam Speaker. How’d you know it 
                        was me?
                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        The shoes, no offense. And call me 
                        Terra.

           Mia speaks through the stall, like a church confessional.

                                 MIA
                        I respect his war record. First in 
                        his class at West Point. Master 
                        strategist. Helicopter shot down in 
                        Tikrit and he still wins the 
                        battle. He’s impressive.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Yes, oppressively impressive. That 
                        glass eye of his seems to follow me 
                        around the room like a painting in 
                        a haunted house.

                                 MIA
                        He’s going to be the leader of the 
                        free world and he can’t stand me.
                             (then)
                        What’s wrong with my shoes?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        They’re too sensible for a first 
                        lady and too proletarian for a 
                        cellist -- I made a deduction. You 
                        know, it’s not true about needing 
                        the chief justice to swear Jim in.

                                 MIA
                        The constitution’s a little murky 
                        on that point. I was just buying 
                        time. As long as he’s out of the 
                        range of cellphones, advisors, and 
                        Wikipedia, I can hold out. Thank 
                        you for backing me up, by the way.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        It was in my self-interest. I have 
                        a sentimental attachment for 
                        civilization. If the Syrian Peace 
                        Accord goes up in smoke over this, 
                        so does half the first world.

                                 MIA
                        And most of the third.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You say you’re stalling for time. 
                        What are you holding out for?
                                 MIA
                        The president to survive long 
                        enough for my bosses to fly back 
                        from Brussels. The Chief of Secret 
                        Service should be the one jumping 
                        on this grenade.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        If the president dies-

                                 MIA
                        -The vice president must retaliate-

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        -bombs drop, the falcon cannot hear 
                        the falconer, and mere chaos is 
                        loosed upon the world.

                                 MIA
                             (can’t get over it)
                        If he takes office, can he really 
                        go over my boss’s head and fire me?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        I’ve known Jim 35 years. If you 
                        were a man, he wouldn’t dream of 
                        it. But he has a real genius for 
                        misogyny. He’s a misogenius.

                                 MIA
                        My shoes are from JC Penney. I 
                        thought they looked nice. And 
                        here’s another confession: I don’t 
                        have to pee.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Me neither. I just wanted a break 
                        from all that hostility in the war 
                        room. You could cut the 
                        testosterone with a...

           She realizes her poor choice of words...

           INT. BATHROOM – CONTINUOUS

           The two women step out of their stalls and move to the sink. 
           They make eye contact through the mirror.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Since you’re confiding in me, you 
                        must not think I’m the killer.
                                 MIA
                        On the contrary, you’re a prime 
                        suspect.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Am I? What’s my motive? The 
                        president’s from the other side of 
                        the political aisle?

                                 MIA
                        You’re the speaker of the house. If 
                        the vice president is the murderer, 
                        or if you can make it look like the 
                        he’s the murderer, then you become 
                        the president.

           Speaker Brookes cocks one eyebrow.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You have a subtle mind.

                                 MIA
                        I’m sensible... if a bit 
                        proletarian.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You’ve worked hard to cover your 
                        southern accent, haven’t you.

                                 MIA
                        My only path out of Wheeling, West 
                        Virginia was an army recruiting 
                        office. I find people take me more 
                        seriously if I sound like I use a 
                        bathtub for showering rather than 
                        making moonshine.
                             (then)
                        What’s your angle in all this? You 
                        support the Syrian Peace Accord?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        I honestly don’t know yet. If I 
                        were sitting in the big chair, 
                        would I choose to play politics or 
                        choose what I think is right? It’s 
                        surprisingly hard to know.

                                 MIA
                        Is it? Did you know that congress-
                        people and secret service officers 
                        take the exact same oath?
                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Sweetheart, can you solve this 
                        crime?

           Mia shakes her head.

                                 MIA
                        Not in six hours. Locked in a 
                        bunker. There are already several 
                        clues that make no sense to me. I’m 
                        hoping to pass this buck.

           Speaker Brookes pats Mia on her shoulders.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Then you know how I feel.

           INT. HALLWAY – NIGHT

           Mia and Stone take a lap around the bunker.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Thunder storms in Brussels. At 
                        least nine hours for the chief to 
                        return.

                                 MIA
                        I need the cavalry, and they’re on 
                        the other side of an ocean. Any 
                        fingerprints on the knife?

           ANALYSTS scurry past, carrying laptops to the briefing room.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Don’t know yet. Nancy Garcia is on 
                        her way from Georgetown PD. I did 
                        check the security logs on the Oval 
                        Office. The Rose Garden and 
                        Secretary doors were armed and 
                        locked.

                                 MIA
                        So only two possible entrances from 
                        the private dining room. And zero 
                        security cameras around the Oval 
                        Office. A pretty kettle of fish.

           They round the corner to see a White House institution: Chief 
           Server GOLDIE (60s), a short woman with a black catering tie 
           over her white blouse, guarded at the elevator by a Uniformed 
           Division Officer. She speaks with an East African accent.

                                 GOLDIE
                        I am so sorry, Ms. Pine.
           She appears nervous to the brink of tears.

                                 MIA
                        Goldie, can you tell me which place 
                        setting was missing a steak knife?

           Goldie shakes her head emphatically.

                                 GOLDIE
                        I already clear all the places for 
                        dessert. And those knives are 
                        already cleaned by the dishwasher.

                                 MIA
                        So no fingerprints...

                                 AGENT STONE
                        And no way to tell who was missing 
                        their knife.

           Mia furrows her brow.

                                 MIA
                        Goldie, how many steak knives are 
                        in the Kennedy set?

                                 GOLDIE
                        Oh, Ms. Pine. I know you smart 
                        lady. You track every weapon in the 
                        White House. You know there are 
                        six.

                                 MIA
                        But there were seven diners 
                        including the president. Who was 
                        eating without a knife?

                                 GOLDIE
                        Ms. Adara was a last minute 
                        addition. Luckily, she is a 
                        vegetarian. She eat quinoa salad.

           Mia spies through the blinds at the dinner guests inside the 
           War Room. Adara sits curled in a plush chair, her face 
           showing the calm complacency of a well-stroked cat.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        So Adara had no knife. Does that 
                        eliminate one suspect?

           Mia studies Adara’s body language. Her leg bounces nervously. 
           Her left hand taps frenetic patterns against her chair... 
           Cello fingerings. Adara is a bundle of nerves.
                                 MIA
                        Not exactly. Though I do have a 
                        harder time picturing a vegetarian 
                        carving up the president.

           Mia turns back to Goldie.

                                 MIA
                        Thank you, Goldie. Come see me if 
                        you notice anything else.

                                 GOLDIE
                        Oh yes, I will Ms. Pine.

           Mia dismisses her with a nod. Agent Stone presses a finger to 
           his earpiece, listening intently.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Dr. Cheng attempted resuscitation 
                        on POTUS.

                                 MIA
                        And?

           Agent Stone shakes his head gravely.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        I’m sure sorry.

           Mia’s face falls. She covers her eyes with both hands.

           INT. WAR ROOM – CONTINUOUS

           Mia marks the time on her cell phone. She takes a deep breath 
           and enters the War Room.

           Conversation falls silent.

                                 MIA
                        Tonight, at 11:25pm, President 
                        Henry Wood was pronounced dead.

           The first lady’s shoulders slump. Adara looks away, hiding 
           her face. Chief of Staff Holland rubs his temples.

           The Speaker of the House rises to address the room.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Abraham Lincoln. William McKinley. 
                        James Garfield. John F. Kennedy. 
                        And now Henry Douglas Wood... 
                        Before we get caught up in politics 
                        and blamestorming, we should take a 
                        moment to honor a fallen president.
           The group listens.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        I did not know Hank well. But I 
                        admired him. Would anyone like to 
                        offer some words of remembrance?

           There are a few moments of foot-shuffling, throat-clearing 
           awkward silence. No one speaks up. Finally, Mia jumps in to 
           fill the hole.

                                 MIA
                        “Even in our sleep, pain which 
                        cannot forget, falls drop by drop 
                        upon the heart, until in our own 
                        despair, against our will, comes 
                        wisdom through the awful grace of 
                        God.”

           Mia swallows. The room is silent.

                                 MIA
                        It’s from Aeschylus.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Thank you. Does anyone else have 
                        anything to add?

           More silence. At last, the first lady holds up her mug.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Pain makes you stronger. Tears make 
                        you braver. Heartbreak makes you 
                        wiser. And gin makes you not 
                        remember any of that crap.

           She salutes the room with her mug and drinks.

           Deputy National Security Advisor MARK BANKS bursts into the 
           room. He wears a rumpled dress shirt with the sleeves rolled 
           up. He’s flanked by a DUTY OFFICER, a COMMUNICATIONS 
           ASSISTANT and two CIA ANALYSTS.

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        Mr. Vice President, I apologize for 
                        the interruption. We have satellite 
                        of the Russians advancing their 
                        ground troops in Syria.

           The two analysts set up laptops and turn on the War Room’s 
           SMART screens, pulling up SATELLITE IMAGES OF RUSSIAN TANK 
           POSITIONS IN THE SYRIAN DESERT.
                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        In the past 20 minutes, the 
                        Russians have crossed the border to 
                        advance on Aleppo.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Those are not Russian troops.

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        Fine, Syrian resistance fighters 
                        armed by Russia, trained by Russia, 
                        embedded with Russian intelligence 
                        agents, with Russian air support. 
                        Tomato, to-mah-to.

           Banks turns back to the vice president.

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        We don’t know what triggered this. 
                        Drone footage shows a missile 
                        launcher smorgasbord. They’re on a 
                        war footing.

           The vice president turns to the Russian ambassador.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        What are you up to?

           Ambassador Kamenev holds Vice President Steele’s stare.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        If you release me from this bunker, 
                        or give me a cellphone signal, 
                        maybe I can find out.

           Security Advisor Banks continues.

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        Major General Fitz is in charge on 
                        the ground. He recommends moving 
                        all our lines north to Aleppo to be 
                        ready to counterattack with 
                        hellfire missiles.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Keep me updated. The American 
                        people just lost a president. 
                        They’re gonna want a show of force.

           Banks shuts his laptop and the analysts file out. Holland 
           sidles up next to the vice president at the side table.
                                 HOLLAND
                        Sir, can I get you a coffee? 
                        They’ve got a Keurig with the 
                        single pods.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Sure, why not.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Let me guess: cream, sugar, and 
                        marshmallows?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Black as the night.

           Adara corners Mia.

                                 ADARA
                        Can I leave? I am just the cello 
                        player.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                             (vicious)
                        Then you’ve got a strong right arm. 
                        You could have stabbed that knife 
                        into him better than any of us.

           Mia’s face is ashen. Voices swirl around her as she takes 
           slow, deep breaths.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        The speaker and I should be allowed 
                        to leave. The murderer couldn’t 
                        have been a middle-aged woman. Hank 
                        was a 200-pound former wrestler. 
                        How could we overpower him?

           The vice president points to his carotid artery...

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        We learned blood-chokes in the 
                        Marines. It’s amazing how fast you 
                        lose consciousness when the carotid 
                        artery can’t pump blood to your 
                        brain.

           He shakes his head.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        That knife would have put Hank’s 
                        lights out in seconds. I believe a 
                        woman could have done this.
                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        An equal opportunity investigation.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Not completely equal. Look at 
                        Holland. What possible motive could 
                        he have for killing him?

           Eyes turn to the young chief of staff, polishing his glasses.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        V-neck? He couldn’t kill a fly.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for 
                        that vote of confidence in my 
                        character.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I still say it was one of the men. 
                        Terra and I are too level-headed.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Hank was stabbed in the neck. 
                        That’s clearly a crime of passion!

           Mia takes a breath and steps forward.

                                 MIA
                        No. The killer needed to conceal 
                        the knife in the dining room before 
                        bringing it to the Oval Office. 
                        That shows malice of forethought.

           Everyone turns to Mia. The color has returned to her cheeks.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Who are you anyway? And what kind 
                        of bodyguard quotes Cicero?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Aeschylus.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Whoever. I’d like to see your 
                        badge.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Jim, she clearly works here. She 
                        didn’t just sneak in to prank us.
                                 MIA
                        No, it’s okay. I have not properly 
                        introduced myself. And so perhaps I 
                        have not been entirely truthful. 
                        The president personally requested 
                        me to attend tonight.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Why? Who are you?

                                 MIA
                        My name is Mia Pine. I am Secret 
                        Service. That much is true. 
                        Everyone knows the Secret Service 
                        protects the president, but that is 
                        only half our mandate. We have an 
                        investigative mission: drug 
                        enforcement, antiterrorism, money 
                        laundering, even missing children. 
                        I am an investigator, trained to 
                        observe.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Why did the president want you here 
                        tonight?

                                 MIA
                        Because he thought someone might 
                        try to kill him.

           The diners exchange shocked looks.

                                 MIA
                        In the secret service, the best way 
                        to solve a crime is before it even 
                        happens. To anticipate the enemy’s 
                        intent. The president’s instincts 
                        were correct. Unfortunately, I was 
                        too late. And someone – who I 
                        believe is in this room – 
                        succeeded.

           Mia steps forward, now commanding the room.

                                 MIA
                        Was it a personal dispute? Or was 
                        someone attempting to blow up the 
                        Syrian Peace Accord? Was it the 
                        Russians? Or someone implicating 
                        the Russians? Cui bono?

           Mia circles the room.
                                 MIA
                        We have only a few hours to solve 
                        this murder before America goes to 
                        war.

           She stops at the head of the boardroom table.

                                 MIA
                        Since I was not there during 
                        dinner, I will be relying on all of 
                        your memories tonight, faulty 
                        though human memory may be. I will 
                        be conducting private conversations 
                        with each of you, starting 
                        clockwise. Before we begin, I think 
                        it may be wise to bear in mind two 
                        quotes from the Greek poet 
                        Aeschylus. “Memory is the mother of 
                        all wisdom.” And...

           The room listens intently.

                                 MIA
                        “In war, truth is the first 
                        casualty.”

           INT. BREAK ROOM - HOLLAND ATKINSON’S INTERROGATION

           A small kitchenette with a fridge and microwave. Holland 
           shuts the door and turns to Mia.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Clockwise, huh?

           He wraps his arms around her. He kisses the line of her jaw 
           and down her neck. He leans her head back.

                                 MIA
                        Nice performance out there. Kissing 
                        ass and taking numbers.

           He kisses his way up to her mouth and she turns away.

                                 MIA
                        No, no making out. It doesn’t feel 
                        right.
                                 HOLLAND
                        ‘Cause we’re at work?

                                 MIA
                        No.

                                 HOLLAND
                        ‘Cause I drank coffee?

                                 MIA
                        No! Because a sitting US president 
                        was just murdered on my watch!

                                 HOLLAND
                        It’s not your fault-

                                 MIA
                        -Of course it is! It’s my job to 
                        protect him. Who else’s fault would 
                        it be?

                                 HOLLAND
                        The murderer’s?

           Mia rifles through the cabinets by the sink until she finds a 
           stack of board games.

                                 MIA
                        I found the chessboard. C’mon, 
                        c’mon. You know it helps me think.

           She sits at the table and begins setting up the pieces.

           Holland ransacks the cabinets and comes up with a stash of 
           cereal boxes. He pours several different brands into a bowl.

                                 HOLLAND
                        All right, if getting your ass 
                        whooped makes you feel better, who 
                        am I to stand in the way?

                                 MIA
                        Is that Cap’n Crunch, Count 
                         Chocula, and Froot Loops?

                                 HOLLAND
                        You’re goddamn right it is. Who do 
                        you like for the murder?

                                 MIA
                        You eat like a four year-old. Pawn 
                        to E-4, bitch. Your move.

           She hits play on her iPhone. BACH.
                                 HOLLAND
                        Classical music?

                                 MIA
                        I need everything going to kick my 
                        brain into gear. If they had a 
                        piano down here, I’d be playing it. 
                        Now it’s past midnight and I am 
                        definitely not a night person, so 
                        just play, okay?

                                 HOLLAND
                        They’ll be wondering why you’re 
                        interrogating me for so long.

                                 MIA
                        Then play faster.

           Holland plays his knight.

                                 HOLLAND
                        You quoted Aeschylus out there. 
                        Twice. No, three times.

                                 MIA
                        I need them to respect me. They see 
                        me as blue collar.

                                 HOLLAND
                        It’s not your collar they’re 
                        seeing, it’s your shoulder with the 
                        chip on it.

                                 MIA
                        I had to stare down the vice 
                        president. Like playing chicken 
                        with a freight train. I didn’t see 
                        you chivalrously rushing to my 
                        defense.

                                 HOLLAND
                        My boss is dearly departed. I’m no 
                        longer chief of staff, I’m chief of 
                        unemployment unless I can prove I’m 
                        indispensable to that wildebeest.

                        While you were blowing pitch pipes 
                        in the Harvard Krokodiloes, he was 
                        dodging bullets in the Korengal 
                        Valley. Besides, the VP has his own 
                        chief of staff, you know.
                                 HOLLAND
                        Point is, I’m not picking any 
                        fights with him. There’s no 
                        percentage in it. I come to your 
                        defense, people suspect we’re 
                        dating. Check.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Is that more Aeschylus?

                        It’s Dr. Phil. You know how 
                        Aeschylus died, right?

                                 HOLLAND
                        You’re always obsessed with how 
                        everyone died. You’re-you’re-you’re 
                        like my grandmother morbidly 
                        sending me obituaries.
                             (then)
                        Nice shoes, by the way. You look 
                        like you robbed the grave of Nikita 
                        Khrushchev.

                                 MIA
                        Wow. Khrushchev: very topical. Why 
                        does everyone hate my shoes?

                                 HOLLAND
                        I have a visual eye that is easily 
                        offended.
                             (again)
                        Who do you like for the murder?

                        Well, my dear Watson. I don’t want 
                        to call the race before the 
                        primaries. A detective picks a 
                        favorite too soon and they get a 
                        blind spot. They only look for 
                        evidence that supports their bias. 
                        I focus too hard on your pawns and 
                        I forget all about your 
                        fianchettoed bishop, aiming at my 
                        king like a sniper. Cheeky bastard.

                        I’m free at last. She’s back with

                        It’s like you decorated by raiding 
                        a frat house. How do you feel about

                        It’s sad, but let’s face it: I’m 
                        not a family man. My duty is here. 
                        And your-your-your duty is to rally 
                        around the vice president. He’s the 
                        new star around which we orbit.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - FIRST LADY GAIL WOOD’S INTERROGATION

           The first lady sits barefoot, sipping from her mug. Her high 
           heels are nowhere to be seen.

                        I am so sorry for your loss, Mrs.

                        He was a short man with a shorter 
                        temper. You know how some people 
                        have dysphonia - the sound of 
                        someone chewing popcorn can drive 
                        them insane? I had that for his 
                        entire personality.

                                 MIA

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        He was completely uninterested in 
                        culture. Do you know, the first 
                        time we went to the opera, he 
                        called it Wagner’s Rinse Cycle? Oh, 
                        but he charmed people with that 
                        delicate Connecticut etiquette.

                        Have you ever lost anyone close to 
                        you, hon? Or are you too young?

                        forever. I just asked because I 
                        thought you’d stopped drinking.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I know Hank had you people empty 
                        every wet bar on the grounds. But 
                        you don’t get to be first lady

                        I know all about your 
                        resourcefulness. You’re famous in 
                        the Secret Service for being the 
                        only first lady to sneak off the 
                        grounds in a catering truck.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Well, Michelle Obama started the 
                        vegetable garden. I needed to be 
                        first at something.

                                 MIA
                        How many drinks have you had this 
                        evening?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Less than a lot, more than a few. 
                        You’ve been in the White House for 
                        a while, Mia. You must know about 
                        his affair with that young staffer. 
                        Gave her an 18-karat gold bracelet 
                        inlaid with ten diamonds. Cartier.

                                 MIA
                        The president was wealthy. There’s 
                        a rumor he was changing his will.
           The first lady takes a slow sip from her mug.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Rumor is a beast with many eyes and 
                        many tongues and it flies faster 
                        than any creature.

                                 MIA
                        When I found you tonight, how did 
                        you come to have the president’s 
                        blood on your hands?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I must have embraced him.

                                 MIA
                        Around his neck?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I honestly don’t remember.

                                 MIA
                        Can you remember what was served 
                        for dessert?

           The first lady frowns.

                                 MIA
                        How about dinner?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Most of what I remember about 
                        dinner was that awful woman. With 
                        her olive eyes and olive skin, 
                        sucking olives from her martini 
                        glass and giggling at all Hank’s 
                        tired jokes.

           Something vicious flashes behind the first lady’s eyes.

           INT. BREAK ROOM – ADARA LEHAVA’S INTERROGATION

           Adara sits cross-legged, tapping one high heel. Her silky, 
           raven hair covers one eye. She applies lipstick, a bold shade 
           of cherry blossom.

                                 MIA
                        I just have to say, I was 
                        tremendously moved by your recital 
                        tonight. I love the Bach cello 
                        suites.

           Adara speaks with a rhythmic accent.
                                 ADARA
                        Bach did not write them on 
                        commission. Bach write them just 
                        for ’imself alone. So they contain 
                        Bach’s soul.

           Mia sees Adara’s fingernails are nibbled down to the quick.

                                 MIA
                        All Israeli women serve in the

                        One of the few female combat 
                        divisions in the world.

                                 ADARA
                        You know of it?

                                 MIA
                        I’ve seen the photos: a bunch of 
                        badass women in body armor sporting 
                        huge assault rifles. You’re a 
                        feminist icon. It’s an honor to 
                        meet you.

                                 ADARA
                        It was an ’onor to serve.

                                 MIA
                        They give you time off to practice 
                        cello?

           Adara smiles and nods.

                                 ADARA
                        They made special allowance. It was 
                        good public relations for a touring 
                        cellist to come back to serve 
                        Israel.

                                 MIA
                        Tell me, how did you get invited to 
                        dinner tonight? I mean... First 
                        Lady Wood... Vice President 
                        Steele... Ambassador Kamenev... 
                        Cello player. One of these things 
                        is not like the others.
                                 ADARA
                        I was surprise as anyone. Maybe is 
                        normal to invite the evening’s 
                        musician. ’enry was very polite.

                                 MIA
                        I didn’t take President Wood for a 
                        music lover. I checked the Secret 
                        Service log. You’ve visited him 
                        several times this year – even at 
                        Camp David. Did you two have a 
                        special relationship?

           Adara begins fidgeting with her bracelet, turning it around 
           and around on her wrist.

                                 ADARA
                        ’enry and I... Were good friends.

           Mia looks down at Adara’s fidgeting hands.

                                 MIA
                        Your bracelet. Is that Cartier?

           INT. BREAK ROOM - AMBASSADOR PYOTR KAMENEV’S INTERROGATION

           Ambassador Kamenev lights up a slim Davidoff Gold cigarette, 
           his legs crossed primly at the knees. His movements are 
           graceful and elegant, like a dancer.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I apologize for smoking. I did not 
                        know I would be locked indoors so 
                        many hours. I will smoke quickly.

           He sucks hard on the cigarette and exhales up toward the 
           ceiling vent.

           Mia scans a computer printout.

                                 MIA
                        A medal of commendation in The 
                        Second Chechen War?

           The Russian nods.

                                 MIA
                        Did you kill people?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                             (frowning)
                        Why would you ask me that?
                                 MIA
                        I was just curious how you earned 
                        your medal.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        The Secret Service men you work 
                        with – most of them served in the 
                        military, yes? You ask them if they 
                        kill people?

                                 MIA
                        I served too, you know.

           Ambassador Kamenev draws on his cigarette and says nothing.

                                 MIA
                        You are staying in the Russian 
                        embassy, right? Isn’t that the U.S. 
                        headquarters of the FSB?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        You are calling me a spy?

                                 MIA
                        I’d just like to know where you’re 
                        staying. In case I need to get in 
                        touch with you about this 
                        investigation.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I killed a man at the Battle of 
                        Grozny. It turned out he was a 
                        Chechen commander. The army gave me 
                        a medal.

           The ambassador crushes out his cigarette.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        The killing made me sick. For 
                        years, it was all I see when I shut 
                        my eyes at night. It was the reason 
                        I became diplomat. So that I could 
                        prevent humanitarian disasters like 
                        Chechnya from ever happening again.

           Mia studies his eyes, his body language.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Why you looking at me like that?

                                 MIA
                        It’s just interesting how many 
                        people we have here tonight who are 
                        trained to kill.
           INT. BREAK ROOM - VICE PRESIDENT STEELE’S INTERROGATION

           Vice President Jim Steele sits with marine posture. His 
           presence fills the room. He seems better suited for 
           battlefields than kitchenettes.

           Nevertheless, he has a plain-spoken Midwestern charm that 
           evokes potlucks and barn-raisings.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I honor your service, Ms. Pine, 
                        like I honor the service of any 
                        American in uniform, and I 
                        apologize if I treated you 
                        disrespectfully earlier this 
                        evening.

                                 MIA
                        No apology necessary, Mr. Vice 
                        President.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Now I know what you’re thinking. 
                        It’s no secret I ran a vicious 
                        campaign against Hank in the 
                        primaries, and the only reason he 
                        chose me as his running mate was a 
                        calculated bid to win the more 
                        polarized wing of the party. It’s 
                        no secret I’m ass-deep in defense 
                        contracts. You probably think I 
                        have Boeing tattooed on my right 
                        butt cheek, and Lockheed Martin on 
                        the left. It’s no secret I saw 
                        heavy combat in Iraq and probably 
                        have more than a few freckles of 
                        PTSD. It’s no secret I’ve got that 
                        famous hair-trigger temper they 
                        bellyache about in the press. Some 
                        people call it being a straight 
                        shooter and some people call it 
                        being an asshole. Some people say 
                        it will be the ruin of me. All of 
                        these non-secrets are true. Except 
                        the part about the Lockheed Martin 
                        tattoo - my ass tattoo says 
                        Northrop Grumman.
                             (then)
                        That was a joke, by the way.

           He sips his coffee, stares at the mug, and shakes his head.
                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Say what you will about that 
                        jabbering lickspittle, V-neck. He 
                        can make the living shit out of a 
                        cup of coffee.

           He clears his throat and continues.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        It’s no secret I hate the Syrian 
                        Peace Accord. If we want the Middle 
                        East to heel, we need to show our 
                        might. An eye for an eye. It’s the 
                        only thing those people will 
                        respect. Hank and I didn’t agree on 
                        everything but we saw eye to eye on 
                        that. Now it’s no secret I stand to 
                        benefit from the president’s 
                        untimely passing, god rest his 
                        soul. I get to step up and pinch 
                        hit. And it’s no secret that the 
                        split second I’m sworn in, I’m 
                        blowing up the peace deal and 
                        that’s just the first thing I’m 
                        blowing up.

           He finishes his coffee, crushes the Styrofoam cup in his 
           fist, and tosses it in the wastebasket.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        All that is the god’s honest truth. 
                        But here’s another truth: I fucking 
                        love this country. I honor the 
                        office of the president. And if 
                        anyone’s crazy enough to think for 
                        one goddamn second that I would 
                        ever lift a finger against the 
                        President of the United-Fucking-
                        States of America, they’re out of 
                        their goddamn mind.

           He leans in close to Mia.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Now look me in the eyes, and tell 
                        me if I ain’t telling the truth.

           Vice President Steele stares down Mia, his glass eye peering 
           somewhere right-of-center.
           INT. BREAK ROOM - SPEAKER TERRA BROOKES’ INTERROGATION

           The Speaker of the House plucks an English muffin from the 
           toaster before taking a seat. She has the confidence of a 
           person wealthy enough to own multiple horse farms.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Clockwise, huh?

                                 MIA
                        Saving the best for last.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Are we becoming best friends?

           Mia waves a printout.

                                 MIA
                        I’ve been reading about you.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Likewise, Mia.

                                 MIA
                        How did you get on the internet?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Don’t worry. I’m not leaking 
                        anything about the president.

                                 MIA
                        It’s not in your self-interest.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You’ve built quite a reputation for 
                        yourself.

                                 MIA
                        Madam Speaker, are you planning a 
                        presidential run?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Remember, call me Terra. You’re a 
                        Secret Service legend. You caught 
                        James Joseph, the white supremacist 
                        terrorist.

                                 MIA
                        You know what Virgil said about 
                        rumors, Terra.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        And you foiled the Thanksgiving Day 
                        Parade attack. 
                                 SPEAKER BROOKES (CONT'D)
                                 SPEAKER BROOKES (CONT'D)
                        The public never hears about the 
                        attacks that don’t happen. They 
                        never learn who the true heroes 
                        are...

                                 MIA
                        There are rumors you’ve already 
                        raised twelve million dollars for 
                        your campaign.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You’re the youngest person – male 
                        or female – to be promoted to the 
                        level of Deputy Chief. I know this 
                        town: you don’t get to that level 
                        without being at least a little 
                        ruthless.

                                 MIA
                        I don’t have much of a social life.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        A classics major. A graduate degree 
                        in psych. They say you can tell 
                        when a person is lying. Can you?

                                 MIA
                        Have you ever met a sociopath?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Every day in Congress.

                                 MIA
                        I’m talking about a person capable 
                        of remorseless violence. I have, 
                        several times. They were always 
                        incredibly charming.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        So you cannot spot liars?

                                 MIA
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        What are you saying?

                                 MIA
                        I do not trust myself to spot the 
                        lie. But I trust myself to spot the 
                        liar.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        How?
           Speaker Brookes bites into her English muffin with an audible 
           crunch.

                                 MIA
                        A lot is in the eyes. I judge 
                        character. People are constantly 
                        revealing themselves if we just pay 
                        attention. Like you, for instance.

           Speaker Brookes raises one eyebrow.

                                 MIA
                        I set out to interrogate you; you 
                        end up interrogating me. Classic 
                        deflection. What are you hiding?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You’ve had a chance to look at 
                        everyone tonight. Which of them is 
                        capable of premeditated murder?

                                 MIA
                        Several.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Am I one of them?

                                 MIA
                        Well, you’re extremely charming. 
                        Whether or not that makes you a 
                        sociopath... Time will tell.

           A WOMAN’S SCREAMS CUT THE SILENCE. MIA JUMPS TO HER FEET.

                                 MIA
                        Jesus. Not again.

                              Chapter Four: The First Lady

           INT. BUNKER – WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           MIA BURSTS INTO THE WAR ROOM. THE FIRST LADY IS GRAPPLING 
           WITH ADARA, SCRATCHING, CLAWING, AND KICKING.

                                 MIA
                        For god’s sakes, break it up!

           MIA HOOKS THE FIRST LADY’S ELBOWS AND DRAGS HER BACKWARD. 
           VICE PRESIDENT STEELE BEAR HUGS ADARA, LIFTING HER TO SAFETY.
           ADARA IS BLEEDING FROM AN UGLY CUT BY HER RIGHT EYE.

           THE FIRST LADY STRUGGLES AGAINST MIA’S GRIP.

                                 MIA
                        Mrs. Wood, relax!

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I’ll kill her!

                                 MIA
                        Calm down!

           MIA TIGHTENS HER ARM-BAR.

                                 MIA
                        An hour ago you were saying you’re 
                        too level-headed for a crime of 
                        passion, that women aren’t capable 
                        of violence.

           Mia wrestles a high heel out of the first lady’s grip. She 
           looks at the nasty heel tip and then at Adara’s eye.

                                 MIA
                        Is that your first instinct, Mrs. 
                        Wood? To stab?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Let go of me.

           Mia releases the first lady.

           Ambassador Kamenev wets some paper towels and hands them to 
           Adara. She dabs at her bleeding face and the fingernail 
           scratches on her wrist.

                                 ADARA
                        She tries to take my bracelet. I 
                        try to make ‘er - um - decrescendo 
                        but she is like crazy person!

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        This Mediterranean hussy doesn’t 
                        deserve that bracelet.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Come on, Gail. Keep your dignity.

           The first lady gives the vice president a scathing look.

           Mia takes the first lady’s drinking mug and pours it in the 
           trash. She hands the empty mug to Holland.
                                 MIA
                        Holland, work your Keurig magic 
                        with one of those coffee pods. Make 
                        it strong.

           The first lady is still spitting mad.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Adara isn’t just an innocent cello 
                        player, you know.

                                 MIA
                        And who is she then?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        She’s an Israeli asset.

           The vice president throws his hands in the air.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Of course she is. You think the 
                        president would negotiate the 
                        Syrian Peace Accord without keeping 
                        the Israelis informed? Adara is 
                        here as a professional courtesy. 
                        President Wood didn’t give a shit 
                        about cello music. No offense.

                                 ADARA
                        Some taken.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I’m just saying, the presence of an 
                        Israeli spy here should not be 
                        discounted.

                                 ADARA
                        Why would I ’urt the president?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        That’s easy. To stop the peace 
                        accord. As long as the Arab nations 
                        keeping fighting, they stay weak 
                        and Israel stays strong!

                                 MIA
                        Everyone sit down! Now!

           The dinner guests sit like scolded children.

                                 MIA
                        I believe that the eyes are the 
                        windows to the soul. They often 
                        contain all the proof you need. 
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                        When I interviewed you, each of you 
                        was lying about something. Everyone 
                        had a reason to want the president 
                        dead. Well, except for Holland – he 
                        wouldn’t hurt a fly.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Thank you?

                                 MIA
                        Madam Speaker is rumored to be 
                        exploring a presidential run. And 
                        the only person who can beat her in 
                        the polling... is now dead.

           Terra Brookes looks up at Mia, shocked.

           Mia circles the table clockwise.

                                 MIA
                        The first lady is not too thrilled 
                        about her husband’s extramarital 
                        extracurriculars. He was powerless 
                        to divorce her while in the highest 
                        office in the land. However, I 
                        happen to know that the president 
                        threatened to change his will if 
                        she did not curb her drinking.

                                 FIRST LADY WOODS
                        You have no right to judge me!

           Mia has already moved around the table to...

                                 MIA
                        Adara is a foreign asset who has 
                        spent quite a bit of time with the 
                        president. They apparently share a 
                        rather fervent love of music.

                                 ADARA
                        We were just good friends!

                                 MIA
                        Of course. It’s just that I noticed 
                        you’re wearing the same pink shade 
                        of lipstick I spotted earlier on 
                        the president’s collar.

           Adara’s eyes widen. Mia keeps moving.
                                 MIA
                        Ambassador Kamenev. If you are not 
                        Russian intelligence, you certainly 
                        work on the same hallway. You’re a 
                        well-trained and well-decorated 
                        killer. And Russia benefits from a 
                        Middle East in chaos.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Here, here.

                                 MIA
                        And Vice President Steele. You said 
                        it’s no secret you didn’t want the 
                        president to sign the Syrian Peace 
                        Accord. And you stand to benefit 
                        more than anyone from his death. 
                        You get to sit in the big chair.

           The vice president clenches his jaw and says nothing.

                                 MIA
                        So here we are. Who is lying, and 
                        who is telling the truth?

           Mia crosses her arms.

                                 MIA
                        All of you have told lies tonight.
                             (then)
                        Except maybe Holland.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Thank you, Mia.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Why you assume he is so innocent?

                                 MIA
                        Because I know his whereabouts at 
                        the time of the murder.

           Mia lowers her eyes and quickly continues.

                                 MIA
                        Earlier tonight I told madam 
                        speaker that there were already 
                        several important clues. I’d like 
                        to share one with you now...

           Mia pulls up a photo on her phone and shares it on the War 
           Room’s SMART screens.
                                 MIA
                        Mrs. Wood, you may want to look 
                        away.

           THE SCREENS DISPLAY A GRUESOME IMAGE OF THE DEAD PRESIDENT. 
           He is sitting up in his chair, head tilted back. A knife 
           protruding from his throat. Blood soaking his shirt.

           The first lady moans.

           Holland looks nauseous.

           Agent Stone crosses the room with a first aid kit for Adara.

           Mia cycles through a few photos of the president’s corpse.

                                 MIA
                        When I first looked at these, 
                        something immediately struck me as 
                        odd. Does anyone see it?

           Adara gingerly holds out her scratched wrist for Agent Stone 
           to dab with iodine.

                                 ADARA
                        No defensive wounds?

           Mia nods. She examines the screen more closely.

                                 MIA
                        True... But it’s more than that. 
                        What’s the first thing you do when 
                        someone stabs you in the neck?

           Nobody answers. Holland jumps in the hole.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Call HR?

           Crickets.

                                 MIA
                        Holland, I need a volunteer. Would 
                        you help me?

           Mia grips a dry erase marker overhand like a knife. She steps 
           behind Holland’s chair and wraps one arm around his neck. 
           With her knife hand – in exaggerated slow motion – she drives 
           the marker down on Holland’s carotid artery.

           Instinctively, Holland lifts his hands in defense.

           Mia tucks the marker under his V-neck, so that it stands 
           straight up.
                                 MIA
                        You are now the proud owner of a 
                        knife in your carotid artery. What 
                        do you do?

           Holland clutches at the marker, a bit theatrically.

                                 MIA
                        See? Your hand went to it 
                        instinctively. You want to staunch 
                        the bleeding. Forget defensive 
                        wounds. There’s no blood on the 
                        president’s hands.

           Mia points to the TV screens. Sure enough, the president’s 
           hands are immaculate.

                                 MIA
                        Think about it. He was stabbed in 
                        the neck and bled to death, and he 
                        never once thought to grab the 
                        knife or stem the bleeding. He just 
                        sat there with his hands at his 
                        sides.

           The room is silent.

                                 MIA
                        When we found his body, I saw there 
                        was no blood on the phone. Why 
                        didn’t he call for help? I even 
                        checked the panic button under his 
                        desk – there’s no blood there, 
                        either.

           The group takes this in. Agent Stone packs up his first aid 
           kit and bows out of the room.

                                 MIA
                        But it gets stranger...

           Mia crosses back to Holland.

                                 MIA
                        You’re stabbed in the neck, you’re 
                        passing out. Act it out for us.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        This is in poor taste.

                                 MIA
                        Please, it’s important. Holland, 
                        pretend you’re bleeding out.
           Holland seems to get into the acting. His eyes dim and slowly 
           close. He collapses forward onto the table.

                                 MIA
                        Oscar-winning. But why didn’t you 
                        fall backward?

           Holland returns to life.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Well, it felt natural. The chair 
                        kind of sends you forward.

                                 MIA
                        Let’s try again to make sure.

           Mia retrieves the marker and once again mimes stabbing 
           Holland in the neck.

                                 MIA
                        You’ve been stabbed in the neck. 
                        Holland, can you imagine any world 
                        in which you could pass out in the 
                        same position as the president?

           Holland eyes the SMART screen. He mimes passing out while 
           staying sitting up, his head resting back in the posture of 
           the president.

                                 HOLLAND
                        No. It’s completely unnatural. I 
                        don’t think it’s possible.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        So what does this mean?

                                 MIA
                        The president was already 
                        incapacitated.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Someone stabbed him when he was 
                        already unconscious?

                                 MIA
                        Yes. Somehow, he was placed in this 
                        position.

           The group digests this.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        So someone drugged him first?
                                 MIA
                        We’ll soon find out from a tox 
                        screen.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        He did have the white wine at 
                        dinner. I noticed because everyone 
                        else had the sense to have red wine 
                        with the steak. But if someone put 
                        something in the white wine...

                                 ADARA
                        Or the coffee. He had coffee.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        So, someone killed him twice? Once 
                        with poison and once with a knife?

                                 ADARA
                        Or there are two killers.

                                 MIA
                        Or a third possibility. One I can’t 
                        quite see yet...

           The first lady waves her hands at the SMART screen.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I’m sorry. Can we change the 
                        channel?

           Mia sees Agent Stone appear in the doorway.

                                 MIA
                        Of course. Let’s all take a moment.

           Mia turns off the SMART screens and moves to the door to 
           huddle with Agent Stone.

                                 AGENT STONE
                             (whispered)
                        Why are you open-sourcing this 
                        investigation? I mean, if the 
                        killer is really here, aren’t you 
                        tipping your hand?

                                 MIA
                        Maybe. But I believe the killer’s 
                        behavior will change as I get 
                        hotter or colder. And I am watching 
                        for that change.
           Mia eyes the diners. First Lady Wood pats tears with a wadded 
           up Kleenex and shuffles off to the bathroom. Speaker Brookes 
           stretches her neck and paces.

                                 MIA
                        Is Dr. Silver examining the 
                        president? Where is he with my 
                        expedited toxicology report?

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Nothing yet.

                                 MIA
                        I’m looking for a sedative – 
                        something to knock out the 
                        president. Rohypnol in his drink, 
                        chloroform in his nasal passages – 
                        anything. Any word on knife 
                        fingerprints?
                             (she catches Stone’s look)
                        What is it?

                                 AGENT STONE
                        She insisted...

           Agent Stone shrugs apologetically and steps to one side. 
           Chief Server Goldie pushes her way into the war room, 
           breathless and earnest.

                                 CHIEF SERVER GOLDIE
                        Ms. Pine, there is another mystery!

           Mia raises her eyebrows. The dinner guests in the room strain 
           to listen while feigning interest in their smartphones.

                                 CHIEF SERVER GOLDIE
                        You tell me to report anything else 
                        I notice. After I count all the 
                        knives, I decide to count the other 
                        silverware. Is all there. Then I 
                        think: count the plates and 
                        glasses. Is all there. Then I 
                        think: count the napkins. And...

           She leans in dramatically.

                                 CHIEF SERVER GOLDIE
                        ...There is one napkin missing!

           Mia glances at Agent Stone who shrugs again. Mia pats Goldie 
           on the arm.
                                 MIA
                        Thank you, Goldie. We shall add 
                        this crime to our list.

           Agent Stone ushers Goldie from the room.

           Mia reviews her interview notes. Holland maneuvers close to 
           her on the pretense of pouring more coffee.

                                 HOLLAND
                             (whispered)
                        You had to pick me to stab to 
                        death?

                                 MIA
                        Maybe it was Freudian.

                                 HOLLAND
                        How you holding up?

                                 MIA
                        I have a working hypothesis. I just 
                        need to test it.

           Mia notices Vice President Steele locked in debate with  
           Ambassador Kamenev. She focuses on their conversation...

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You sold Syria weapons for years 
                        and then act shocked when they use 
                        them.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Do you care about peace? Or Syria’s 
                        oil? How much did Exxon fund your 
                        campaign?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Russia wants Syria in chaos so 
                        Turkey destabilizes.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Why do we want that?

           The vice president laughs. He spreads his arms wide, 
           addressing the whole room.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Because Russia wants a warm water 
                        port!

           The vice president stands, towering over the seated Russian, 
           invading his personal space. The temperature in the room 
           changes.
                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        It’s what Russia wanted in the 
                        Crimean War, the Russo-Japanese 
                        War, World War One, the Ukrainian 
                        genocide, and again in the Crimean 
                        annexation of 2014! If Russia 
                        destabilizes Turkey, you win the 
                        Dardanelles.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Jim, if we put self-interest aside 
                        and deescalate, then Russia can 
                        back down while saving face-

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        -Terra, gimme a goddamn break-

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        -We could both leave the region in 
                        peace and save our countries a 
                        costly proxy war-

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        -And we’ll all hold hands, pass a 
                        joint, go back to Berkeley, and 
                        play in a drum circle.

           The vice president turns to Adara.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You’re Israeli. The Syrians have 
                        broken every treaty they’ve ever 
                        signed. Do you believe their 
                        leadership can promise peace?

                                 ADARA
                             (guarded)
                        I do not believe the word of a 
                        dictator can ever be trusted.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I agree!

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        And what is a dictator, exactly?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Someone who leads a country without 
                        being properly voted in for the 
                        job.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Oh. You mean, like you, when you 
                        become president tomorrow?
           VICE PRESIDENT STEELE POURS HIS COFFEE ON AMBASSADOR KAMENEV.

           THE AMBASSADOR LEAPS TO HIS FEET.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Are you out of your mind?

           MIA CROSSES THE ROOM.

                                 MIA
                        That’s enough!

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        They spike our elections, they 
                        poison diplomats, and now they 
                        assassinate presidents! And nobody 
                        does a damn thing about it. Well, I 
                        will!

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        By throwing coffee?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        More than that.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        What are you going to do? “Blood-
                        choke” me?

           VICE PRESIDENT STEELE CURLS HIS FISTS. MIA THROWS HERSELF 
           BETWEEN THE TWO MEN.

                                 MIA
                        Sir, you are about to become the 
                        president!

           Mia stands chest-to-belly with the vice president, holding 
           him back from assaulting the ambassador.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I don’t appreciate the pass 
                        interference.

                                 MIA
                        Sir, I am asking you to stand down.

           Ambassador Kamenev wipes hot coffee from his dripping jacket.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I flew 5,000 miles to be here 
                        tonight.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        And you can fly 5,000 miles back.
           The first lady returns from the bathroom and takes in the 
           scene.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Soak it in cold water.

           Ambassador Kamenev turns and strides from the room.

           Agent Stone steps in, hand on his weapons belt.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        I heard shouting. Everything okay?

           Vice President Steele snaps his fingers at Agent Stone.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Keep an eye on that Russian. This 
                        is a top-secret facility. I don’t 
                        want him wandering around, checking 
                        in the medicine cabinets.

                                 MIA
                        Sir, he’s just going to the 
                        bathroom. He doesn’t need an 
                        escort.

           Vice President Steele glares down at Mia.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You’ve really picked sides, haven’t 
                        you?

           Holland cues Mia with a subtle nod of his head. Meet me 
           outside.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Holland strides out of earshot from the War Room. Mia catches 
           up.

                                 MIA
                        Okay. What did I do?

                                 HOLLAND
                        You know how we promised that we 
                        would be each other’s makeup 
                        mirror, and always let the other 
                        know when we had spinach in our 
                        teeth?

           Mia nods, hustling to match Holland’s pace.
                                 HOLLAND
                        You’ve got major career spinach in 
                        your teeth. And what do you do? You-
                        you-you keep eating more spinach.

                                 MIA
                        He’s being an ass, that’s 
                        empirically true. But he’s being 
                        deliberate. He’s trying to provoke 
                        the ambassador and I don’t know 
                        why. There’s a strategy there...

                                 HOLLAND
                        Then let him employ his strategy – 
                        he’s the next president. And he has 
                        a sworn duty to protect America's 
                        interests on the world stage. Keep 
                        your eye on the ball!

           Mia stops, pinches the bridge of her nose, and sighs.

                                 MIA
                        I could kinda use some support 
                        right now.

           Holland softens. In the empty hallway, he places a hand on 
           her arm.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Look, I can see how tonight would 
                        be triggering for you, with your 
                        dad and all. But don’t let this 
                        blow up the career you’ve worked so 
                        hard for.

                                 MIA
                        What does my dad have to do with 
                        this?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Forget it.

           Holland keeps walking. The bunker hallway makes right turns, 
           leading back toward their starting point. Mia jogs after him.

                                 MIA
                        No, enlighten me!

                                 HOLLAND
                        Oh, c’mon Mia. You’re like a-a-a 
                        character in a Greek play! Puppeted 
                        by fate! You know what everyone 
                        says about you? Why’d she go secret 
                        service? 
                                 HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                                 HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        Why not DEA, or FBI or CIA? A smart 
                        Duke grad – a soccer star - you 
                        could have gone anywhere. Who goes 
                        Secret Service besides a bunch of 
                        washed up ex-army grunts?

           Mia stops and puts her hands on her hips. She can’t look 
           Holland in the eye.

                                 HOLLAND
                        It’s all about what happened to 
                        your dad. You want to protect 
                        people. You want to prevent the 
                        murder from ever happening in the 
                        first place.

           Mia just stares at the ground, taking slow deep breaths.

                                 HOLLAND
                        I liked the president. I really 
                        liked him. I’m sorry he died. But 
                        your career doesn’t have to die 
                        with him. You don’t have to be 
                        fate’s puppet. You can hold your 
                        own strings.

           Holland jerks a thumb back toward the War Room.

                                 HOLLAND
                        I gotta get back to the vice 
                        president. Just think about your 
                        strategy, okay?

                                 MIA
                        It was a falling tortoise.

           Holland stops walking and looks back.

                                 HOLLAND
                        What?

                                 MIA
                        Aeschylus. He was bald. Eagles 
                        break open turtles by dropping them 
                        onto rocks. The father of Greek 
                        tragedy was killed when he was 
                        struck on the head by a falling 
                        tortoise.
                        Chapter Five: The Russian Ambassador

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Deputy National Security Advisor Banks strides in, looking 
           more stressed than before. He’s followed by a tall, gray-
           haired BRIGADIER GENERAL with medals glittering on his chest. 
           The SECRETARY OF DEFENSE wears a wrinkled suit. ADMIRAL DIAZ, 
           Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is flanked by CIA ANALYSTS.

           Mia watches still more men file in... the DIRECTOR OF 
           NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, the NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO THE 
           VICE PRESIDENT, the ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL 
           SECURITY AFFAIRS...

           Analysts set up laptops around the table. Satellite images of 
           the desert flash onto the SMART screens.

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        Mr. Vice President, the Russians 
                        have tank battalions closing the 
                        noose on Homs and Damascus.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Why are they escalating?

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        No idea. We’re responding in kind. 
                        We’ve got drones ready to rain hell 
                        the second we detect any launches 
                        from the Russians.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Do we have boots on the ground?

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        We’re going to need a beat to get 
                        troops into striking distance. I’ll 
                        keep you advised. You can finish 
                        your meeting.

           Security Advisor Banks turns to Mia.

                                 SECURITY ADVISOR BANKS
                        FYSA, we’ve got four-star generals 
                        incoming. We’ve outgrown the 
                        briefing room.

                                 MIA
                             (nodding)
                        We’ll swap with you. 
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                        The briefing room has two exits; 
                        it’s perfect for what I have in 
                        mind.

           Mia turns to the dinner group and beckons them to follow.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, can you run to the break 
                        room and collect all the plates and 
                        silverware you can find? And 
                        napkins – don’t forget napkins.

           Agent Stone looks at her quizzically but does as he’s told.

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

           Office chairs surround an ovular table. The light is somehow 
           harsher, the room smaller and more claustrophobic.

           The Russian ambassador returns from the bathroom without his 
           dinner jacket - only his dress shirt and bowtie.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                             (apologetically)
                        It’s hanging to dry.

           He begins to take a seat. Mia holds a hand in the air.

                                 MIA
                        Please, no one sit down yet.

           Mia counts seven chairs and wheels the rest out of the room.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        What is this, musical chairs?

                                 MIA
                        No. It’s Cicero’s memory palace.

           The dinner guests exchange glances.

                                 MIA
                        Cicero’s friend Simonides had just 
                        left a dinner party when the roof 
                        collapsed, killing everyone inside. 
                        Family wanted to bury their dead, 
                        but couldn’t tell them apart. 
                        Simonides realized he could 
                        remember where everyone was seated 
                        by visualizing the table. You see, 
                        human memories are remarkably 
                        evolved for mapping.

           The group squints at her.
                                 MIA
                        We’re going to recreate your dinner 
                        in every detail.

           Agent Stone arrives with an armload of plastic utensils, 
           plates, and paper napkins. He spreads them out on the table.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        It’s not difficult for us to 
                        remember where we were sitting, 
                        there were only seven of us.

                                 MIA
                        Ah, but by sitting in your chairs, 
                        you will better be able to remember 
                        who left the room, when.

           Mia and Agent Stone set seven place settings.

                                 MIA
                        The president sat at the head of 
                        the table. Mrs. Wood, I assume you 
                        were at the president’s left. 
                        Ambassador Kamenev, by protocol you 
                        would be seated to the president’s 
                        right. Mr. Vice President, were you 
                        next to the Ambassador?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        This is ridiculous. This is beneath 
                        our dignity.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I agree.

                                 MIA
                        Humor me.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        There is a national emergency to 
                        attend to. When Hitler invaded 
                        Poland at Mokra, Churchill didn’t 
                        sit around playing tea party.

           Ambassador Kamenev takes his seat.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Churchill said it takes courage to 
                        stand up and speak, and also 
                        courage to sit down and listen.

           Vice President Steele stares down the Russian, who returns 
           his own unblinking gaze. The Vice President slowly lowers 
           into his chair.
           Mia squints her eyes at the mention of Churchill, her brow 
           crinkling in thought.

           Holland and Speaker Brookes find their chairs.

           Mia opens a laptop, types a few keys, and reveals a YouTube 
           video of a LOG CRACKLING IN A FIREPLACE. She sets it to full 
           screen and places it on the floor of the east wall.

           She then moves to the dimmer switch and darkens the room for 
           mood lighting.

           Mia switches on one of the hanging SMART boards and Google 
           image searches a blueprint of the West Wing.

                                 MIA
                        We’re in the private dining room. 
                        The north door leads to the West 
                        Wing corridor. The east door leads 
                        through the president’s study, past 
                        his bathroom, to the Oval Office. 
                        Are there any other details that 
                        will help set the scene?
           Vice President Steele surprises everyone by speaking up.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Well, the fireplace should really 
                        be a few feet to the left.

           Mia shifts the laptop accordingly.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        There were two vases on either side 
                        of the fireplace mantel. Gardenias.

           Mia finds two fake potted plants on a side table and moves 
           them to either side of the laptop.

           The vice president can’t help getting into it.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        There was a chandelier over the 
                        table. A grandfather clock by the 
                        window. The centerpiece was a 
                        wicker basket of flowers. Red and 
                        yellow. Marigolds, if I’m not 
                        mistaken.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Sir, that’s amazing. You must have 
                        a photographic memory.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Well, I’ve always had an eye for 
                        visual details.

                                 MIA
                        Excellent. Anyone else?

                                 ADARA
                        There was background music. Very 
                        soft. Jazz guitar. I think Grant 
                        Green? Maybe George Benson?

           Mia hands Adara a stray laptop. Adara searches and pulls up 
           Grant Green. BACKGROUND JAZZ PLAYS QUIETLY.

           Crime scene technician NANCY GARCIA (30s) pokes her head in 
           the door. With funky hair, she looks more like a DJ than a 
           police officer. She wheels in a cart with a bulky electronic 
           fingerprint reader.

                                 NANCY

                        I’ve lifted some great prints off 
                        the knife. I’ll just need 
                        everyone’s prints to make 
                        comparisons.

                                 MIA

                        the break room. I’ll send everyone 
                        out to you one by one.

           Nancy waves, wiggling her fingers. She backs out, pulling her 
           cart. Mia clasps her hands behind her back.

                                 MIA

                        He was running late. I was checking 
                        my watch every minute.

                        Yeah, you didn’t go to the 
                        bathroom. I was heading out to my 
                        office down the corridor. G7 prep. 
                        I held the door for you, and you 
                        turned right. You ran an end-around 
                        to the Oval Office to corner the 
                        president before his phone call.

           Ambassador Kamenev rubs a hand across his brow.

                        through corridor to find another 
                        bathroom.

                                 MIA
                        Okay, all of you to fingerprinting. 
                        Speaker Brookes, you exit by the 
                        east door. Everyone else through 
                        the corridor.

           The vice president, the ambassador, the speaker, and Adara, 
           all leave the room.

           Mia studies her white board and consults the West Wing map.

                 *10:30pm  President goes to Oval Office  (study exit)

                 *10:31pm  Holland goes to Chief of Staff office  (corridor exit)

                 *10:31pm  First Lady goes upstairs for meds  (corridor exit)

                 *10:32pm  VP goes to VP’s office  (corridor exit)

                 *10:32pm  Speaker goes to bathroom  (study exit)

                 *10:32pm  Ambassador goes to Oval Office  (corridor exit)

                 *10:32pm  Adara goes to bathroom  (corridor exit)

           Holland returns first from fingerprinting, scrubbing his 
           hands with Purell. Mia stays him with a flat palm.

                                 MIA
                        Don’t set foot back in this room, 
                        Holland. I know for a fact you were 
                        still in your office at 10:33pm.
           Holland raises his finger to his lips, signaling Mia to shh! 
           He backs out into the hallway, checking if anyone heard. 

           The first lady squeezes past, wiping her freshly 
           fingerprinted hands with a Kleenex.

                                 MIA
                        Mrs. Wood, how long were you 
                        upstairs getting the president’s 
                        medication?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Three or four minutes, tops. I 
                        crossed through the empty dining 
                        room to the president’s study to 
                        deliver the meds but got waylaid by 
                        Terra coming out of the bathroom.

           Speaker Brookes appears in the east doorway.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        I heard my name?

                                 MIA
                        You and the first lady spoke in the 
                        hallway by the president’s study?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Yes, she was quite agitated.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Agitated?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Shouting. Forgive me, Gail.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I don’t remember this.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        I believe you described wanting to 
                        make the president ‘swallow his own 
                        balls’ or words to that effect. I 
                        was trying to calm you down.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I wasn’t the one shouting. The only 
                        shouting I remember was coming from 
                        the president’s office.

                                 MIA
                        Is that true?
                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Yes, I forgot about that. A man’s 
                        voice. The Oval Office door was 
                        shut, so it was muffled.

           Mia writes this down on the white board...

                                 MIA
                        Call it 10:35pm, the president is 
                        still alive. Mrs. First Lady, Madam 
                        Speaker, please remain in the east 
                        hallway. Now, who returned to the 
                        dining room next?

           The background JAZZ MUSIC rises in intensity. Adara appears 
           in the north doorway along with the Russian.

                                 ADARA
                        I think maybe it is me who return 
                        next. From the bathroom.

                                 MIA
                        No. Try again.

                                 ADARA
                        What do you mean?

                                 MIA
                        Adara, you came from the Oval 
                        Office. That’s how your lipstick 
                        ended up on the president’s collar.

           Adara flushes scarlet. 

           The first lady scowls.

                                 ADARA
                        I finish using the corridor 
                        bathroom. I see the ambassador is 
                        leaving the Oval Office. He look 
                        very upset. I knew the president 
                        would be alone and need comfort.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                             (snorting)
                        Comfort...

                                 ADARA
                        ’enry was very concern about 
                        calling the Kremlin. It was 
                        difficult decision to make. ’e was 
                        in a den of snakes. ’enry needed 
                        support. Support ’e never got from 
                        ’is wife. We mostly just talked.
                                 MIA
                        How long were you there?

                                 ADARA
                        No more than three minutes.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I know my husband, sweetheart. 
                        Three minutes is plenty of time for 
                        him to drop his trousers and-

                                 MIA
                        Call it 10:38. What happened next?

                                 ADARA
                        ‘enry make White ’ouse switchboard 
                        place the call to Kremlin. I left 
                        through the corridor and return to 
                        dining room to wait for the others.

           Adara takes her seat at the table. She is now alone in the 
           dining room.

                                 MIA
                        Now Adara. No more lying. Did you 
                        see anyone at this point?

           The Russian appears in the north doorway, waiting his turn to 
           enter. The vice president is at his side.

           Adara slowly shakes her head. She drums cello fingerings with 
           her left hand...

                                 ADARA
                        I did not see anything that seemed 
                        important at the time.

           Mia watches her carefully.

                                 MIA
                             (quietly)
                        What did you see, Adara?

           Adara’s hand flutters to her mouth. She nibbles a cuticle.

                                 ADARA
                        Nothing. After a few minutes, the 
                        waitstaff clear dinner plates. They 
                        set dessert forks. They bring out 
                        little cakes – one with a candle 
                        for the ambassador.

           The vice president speaks up from the doorway.
                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Chocolate lava cakes. I returned to 
                        the room with Kamenev.

           The vice president enters the room with the Russian. They 
           sit. First Lady Wood and Speaker Brookes return as well.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        We heard dessert was ready and came 
                        running. Adara was already seated. 
                        She started singing Happy Birthday 
                        and we all joined in.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I blew out candle. It was very nice 
                        gesture. The president was, I 
                        think, a very polite man.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I love a chocolate lava cake. But 
                        as soon as the ambassador blew out 
                        his candle, I rushed to give the 
                        president his pills. That’s when I 
                        found him... I suppose it’s true: 
                        you can’t have your cake and eat 
                        it, too.

           Mia turns to the Russian.

                                 MIA
                        Mr. Ambassador, we’re closing in on 
                        a time of death. Did anyone see you 
                        enter or leave the bathroom?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        No.

                                 MIA
                        So no one can confirm your 
                        whereabouts during the president’s 
                        phone call?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I see where you’re going with 
                        this... The Russians have been the 
                        aggressors all night... The dots 
                        are connecting themselves.

           Holland takes a step into the room.
                                 HOLLAND
                        There’s another way to solve this. 
                        If the president was on the phone 
                        with the Kremlin, they might have 
                        heard what happened! White House 
                        communications probably recorded 
                        the-the-the entire call. 

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I can tell you what happened: the 
                        president hung up halfway through 
                        the call. It was very rude.

                                 MIA
                        How do you know that?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I receive a text from the Kremlin 
                        after I blew out the candle on my 
                        cake. Suffice it to say, I did not 
                        get my birthday wish.

           Ambassador Kamenev turns to the vice president.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        You want to know why the Russian 
                        Federation Army advanced on Syria? 
                        It was because your president hung 
                        up in the middle of a call about a 
                        peace agreement. We are not the 
                        aggressors. You are.

           Vice President Steele frowns in square-jawed silence.

                                 MIA
                        Mr. Ambassador, what time did the 
                        president hang up on the Kremlin?

           Ambassador Kamenev checks the texts on his phone.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        First, they tried to call him back. 
                        He does not pick up. By the time 
                        Moscow texts me, it is 10:43pm.

                                 MIA
                        So let’s say the president hung up 
                        on Moscow two minutes earlier. We 
                        now know the president was alive 
                        until at least 10:41pm. I heard the 
                        first lady screaming and entered 
                        the Oval Office about 10:45pm.

           THE JAZZ MUSIC INTENSIFIES...
                                 MIA
                        We are almost there. We have the 
                        killer encircled. I believe it is 
                        now time we recreated the Oval 
                        Office. Tommy?

           Tommy strides into the room and helps Mia swivel the table 
           sideways to form the Resolute Desk. Mia moves the two flags 
           from the corner: the American flag the Presidential Seal. She 
           maneuvers them behind the president’s desk.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, you get to be president.

           Tommy sits behind the desk. Mia moves a telephone to his 
           left. She shuts off the fireplace laptop and music. The room 
           stands in stark silence.

                                 MIA
                        Mr. Vice President, any visual 
                        details I’m missing?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Well, the president keeps framed 
                        photos on the credenza behind the 
                        desk. There’s a chair on either 
                        side. Chests of drawers to the left 
                        and right.

           Mia maneuvers a few chairs around accordingly.

                                 MIA
                        Anything else?

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        On the right chest, there’s the 
                        Frederic Remington bust of the 
                        bucking bronco.

                                 MIA
                        Very good. Let us begin with you, 
                        Mr. Ambassador. You are in the Oval 
                        Office. When did you begin shouting 
                        at the president?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Excuse me?

                                 MIA
                        Both the speaker and the first lady 
                        heard a man’s voice shouting. At 
                        this point in our timeline, only 
                        you or Adara could have been in the 
                        Oval Office.

                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                        And Adara, I don’t have to point 
                        out, does not have a man’s voice.

           The ambassador takes a step backward.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I wanted a military de-escalation. 
                        I wanted the president to back 
                        down! My own president would be too 
                        proud to blink first. It would 
                        never happen. In Russia we say, a 
                        lobster would sooner whistle on top 
                        of a mountain.

           The ambassador makes eye contact with each listener in the 
           room, earnestly making his case...

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I thought perhaps President Wood 
                        could see beyond his self-interest. 
                        I believed I had convinced him. All 
                        the way up until he hung up on the 
                        Kremlin.

                                 MIA
                        How did you leave the Oval Office?

           Note: as before, the briefing room seamlessly transitions 
           into the Oval Office and back as needed.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I needed a moment to calm down. I 
                        went to the bathroom.

           He heads for the study door. Speaker Brookes blocks his 
           exit...

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You couldn’t have gone this way. I 
                        was in the hallway speaking with 
                        the first lady – you would have had 
                        to squeeze right past us.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                             (flustered)
                        Yes, that is quite true. I guess I 
                        must have gone out to the corridor.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        That’s another pump-fake. You said 
                        you went to the bathroom, not the 
                        hallway.

           The ambassador is increasingly flustered.
                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I, I haven’t slept in quite a 
                        while. I think I found a bathroom 
                        out in the corridor. Yes, that is 
                        what happened.

           The ambassador stands in the middle of the briefing room, 
           everyone staring at him.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        My jet lag, you understand...

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        No one saw you enter the bathroom. 
                        And no one saw you leave.

           Nancy Garcia steps into the room, her expression somber.

                                 MIA
                        Nancy, do you have a fingerprint 
                        match for the knife?

                                 NANCY GARCIA
                        I do. Should I tell you outside?

                                 MIA
                        No. Go ahead, Nancy.

           Nancy takes a deep breath.

                                 NANCY GARCIA
                        It’s Ambassador Kamenev. His 
                        fingerprints are all over the 
                        knife.

           Ambassador Kamenev looks as if he might faint.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        This is impossible. This can’t be 
                        happening. I am an emissary of the 
                        Russian government.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        You killed my husband?

                                 MIA
                        I would read you your rights, 
                        ambassador. But in this situation, 
                        the assassination of a president, 
                        I’m not sure you have any.

           AGENT STONE PULLS THE AMBASSADOR’S ARMS BEHIND HIS BACK AND 
           LOCKS HIS WRISTS IN PLASTIC FLEX CUFFS.
                                 MIA
                        Put him in the break room for 
                        questioning.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I am entitled to a lawyer, a court, 
                        a trial!

           Mia’s face is grim.

                                 MIA
                        Ambassador, if your actions result 
                        in a war, the American people will 
                        see you hang.

                                  Chapter Six: The Cellist

           INT. HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS

           The diners follow Mia into the hallway, gossiping excitedly.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I was right all along.

                                 ADARA
                        So what do we do now? Do we all 
                        just go ’ome?

           Mia taps a finger against her chin, thinking.

                                 MIA
                        Not yet. There’s something that 
                        doesn’t make any sense to me... I 
                        need to talk to the ambassador in 
                        private.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        I’ll be in the briefing room.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I’ll be in the War Room.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I’ll be in the bathroom.

           Goldie, the server, appears in the hallway carrying a silver 
           tray.
                                 GOLDIE
                        I brought donuts and orange juice. 
                        Is this a good time?

           The diners descend on the donuts like a pride of lions.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

           Mia enters, wiping powdered sugar from her chin. Agent Stone 
           stands guard over the ambassador who sits meekly, his wrists 
           bound behind his back, staring glumly at the chessboard.

                                 THE AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I am a nationally ranked chess 
                        player. My ELO rating is 2,200. You 
                        really think I just stabbed the 
                        President of the United States with 
                        my bare hands and didn’t wipe off 
                        the fingerprints?

                                 MIA
                        If you’re a strong chess player, 
                        then you must have a visual memory. 
                        But you couldn’t remember how you 
                        entered the Oval Office, how you 
                        left the Oval Office, or which 
                        bathroom you used.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I have been awake for 36-hours 
                        straight. I can’t even remember 
                        what continent I’m on!

           The ambassador stands.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Can you please unlock my handcuffs 
                        so I can smoke a cigarette?

                                 MIA
                        What were you yelling at the 
                        president about?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I was not yelling!

                                 MIA
                        Like you’re not yelling right now?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        It was the treaty! I passionately 
                        believe in it. It was important he 
                        do the right thing!
           The ambassador struggles to control himself.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I can prove it was not me!

                                 MIA
                        How?

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        The Israeli spy saw me leave the 
                        Oval Office. She went in right 
                        after me, no? If the president was 
                        dead, why didn’t she notice when 
                         she was making out with him?

                                 MIA
                        You could have gone back in after 
                        she left. You have no alibi for the 
                        moment of the murder. We 
                        established that no one saw you 
                        enter or leave the bathroom.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        No! We established that after the 
                        Israeli return to the dining room, 
                        everyone sing happy birthday for 
                        me. How could they sing happy 
                        birthday for me if I was killing 
                        President Wood? Did I possibly have 
                        enough time?

           Mia thinks about that.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        And what about drugging him? When 
                        did I have time for that?

           Mia nods slowly.

                                 MIA
                        I’ve been wondering the same thing. 
                        If Adara’s your alibi, I need to 
                        talk to her. 

           Mia turns to leave.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Watch out for the bishop.

                                 MIA
                        Pardon?

           Ambassador Kamenev is staring at the chessboard.
                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        It is going to strike your queen.

           INT. HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER

           Mia hustles down the hallway. Agent Stone locks the 
           ambassador into the break room and follows. Mia sweeps into--

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She scans the room.

                                 MIA
                        Where is Adara Lehava?

           The first lady sits with her bare feet on a chair, her shawl 
           covering her eyes, trying to sleep.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Why? You need a quickie?

           Speaker Brookes, in her reading glasses, looks up from the 
           Washington Post.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Adara went to the bathroom.

                                 MIA
                        How long ago?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                             (shrugging)
                        Ten minutes?

           Mia’s face fills with foreboding...

           INT. HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS

           MIA SPEED-WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, BREAKING INTO A JOG. She 
           passes Holland coming the other way.

                                 MIA
                        Have you seen Adara?

                                 HOLLAND
                        I thought she was in the briefing 
                        room?

           Mia ducks her head into the War Room – generals everywhere - 
           no sign of Adara.

                                 HOLLAND
                        What’s the matter?
           Mia reaches the one working bathroom. SHE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR 
           AND PUSHES HER WAY INSIDE--

           INT. BATHROOM – CONTINUOUS

           ADARA LEHAVA’S BODY LIES SPRAWLED ON THE TILED FLOOR, ARMS 
           AND LEGS AKIMBO.

                                 MIA
                        Oh god, no...

           MIA DROPS TO HER KNEES. SHE HOVERS OVER ADARA’S FACE, 
           LISTENING FOR BREATH. NOTHING.

           SHE PRESSES TWO FINGERS TO ADARA’S NECK, FEELING FOR A PULSE. 
           NOTHING.

           Holland peers in behind her, his face aghast.

           AGENT STONE FINALLY CATCHES UP, BURSTING INTO THE RESTROOM.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        What is it?

                                 MIA
                             (grim)
                        Ambassador Kamenev’s just lost his 
                        alibi.

           Mia pulls open each of Adara’s white, vacant eyes. They stare 
           upward into oblivion.

           VICE PRESIDENT STEELE SHOVES HIS WAY INTO THE BATHROOM. A few 
           men in uniform crowd behind him.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        God almighty.

                                 MIA
                             (to Agent Stone)
                        Get them out of here. Set guards on 
                        the door. Tell everyone we’re down 
                        to zero bathrooms. And call Dr. 
                        Silver down here stat.

           Agent Stone attempts to usher everyone out. THE VICE 
           PRESIDENT RESISTS.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        How could this happen? In the most 
                        secure bunker in the world! And 
                        with your security everywhere? This 
                        is a disgrace, Agent Pine. 
                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE (CONT'D)
                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE (CONT'D)
                        I want you off this job! I want you 
                        terminated!

           Red arteries bulging in the vice president’s neck, his glass 
           eye slightly askew.

                                 MIA
                        Well, you can terminate me later 
                        because no one’s leaving here 
                        tonight. We need a fresh round of 
                        forensics and fresh ideas.

           She looks down at Adara’s body.

                                 MIA
                        On the bright side, we may have one 
                        less suspect.

           AGENT STONE MANAGES TO MANEUVER THE VICE PRESIDENT OUT OF THE 
           BATHROOM AND LOCK THE DOOR.

           Mia studies Adara’s face. Working quickly, she feels along 
           the neck – no bruising. She opens the mouth and sniffs for 
           poison. She opens the eyes to check coloration below the 
           eyelids. She peers closely...

           She stands up and scans the crime scene. Looking for any 
           sign, any clue...

           Mia opens one of the stalls and finds Ambassador Kamenev’s 
           coffee-stained jacket drying on a coat peg. She searches the 
           pockets and finds them empty. She frowns...

                                 AGENT STONE
                        What were you hoping to find there?

                                 MIA
                        The missing napkin. It’s beginning 
                        to trouble me.

           Agent Stone looks at her, perplexed. Mia puts her hands on 
           her cheeks and shakes her head.

                                 MIA
                        Another one dead on my watch. My 
                        reputation... My track record...

           THERE’S A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

           Agent Stone unlocks it and carefully cracks it open.

           DR. CLAY SILVER edges inside. He wears a lab coat and blue 
           plastic gloves, his Einstein hair tamed under a blue hairnet.
                                 MIA
                        Clay, thank the gods.

                                 DR. SILVER
                        Hi Mia. Fun night at the office?

           He looks down at the body.

                                 DR. SILVER
                        Jesus, is that Adara Lehava? My 
                        husband and I saw her perform at 
                        the Kennedy Center two nights ago.

           Dr. Silver sets down a large carry case of medical equipment 
           and drops down to one knee to examine Adara.

                                 DR. SILVER
                        Two bodies in one night. I ought to 
                        open a permanent practice here.

                                 MIA
                        How long to fingerprint everything? 
                        Fresh tox screen? Maybe a quick 
                        guess at cause of death? And when 
                        do I get a report on the president?

                                 DR. SILVER
                        It all takes time, Mia. I shouldn’t 
                        give you information piecemeal – 
                        things fall through the cracks. You 
                        lose the bigger picture.

                                 MIA
                        Work with me here — what’s your 
                        first blush reaction? Did she die 
                        from asphyxiation? Did she die of 
                        embarrassment? Did she die 
                        laughing? Give me a hint! 

                                 DR. SILVER
                        I’m already fast-tracking a 
                        presidential autopsy for you and 
                        that’s not the sort of thing you 
                        want to do a rush-job on! My 
                        professional reputation is at 
                        stake. Doctors for decades are 
                        going to second-guess my every move 
                        tonight. I have to do things 
                        perfectly.

                                 MIA
                        Clay, you’re my friend. You know 
                        who’s not my friend? Time. 
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                        Do you know what’s happening in the 
                        War Room? War. We’re going to war 
                        over this.

           Dr. Silver nods and crouches low over Adara.

                                 DR. SILVER
                        What’s all this defensive bruising 
                        on the wrist? And the stab mark 
                        near the right eye?

                                 MIA
                        The first lady. You can ignore 
                        that.

           Dr. Silver gives her a bewildered look.

                                 MIA
                        Catfight.

                                 DR. SILVER
                        Wow.

           Dr. Silver takes off his glasses.

                                 DR. SILVER
                        Soon as the crime scene 
                        photographer clears me to move the 
                        body, I’ll run a hemoglobin test 
                        for asphyxiation. Then there’s 
                        cyanotic tissue and a few other 
                        snazzy tricks.

                                 MIA
                        Thanks, Clay.

           She turns to leave.

                                 DR. SILVER
                        Oh – and Metro PD is already 
                        working on a tox report for the 
                        president. So far, he’s totally 
                        clean.

                                 MIA
                        That’s impossible. I mean, the way 
                        he was stabbed-

                                 DR. SILVER
                        No Rohypnol, no sedatives, no 
                        paralytic agents.

                                 MIA
                        What about alcohol?
                                 DR. SILVER
                        .04 – one drink. Hey, we’ll keep 
                        looking – some of the tox tests 
                        take weeks. And the head and neck 
                        bruising is interesting.

                                 MIA
                        Is it?

                                 DR. SILVER
                        Sure. But make no mistake: the 
                        cause of death was the knife.

           The CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER and SEVERAL TECHNICIANS begin 
           lugging equipment into the bathroom.

           Mia looks stunned.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mia shakes her head. Defeated.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        You okay?

                                 MIA
                        Why would the president just sit 
                        there, let himself get stabbed, and 
                        then bleed to death?

           Mia raises her hands and collapses them at her side.

                                 MIA
                        I’ve been wrong about everything. 
                        I’ve bungled this whole 
                        investigation.

           Agent Stone searches for something to say.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Do I let Ambassador Kamenev out of 
                        the break room?

           Mia pouches her lips. Then exhales and nods.

                                 MIA
                        He can’t get far.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Is he innocent?
                                 MIA
                        Well, if he killed the president, 
                        and he didn’t kill the Israeli, 
                        then we have two killers. So yeah, 
                        I certainly hope he’s innocent.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        But you don’t know.

           Mia shakes her head.

                                 MIA
                        When I questioned him, he was 
                        handcuffed, jet-lagged, accused of 
                        assassination, and he still had the 
                        wherewithal to make a complex chess 
                        calculation. Would a man like that 
                        stab the president and leave his 
                        fingerprints on the knife?

           Mia shakes her head again in frustration. She paces down the 
           hallway. Agent Stone follows.

                                 MIA
                        The ambassador said something to 
                        the vice president earlier... 
                        Something that seemed important. 
                        But I can’t quite put it 
                        together...

           Mia studies the crime scene photos on her phone: the 
           president’s ghastly face, the mottled bruising, the Remington 
           statue and the Churchill bust...

           She puts her back against the wall, overcome by fatigue. 

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Take a break. Everyone’s in the War 
                        Room waiting for the battle. 
                        They’re not going anywhere tonight.

           Mia nods. She hears the SOUND OF MUFFLED CRYING...

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

           Mia finds the first lady seated in a corner, rocking back and 
           forth, sobbing. She’s clutching something in her fist.

           Mia sits and puts an arm around her, shushing her. She gently 
           opens the first lady’s hand, revealing two purple pills.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        I just discovered them in my 
                        pocket. 
                                 FIRST LADY WOOD (CONT'D)
                                 FIRST LADY WOOD (CONT'D)
                        I never got to give them to him. 
                        What do I do with them now? Do I 
                        just throw them away? It seems 
                        wrong somehow.

           Mia holds the first lady’s hand.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        When Hank drove up to Westchester 
                        to ask permission to marry me, my 
                        father took him to the golf club. 
                        He might as well have taken him to 
                        planet Mars. Hank duffed his way to 
                        a 150 by about the third hole. My 
                        father said they’d have to re-sod 
                        the course.

           She smiles at the memory.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Then my father sat there in the 
                        clubhouse watching Hank eat his 
                        entire side salad with a tiny 
                        little lobster fork.
                             (shaking her head)
                        If my parents knew how far he’d 
                        come...

           The first lady blinks away tears.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        The White House... I’m going to 
                        have to move out of here. Next 
                        week? The week after? Then what? 
                        What do I do the rest of my life?

           Mia just holds her.

           Adara’s black body bag, strapped to a gurney, is trundled 
           down the hallway. Mia closes her eyes.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                           Chapter Seven: The Secret Service Agent

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

           MIA SNAPS AWAKE. She checks the time on her phone. 4:30am.
           Her blazer is draped over her for a blanket. She sits up in 
           her office chair. Agent Stone offers her a cup of coffee.

                                 MIA
                        I don’t really drink coffee, but...

           She blows on the steam and takes a cautious sip.

                                 MIA
                        Wow. That is good.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        C’mon. It’s time. Our troops are in 
                        position. We’re ready to attack.

           INT. WAR ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

           Mia buttons her blazer and steps into the bustling War Room, 
           packed with military officers.

           Ambassador Kamenev sits in a corner looking miserable in his 
           wet suit jacket. She nods to him and he nods back.

           Speaker Brookes stands in the center of the room locked in 
           tense debate with the vice president.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Only congress has the power to 
                        declare war.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        The executive branch can utilize 
                        the military in moments of a 
                         national security crisis.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        How is this a national security 
                        crisis? Syria’s 10,000 miles away!

           Vice President Steele turns to the Brigadier General.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Tell the general on the ground to 
                        open fire.

           The Brigadier General hesitates.

                                 BRIGADIER GENERAL
                        Sir... Are you officially the 
                        Commander in Chief? Do we have 
                        chain of command?

           Vice President Steele paces the room, running a hand through 
           his buzz cut. Holland speaks up.
                                 HOLLAND
                        Sir, I’m not sure of the 
                        legalities. But it will be better 
                        optics if the American people know 
                        you were sworn in. It will help 
                        close the loop on any Monday 
                        morning quarterbacking.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        When is the chief justice getting 
                        here? Has anyone even tried getting 
                        her out of bed?

                                 HOLLAND
                        She’s not picking up. I’m sending a 
                        secret service car to her house. I 
                        told them to knock until the door 
                        falls down.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Tell them to fucking hurry.

           Mia can’t sit still any longer. She signals Holland with a 
           nod of her head. He catches their private signal and follows 
           her out of the room.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

           Mia shifts her coffee into her other hand so she can lock the 
           door behind them.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Now you want to make out?

                                 MIA
                        What? No. I’m drinking coffee.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Wow, things are serious.

                                 MIA
                        Yeah, they’re serious!

           Holland tries to embrace her and she pushes him away.

                                 MIA
                        We figured out where everyone was 
                        when the president was murdered. 
                        And you know the one thing not on 
                        that chart? Me. It doesn’t say 
                        where I was.

           Holland sets his hands on his hips and looks at the floor.
                                 HOLLAND
                        Mia, don’t.

                                 MIA
                        I should have been there for the 
                        president. Maybe I could have 
                        protected him. Instead I was in 
                        your office. Making out with you.

           Holland shakes his head.

                                 MIA
                        So, yeah. You want to know why I 
                        don’t want to kiss you? That’s why.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Well, at least we’ve solved one 
                        mystery tonight.

                                 MIA
                        My career’s over. I’m going to be a 
                        night-shift security guard at an 
                        Applebee’s in Delafield, Wisconsin. 
                        Also the world’s going to war and 
                        it’s probably my fault because I 
                        can’t solve this case.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Wow. Some people beat themselves 
                        up. You kick the shit out of 
                        yourself.

                                 MIA
                        People are dead, Holland!

           Mia paces in a tight circle.

                                 MIA
                        Your office is right next to the 
                        vice president’s. Are you sure he 
                        went there after dinner? Did you 
                        see him coming or going?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Yes, absolutely. I saw him walk by 
                        and I heard him on the phone. He 
                        was there the whole time, Mia.

           Mia lets out her ponytail. She shakes her head.
                                 MIA
                        Something doesn’t fit, Watson. 
                        Something I looked at, but didn’t 
                        see. It’s like a name that’s on the 
                        tip of my tongue...

           She paces, wringing her hands.

                                 MIA
                        When the Secret Service clears a 
                        street for the president, we’re 
                        always looking for a blind spot. A 
                        rooftop with a line of sight, a 
                        sewer grate we didn’t weld shut. 
                        But how do you find a blind spot? 
                        How do you see what you can’t see?
                             (then)
                        I need the chessboard.

           She sits down at their game where they left it on the table.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Now?

                                 MIA
                        Help me, Holland!

                                 HOLLAND
                        I can’t, the vice president needs 
                        me in the War Room. I’m trying to 
                        wrangle the chief justice.

                                 MIA
                        What, do you work for him now?

                                 HOLLAND
                        As a matter of fact, I do.

                                 MIA
                        Jesus, how long was I asleep? What 
                        about the VP’s chief of staff?

                                 HOLLAND
                        She’ll be fired in the morning. Jim 
                        needs someone with more experience 
                        in the big show.

                                 MIA
                        He’s Jim, now?

           Mia plays a rook.
                                 HOLLAND
                        Look, you said yourself - the 
                        Russian’s alibi is dead. It’s just 
                        his word against everyone else. 
                        He’s guilty – it’s Occam’s Razor. 
                        You want to know about blind spots? 
                        You don’t want the ambassador to be 
                        guilty because it’ll mean war!

                                 MIA
                        And you want war?

                                 HOLLAND
                        I never liked the peace accord. I 
                        always thought it was a mistake!

           Holland fidgets with his glasses. Polishing, fogging them 
           with his breath, and repolishing them.

                                 HOLLAND
                        I don’t know why you’re even still 
                        holding us. I haven’t been able to 
                        check my cell in hours. Doreen 
                        probably waited up for me. I’ll 
                        probably have eighty-five texts 
                        from her.

           Holland moves his knight, then spots his blunder.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Shit.

           MIA FEELS THE WALLS CLOSING IN ON HER... HER BREATHING 
           BECOMES LABORED...

                                 MIA
                        Why would Doreen be waiting up for 
                        you? You said she took the kids to 
                        her parents’ place in Virginia...

           Mia’s Appalachian accent begins to shine through. She rises 
           shakily to her feet.

                                 MIA
                        You lying bastard. You never 
                        separated. You’re just stringing me 
                        along.

           Holland stands up.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Separated? Divorced? How is that 
                        going to look for my career? 
                                 HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                                 HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        Why can’t you see it from my 
                        perspective? The vice president is 
                        a marine. Semper Fidelis! He values 
                        unquestioning loyalty. Breaking up 
                        a marriage? Running off with a 
                        coworker? A-a-a coworker who 
                        threatened to arrest him? That’s 
                        not how Washington works. These 
                        aren’t sound chess moves, Mia! You 
                        of all people should appreciate 
                        that!

                                 MIA
                             (still reeling)
                        You promised me we were moving in 
                        together. I gave notice on my 
                        apartment. This whole time... you 
                        were never going to leave her!

           HOLLAND SMASHES HIS FIST ON THE TABLE. Chess pieces topple 
           and roll.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Don’t make me feel guilty! It’s not 
                        my fault if you want to devote your 
                        life to chasing unavailable men. 
                        Men who will never live up to your 
                        image of your perfect father.

                                 MIA
                        What does my father have to do with-

                                 HOLLAND
                        Everything! It’s all about him! I 
                        could never be good enough. You 
                        know what, Mia? You can solve all 
                        the murders in the world, and it 
                        won’t bring him back. So move on!

           Mia is shattered. Her eyes wide to the point of hysteria.

                                 HOLLAND
                        You’re going to be fired in the 
                        morning. And I want to be clear: it 
                        won’t be because of your friction 
                        with Jim. It’ll be because you were 
                        the head Secret Service agent in 
                        the White House when the president 
                        was assassinated under your nose.

           Mia’s mouth hangs open.
                                 HOLLAND
                        I can’t be associated with that. 
                        That’s a stink that will never come 
                        off. I hope you can understand my 
                        position.

           Holland heads for the door.

                                 MIA
                        Thank you, Holland. You’ve just 
                        shown me my blind spot. I see the 
                        bishop now. 

           He leaves, slamming the door.

           INT. HALLWAY – NIGHT

           Mia trudges to a plastic chair in the hallway and sits down.

           Speaker Brookes, looking equally shell-shocked, drags herself 
           from the War Room and slumps down next to her.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Well, we tried.

           Mia slowly nods her head.

                                 MIA
                        Another war.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        You liked him, didn’t you?

           Mia looks up, surprised.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        The president. You were fond of 
                        him.

                                 MIA
                             (nodding)
                        He was always good to me.

           Speaker Brookes pries off her shoes. Rubs her tired feet.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        I didn’t often agree with Hank. But 
                        he was principled, he tried to do 
                        the right thing. Someone once told 
                        him that Reagan never took his 
                        jacket off in the Oval Office. 
                        Which isn’t true, by the way. 
                                 SPEAKER BROOKES (CONT'D)
                                 SPEAKER BROOKES (CONT'D)
                        But after that, Hank never took his 
                        jacket off in there, even in the 
                        furnace of August. You have to 
                        admire that.

                                 MIA
                        My father was the same way. Wore 
                        his sheriff uniform even on his 
                        days off. Even when it made him a 
                        target.

           Speaker Brookes studies Mia’s face.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Something happened to him?

                                 MIA
                        He was murdered walking out a diner 
                        on King Street. Middle of a Sunday.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        My god, Mia. I’m so sorry. Did they 
                        catch who did it?

           Mia shakes her head.

                                 MIA
                        I spent years wondering how I 
                        could’ve seen it coming. Holland 
                        thinks I’m obsessed, that I need to 
                        get over it. But I don’t know. I 
                        think it fires me.

           Speaker Brookes clasps Mia’s hand.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Mia, losing your father didn’t make 
                        you weak. It made you strong.

           She gives Mia’s hand a squeeze.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        He’d be proud of who you are. You 
                        should be, too.

           Mia nods. Speaker Brookes grimaces as she tucks on her shoes.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Your dogs aren’t barking?

           Mia looks down at her JC Penney loafers. Sensible, if 
           proletarian. She smiles.
                                 MIA
                        Not even a little bit.

           Speaker Brookes grins, takes a breath, and rises to her feet.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Well, Churchill said, when you’re 
                        going through hell, keep going.

           Mia nods again. Her brow gradually furrows.

                                 MIA
                        Churchill...

           She pulls up her photos of the dead president on her phone. 
           She flips through them, and sees a new detail...

           Behind the president sits the famous bust of Churchill. 
           Bronze, 12 inches high, hundreds of thousands of dollars.

           In one photo, Churchill’s facing left. In the next photo, 
           taken seconds later, Churchill’s facing to the right.

           MIA’S FACE CLEARS...

                                 MIA
                        Thank you, Terra. You may have just 
                        stopped the war.

           Speaker Brookes looks at her, bewildered.

           MIA IS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND RUSHING FOR--

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM – CONTINUOUS

           Mia bursts in.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, I need an outside line!

           Agent Stone passes a phone across the table to her.

           Mia frantically dials the landline.

                                 MIA
                        Clay, it’s Mia. What bruises did 
                        the president have?

                                 DR. SILVER (FILTERED)
                        What are you looking for?

                                 MIA
                        Was he hit on his head from behind?
                                 DR. SILVER (FILTERED)
                        Yes. Big bloody bruise. I told you 
                        it was interesting.

                                 MIA
                        Was it enough to knock him 
                        unconscious?

                                 DR. SILVER (FILTERED)
                        It was enough to hobble an 
                        elephant. It’ll be in my medical 
                        report if you would wait for it.

                                 MIA
                        Clay, whatever they pay you, they 
                        should double it.

                                 DR. SILVER (FILTERED)
                        Great. Because I became a medical 
                        examiner for the money.
                             (then)
                        I’ve got more for you. Adara 
                        Lehava: hypoxia.

                                 MIA
                        Beautiful! I mean, not beautiful, 
                        but - you understand.

           Mia regroups.

                                 MIA
                        Clay, do you have a list of the 
                        signs of asphyxiation – you know, 
                        like for first responders to detect 
                        spousal abuse? I saw one when I was 
                        an EMT volunteer in high school, 
                        but I need to double-check my 
                        memory.

                                 DR. SILVER (FILTERED)
                        Sure, I’ll email you.

                                 MIA
                        Top priority. You’re the best.

           MIA HANGS UP THE PHONE AND BARRELS FOR THE DOOR.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, where’s the VP?

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Heading to the Oval Office for 
                        swearing in.
                                 MIA
                        We let him off the floor?

                                 AGENT STONE
                        He’s surrounded by generals. 
                        Besides... he’s going to become the 
                        president.

           INT. HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS

           MIA SPRINTS FOR THE ELEVATOR. TOMMY JOGS AFTER HER.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, we’re going to need everyone 
                        up there. The speaker, the 
                        ambassador, Holland – everyone.

           INT. WEST WING – MOMENTS LATER

           MIA AND AGENT STONE BURST FROM THE EAST WING ELEVATOR AND 
           RACE UP THE MAIN CORRIDOR.

           The vice president is heading for the Oval Office, surrounded 
           by Holland and a coterie of generals.

           MIA SHOUTS DOWN THE HALLWAY.

                                 MIA
                        Mr. Vice President. I am ordering 
                        you to stop!

           Vice President Steele turns and stares. The generals look at 
           her in shock.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You order me?

           Mia catches up to the vice president.

                                 MIA
                        Search him.

           Agent Stone looks at her in amazement.

                                 MIA
                        You don’t have to strip him. It’s 
                        his pockets I want.

           Agent Stone still hesitates.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Young man, you lay one hand on me 
                        and you can pack your bags back to 
                        Peoria.
           Impatiently, Mia steps up to the vice president and FRISKS 
           HIM. She searches all of his pockets.

           Vice President Steele lifts his hands in the air and looks 
           down on Mia with a pitying smile.

           She steps away, mystified.

                                 MIA
                        You’re clean...

           The secretary of defense turns to the vice president.

                                 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                        Who is this maniac? Do we fire her 
                        or arrest her?

           Mia’s face flushes. She’s on the brink of tears.

                                 MIA
                        I guess fire me. That would be 
                        preferable.

           Holland speaks up.

                                 HOLLAND
                        No need to make a scene. We play 
                        politics and do this discretely. 
                        I’ll accept your written 
                        resignation in one hour, once the 
                        new president is sworn in.

           Once again, MIA FEELS THE WALLS OF THE NARROW CORRIDOR 
           CLOSING IN. THE BEGINNINGS OF A PANIC ATTACK.

                                 MIA
                        ...Play politics...

           THE WORLD SWIMS BEFORE HER VISION, HER BALANCE UNMOORING. And 
           then... Speaker Brookes’ words bubble to the surface of her 
           mind...

                                 MIA
                             (quietly)
                        “We can choose to play politics or 
                        we can choose what’s right.”

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Excuse me?

           MIA’S WORLD SNAPS INTO FOCUS.

           The walls no longer push in. Mia’s posture straightens and 
           she turns to Agent Stone.
                                 MIA
                        I need all suspects in the Oval 
                        Office.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I am relieving you of this 
                        investigation.

                                 MIA
                        No, sir. I have until you are sworn 
                        in and that should be all the time 
                        I need. You will report to the Oval 
                        Office immediately or I will arrest 
                        you for refusing to cooperate with 
                        a Secret Service investigation into 
                        the assassination of a US 
                        president. I will shout it from the 
                        rooftops. I will make sure every 
                        journalist in the country is here 
                        to watch me lead you down 
                        Pennsylvania Avenue in handcuffs.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You would do that?

                                 MIA
                        “If I cannot move heaven, then I 
                        will raise hell.”

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Is that another goddamn Greek?

                                 MIA
                             (shaking her head)
                        Roman.

           The vice president turns to Holland.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I’ve got two combat battalions 
                        waiting on my command to pull the 
                        trigger. How long until the chief 
                        justice suffers herself to be here 
                        so I can be sworn in and fire this 
                        lunatic?

                                 HOLLAND
                        Ten minutes tops, sir.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Agent Pine, I cannot stand to be 
                        leveraged. As it happens, I am 
                        heading to the Oval Office anyway.
           The first lady, Speaker Brookes, and Ambassador Kamenev 
           arrive from the East Wing elevator.

                                 MIA
                        Let us return to the beginning. The 
                        Oval Office.

           Mia ushers them forward, pausing to read an incoming email...

           INT. OVAL OFFICE – NIGHT

           As in the beginning, the dinner guests surround the 
           president’s desk.

                                 MIA
                        Tommy, would you do the honors?

           Agent Stone approaches the president’s chair. He hesitates.

                                 MIA
                        Go ahead, Tommy. It’s necessary.

           Tommy gingerly sits in the president’s chair.

                                 MIA
                        When Adara left the Oval Office, 
                        the White House was connecting the 
                        president’s call to the Kremlin. 
                        Our killer entered the room and 
                        listened to the call. They realized 
                        the president was going to offer 
                        peace and back out of Syria with 
                        his tail between his legs. Our 
                        killer needed to put a stop to 
                        this, but had no options.

           Agent Stone picks up the phone and mimes a phone call.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE // FLASHBACK

           The president is on the phone...

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        In a fit of temper, our killer 
                        grabs the Churchill bust, crosses 
                        behind the president, and smashes 
                        him over the head.

           THE UNSEEN KILLER ATTACKS THE PRESIDENT.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE // PRESENT

           Mia uses her sleeve to avoid touching the bust. She hoists it 
           high and mimes bashing Agent Stone on the crown of his head.
                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        It was a crime of passion!

                                 MIA
                        The president didn’t rudely hang up 
                        on the Kremlin. We know the 
                        president’s Connecticut etiquette. 
                        He would sooner have streaked 
                        Pennsylvania Avenue as hang up on a 
                        world leader.

           The group listens. INTERCUT FLASHBACKS AS NEEDED...

                                 MIA
                        Now, it’s 10:41pm. The president is 
                        unconscious but still alive. It was 
                        the killer who hangs up the phone.

           Mia hangs up the phone...

                                 MIA
                        The killer places the Churchill 
                        bust back on the chest of drawers.

           Mia returns the bust to its place, but at an odd angle.

                                 MIA
                        The killer sits the president up in 
                        his chair, perhaps to hide the ugly 
                        bruise. The killer needs to pin 
                        this on someone else. But who?

           Speaker Brookes lights up.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Ambassador Kamenev.

                                 MIA
                        Yes. Frame the Russian Ambassador. 
                        This will torpedo the treaty and 
                        solve every problem. The killer 
                        returns to the dining room and 
                        takes the ambassador’s steak knife, 
                        careful to wrap it in a napkin to 
                        preserve the fingerprints. Then, 
                        the killer returns to the Oval 
                        Office and stabs the president.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE // FLASHBACK

           THE KILLER STABS THREE TIMES. The unconscious president does 
           not resist. BLOOD GUSHES FROM THE PRESIDENT’S NECK.
           INT. OVAL OFFICE - PRESENT

           The group listens, enrapt.

                                 MIA
                        The killer leaves the knife and 
                        returns to the dinner party. Later, 
                        when we all rushed into the Oval 
                        Office, the killer noticed the 
                        Churchill bust. Was Churchill 
                        facing to the left or to the right? 
                        The killer is a person with an eye 
                        for visual details. As I was 
                        snapping photos of the crime scene, 
                        the killer moved the bust, just so.

           Mia moves the bust to its proper direction.

                                 MIA
                        This was the detail I spent the 
                        whole night trying to see.

                                 HOLLAND
                        That’s a pretty wild theory.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        It’s horseshit. It’s a fourth 
                        quarter Hail Mary!

           Mia paces the room.

                                 MIA
                        Ambassador Kamenev is a chess 
                        grandmaster. That requires an 
                        excellent visual memory. Holland, 
                        too, has his moments. And Mr. Vice 
                        President, earlier tonight you 
                        astonished us with your memory. You 
                        were able to recall every visual 
                        detail of the president’s desk – 
                        even the Remington statue – but you 
                        failed to mention the Churchill 
                        bust. This from a man who greatly 
                        admires Churchill.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        This is a lot of supposition 
                        peppered with speculation.

                                 HOLLAND
                        And there’s a second mystery. Who 
                        killed Adara?

           Mia arrives at the center of the room.
                                 MIA
                        Ah. But the astute among you will 
                        remember we have a third mystery 
                        tonight: the mystery of the missing 
                        napkin. Our chief server Goldie was 
                        right to be distraught. The napkin 
                        is the key. It answers everything.

                                  Chapter Eight: The Napkin

           INT. OVAL OFFICE – NIGHT

           Mia gestures to Holland.

                                 MIA
                        The chief of staff wants to know 
                        who killed Adara and why. Adara was 
                        Ambassador Kamenev’s alibi, but 
                        could the killer have known that? 
                        For a while, this had me stumped. 
                        Until I remembered the napkin...

           Mia nods to Agent Stone, who goes back to playing dead.

                                 MIA
                        Let us return to the moment of the 
                        murder... The killer is careful to 
                        grip the knife in a napkin when 
                        they stab the president.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE // FLASHBACK

           The killer backs away from the dead president.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        The killer leaves the knife as 
                        evidence, stuffs the napkin into 
                        their pocket, and returns quickly 
                        to the dinner party... In the 
                        ensuing chaos, the killer has no 
                        chance to dispose of the napkin.

           INT. WAR ROOM // FLASHBACK

           Goldie speaks to Mia; diners listen in the background...
                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Later, when Goldie reported that 
                        one napkin was missing, our killer 
                        realized they must get rid of the 
                        evidence as soon as possible. It’s 
                        covered in the blood of a US 
                        president.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - PRESENT

           The first lady shakes her head at the image.

                                 MIA
                        Our killer is stuck in the bunker 
                        and needs to dispose of the napkin. 
                        But where to hide it?

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        The bathroom?

                                 MIA
                        Perhaps. It could be flushed down 
                        the toilet on the hope it doesn’t 
                        clog. But I think there’s a better 
                        place to plant it. Our killer... is 
                        a strategist.

           Mia turns to Ambassador Kamenev. The ambassador looks down at 
           his damp suit. His face lights up.

                                 THE AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        My jacket!

                                 MIA
                        Exactly.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Jim got upset and threw his coffee 
                        on the ambassador!

                                 MIA
                        Yes. This caused Ambassador Kamenev 
                        to remove his jacket. Now, in the 
                        middle of the night, the jacket is 
                        hanging unguarded in the bathroom 
                        stall. If the killer can secret the 
                        napkin into the jacket pocket, that 
                        completes the frame job.

           Mia crosses to Agent Stone and plucks the pocket square from 
           his suit. She carefully uses it to pick up the Churchill bust 
           and hand it to him.
                                 MIA
                        Guard this closely.

           Agent Stone nods.

                                 MIA
                        Now, I need you all to come to the 
                        dining room for the finale.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Oh, come on. This is ridiculous. 
                        You throw enough spaghetti against 
                        the wall and hope the wall falls 
                        down.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        No, I want to hear this.

           Mia leads the group out into the--

           INT. MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE WEST WING - CONTINUOUS

           Agent Stone, one finger to his earpiece, whispers to Mia.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        The Chief Justice is at front gate

                                 MIA
                        Tell our guys to stall her -- I’m 
                        going as fast as I can.

           Mia herds the group toward the private dining room.

                                 MIA
                        Adara knew the killer wasn’t 
                        Ambassador Kamenev. This is where 
                        she saw him leave the Oval Office 
                        on her way in. And when she left, 
                        she saw the next person to enter: 
                        the killer.

           INT. PRESIDENT’S PRIVATE DINING ROOM – CONTINUOUS

           The group steps into the ornate chamber. Mia sits in Adara’s 
           chair at the dining room table.

                                 MIA
                        Now, it’s 10:42pm. As we 
                        established earlier tonight, at 
                        this moment, Adara is alone in the 
                        dining room. This is very 
                        important.
           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM // FLASHBACK

           Adara sits alone at the table. She nods to an unseen figure.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Only Adara saw the killer enter the 
                        dining room. On the sly, the 
                        assassin slid Ambassador Kamenev’s 
                        knife from the table and left.

           A hand uses a napkin to palm the knife and tuck it into a 
           pocket...

           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM - PRESENT

                                 HOLLAND
                        But why didn’t Adara say anything 
                        during our reenactment?

                                 MIA
                        She did. The killer was in the 
                        doorway, watching her. Adara was 
                        literally biting her nails. Her 
                        exact words were:

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM // FLASHBACK

           Adara, clearly nervous, answers Mia’s questioning...

                                 ADARA
                        I did not see anything that seemed 
                        important at the time.

           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM - PRESENT

                                 MIA
                        What an odd thing to say.

           First Lady Wood puts a hand to her mouth.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        The killer must have threatened her 
                        at some point.

                                 MIA
                        All we know is this: Adara was 
                        there when the murderer grabbed the 
                        knife. She knew who stabbed the 
                        president.

                                 HOLLAND
                        But if that’s true, why didn’t she 
                        say anything?
                                 MIA
                        Leverage.

           INT. WAR ROOM // FLASHBACK

           Adara anxiously taps cello fingerings on her chair...

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Adara waited her chance to get the 
                        killer alone, chewing her nails 
                        down to the nubs. When I was 
                        interrogating Ambassador Kamenev in 
                        the break room, she saw the killer 
                        walk into the restroom alone and 
                        saw her opportunity...

           Adara follows a figure down the hallway... She takes a deep 
           breath, steeling her nerves.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        Tonight, this is a coed restroom – 
                        the woman’s room is out of order. 
                        So she walked right in to 
                        confront...

           Adara pushes open the door, revealing... VICE PRESIDENT 
           STEELE. HE IS REACHING INTO THE AMBASSADOR’S JACKET POCKET.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        ...the vice president. I believe 
                        she was just in time to see him 
                        attempt to plant the napkin. If she 
                        had any doubts about his guilt, she 
                        now knew for sure. Adara was a good 
                        intelligence operative. She made 
                        him an offer.

           Adara makes a pitch to the startled vice president...

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        She will keep his secret safe. Even 
                        help pin it on the Russian 
                        ambassador. But in exchange, she 
                        will leverage this information for 
                        her government. Our killer cannot 
                        stand to be leveraged. Our killer 
                        cannot have his secret out. And our 
                        killer is famous for his hair-
                        trigger temper. So...he killed her.

           THE VICE PRESIDENT TURNS RED. HIS EYES MENACING. HE BEARS 
           DOWN ON ADARA...
           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM // PRESENT

           Mia stares evenly at the vice president. His face flushes.

                                 MIA
                        If you had only kept your self-
                        control, you could have walked away 
                        today. But you told me yourself, 
                        your temper would be your ruin.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        These are outrageous, defamatory 
                        allegations! Where is your proof?

                                 MIA
                        As I said earlier tonight, the 
                        proof is in the eyes.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        You’re saying you can see it in my 
                        eyes? That’s not proof. That’s New 
                        Age nonsense!

                                 MIA
                        Not your eyes, Mr. Vice President. 
                        Adara’s eyes.

           The vice president’s forehead wrinkles up in confusion.

                                 MIA
                        Retinal bleeding... Red eyes.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        What are you talking about? I saw 
                        her when you found the body! Her 
                        eyes were white as the driven snow!

                                 MIA
                        Exactly. I examined Adara and had 
                        our medical examiner send me a list 
                        of symptoms of asphyxiation. Adara 
                        had no subconjunctival 
                        hemorrhaging: no red eyes. No 
                        Petechial hemorrhages: no burst 
                        capillaries, no red dots under the 
                        eyes. No blueish tint around the 
                        lips. No crushed trachea. No 
                        fractured larynx or hyoid bone. No 
                        defensive wounds. No signs of 
                        violence.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        What are you saying?
                                 MIA
                        Adara didn’t die by asphyxiation. 
                        This was far too clean.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        So what killed her?

                                 MIA
                        Hypoxia... Her blood was starved of 
                        oxygen.

           Mia turns to face the group.

                                 MIA
                        Adara was blood-choked.

           All eyes turn to Vice President Steele. His mouth hangs wide 
           in shock.

                                 MIA
                        Once the vice president strangled 
                        Adara... That is when Holland 
                        walked in and saw everything.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Me?

           Mia turns to him.

                                 MIA
                        I was wondering how you suddenly 
                        became Vice President Steele’s new 
                        chief of staff. He loathed you. He 
                        called you a jabbering lickspittle.

                                 HOLLAND
                        He did?

                                 MIA
                        I wondered what possible piece of 
                        political pandering you had pulled. 
                        You must have found something 
                        massive on him.

                                 HOLLAND
                        Mia, I have nothing to do with 
                        this...

                                 MIA
                        You said earlier tonight that the 
                        vice president requires undying 
                        loyalty. How could you prove your 
                        undying loyalty to him?
                                 HOLLAND
                        ...You’re upset because I rejected 
                        you tonight...

           Holland turns to the group.

                                 HOLLAND
                        ...She tried to have an affair with 
                        me and I turned her down...

                                 MIA
                        It’s true. All night I couldn’t see 
                        what was right in front of me: you 
                        were never going to leave your 
                        wife. You were always going to do 
                        what’s best for you.

                                 HOLLAND
                        ...I’m a family man. I have a wife 
                        and two young children!

           Mia crosses the room, closing in on him.

           INT. BATHROOM // FLASHBACK

           Holland enters the bathroom. He sees the vice president 
           standing over Adara’s body, holding a bloody napkin.

           The two men stare at each other in shock.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        The moment you walked in on the 
                        vice president, you realized... You 
                        held all the leverage in the world. 
                        Half the army was in the bunker. A 
                        single shout from you, and a dozen 
                        generals would come running to that 
                        bathroom. You had the future US 
                        president by the balls. 

           Holland carefully shuts the bathroom door. He steps toward 
           the vice president.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        But how do you guarantee this 
                        leverage? Forever? You needed a 
                        piece of evidence.

           The vice president is panting, wild-eyed, a caged animal.

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        In this moment, the VP had to do 
                        whatever you said. 
                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                                 MIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Maybe he knew his plan to frame the 
                        Russian ambassador was on ice. 
                        Maybe he figured his best bet was 
                        to put as much distance as possible 
                        between himself and any evidence. 
                        Maybe you were just very 
                        convincing. 

           Holland steps close to the panicked vice president...

                                 MIA (V.O.)
                        A good chief of staff is a fixer. 
                        You told the vice president you’d 
                        handle everything. You calmed him 
                        down. You smoothed out his jacket. 
                        And you told him you’d dispose... 
                        of this.

           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM // PRESENT

           Mia reaches into Holland’s V-neck pocket and plucks out a 
           dinner napkin. IT IS COVERED IN BLOOD.

                                 MIA
                        The vice president knew this 
                        evidence would be safe on your 
                        person. This whole night, you were 
                        the only dinner guest that no one 
                        ever suspected of murder. You were 
                        the perfect person to secret this 
                        evidence away.

           Holland’s head swivels from the vice president to Mia.

                                 MIA
                        When I searched Vice President 
                        Steele and didn’t find the napkin, 
                        I thought my whole theory was 
                        wrong. I had a blind spot: you. But 
                        thank god for your self-interest, 
                        Holland. You were never going to 
                        throw away this napkin. Because, as 
                        you told me, that’s not how 
                        Washington works. Washington works 
                        on self-interest. This napkin was 
                        your meal ticket.

           Mia uses her sleeves to take the Churchill bust from Agent 
           Stone. She turns it over in the light. On the base is a 
           smudge of blood and strands of the president’s hair.

                                 MIA
                        I believe the vice president’s 
                        fingerprints are on this bust. 
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                                 MIA (CONT'D)
                        And I believe this blood will match 
                        the napkin, Holland.

                                 HOLLAND
                             (ashen)
                        What could I have done? He’s the 
                        next president. The most powerful 
                        man in the world.

           Mia turns to Vice President Steele.

                                 MIA
                        You are not above the law. You 
                        never were.

           The vice president takes an involuntary step backward. His 
           eyes dart from person to person, a caged animal.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        None of you hypocrites has been to 
                        war, but you get your freedoms, 
                        your rights, and your privileges, 
                        from men like me who know there are 
                        sacrifices that must be made for 
                        the greater good.

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        My husband was a sacrifice?

           UNIFORMED DIVISION OFFICERS guard the door to the West Wing 
           corridor. Vice President Steele marches toward them.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        Let me out! I have a country to 
                        run!

           The guards stare forward, stony-faced, blocking his path.

                                 VICE PRESIDENT STEELE
                        I’m one of you, damn it! I’m a 
                        marine!

           Mia nods to Agent Stone who pulls a fresh set of plastic flex 
           cuffs from his belt.

                                 MIA
                        By the powers vested in me by the 
                        US Code 3056, I am placing you 
                        under arrest for the assassination 
                        of President Henry Douglas Wood. 
                        You have the right to remain 
                        silent, anything you say can and 
                        will be used against you in a court 
                        of law.
           Vice President Steele looks ready to fight. First Lady Wood 
           steps close to him. She quotes him, acid in her voice...

                                 FIRST LADY WOOD
                        Come on, Jim. Keep your dignity.

           The vice president’s eyes lower in shame.

           Out of the corner of her eye, Mia spots Holland slinking for 
           the door. He creeps diagonally across the checkered tiles.

                                 MIA
                        Holland Atkinson, the second you 
                        took that bloody napkin, the vice 
                        president tied you to his fate. You 
                        are an accessory after the fact. 
                        That’s a felony.

           THE UNIFORMED DIVISION OFFICERS SEIZE HOLLAND BY THE ELBOWS.

                                 HOLLAND
                        I can’t go to jail... I have a life 
                        here... I have kids...

                                 MIA
                        It’s okay, Holland. Your wife never 
                        liked D.C. And you said yourself: 
                        you’re not a family man.

           Agent Stone presses a finger to his earpiece.

                                 AGENT STONE
                        Ms. Pine? The chief justice has 
                        arrived. She’s in the building.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAWN

           Fey light streams in. Mia, the first lady, Speaker Brookes, 
           and Ambassador Kamenev stand before the Resolute Desk.

           CHIEF JUSTICE OMAR (60s) sweeps into the room majestically. 
           She shrugs off her jacket, revealing her judicial robe.

                                 CHIEF JUSTICE OMAR
                        Do I need my eyes checked, or did I 
                        just see the vice president being 
                        led away in handcuffs?

                                 MIA
                        It’s been a long night.

                                 CHIEF JUSTICE OMAR
                        I see. Well, I believe I was called 
                        here to swear in a president.
                                 MIA
                        She’s over here, your honor.

           Speaker of the House Terra Brookes steps forward.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Ambassador Kamenev, would you 
                        please join us for the ceremony? I 
                        know we’ve kept you a while, but 
                        when I speak to the American people 
                        this morning, and tell them that 
                        our president has been killed, I 
                        will need to tell them that our 
                        countries are at peace.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        Peace?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        The US is standing down. I know we 
                        both have self-interest in the 
                        Middle East. But I have been 
                        thinking a lot about self-interest 
                        tonight...

           Speaker Brookes eyes meet Mia’s.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        ...And I believe it is more 
                        important to think of duty. Our 
                        duty to do whatever we can to bring 
                        peace to that region. Our duty to 
                        do what’s right.

           The ambassador bows.

                                 AMBASSADOR KAMENEV
                        I will notify the Kremlin. I 
                        believe they will be much relieved 
                        to stand down.

           Chief Justice Omar clasps her hands.

                                 CHIEF JUSTICE OMAR
                        Shall we begin?

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        There is one final thing.

           Morning sunlight floods the room.

                                 SPEAKER BROOKES
                        Mia, would you care to serve as my 
                        new Chief of Secret Service?
                                 MIA
                        It would be my honor. Madam 
                        President.

           Chief Justice Omar holds out the Lincoln bible...

           Speaker Brookes places her right hand upon it...

           Mia Pine stands at attention behind the new American 
           president.

                                 THE END
