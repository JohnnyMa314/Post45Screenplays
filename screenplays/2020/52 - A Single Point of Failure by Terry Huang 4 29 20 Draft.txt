           OVER BLACK:

           The hum of a jet engine in full throttle. A slight rumbling 
           that gives way to increasingly violent shaking. 

           [The voices are all slightly accented, but in English. Images 
           will flash in and out rapidly. Otherwise, we're in black.]

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Air control, we have some problem.

                                 FIRST OFFICER (V.O.)
                        We are flying manually due to 
                        flight control problem.

           FLASH ON SCREEN: Lights flicker frantically on the cockpit 
           dashboard. Warning noises overtake all sound.

                                 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (V.O.)
                        Please report altitude.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Air control, we cannot determine 
                        altitude due to instruments showing 
                        different readings.

           FLASH ON SCREEN: A warning light flashes red. The altimeter 
           is going nuts.

                                 FIRST OFFICER (V.O.)
                        Aircraft is flying down.

                                 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (V.O.)
                        What altitude?

           FLASH ON SCREEN: The entire cockpit shakes violently.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Five thou.

                                 FIRST OFFICER (V.O.)
                        Jet is descending.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        It's okay.

           FLASH ON SCREEN: The entire cabin full of PASSENGERS 
           screaming as the plane nosedives. They're yanked up, some out 
           of their seats, violently thrown around. A MOTHER holds tight 
           to her BABY as she cries.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.)
                        Excess speed. Warning. Excess 
                        speed. Warning.
                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Fly up.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.)
                        Warning. Terrain, terrain. Warning. 
                        Pull up, pull up. Terrain. Warning.

           FLASH ON SCREEN: All out chaos in the cockpit. Only blue and 
           white whirring past the window. Then -- 

           SILENCE ..................... The sound of waves takes us --

           EXT. JAVA SEA - DAY

           The water at the surface undulates with a consistent rhythm. 

           The clear blue-green surface gives way to white foam.

           Finally, something appears at the surface. A piece of metal.

           Then another piece. We realize ... there's debris everywhere. 

           The remnants of a fuselage. Luggage. All eradicated to bits.

           It's a massive accident.

           DOMINIC GATES (60s), reporter for the Seattle Times, a sober 
           look about him, Irish accent muted by decades in the States.

           BETH (17), his daughter, dressed in a private girls school 
           uniform, also eating.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Did you get your applications in?

                                 BETH
                        Dad, I already told you, 
                        applications aren't due for months.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Still, it's better to get ahead of 
                        it, don't you think?

                        Would you just lay off? All the

                                 DOMINIC
                        All right, SORRY I asked. You know 
                        I'm really gonna miss these talks 
                        of ours when you go away to school.

                        Oh she's MY daughter all the 
                        sudden? Ask her how her college 
                        applications are going.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 DOMINIC
                        Been down that road. I'm truly 
                        afraid she's going to murder me. 
                        Chop me up into little bits, feed 
                        me to the fishies.

                                 NINA
                        She's a seventeen-year-old girl. 
                        You really shouldn't be this scared 
                        of her.

                        here. There's something developing 
                        out of Indonesia.

           allowing everyone to enter before him.

           He finally steps inside, we get a clear look at his face as 
           he turns around. The look of a kind and well-intentioned man.

           Paul drops his bag down at his desk, grabs his laptop and

           another INVESTMENT MANAGER. He speaks with a measured 
           cadence, making sure every word is chosen with care.

                        -- your portfolio has performed in 
                        line with expectations, slightly 
                        outpacing global markets. These 
                        charts show --

                        -- U.S. blue chips have been 
                        performing at record rates with 
                        mega-cap stocks at historical 
                        highs. This is due to healthy 
                        balance sheets -- multinationals 
                        have been employing cost-cutting 
                        measures since the recession and 
                        have benefitted from increased

                        more profitable than ever.

                                 MANAGER
                        We're thinking of adding a few new 
                        mega-cap stocks into the mix, 
                        including aviation.

                        Yes, as you can see by these charts 
                        Airbus and Boeing have been vying 
                        for market share for years.

                        wrote me a piece about big milk in 
                        school cafeterias.

           Nina and Dominic watch CNN from a couch. At the desk is --

           DON SHELTON (60s), nearing the end of his career.

                                 CNN REPORTER
                            (on TV)
                        -- reporting that all 189 
                        passengers on the Lion Air flight 
                        are believed to be dead. Indonesian 
                        investigators are looking into the 
                        cause of the crash, but --
           Nina mutes the TV.

                                 DON
                        Any word out of Indonesian Search 
                        and Rescue?

                                 DOMINIC
                        Nothing yet. But I have a call in.

           They both stare at the coverage for a moment.

                                 DON
                        Let me know what you find out.

           Dominic gets up to leave, when --

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Oh, and what sort of background do 
                        we have on the situation? Wasn't 
                        Mike already interviewing those two 
                        airline execs?

           find our way to --

           EDDY KNOWLES (late 50s), lifelong mid-level salesman, from 
           the heartland of America. He looks into camera --

                                 EDDY
                        So this is gonna be part of a 
                        documentary or something, right?

           MIKE BAKER (30s), football player physique, ginger, stands in 
           front of a series of monitors reviewing the footage, next to 
           a VIDEO EDITOR, who drives the edit.

           Eddy's face is up on one screen.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                            (via monitor)
                        That's right. Something like that.

                                 EDDY
                        So what d'you want me to say?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Could you start by stating your 
                        name and what your role was?
                                 EDDY
                        Ah yeah, sure thing. Eddy Knowles. 
                        Worked for UA. United Airlines.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        And what exactly did you do there?

           INT. BOEING 747 - DAY

           A rumbling of turbulence. Some verbal grumblings from other 
           PASSENGERS. A ding of the seatbelt sign.

                                 EDDY (V.O.)
                        Yeah, I was a buyer. Worked with 
                        the sales reps at the airplane 
                        manufacturers. Made the deals.

           A FLIGHT ATTENDANT smiles reassuringly as she makes her way 
           down the aisle. She passes Eddy, taps on his seat.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Sir, could you put your tray table 
                        up for me? We're about to land.

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        And can you walk me through how 
                        those deals went down?

           FLASH: Eddy's interview as he considers where to start.

           INT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIPORT - DAY

           Outside, we see the 747 sits parked safely on the tarmac.

           Passengers exit the jetway. Eddy rolls his suitcase into the 
           terminal, his phone to his ear.

                                 EDDY
                        Hi, hun. Just wanted to let you 
                        know that I landed all right. Bit 
                        of turbulence but easy enough.
                            (beat)
                        Oh and forgot to mention that Brian 
                        asked about using the lake house 
                        with his friends next weekend. I 
                        told him he could have it, figured 
                        it was his turn to use it.

           Eddy spots someone in the distance he knows.
                                 EDDY (CONT'D)
                        Hot damn, I don't believe it -- 
                        hun, all right, I'll see you next 
                        week -- I'll get you some of those 
                        chocolates you like -- love you.

                        Son of a -- look who it is. I 
                        didn't know they were sending you

           Jeff and Eddy shake hands.

                                 JEFF
                        Eddy, nice to see you. You gotta 
                        love trade shows -- only time I can 
                        get away from the fucking kids.

                                 EDDY
                        Wait 'til they leave the house -- 
                        you'll never feel freer.

                                 JEFF
                            (laughs, then)
                        What's the word over in Chicago?

                                 EDDY
                        Best time of year. Except for the 
                        humidity.

                                 JEFF
                        Think you've got it bad? Come to 
                        Atlanta -- walk outside and the air 
                        slaps you across the face.

           Jeff and Eddy laugh, realize they're standing in front of an 
           airport bar.
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Wanna?

           They head straight for the bar.

                        You bought planes for the airlines?

                        Gotta love Paris for the 
                        croissants, but goddam their 
                        service is slow.

           Jeff waves to get some attention.

                                 EDDY
                        We give Americans a bad name.

                                 JEFF
                        Eh, what're you gonna do?

           The drinks finally arrive.

                                 EDDY
                        Well, cheers I guess -- to Europe.

                                 JEFF
                        To Europe.
                            (clinking)
                        So what're y'all in the market for 
                        this year?

                                 EDDY
                        Recession still has us squeezed 
                        pretty tight, but we're thinking of 
                        ramping up the fleet a bit. You?
                                 JEFF
                        We're in the market for a couple 
                        new planes, but we're sticking to 
                        single aisle. Shifting focus away 
                        from long-haul flights.

                                 EDDY
                        Gotta get those business travelers. 
                        Those shuttle flights.

                                 JEFF
                        Oil prices are killing us.

                                 EDDY
                        You're telling me. We can barely 
                        make up the difference -- between 
                        the unions, the cost of fuel, 
                        cleaning, repairs -- we gotta find 
                        an edge somewhere.

                                 JEFF
                        Look over there.

           Jeff eyes a group of AMERICAN AIRLINES EXECS rolling their 
           suitcases through the airport.

                                 EDDY
                        Fuckin' American. They roll in here 
                        like the goddam Yakuza.

           They watch as they make their way toward the exit.

                                 JEFF
                            (onto)
                        Wanna split a cab?

                                 EDDY
                        Yeah, might as well save a buck.

                        waiting for you.

                                 MARK
                        Sorry, I just -- you know what? You 
                        all go ahead, I'll meet you at the 
                        restaurant.

                                 KYLE
                        You sure?

                        Still on for our lesson this 
                        weekend? Gotta get my hours in.

                                 MARK
                        Sure thing.

           Kyle smiles, then takes off. As Mark heads out of the room we 
           notice on the wall --

           A framed photo of Mark in a pilot uniform.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           A light switches on, revealing storage, boxes, etc. Mark 
           walks down the stairs.

           He starts looking through various filing cabinets, searching 
           for something.

           Finally, he finds a folder and looks through the contents. 
           Printouts. 

           We can't make out the contents but we catch the logo at the 
           top: The Boeing Company.

           EXT. BLOOMBERG NYC OFFICES - DAY

           Various EMPLOYEES make their way in and out of the lobby.

                                 PETER (PRE-LAP)
                        Boeing released a press statement, 
                        basically --

           INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Peter stands at the door, while Joel redlines a story.

                                 PETER
                        -- absolving themselves of any 
                        responsibility. They're calling it 
                        a maintenance issue. 

                                 JOEL
                        Peter, I'm kinda busy.

                                 PETER
                        Come on, Joel, just listen to this.
                            (reading from phone)

                        Customers quote have our assurance 
                        that the 737 MAX is as safe as any 
                        airplane that has ever flown the 
                        skies. It's a canned response.

                                 JOEL
                        Okay, what's the FAA saying?

                                 PETER
                        Not hearing a peep out of the FAA. 
                        It's sort of outside their purview 
                        at this point.

                                 JOEL
                            (actually intrigued)
                        What do you mean "outside their 
                        purview"? They're the Federal 
                        Aviation Agency.

                                 PETER
                        This is a foreign carrier flying 
                        out of Jakarta. There weren't any 
                        Americans on board. They have to 
                        defer to the local authorities in 
                        this situation.

                                 JOEL
                        The FAA is responsible for any 
                        plane manufactured in the United 
                        States --

                                 PETER
                        They're saying it's not a plane 
                        issue. It's a pilot issue. Lion Air 
                        has a shit record with its pilots, 
                        so it stands well within the realm 
                        of possibility that the fault lies 
                        with the airline.

                                 JOEL
                        What about you? You think it was 
                        pilot error?

                                 PETER
                        Couldn't say at this point.

                                 JOEL
                        You were inside Boeing -- what sort 
                        of confidence do you have in their 
                        operations?

           Peter's face betrays his confidence in Boeing.
                                 PETER
                        Look, I know the people up top 
                        might object, but I'd like your 
                        approval to pursue this.

           Joel has to make a quick decision.

                                 JOEL
                        Yeah, shit, all right. Grab Julie 
                        and some of the interns, see if you 
                        can dig into this some more.

                                 PETER
                        All right. Thank you, Joel.

                                 JOEL
                        And Peter? Don't say I never gave 
                        you latitude.

                        Quiet. I just put her down.

           Caroline motions to a BABY asleep in a crib.

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry, sorry.

           Paul takes off his shoes, sets the grocery bags down, and 
           tiptoes toward her. They kiss.

                                 CAROLINE
                        How was work?

                                 PAUL
                        Okay, yeah. Busy. How was your day?
                                 CAROLINE
                        Also busy, yeah.

                                 PAUL
                        Did you manage to file the 
                        residency paperwork yet?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Yes, I turned it in yesterday -- 
                        they said we had to wait a few 
                        weeks before we would hear back. 

                                 PAUL
                        Good. It's in their hands now.

           Paul looks down at the table at a crayon drawing, picks it 
           up. It's one of their kids' drawings of the whole family. 

           Caroline watches him as he takes it in.

                                 CAROLINE
                        It's starting to feel like home 
                        now. Starting to feel comfortable. 
                            (beat)
                        I want to stay here.

                                 PAUL
                        I know. So do I.

           He sets the drawing down.

                        I'm going to finish up some work.

                                 CAROLINE

                        They want a full portfolio analysis 
                        for tomorrow. Reviewing risk

                        All right, but don't work too hard.

           They kiss and he heads off into the other room.

                        What up, Goldman? You covering 
                        this?

                                 GOLDMAN
                        Yeah, man. They took me off 
                        industrials and put me on 
                        aerospace.

                                 DEUTSCHE
                        Aerospace is where it's at. It's 
                        where all the action is.

                                 GOLDMAN
                        Doesn't fucking matter to me. It's 
                        all the same. Copper, hotels, 
                        airplanes, it's all just product on

                        Can't we get an omelette bar?

                        How about a Belgian waffle?

                                 GOLDMAN
                        Tired of bagels. Every day it's a 
                        goddam bagel. These quarterly 
                        investor presentations make me 
                        wanna jump out a window.

           Goldman grabs extra lox. Deutsche follows his lead.

                        You kidding me? You seen their 
                        balance sheet. They're flush -- 
                        they've already spent thirty 
                        billion on stock buybacks -- and 
                        oil prices -- I'm betting it goes 
                        over four hundred in a year.

                                 DEUTSCHE
                        Four hundred? You can't be serious.

                                 GOLDMAN
                        Dead serious.

           Mark Forkner sits in the front seat of his car. He's parked 
           outside a non-descript office building.

           He's watching the front door, waiting for someone, when he 
           spots whoever it is, gets out of the car.

           EXT. SEATTLE STREET - DAY

           Mark runs across the street, catches up to --

           PATRIK GUSTAVSSON (50s), too tall, looks like he's in IT.

                                 MARK
                        Patrik!

                                 PATRIK
                        Jesus, Mark, what are you doing --

                                 MARK
                        I've been trying to get a hold of 
                        you. Why haven't you --

                                 PATRIK
                        You can't be here.

           Patrik approaches his car.

                                 MARK
                        We need to talk.

                                 PATRIK
                        There's nothing to talk about.
                                 MARK
                        You saw the news, didn't you? The 
                        crash?

                                 PATRIK
                        Yeah, I saw it. What do you --

                                 MARK
                        I spoke to some friends I know from 
                        NTSB and they're saying the plane 
                        was experiencing throttling down on 
                        takeoff. The plane was --

                                 PATRIK
                        Mark, we can't be talking about 
                        this, all right?

           Patrik gets inside his car.

                                 MARK
                        Pat, it's just like the sim, I --

                                 PATRIK
                        Mark, stop it! Stop talking! Just 
                        go home.

           Patrik reverses, drives off, leaving Mark standing there.

                        sensor was replaced two days before 
                        the flight. They're saying the 
                        sensor was malfunctioning, giving 
                        the pilots bad readings.
                                 DOMINIC
                        You get a hold of the design 
                        documents from Boeing yet?

                                 MIKE
                        I have a request in, but I haven't 
                        heard back.

                                 DOMINIC
                        We need to get a look at those 
                        documents so we can confirm what 
                        went wrong with the plane -- stay 
                        on them.

           Dominic walks off.

           INT. SEATTLE TIMES EDITING ROOM - DAY

           Mike sits with the Video Editor reviewing more footage.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                            (via monitor)
                        Can you just give me a little more 
                        context into how deals go down?

           EXT. LE BOURGET AIRPORT - DAY

           Various commercial planes sit on the tarmac. A group of 
           WORKERS puts up a sign that reads: PARIS AIR SHOW 2011.

                                 EDDY (V.O.)
                        Nothing to it really.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        Big event is the Paris Air Show. 

                                 EDDY (V.O.)
                        It's where all the airlines and 
                        manufacturers shake hands.

           Crowds of AIRCRAFT SELLERS and AIRLINE BUYERS mingle. This is 
           the largest aviation market in the world. 

           It happens every other year and it's the chance for the 
           airplane manufacturers to SELL BIG.

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - DAY

           Various booths setting up. Boeing raises its logo over its 
           booth. Some of their REPS get organized.
           And over on the other side is Airbus. The other elephant.

           Eddy and Jeff filling up on coffee at the concession table. 
           They eye the gathering at the Boeing station.

                                 EDDY
                        Boeing's been losing market share 
                        to Airbus.

                                 JEFF
                        They hate each other. I love it.

                                 EDDY
                        You hearing anything about the 
                        Dreamliner?

                                 JEFF
                        Dreamliner. More like a nightmare 
                        from what I've heard.

                                 EDDY
                        They're three years delayed on 
                        delivery.

                                 JEFF
                        Saying there's some problems in 
                        assembly. How much have they spent 
                        on it?

                                 EDDY
                        They're way over budget, billions 
                        over budget.

                                 JEFF
                        Someone's gonna get fired for that.

                                 EDDY
                        You kidding me? Who are they gonna 
                        fire? They barely got any engineers 
                        left. They've gutted the place. 
                        They've already subcontracted all 
                        the manufacturing -- they're 
                        ruthless motherfuckers.

           ANGLE OVER to the Airbus booth.

                                 JEFF
                        What do the Europeans got?

                                 EDDY
                        An update to the A320. They 
                        announced it last year.
                                 JEFF
                        What kind of update?

                                 EDDY
                        Nothing sexy. New engine, more fuel 
                        efficient, something like that. I 
                        dunno exactly.

                                 JEFF
                            (intrigued)
                        Huh.

                                 EDDY
                            (offering)
                        Biscuit?

                                 JEFF
                        No sweets -- doctor's orders. I'm 
                        pre-diabetic.

                                 EDDY
                        What the hell is pre-diabetic?

           A candle flickers. There are hundreds more. Flowers too.

           Printed photos of VARIOUS LION AIR PASSENGERS are placed 
           together creating a makeshift memorial.

           The sheer number of photos is overwhelming.

           INT. SEATTLE TIMES BULLPEN - NIGHT

           Dominic sits at his desk, poring over papers. As he flips 
           through, up walks --

                                 NINA
                        We're late -- let's get a move on.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Can we cancel?

                                 NINA
                        No, I promised them we'd have 
                        dinner, it's been months -- come 
                        on, we gotta go.

                                 DOMINIC
                        All right -- yeah, okay.
           Dominic starts to gather his things. Nina notices a huge 
           stack of papers on his desk.

                                 NINA
                        Some light reading?

                                 DOMINIC
                        Design documents submitted to the 
                        FAA for approval for the MAX.

                                 NINA
                        Anything interesting?

                                 DOMINIC
                            (takes a breath)
                        Can't say for sure.

                                 NINA
                        What can you say?

                                 DOMINIC
                            (figuring it out)
                        I dunno -- I'm not an airplane 
                        designer so it's hard to know, just 
                        -- you know just some stuff that 
                        doesn't exactly make sense.

                                 NINA
                        Like what?

                                 DOMINIC
                        The Indonesian authorities reported 
                        a faulty sensor -- on the nose -- 
                        it's suppose to measure the angle 
                        of ascent. They're saying that it 
                        misread, gave the pilots a bad 
                        reading. But the sensor was 
                        repaired multiple times, on 
                        multiple planes. Something like 
                        that ... had to have been a known 
                        issue.

                                 NINA
                        So you think Boeing knew about the 
                        problem?

                                 DOMINIC
                        Dunno for sure -- but I just can't 
                        see how they didn't know about it.
                                 NINA
                        Well, if you're gonna publish that 
                        Boeing knew about the safety issue 
                        and didn't say anything, you better 
                        have sources to back it up.
                            (as he considers this)
                        Come on, let's get dinner.

           Dominic grabs his coat and they exit.

           EXT. BLOOMBERG OFFICES - NIGHT

           A CLEANING CREW mops the floors of the lobby. 

           INT. BLOOMBERG OFFICES - NIGHT

           Peter walks into the doorway, stands at Joel's door as Joel 
           finishes up some work.

                                 PETER
                        Someone leaked the FDR from the 
                        crash. 

                                 JOEL
                        The FDR?

                                 PETER
                        The Flight Data Recorder. It's 
                        basically the device that --
                            (off confused look)
                        Better just come have a look -- 
                        it'll be easier to explain.

           INT. BLOOMBERG CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Peter tapes a printout of a graph of the Flight Data Recorder 
           (FDR) on the whiteboard as Joel and some RESEARCH INTERNS and 
           JULIE JOHNSSON (30s), fellow reporter, sit at the table.

           Peter begins to trace the line with a marker.

                                 PETER
                        Okay, pretty simple. This line 
                        shows the altitude of the plane 
                        over time -- this one's the 
                        velocity of the aircraft.
                            (pointing)
                        Right here ... takeoff. Climbing, 
                        climbing, climbing ...

           He starts to circle various points on the line graph.
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        You can see here -- the plane 
                        ascends then -- down hard. Pilots 
                        try to pull up, then down again.

                                 JOEL
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        Doesn't make sense, right? Then we 
                        did a little digging.

           Peter sorts through papers, finds part of the design doc. 
           Then he writes on the board: MCAS.

                                 JOEL
                        What's MCAS?

                                 JULIE
                            (reading)
                        MCAS. Maneuvering Characteristics 
                        Augmentation System.

                                 PETER
                        Turns out Boeing installed it on 
                        the plane when they upgraded the 
                        737 to the MAX. 

                                 JULIE
                        It's a software program. 

                                 PETER
                        You can see the pilots keep trying 
                        to take manual control and to 
                        regain altitude, but MCAS keeps 
                        forcing the plane down -- the same 
                        thing happened the day before on 
                        another flight and the pilot 
                        managed to land safely. But not 
                        this time. This time, the pilots 
                        couldn't force the plane up -- the 
                        plane nosedived until ...

           Peter shows the final altitude descent on the line graph.

                                 JOEL
                        Jesus, why the hell would it do a 
                        thing like that?

           INT. SEATTLE TIMES CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dominic sits at a conference room table, one by one folding 
           pieces of paper into paper airplanes.
                                 JULIE (V.O.)
                        It gets a bit technical, so just 
                        bear with us.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 PETER
                        Okay, so MCAS was installed after 
                        Boeing retrofitted the old 737 with 
                        its new engines. 

           Dominic starts tweaking the base model paper airplane by 
           adding a paper engine with scotch tape.

                        The new engines were bigger than 
                        the old ones, so when they were 
                        installed --
                            (off to)
                        Julie, do you have a printout of 
                        the schematic?

           Julie grabs pages, tapes them up to the board, showing the 
           side view of the plane.

                                 JULIE
                        Right, okay, so you can see here, 
                        that the new engine actually sits 
                        slightly above the wing, and this 
                        changes the aerodynamics of the 
                        plane. Engineers found that because 
                        of the new design, the plane tended 
                        to pitch up during takeoff which 
                        could result in a stall. 

           Dominic begins a series of tests, throwing plane after plane 
           into the air.

                        Are you still with me?

                                 JOEL
                        Yeah, I think so.

           Dominic pieces together a new paper plane that closely 
           resembles the aerodynamics of the 737 MAX.

                                 JULIE
                        A stall is not good -- it's a 
                        really bad thing. Okay, so rather 
                        than completely re-engineering the 
                        plane, Boeing installs the new 
                        software system, MCAS, which forces 
                        the plane back down again -- to 
                        avoid the stall.
                                 JOEL
                        So the software forces the plane to 
                        nose down when it's about to stall?

           Dominic thinks for a beat, finally adds a bit of weight to 
           the tip of the plane by attaching a paperclip to the nose.

                                 PETER
                        That's what it's designed to do, 
                        but only under extreme scenarios. 
                        It should rarely ever kick in and 
                        it shouldn't have been triggered 
                        this time, not in this scenario. 

           Dominic finalizes his model paper plane, throws it over and 
           over again as a test.

                                 JULIE
                        MCAS was trying to compensate for 
                        engineering design problems. And 
                        for whatever reason, it triggers 
                        when it's not supposed to. The 
                        pilots try to override it, but MCAS 
                        keeps pushing them down -- 

           Dominic's planes nosedive over and over again.

                                 JULIE (CONT'D)
                        -- over and over, and they're 
                        gaining speed and eventually, the 
                        software overtakes them completely.

                                 JOEL
                        Shit ... did Boeing know about 
                        these problems?

                                 PETER
                        There were reports of issues with 
                        the AOA sensor, and it's looking 
                        like the sensor on this plane had 
                        just been replaced.

                                 JOEL
                        So was this a repair issue or is it 
                        a design problem?

           All of Dominic's paper planes sit piled up in a garbage can.

                                 PETER
                        We need to dig more on this -- we 
                        think it goes deeper than 
                        maintenance.

                        I'm hearing some grumblings from 
                        pilots and airlines. We need to 
                        talk to the engineers and the FAA -
                        -

                                 JOEL
                        All right. Keep going. Maybe I can 
                        spin this to corporate as an 
                        investor piece about Boeing's stock 
                        prospects.

           INT. VARIOUS CABLE NEWS ROOMS - NIGHT

           Various FINANCIAL NEWS PUNDITS sit at the desks of their 
           opinion shows, intercutting --

                                 VARIOUS PUNDITS
                        Prospects! Let's talk about 
                        Boeing's now. Boeing, the pride of 
                        American manufacturing. We've all 
                        heard about the crash and now 
                        there's some rumblings that 
                        officials want to ground the 737 
                        MAX. 
                            (sound effects)
                        Slow down, everyone! Do you know 
                        what that would do? The 737 is 
                        Boeing's most profitable plane in 
                        its history. It's got thousands of 
                        these babies flying all over the 
                        world. If I were a Boeing exec, I'd 
                        be doing whatever I could to keep 
                        those planes in the air. Grounding 
                        the 737 would most certainly tank 
                        Boeing's stock price! BEWARE 
                        INVESTORS! You kill the 737, might 
                        as well kill Boeing. And that's 
                        just un-American.

           INT. BOEING CHICAGO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A group of EXECUTIVES sit around a table. There's a good deal 
           of commotion. Finally, the room hushes as --

           Dennis Muilenburg enters the room. He takes a seat at the 
           head of the table. Everyone turns toward him in anticipation.

                                 DENNIS
                        All right, where are we on all 
                        this?
           KEVIN McALLISTER (50s), everyone's dad, head of commercial 
           airplanes division, leans in.

                                 KEVIN
                        We've already issued a press 
                        release extending our sincerest 
                        condolences to the families of 
                        those lost in the crash, but we 
                        haven't said anything about the 
                        crash beyond the sensor repair.
                            (beat)
                        We need to get ahead of the 
                        publicity around this -- we already 
                        have the airlines and the pilots 
                        breathing down our necks.

                                 DENNIS
                        What do you propose?

                                 KEVIN
                        Start sending reps out to all the 
                        airlines and hold an official Q&A 
                        for the pilots. We need to reassure 
                        them that the plane is safe to fly.

                                 DENNIS
                        It is safe to fly, right?

                                 KEVIN
                        The plane is fine. It's a safe as 
                        anything.

                                 DENNIS
                        You're not convincing me.

                                 KEVIN
                        We're gonna need to take a look at 
                        MCAS, work on some updates, and 
                        relay this information to 
                        customers. We can't avoid it 
                        anymore.

                                 DENNIS
                        I've got Gary Kelly chasing me down 
                        -- I keep telling him the plane is 
                        safe. Southwest has thirty-four in 
                        its fleet. I told him it's business 
                        as usual -- keep flying the planes.

                                 KEVIN
                        That's right -- that's what you 
                        should tell them.
                                 DENNIS
                        What are we saying about the 
                        pilots?

                                 KEVIN
                        Nothing officially. Lion Air's one 
                        of our biggest customers, we're not 
                        going to shift blame to them.
                            (beat)
                        That said, everyone knows Lion 
                        Air's reputation for overworking 
                        their pilots, and their standards 
                        for training them speaks louder.

                                 DENNIS
                        All right. Everyone, get ahead of 
                        this. There is no scenario under 
                        which we recall this plane. We need 
                        to continue delivering on our 
                        current orders and putting in new 
                        ones. 

                                 KEVIN
                            (to room)
                        Our official statement is that the 
                        plane is as safe as it ever was and 
                        this crash was tragic yet isolated 
                        accident.

           Executives around the room eye each other, perhaps knowing 
           more of the truth than they seem to admit.

           Paul and Caroline watch as their two children RYAN (6) and 
           KELLI (3) play on the swings nearby.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Not too hard, Ryan! Be careful, 
                        she's still small!

           Paul smiles, looks down to baby RUBI in Caroline's arms.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                            (beat)
                        She was born here, which means 
                        she's a citizen automatically.

                                 PAUL
                        This is a good country to raise a 
                        family. You have a good job here.
                                 CAROLINE
                        They like us here.

                                 PAUL
                        People here are kind to foreigners.

           They share a smile. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry to leave you to take the 
                        children all by yourself.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You have work. And my mother will 
                        go with us. She's much more useful 
                        than you are.

           He laughs. Just then Ryan runs up with Kelli.

                                 RYAN
                        Dad, did you bring the football?

                                 PAUL
                        It's in the car -- come, let's go 
                        get it.

           Paul grabs Ryan and flips him upside down playfully as they 
           head off.

                        Look, sorry to bother you on the 
                        weekend but I was hoping I could 
                        sit down with you -- we're working 
                        on a longer piece on what exactly 
                        went down inside the company that 
                        led to the approval of 737 MAX.

                        to hear about what you saw when you

                        Wanna know how the whole financial 
                        system came crashing down?

           INT. PARIS HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           Eddy sits at a table with Jeff sipping whiskey. A news 
           program on the TV reminds us we're in 2011.
                                 JEFF
                        Sure, enlighten me.

                                 EDDY
                        It wasn't that the system didn't 
                        work. It was that it worked too 
                        well. It did too good a job doing 
                        what it was designed for.

           Various other CONVENTION ATTENDEES hang around the room in 
           their own conversations.

                                 JEFF
                        How do you mean by that?

                                 EDDY
                        Okay, it's like -- here's an 
                        analogy -- in the 1950s, as part of 
                        the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong 
                        -- you know Mao Zedong, right? 

                                 JEFF
                        Sure. Chairman --

                                 EDDY
                        Yeah, Chairman Mao -- well, he 
                        decides to implement what he calls 
                        the Four Pests Campaign --

                                 JEFF
                        Four pests? What is --

                                 EDDY
                        The four pests -- rats, flies, 
                        mosquitoes, and sparrows. It was a 
                        hygiene campaign to eradicate the 
                        country of pestilence and disease. 
                        So he, you know, creates this 
                        public campaign to kill all these 
                        animals, thinking, hey, these dirty 
                        rodents are disgusting, disease 
                        carrying -- they're gross, they 
                        make us look primitive -- so let's 
                        get rid of them.

                                 JEFF
                        Okay --

                                 EDDY
                        So that's what they do -- you know, 
                        they start destroying sparrow nests 
                        or shooting them out of the sky, 
                        they encourage everyone in the 
                        country to do this and it works.
                                 JEFF
                        So it was a success?

                                 EDDY
                        Massive fucking success, except ...

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 EDDY
                        These orders from high up, they 
                        didn't take into consideration the 
                        adverse effects. What the Chinese 
                        government didn't realize was that 
                        it was the sparrows who kept the 
                        insect populations in check. So 
                        when all the sparrows were gone, 
                        the locust population ballooned and 
                        ate all the crops.

                                 JEFF
                        Shit.

                                 EDDY
                        It exacerbated the Great Chinese 
                        Famine which is estimated to have 
                        killed up to forty-five million 
                        people of starvation.

                                 JEFF
                        Forty-five million, Jesus Christ. 

                                 EDDY
                        It was misguided regulation. It 
                        gave too much authority with too 
                        little oversight. 
                            (beat)
                        And that's what happened with the 
                        banks and the mortgages. That's 
                        what happens everyday all over the 
                        world. They build the system and 
                        the let them use it for exactly 
                        what it's designed for, without 
                        anyone keeping them in check. 
                            (beat)
                        Kill the sparrows and you get the 
                        locusts.

           Eddy takes a final swing of his drink.

                        We need to get someone from the FAA 
                        on record.
           INT. SEATTLE HOME - NIGHT

           Nina chops vegetables. Dominic sits at his computer looking 
           through documents, phone to his ear.

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        I'm looking into it.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Did you speak to Ludtke?

           INT. SEATTLE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike also pores over mounds of printed pages.

                                 MIKE
                        No, I'm supposed to get on the 
                        phone with him next week.

                                 DOMINIC (V.O.)
                        We need to know what was going on 
                        inside Boeing during the 
                        certification of the plane.

           INT. SEATTLE TIMES BULLPEN - DAY

           Dominic sits at his desk, scrolling through a massive 
           document. He finally gets to the end.

           He thinks for a second, then he does a keyword search on the 
           PDF ... MCAS: 1 result. He scrolls, takes in what he reads.

           Then, he leans back, shakes his head.

           INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY

           Don sits at his desk across from --

           MICHELE FLORES (50s), cheery, has the energy of a younger 
           reporter, you might not guess she has a Pulitzer. She's the 
           new editor in chief.

                                 DON
                        -- the number of staffers for the

                                 MICHELE
                        I think we can make it work.
                                 DON
                            (noticing)
                        Dominic, come in.

           Dominic stands at the door.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Sorry, got a second? Didn't mean to 
                        interrupt --

                                 DON
                        Yeah, all good, shut the door.

                                 DOMINIC
                            (enters)
                        Michele, hi.

                                 DON
                        Good time to loop her in on the 
                        story, since she'll be taking over.

                                 DOMINIC
                            (taking a seat)
                        Right.

                                 DON
                        So what do you got? You guys have 
                        been deep in the research.

                                 DOMINIC
                        It's overwhelming -- airplanes 
                        require a lot documentation.

                                 DON
                        I hear the Times is gonna drop a 
                        story any minute. We better publish 
                        soon.

                                 DOMINIC
                        We're working -- just wanna get all 
                        the facts right. 

                                 DON
                        So what's on your mind?

                                 DOMINIC
                        Okay, so still no word out of the 
                        FAA about the design flaws I 
                        flagged. They're chronically 
                        muzzled.

                                 MICHELE
                        So we're sure there's something 
                        wrong with the plane then?
                                 DOMINIC
                        The FAA won't say it, but between 
                        you and me ... yes, there's 
                        something wrong with the plane. The 
                        important question now is how much 
                        did Boeing know -- and what did it 
                        fail to disclose. 

                                 DON
                        Right.

                                 DOMINIC
                        But no one's willing to say it. Now 
                        we've gone through all the approval 
                        documents from the FAA.

                                 MICHELE
                        And?

                                 DOMINIC
                        Okay, so Boeing sent out a new 
                        manual when they delivered the MAX 
                        to the airlines. That's obviously 
                        required by the FAA for any new 
                        model -- thing was like hundreds of 
                        pages -- it was a slog. 
                            (beat)
                        Anyway, guess how many times the 
                        manual mentioned MCAS.

                                 MICHELE
                        I dunno, how many?

                                 DOMINIC
                        Once ... in the index.

                                 MICHELE
                        So you're telling us that Boeing 
                        implemented a new software system 
                        which essentially took control of 
                        the plane, causing it to crash, and 
                        they didn't mention it to the 
                        pilots or the airlines?

                                 DOMINIC
                        That's exactly what I'm saying.

           INT. NYC CONFERENCE HALL - DAY

           A group of PILOTS and AIRLINE REPS sit in folding chairs. 

           As the commotion grows, we land back on --
           Kevin McAllister who steps up to the podium.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hello, everyone, thank you all for 
                        coming today. You've all been very 
                        patient with us for the last few 
                        weeks, and I know you've got 
                        questions and we've allocated time 
                        to answer all of them, but first 
                        I'd just like to say one thing.
                            (beat)
                        We've been in business a long time. 
                        And over that time, I think we've 
                        done our job in earning your trust. 
                        So what I'd like to say is ... you 
                        know us. We've always looked out 
                        for you. And we're looking out for 
                        you now, so believe me when I tell 
                        you that the plane is one-hundred 
                        percent safe.
                            (beat)
                        All right, let's take some 
                        questions. Bill?

           ANGLE ON: BILL (50s) training expert for a major airline.

                                 BILL
                        Yeah, Kevin, why weren't we made 
                        aware of the MCAS system?

                                 KEVIN
                        Thanks for the question, Bill. MCAS 
                        is only triggered in extreme 
                        circumstances. We know you've all 
                        got a lot on your plates already. 
                        We didn't want to overwhelm 
                        everyone with unnecessary 
                        information. Figured you'd much 
                        rather spend time out on the golf 
                        course than reading a list of 
                        software updates. There is no 
                        reasonable belief that any pilot 
                        would ever encounter MCAS in ten 
                        million flights.

                                 BILL
                        But these pilots did.

                                 KEVIN
                        Because of the AOA sensor 
                        misreading. And we all know Lion 
                        Air's reputation with their 
                        maintenance.

                        The Lion Air pilots lacked the 
                        necessary training to handle it -- 
                        they basically get these guys off 
                        the streets. Going through the NNC 
                        checklist, any American pilot with 
                        any degree of airmanship, basically 
                        any of you in this room, would have 
                        been able to navigate the system 
                        without error.

                                 BILL
                        But we heard you'd be pushing an 
                        update to the software?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yes, we've always believed in 
                        evolving and in making things even 
                        safer. It's our number one 
                        priority. Yeah, Robert?

           ANGLE ON: ROBERT (50s), another airline manager.

                                 ROBERT
                        Do you think the FAA is going to 
                        ground the plane?

                                 KEVIN
                        No, there's no reason --

                                 ROBERT
                        Because we've got a lot of this 
                        aircraft in our fleet. It would 
                        cost us a lot of money.

                                 KEVIN
                        The FAA is not going to ground the 
                        plane, guys. You have my assurance. 
                        We work closely with the regulators 
                        -- the plane is going to keep 
                        flying. I promise you.

           Everyone seems at ease with this explanation, except --

           Mark Forkner who sits in the back of the audience, watching 
           the entire thing. He sits there a bit stunned.

           Mark sits in his car out in the parking lot, watching as the 
           Boeing Executives make their way out.
           He stares at them through the window, wanting to do 
           something, but for some reason he can't. He just slams his 
           hands on the steering wheel in frustration.

           Paul sits at the dining table next to Rubi, feeding her baby 
           food, simultaneously playing peekaboo with her.

           The rest of the family sits around the table.

                                 PAUL
                        Do you have your passports?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Yes, don't worry. I have 
                        everything. Not so fast, you'll 
                        make her spit up.

                                 PAUL
                        She's fine. 
                            (to Rubi)

                                 KELLI
                        Papa, can we have ice cream now?

                                 CAROLINE
                        When you finish your vegetables.

                                 KELLI
                        That's not fair.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Vegetables first, then ice cream.

                                 RYAN
                        Will there be ice cream in Kenya?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Of course, there's ice cream there.

                                 RYAN
                        Good! I love ice cream!

           Paul laughs heartily, looks around at his entire family. Then 
           he notices the clock.

                                 PAUL
                        All right, hurry and finish eating. 
                        We have to get to the airport or 
                        you'll miss your flight.

           Julie sits at a table with her notepad out as she spots --

           Stan Sorscher walking through the door. She waves to him.

           INT. SEATTLE STARBUCKS - LATER

           Julie and Stan are mid conversation --

                                 JULIE
                        -- and so did you ever work on the 
                        MAX certifications yourself?

                                 STAN
                        No, but I worked on the 787. And it 
                        was a mess, let's just say that.

                                 JULIE
                        So you think this was a broader 
                        issue than just one plane -- you 
                        think something was wrong inside 
                        the company?

                                 STAN
                        This whole thing was way worse than 
                        you think -- it still is.

                                 JULIE
                        I guess -- I'm just looking for 
                        some context to the whole thing.

                                 STAN
                        If you want context to what was 
                        going on at Boeing, you have to go 
                        all the way back to the McDonnell 
                        acquisition.

                                 JULIE
                            (flips through notes)
                        That was -- wait, I think I 
                        remember --

           BEGIN INTERCUTTING: Various historical photos of McConnell 
           Douglas, the factories, press footage of the merger, etc.
                                 STAN
                        In 1997 Boeing acquired McDonnell 
                        Douglas, another airplane 
                        manufacturer, but honestly, you 
                        could hardly call McDonnell that -- 
                        they didn't know how to build an 
                        aircraft or run a company -- and 
                        they especially hated engineers.

                                 JULIE
                        An airplane manufacturer who hates 
                        engineers, how does that work?

                                 STAN
                        Exactly. They considered airplanes 
                        to be like -- pants. They could pay 
                        as little as they wanted to have 
                        them made. After the acquisition, 
                        there was a change in the company 
                        culture. See, Boeing started as a 
                        leader in innovation -- it had to 
                        employ the smartest engineers 
                        because it was difficult work they 
                        were doing. But once the jet engine 
                        came along, that was the last great 
                        piece of innovation. And so 
                        aircraft manufacturing became a 
                        commodities business, not an 
                        innovation business ... pants.

                                 JULIE
                        So, what? There was pressure to cut 
                        costs?

                                 STAN
                        You kidding? They cut everything -- 
                        they gutted entire departments. 
                        Half the engineers were gone. And 
                        they began outsourcing all 
                        manufacturing to vendors, to 
                        whoever would bid the lowest. You 
                        just have to look at the Dreamliner 
                        to understand the gross 
                        mismanagement at play.
                            (beat)
                        Look, it's fine when companies 
                        outsource pants to factories in 
                        Vietnam because worse comes to 
                        worst, the zipper breaks and you 
                        get caught with your fly down. Try 
                        to do it with a plane and ... well.

                        Market cap's somewhere north of

                        Hefty profits. So how do we improve 
                        on an already mature stock? Well, 
                        let's take a look at how Boeing 
                        became one of the most profitable 
                        companies in the world.

                        make it. In this case it's

                        But can you make it for even less? 
                        Less money paid to suppliers means 
                        higher profit margins for the 
                        company. Boeing figured out how to 
                        build planes for cheap. In fact, 
                        over the last two decades they were 
                        the gold standard for cost cutting 
                        measures.

                        suppliers bid each other down and 
                        take the lowest offer. Do this for 
                        every piece of the plane. It's all 
                        just parts anyway. All Boeing has 
                        to do is put them together. Like

                        wanna make a bit more cash for your 
                        investors, you've always got one 
                        final card up your sleeve ... the 
                        stock buyback. What's a stock 
                        buyback, you ask.

                        Instead of spending money paying 
                        engineers or reinvesting in new 
                        plants or covering pension and 
                        health plans, stash the money until 
                        you have enough to buy back stock 
                        from the market. Simple supply and 
                        demand. The less supply of stock on 
                        the open market, the higher the 
                        price. Buy back some stock and send 
                        your share price soaring. Ka-ching, 
                        that's how you make a lot of 
                        stockholders rich.

                        And you're okay to make your 
                        connection? Your mother will be

                        Don't worry.

           Paul pulls her in for a hug.

                                 PAUL
                        Be safe, my love.

           He lingers until --

                        miss our flight.

                        Yeah, let's go! Let's go!

           Caroline gathers the suitcases and the children, and they 
           walk toward the entrance. Paul stands there waving goodbye, 
           watching until they disappear out of sight.

                        That's right, yep.

                                 PETER
                        Have you heard anything about the

                        Peter, doesn't ring a bell. There 
                        are hundreds of new bills passed 
                        every year, we try to stick to 
                        covering the most important ones.

                                 PETER
                        For sure, I understand. Look, maybe 
                        you can help find someone who might 
                        know more about it.

                                 ALLAN
                        I can ask someone in research to 
                        have a look -- they're on top of

                        That'd be great, thank you.

                                 AMY
                        The bill continues giving more 
                        authority to the manufacturers to 
                        regulate their own planes.

                                 MIKE
                        Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

                                 AMY
                        Depends who you're asking. The 
                        manufacturers say that the FAA is 
                        too slow and stifles innovation. 
                        They can't compete if they can't 
                        get a plane approved. It's not just 
                        Boeing versus Airbus -- it's 
                        America versus Europe. Boeing is a 
                        shining star in a world where we 
                        have no manufacturing left. Add 
                        that all up, they let Boeing pretty 
                        much have free rein.

                                 MIKE
                        That's insane -- maybe the planes 
                        shouldn't be in the air if they 
                        can't get them approved by the FAA! 
                        How can regulation work like that?

                                 AMY
                        It's the only way it works. The FAA 
                        estimates that if they were to take 
                        on the sole responsibility of 
                        running the regulation of all new 
                        planes, they would need an 
                        additional ten-thousand people, 
                        which would cost billions of 
                        dollars. You ever try to get to get 
                        billions of dollars out of 
                        Congress?

                                 MIKE
                        Yet somehow they manage to find 
                        billions to kill school kids in 
                        Syria.

                                 AMY
                        What they do is they delegate most 
                        of the actual certifications to 
                        Boeing.
                                 MIKE
                        It's like giving a robber the keys 
                        to your store and asking him to 
                        watch the register.

                                 AMY
                        The assumption is that Boeing is in 
                        the business of building safe 
                        aircrafts. They wouldn't want to 
                        approve a plane that would fall out 
                        of the sky because that would 
                        adversely affect the company's 
                        bottom line. So they trust Boeing 
                        to handle the day-to-day and the 
                        FAA swoops in, does one final once 
                        over, and signs the paperwork.

                                 MIKE
                        And now 346 people are dead. So 
                        that's how well that worked out.

                        They're not giving us anything. All 
                        it is to them is -- it's a public 
                        relations fiasco, something they 
                        have to manage. They don't actually 
                        care about anyone on board.

                                 DOMINIC

                        I keep thinking -- imagining what 
                        it must've been like ... those 
                        final minutes. Knowing you're going 
                        to die.

                        it ... and all I keep thinking is 
                        how much I wish I could've been

                        Shut up. I mean seriously, when was 
                        the last time you actually got 
                        excited about a new airplane?

                                 JEFF
                        Airplanes shouldn't be exciting, 
                        they should be reliable.

                                 EDDY

           INT. SEATTLE HOME - DAY

           Stan sits at his coffee table, finishing a very large puzzle.

                                 STAN
                        It's when things really ramp up 
                        between Boeing and Airbus. In late 
                        2010 Airbus announces that they've 
                        made an improvement to the A320.

                                 JULIE
                        That's their plane?

                                 STAN
                        The A320 is the main competitor to 
                        the 737. These are single aisle 
                        planes, you know, the ones with 
                        seats on either side -- they're 
                        extremely ubiquitous -- if you've 
                        flown, you've probably been in one.

                                 JULIE
                        Got it. So they announce an 
                        upgrade? What do they --

                                 STAN
                        In December they announce that 
                        they're adding a new engine to the 
                        A320, they're calling the new model 
                        the A320neo. It's basically the 
                        same plane except for the engine.

                                 JULIE
                        What was the deal with the engine?
                                 STAN
                        The new engine made the plane about 
                        six percent more fuel efficient, 
                        which for a major airline means 
                        millions a year in savings. It's a 
                        huge cost cutter.

                                 JULIE

                        did you let this happen?

                                 DENNIS
                        We're working on fixing it. I 
                        promise, we're going to fix this. 
                        We're pushing new updates to MCAS.

                                 GARY
                        Shit, if I have to hear MCAS one 
                        more time, I'm gonna blow my brains 
                        out. Or maybe I'll just get on 
                        board one of your planes.
                                 DENNIS
                            (takes the punch, then)
                        Look, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        Stop saying my name like that.

                                 DENNIS
                        Gary. We're working on a 
                        resolution. You have my word.

                                 GARY
                        Come on, Dennis. You have to see.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 GARY
                        That you're in deep shit. You 
                        managed to skate by after Lion Air 
                        because -- well -- because in truth 
                        nobody seems to care about a bunch 
                        of Indonesians smashing head first 
                        into the ocean. But you let it 
                        happen again -- and this time there 
                        were Americans on board, so now 
                        it's a big deal. They've mounted a 
                        federal investigation into this. 
                        You're gonna have to answer some 
                        questions. They'll bring you in 
                        before congress. And even if there 
                        are no criminal charges, you gotta 
                        deal with the public relations 
                        fallout. Your stock is gonna 
                        plummet, because who in their right 
                        mind would ever step on board any 
                        one of your planes ever again?

                                 DENNIS
                        The plane is safe ... it's safe.

                                 GARY
                            (smiles, then)
                        Dennis, if that were true, it 
                        wouldn't have crashed. Twice.

           Gary goes back to his steak.

           INT. SEATTLE TIMES OFFICE - DAY

           Mike sits at his desk, reading through a document. Finally he 
           comes across a page with various signatures on it.
           He pops up from his desk.

                                 MIKE
                        Dom, come over here for a second.

           Dominic walks over behind his computer.

                                 DOMINIC
                        What's that?

                                 MIKE
                        These are the certification docs 
                        for the MAX. Something strange.

                                 DOMINIC
                        What is it?

                                 MIKE
                        Right here, these are all the 
                        approval signatures.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Okay?

                                 MIKE
                        Only one of them is an FAA 
                        regulator. Every other person who 
                        signed off on this is a Boeing 
                        employee.

           Mike finally turns to look Dominic in the eyes.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        It's like no one at the FAA even 
                        bothered to check.

           INT. NYC APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Peter sits on his couch looking over pages of documents. 
           After a beat he turns to see --

           TERI (40s), his fiancee, coming in with a glass of water, a 
           lot of sleep in her eyes. Teri is hearing impaired and wears 
           an implant. 

           She uses a mix of sign language and speech. He responds with 
           a similar mix, but it's clear he's learned for her.

                                 TERI
                        When are you coming to bed?

                                 PETER
                        Soon.
           Teri sits down on the couch next to him.

                                 TERI
                        We still have to decide on flower 
                        arrangements -- the calla lilies 
                        are more expensive but they go 
                        better with the color scheme.

                                 PETER
                        Okay, I'll take a look in a bit.

                                 TERI
                        Any updates?
                            (off shrug)
                        Explain where you're at to me. I 
                        might be able to give you an 
                        outside perspective.

                                 PETER
                        Okay ... so where I'm at right now 
                        ... the FAA delegated way too much 
                        control to Boeing to self-regulate 
                        because they were short on man 
                        power. So there are clear design 
                        flaws, and here --
                            (pulls pages)
                        -- right here in the safety 
                        documentation, it calls MCAS a 
                        hazardous failure.

                                 TERI
                        What does that mean?

                                 PETER
                        The FAA has all these different 
                        classifications for if a part 
                        fails, how much of an impact it 
                        would have. A hazardous failure 
                        classification means it would be 
                        catastrophic if it fails, so it 
                        requires that it would fail no more 
                        than once in every ten million 
                        times. Otherwise, they need 
                        backups. That's why these systems 
                        rely so heavily on redundancy.

                                 TERI
                        Which means?

                                 PETER
                        It just means that there's another 
                        check in place so if a part fails, 
                        there's a backup.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        So if MCAS was a hazardous failure 
                        classification, where was the 
                        redundancy?

           As she continues looking through various wedding purchases --

                                 TERI
                        I dunno. I don't know much about 
                        engineering, but normally, I mean, 
                        what I'd suggest is ... follow the 
                        money. If there's a reason, it's 
                        probably because someone somewhere 
                        decided it would be cheaper.

           Peter takes this in.

           INT. SEATTLE HOME - DAY

           Mark Forkner, walks in from a barbecue happening in the 
           backyard. He inconspicuously grabs a bottle of vodka from his 
           freezer, pours himself a glass.

           After a beat his son Kyle walks in from outside, goes to grab 
           himself a refill of a soda and some ice.

           He looks to Mark --

                                 KYLE
                        You all right, dad?

                                 MARK
                        Hmm? Yeah.

                                 KYLE
                        Sure?

           Kyle starts to head back as --

                                 MARK
                        Kyle?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, dad?

           EXT. SEATTLE HOME - DAY

           A cruiser sits parked outside. We see two DEPARTMENT OF 
           JUSTICE AGENTS step out of the marked vehicle.
           INT. SEATTLE HOME - SAME

                                 MARK
                        You know I've always tried to do 
                        the right thing? I mean, I've 
                        always tried to be an honest 
                        person.

                                 KYLE
                        I know that.

                                 MARK
                        I just want you to know that 
                        sometimes in life, even good people 
                        can get caught up in something.

                                 KYLE
                        What are you talking about?

           Mark shakes his head, notices the Agents throw the window. 

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Dad, are you sure you're all right?

           The doorbell rings, as the Agents stand outside the door.

                                 MARK
                        I'm fine. Head outside, I'm gonna 
                        get the door.

           Kyle heads back outside.

           EXT. BISHOFTU, ETHIOPIA, CRASH SITE - DAY

           Debris is spread across a wide swath of dirt. We follow a --

           U.S. NTSB INVESTIGATOR as he walks through the aftermath of 
           the plane crash. It's long after the dust has settled, but 
           they're still searching for answers. He looks around.

           For the first time, we get a sense of the magnitude of the 
           horror. The Investigator notices something in the distance. 

           He walks over, bends down to pick it up. In his hands is a 
           small stuffed animal, dirty and singed, but still in tact. 

           He contemplates the implication of this.

                        Rick? Hi.

                        Grandma, I'm gonna have to call you 
                        back ... no, Grams don't worry. The 
                        people there are taking care of 
                        you. You have to let them do their 
                        jobs -- I have to go now, talk to 
                        you soon.

                        Sorry, my grandma. She lives in a 
                        home -- she worries when I'm gone. 
                        She has trouble remembering things

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

           The WAITER finishes taking their orders.

                                 JULIE
                            (handing menu)
                        Just a coffee for me.

                                 RICK
                        I'll have the club sandwich. And a 
                        diet coke.

           As the Waiter takes off --

                                 JULIE
                        So Rick, you were an engineer 
                        inside of Boeing, right?

                                 RICK
                        That's right. I actually helped 
                        with the certification of the MAX.
                                 JULIE
                        Really, the MAX? I'm trying to get 
                        a bit more information on exactly 
                        what Boeing and the FAA knew and 
                        didn't know about the potential 
                        safety issues before they approved 
                        the plane?

                                 RICK
                        You mean did they know it could 
                        crash? 

                                 JULIE
                        That's what I want to know.

                                 RICK
                        Of course they knew. They knew and 
                        they purposely hid MCAS from their 
                        customers.

                                 JULIE
                        You're sure?

                                 RICK
                        Yes, I was there ... look, to 
                        understand the way Boeing acts when 
                        it makes any changes to a plane, 
                        you have to understand how the FAA 
                        approves new planes.

                                 JULIE
                        How's that?

                                 RICK
                        By law commercial pilots are only 
                        allowed to fly one type of plane. 
                        The 737, for instance. Southwest 
                        Airlines' entire fleet is 737s, 
                        their pilots only fly 737s. Okay? 
                        So any meaningful changes to the 
                        design of the plane means you have 
                        to retrain all the pilots and 
                        retraining is expensive. You have 
                        to get pilots into simulators, 
                        certify them. Airlines just don't 
                        want to do it. So to ensure there's 
                        minimal retraining they have to 
                        keep any changes within Level-D 
                        simulator training.

                                 JULIE
                        Level D?
                                 RICK
                        There are a number of levels -- 
                        level A being the most exhaustive.

                                 JULIE
                        But the MAX only required Level-D 
                        training, right?

                                 RICK
                        By design. We were under extreme 
                        pressure by Boeing to keep any 
                        changes within Level D. Muilenburg 
                        made a deal with Southwest ... 

           INT. SOUTHWEST OFFICES - DAY

           Muilenburg sits across from Kelly in his corner office. They 
           shake hands.

                                 RICK (V.O.)
                        Muilenburg guaranteed that if the 
                        new 737s required anything above 
                        Level-D training, he would refund 
                        them $1 million per aircraft they 
                        purchased.

                                 JULIE
                        A million dollars per aircraft? 
                        They had dozens of MAXes in their 
                        fleet.

                                 RICK
                        So you can see Boeing had a huge 
                        incentive to keep changes minimal 
                        enough to require only Level-D 
                        training, which also means they had 
                        a huge incentive to bury any 
                        changes that might call that into 
                        question.

                                 JULIE
                        They purposely hid information 
                        about the changes?

                        One of the technical pilots went as 
                        far as to ask the FAA to remove any 
                        reference of the new software 
                        system from the pilot manual.

                                 JULIE (V.O.)
                        That's completely unethical.

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - AS BEFORE

                                 RICK
                        In the end Boeing issued pilots an 
                        iPad training course on the new 
                        plane. It was an hour long.
                            (off her shock)
                        Look, I would never go to bat for 
                        Boeing, but you have to think about 
                        it like this. Sure, we could  
                        demonize everyone involved, but all 
                        of them, everyone from the 
                        engineers to the FAA regulators up 
                        to the CEO -- they were just making 
                        decisions they were supposed to. 
                        They were doing what everyone told 
                        them they should be doing. But the 
                        system isn't built to look out for 
                        the customer or the passenger or 
                        the employee. It's all built to 
                        look out for one person.

           Dominic sits around the table, now their makeshift research 
           center, with Mike Baker and two other reporters including 
           STEVE MILETICH. 

                                 DOMINIC
                        I've got Ludtke on record talking 
                        about how managers pressed 
                        regulators to suppress information 
                        on MCAS. Do we have any more 
                        clarity on what happened with the 
                        sensor?

                                 STEVE
                        We've gone through the 
                        documentation that Boeing submitted 
                        to the FAA before approval.

                                 DOMINIC
                        And?

           Mike starts rifling through pages, finally gets to --

                                 MIKE
                        The original Boeing document 
                        included a description specifying a 
                        limit to how much MCAS could move 
                        the horizontal tail?

                                 STEVE
                        Zero point six degrees.

                                 MIKE
                        Except ... after initial flight 
                        tests they found that they needed 
                        to move the tail more to avert a 
                        high-speed stall.

                                 STEVE
                        They increased it to two point five 
                        degrees.
                                 MIKE
                        That's five times the limit they 
                        told the FAA.

                                 STEVE
                        The FAA had no idea they had 
                        increased the limit. No one did.

                                 MIKE
                        The first time Boeing made any 
                        mention of this to anyone was after 
                        the Lion Air crash, when they had 
                        to come clean about the software.

                                 STEVE
                        So the plane forced them down at a 
                        steeper angle with more speed and 
                        none of the pilots even knew the 
                        software existed.

                                 MIKE
                        They also failed to disclose that 
                        MCAS would repeatedly trigger over 
                        and over even after the pilots took 
                        control. That's why you keep seeing 
                        the system forcing them down, every 
                        five seconds -- on Lion Air it did 
                        it twenty-one times.

                                 STEVE
                        Dom, these pilots never stood a 
                        chance. They were set up to fail.

           Dominic shakes his head, fully upset by the revelation.

                        Yeah. I can do that.

                                 GRACE
                        I heard you need someone from 
                        within the FAA to confirm details 
                        of the regulation process.

                                 DOMINIC

                                 DENNIS
                        You too.

                                 SEAMUS
                        Rebecca, you look lovely.

                                 REBECCA
                        Thank you, Seamus.

                                 SEAMUS
                            (to Dennis)
                        Been meaning to get in touch with 
                        you. Can I have a word?
                            (to Rebecca)
                        You don't mind, do you?

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HALLWAY - DAY

           Seamus and Dennis find a corner where they can talk. 

           ATTENDEES periodically pass by requiring them to hush their 
           voices.

                                 SEAMUS
                        My office has been trying to reach 
                        you -- 

                                 DENNIS
                        Sorry, you know, things have been 
                        busy --

                                 SEAMUS
                        I'm getting pressure from my LPs 
                        about our position -- we're looking 
                        at a double-digit loss for the 
                        quarter. They're getting nervous. I 
                        want to assuage their fears.

                                 DENNIS
                        No reason to worry. We have it 
                        under control.

                                 SEAMUS
                        Dennis, look, I have no official 
                        authority to ask you to do 
                        anything, but as a major 
                        stakeholder in the company, our 
                        fund would like our concerns 
                        addressed.

                                 DENNIS
                        Absolutely -- we're happy to 
                        oblige.
                                 SEAMUS
                        These crashes -- they stand to do 
                        long-term damage to the company's 
                        reputation, which are --

                                 DENNIS
                        The crashes, they're --

                                 SEAMUS
                        Let me finish. 
                            (beat)
                        We still stand by Boeing. No one 
                        wants to see Boeing go out of 
                        business. Boeing represents 
                        everything that's great about 
                        America. Hard work. Innovation. 
                        Craftsmanship.

                                 DENNIS
                        We stand by our values.

                                 SEAMUS
                        But ... we're not going to go down 
                        with a sinking ship ... we will 
                        pull our position if we think 
                        things are going south. I owe it to 
                        my LPs to protect their money.

                                 DENNIS
                        I promise you that our company is 
                        healthy and poised to outperform 
                        the market.

                                 SEAMUS
                        I hope you're right. But I need you 
                        to manage this ... situation.

           Seamus spots someone in the distance, waves.

                                 SEAMUS (CONT'D)
                        You're the CEO. You run this 
                        company. But also don't forget, WE 
                        own it.

           Seamus excuses himself and leaves Dennis standing there.

                                 PETER
                        Adam, thank you for calling me 
                        back.

                                 ADAM
                        No problem. Can you talk now?

                                 PETER
                        Yes, I'm free. Actually, I'm gonna 
                        put you on speaker and have a 
                        colleague join, is that all right?

                                 ADAM
                        Sure, do what you gotta do.

           Peter puts Adam on hold, runs off, passes Julie.

                        Adam, can you hear me?

                                 ADAM
                        Yep, I'm here.

                        I've got my colleague Julie

                        the Boeing stories together.

                                 ADAM
                        Hi, there.
                                 JULIE
                        Adam, thanks for speaking with us.

                                 ADAM
                        Not a problem.

                                 JULIE
                            (flipping through notes)
                        Adam, you were the manager of fuel 
                        systems engineering for the 737 
                        MAX, is that correct?

                                 ADAM
                        That's correct, yes.

                                 JULIE
                        We've already spoken to Rick Ludtke 
                        about his experience but we wanted 
                        to get a broader picture of Boeing 
                        during the FAA certification 
                        process. We need to know how far up 
                        the chain this went.

                                 ADAM
                        Sure, yeah, I can speak to that. If 
                        you want a general characterization 
                        about Boeing's approval process, 
                        I'll say up front that all the 
                        managers -- and this came from the 
                        very top -- 

                                 JULIE
                        Muilenberg?

                                 ADAM
                        You said it. They put massive 
                        pressure on our team to 
                        deprioritize safety to ensure 
                        profits. They saw engineering as an 
                        obstacle, albeit a necessary one, 
                        to their financial success.

                        But you have to understand if 
                        you're going to call Boeing out for 
                        how they made their money, you're 
                        gonna have to take a hard look at 
                        everyone else. And I mean everyone 
                        else.

                        finger and you'll have a bunch of 
                        fucking fingers pointing back at 
                        you. Something like that.

                        We're talking about capitalism at 
                        its heart. The way it's designed, 
                        the system works how it's supposed 
                        to -- it tells individuals make a 
                        buck wherever they can.

                        Ultimately though, whoever holds 
                        the purse strings dictates the 
                        terms of business. This happens 
                        with banks, farms, pillows, 
                        computers, even apple pies.

           Famous company logos we know and love. Amazon. Google. Apple. 
           H&M. Their stock tickers in investment accounts multiplying.

                        The system was designed so well we 
                        hardly even know it's there. That's 
                        why economists call it the 
                        invisible hand. But that invisible 
                        hand can slap you right across the 
                        face if you're not careful. Because 
                        we've seen what can happen when no 
                        one's paying attention.

           BP oil spill. A kid vaping. Flint, Michigan. Assault rifles. 
           School shootings.

                        At the end of the day, the system 
                        doesn't care about you -- it only 
                        cares about how much you're willing 
                        to buy.

           A team of LAWYERS sits around a conference table. Dennis sits

                                 LEAD COUNSEL
                        So what we're recommending is that 
                        you set aside a slush fund for the 
                        victims of the crash.

                                 SECONDARY LAWYER
                        We've already got families of the 
                        victims coming after us for 
                        restitutions -- 

                                 LEAD COUNSEL
                        -- but our main concern is not to 
                        set precedent to let these trials 
                        stand in U.S. courts.

                                 DENNIS
                        What's our liability here?

                                 LEAD COUNSEL
                        We're recommending you set aside 
                        $100 million.

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't want this to draw out. I 
                        want to handle this quickly and 
                        quietly. Any press around this is 
                        bad for us.

                                 LEAD COUNSEL
                        We know.

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't want an extended legal 
                        battle.

                                 LEAD COUNSEL
                        We're gonna do our best to stop it 
                        before it even starts. But if this 
                        opens up in the U.S. courts, we 
                        could be looking at tens of 
                        billions in settlements.

                        struggling with is ... why the 
                        plane wasn't grounded after the 
                        Lion Air crash. Why wasn't there 
                        more of an uproar at the FAA to 
                        step in at that point?

                                 RICK
                        Because the FAA and Boeing are so 
                        intertwined with each other. 
                        Remember that Boeing is one of the 
                        largest U.S. exporters. Every 
                        president, Democrat, Republican, 
                        has made it his priority to see 
                        that Boeing continues to remain 
                        dominant in the global market. 
                        There's substantial economic 
                        pressure to keep them competitive. 
                        Boeing forced Washington state to 
                        give them billions in rebates just 
                        to keep its factory open. It was a 
                        shitty deal, but Inslee had no 
                        choice. Obama touted the Dreamliner 
                        as a huge win for American prowess, 
                        but that aircraft was a mess from 
                        the start. Muilenburg has the oval 
                        office on speed dial. Boeing isn't 
                        just in bed with the FAA, they're 
                        in bed with everyone. How can there 
                        ever be accountability with 
                        something like this?

                                 JULIE
                        Three hundred and forty six people 
                        are dead because of a system they 
                        installed that they knew was 
                        dangerous! And they never mentioned 
                        it once!
                                 (MORE)
                                 JULIE (CONT'D)
                        And after the first crash they 
                        blamed the pilots and the airlines 
                        and they called it freak accident, 
                        but they knew it could happen 
                        again. And it did.

                                 RICK
                        You're right.

                                 JULIE
                        So then where are the handcuffs?

           INT. SEATTLE TIMES CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dominic brings in a cup of coffee, places it in front of --

           Grace, the former FAA agent.

                                 GRACE
                        Thank you.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Thanks for coming in.

           Dominic takes out his notepad and pen.

                                 GRACE
                        I need all of this to remain 
                        completely anonymous. I could get 
                        in a lot of trouble if someone 
                        found out.

                                 DOMINIC
                        You don't have to worry. No one has 
                        to know you came forward.

                                 GRACE
                            (beat)
                        Okay.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Where do you want to start?

           INT. FLIGHT SIMULATOR - DAY

           Mark Forkner sits in a very expensive simulator. He's guiding 
           the plane through a routine takeoff.

           The screens in front of him display terrain, then open sky.

           Things seem to be going normally at first.
           Then, something clicks in the control.

           Mark looks down confused. He hits a few buttons, reads a few 
           meters, then grabs manual control.

           An error reading beeps loudly.

           Auto-pilot kicks in forcing the plane down.

           Mark regains control again. Fumbles to do so.

           Then MCAS grabs hold one more time.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.)
                        Warning, warning. Excess speed. 
                        Warning, warning.

           Mark grabs hold again tries to yank the plane back up. But 
           it's getting harder.

           Another few seconds pass. MCAS kicks back in.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Warning, warning. Excess speed.

           Mark tries to grab hold again. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Don't sink. Don't sink.

           Mark helplessly tries to regain control.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Terrain, terrain. Warning. Terrain. 
                        Pull up. Pull up.

           Mark is getting more and more concerned. Things keep getting 
           worse and worse until --

           The simulator crashes. Mark moves back, totally dumbfounded.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Mark sits alone on his bed, staring out into space. He grabs 
           his phone and starts texting. Texts pop up on screen:

           Mark Forkner 6:50PM
           Oh shocker alertT!
           MCAS is now active down to M .2
           It's running rampant in the sim on me
           at least that's what Vince thinks is happening

           Mark Forkner 6:51PM
           So basically I lied to the regulators (unknowingly)

                                               Patrik Gustavasson 6:51PM
                           it wasn't a lie no one told us that was the case

           Mark Forkner 6:50PM
           I'm levelling off at like 4000 ft, 230 knots and the plane is 
           trimming itself like crazy
           I'm like, WHAT?

           He sets his phone down, looks around. Then he pours vodka 
           from the mini fridge into a glass, downs the whole thing.

           INT. SEATTLE TIMES OFFICE - DAY

           Mike and Don sit in front of a television. Dominic walks up.

                                 DOMINIC
                        What's going on?

           We hear the CNN reporter in the background --

                                 MIKE
                        Feds leaked a text chain between 
                        two of the MAX test pilots from 
                        back in 2016.

                                 DON
                        Looks like the pilots had known 
                        about the MCAS problems back then. 
                        Basically admitted to lying to the 
                        FAA about the system. Said the 
                        system was running rampant.

                                 DOMINIC
                        If that's not a smoking gun --

                                 MIKE
                        They're saying he raised these 
                        concerns to Boeing. To Muilenburg.

                                 DON
                        Everyone at Boeing knew about the 
                        problem. But they didn't want to 
                        risk exposing it.

                                 MIKE
                        This shows a concerted effort to 
                        hide serious flaws.
                                 DOMINIC
                        I just interviewed the FAA 
                        engineer. I think she's the last 
                        piece of the puzzle.

           Off Mike and Don's look at the photo of Mark Forkner on 
           screen and we --

                                                      MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. JFK BOARDING AREA - DAY

           Peter stands watching the same news footage of Mark Fornker 
           on a screen at the gate, his phone to his ear.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, I'm seeing it now. 
                            (beat)
                        I've gotta board, but I'll call you 
                        back when I land in Boston.

           INT. BOEING 747 - DAY

           Peter gets in his seat. He stares ahead at the screen in 
           front of him as the safety video plays.

           The FLIGHT ATTENDANT demonstrates the safety features 
           alongside the video. Peter looks down at his phone 
           screensaver which has a picture of Teri on it. 

           Slowly, every potential hazard starts moving through his 
           mind: sounds of the landing gear, the window, the seatbelt, 
           the wings, building in intensity until --

           EXT. ADDIS ABABA STREET - DAY

           The sound of a gatherers. Footsteps. We catch up to a --

           PROCESSION OF MOURNERS walking through the street toward Holy 
           Trinity Cathedral in the distance.

           A somber mood follows the procession.

                                 ETHIOPIA AIR ATTENDANT (PRE-LAP)
                        We are now prepared to board 
                        Ethiopia Air Flight 302 --

           INT. ADDIS ABABA BOLE AIRPORT - DAY

           Crowds of PASSENGERS wait at the gate.
                                 ETHIOPIA AIR ATTENDANT
                            (over PA)
                        -- with service to Nairobi.

           We move around through the crowd, seeing the faces of those 
           who are about to board the fateful flight.

                                 ETHIOPIA AIR ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
                        We invite those traveling with 
                        small children and anyone with 
                        disabilities to board at this time.

           There's nothing in the air to give these travelers the sense 
           that anything could be wrong. This is another normal day.

           We pass the several faces, and finally, we hear a familiar 
           voice, and we see --

                                 CAROLINE
                        Come on now. We have to board.

           Caroline stands there with Rubi in her arms. Her mother ANN  
           KARANJA grabs hold of Kelli's hand, pulling her alongside.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Ryan, come on! Hurry up.

           Caroline turns to see Ryan rushing toward the seats.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going now?

           Ryan comes running back as the family is about to walk out to 
           the tarmac.

                                 RYAN
                        She left it on the seat.

           Ryan is holding onto a stuffed animal. The same stuffed 
           animal the NTSC Investigator picked up from the crash site.

           The entire family exits through the door and out of our view, 
           disappearing from the world, and we --

                                                     FLASH BACK TO:

           EXT. ADDIS ABABA STREET - DAY

           As we move through the crowd, we realize several of the 
           Mourners are holding onto caskets.

           And finally we see Paul among the mourners, holding photos of 
           his entire family.
           He solemnly continues alongside the rest of the mourners.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. SEATTLE HOME BACKYARD (VARIOUS) - AFTERNOON

           >> A party in full effect. A sign reads HAPPY GRADUATION!

           >> Dominic and Beth squeeze into a photo. Dominic holds a 
           Stanford sweatshirt in front of Beth. 

           >> PARTY GUESTS mingle. Dom watches Beth from a distance, the 
           sort of admiration a father has for his only daughter.

           >> Beth and her FRIENDS all huddle together to take a selfie.

           INT. SEATTLE HOME - NIGHT

           Dominic and Nina clean up from the party. Dominic finds a 
           seat at the dining table, stares off into space as --

           Nina walks in and stands by the doorway, noticing his 
           preoccupation.

                                 NINA
                        What's the matter?

           Dominic gives a non-committal shrug. He looks toward a photo 
           of Beth as a young girl.

                                 DOMINIC
                        How'd she grow up so fast?

                                 NINA
                        It's like we just blinked.

           Something in Dominic's expressions prods at Nina. She stares 
           at him for a beat.

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        It's something else though, isn't 
                        it?

                                 DOMINIC
                        It's just ... it's all of this.

                                 NINA
                        What?

                                 DOMINIC
                        I keep thinking about them -- about 
                        the families.
                                 NINA
                        It's terrible what happened.

                                 DOMINIC
                        None of this is gonna make a 
                        difference.

                                 NINA
                        How can you say that?

                                 DOMINIC
                        We've seen this happen over and 
                        over again, and they always come 
                        out of this all right.

                                 NINA
                        Who does?

                                 DOMINIC
                        Them. The executives, the 
                        politicians, the guys on Wall 
                        Street. All of them. They get to go 
                        around ruining people's lives and 
                        they walk away unscathed. All this 
                        work. All the lies and what they 
                        did. It doesn't matter if we write 
                        about it. They're gonna get away 
                        with all of it.

                        That's not true.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Face it, Nina. That's the world we 
                        live in -- and it's made for them.

           Nina doesn't know what to say.

                                 DOMINIC (CONT'D)
                        Three-hundred-forty-six people 
                        died. All those families -- all the 
                        people on that plane -- I talked to 
                        them, had to look them in the eyes. 
                        They're all broken now. They're 
                        barely even people anymore. It's 
                        destroyed their lives. Mothers, 
                        daughters, brothers, entire 
                        families, killed. They're empty 
                        now. And the people who could've 
                        stopped it, the people who knew 
                        better, who decided that their 
                        lives weren't cost effective -- 
                        they're sitting rich in their 
                        offices.

                        And in all likelihood nothing will 
                        happen to them. They'll get a slap 
                        on the wrist. Maybe.
                            (beat)
                        That's how the system works. Maybe 
                        they lose their jobs. Even if they 
                        do, they'll walk away with 
                        severance packages, millions of 
                        dollars, and those people, their 
                        lives are ruined forever!

           Nina takes this in for a moment.

                                 DOMINIC (CONT'D)
                        I'm just not sure I can take it 
                        anymore.

                                 NINA
                            (beat)
                        You can. You can take it and you 
                        will. You'll do it because it's 
                        inside of you, because it's a part 
                        of who you are. You're the one who 
                        has to fight for them. Because 
                        you're strong and because that's 
                        how you'll get through it.

           Nina puts her hand on Dominic's, reassures him.

                        So did you have any other questions 
                        for me?

           A suitcase is rolled through the terminal. We catch up to --

           Eddy and Jeff who make their way toward their respective 
           gates. As they reach a turnoff --

                                 EDDY
                        This is me.

                                 JEFF
                        See you around.

           They shake as they notice --

                                 EDDY
                        Check it out.

           A group of BOEING EXECUTIVES walk through the concourse.

                                 JEFF
                        That's what butt hurt looks like.

                                 EDDY
                        Sure does.

           After the group passes --

                                 JEFF
                        Give my best to the misses.

                                 EDDY
                        Same to you.

                                 JEFF
                        All right. Safe flight.

                                 EDDY
                        Yeah, safe flight to you too.

           The two of them wave goodbye and are off toward their 
           respective gates. Out of sight. And as we're left in the 
           middle of the airport. 

           Travelers going all sorts of places, getting ready to board

                        Hello?

           INTERCUT OFFICE AND NURSING HOME

                                 JULIE
                        Rick, it's Julie.

                                 RICK
                        Hey, Julie. How are you?

                                 JULIE
                        Good, you?

                                 RICK
                        Good, yeah.
                                 JULIE
                        Story's gonna be published any day 
                        now.

                                 RICK
                        Good timing.

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah.

                                 RICK
                            (beat)
                        Was there something you needed?

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah. One thing I still don't 
                        completely understand.

                                 RICK
                        What is it?

                                 JULIE
                        Can you explain to me why MCAS 
                        relied on a single AOA sensor to 
                        activate? There were two installed. 

                                 RICK
                        It's a great question.

                                 JULIE
                        I mean, I'm not an engineer, but 
                        doesn't it seem like really bad 
                        design to allow one sensor to be 
                        the single point of failure? If one 
                        sensor malfunctions or misreads or 
                        breaks down, then -- I mean, we 
                        know it ended up misreading and 
                        activating MCAS erroneously, so why 
                        not rely on the second sensor to 
                        verify the reading?

                                 RICK
                        You're right. It's bad engineering.
                            (beat)
                        I can't say for certain, but here's 
                        the explanation I can think of. 
                            (beat)
                        Any program coded to take data from 
                        both sensors would've needed to 
                        account for the possibility the 
                        sensors might disagree with each 
                        other. 
                                 JULIE
                        Okay.

                                 RICK
                        The program would need to devise a 
                        contingency for reconciling the 
                        mixed signals. Whatever the 
                        contingency, it would've involved 
                        some sort of cockpit alert. Are you 
                        with me?

                                 JULIE
                        Yes.

                                 RICK
                        An alert in the cockpit would've 
                        required additional training —-
                        probably not Level-D training, but 
                        I doubt anyone wanted to risk that.

                                 JULIE
                            (getting agitated)
                        So they relied on a single sensor 
                        because they didn't want to have to 
                        retrain pilots? And the sensor was 
                        faulty? And that faulty sensor 
                        activated a system that was way 
                        more powerful than they ever told 
                        anyone? And then that system 
                        crashed two planes?

                                 RICK
                        That pretty much sums it up.

                                 JULIE
                            (beat)
                        Wow. I just -- it all seems so 
                        stupid, doesn't it?

                                 RICK
                        It does.

           Julie peeks back inside to see her Grandmother nodding off in 
           front of the television.

                                 JULIE
                        It's like we all assume -- all of 
                        us are under this assumption that 
                        we're being looked after, that 
                        there are people out there trying 
                        to keep us safe, when in reality 
                        ... that's not the case at all.

                                 DOMINIC
                        We have confirmation from the FAA 
                        engineer of the events that went 
                        down during certification. Boeing 
                        buried any mention of MCAS and hid 
                        information from the FAA 
                        regulators. They pressured the FAA 
                        engineers to approve without 
                        oversight. They increased the 
                        degree of the tail adjustment 
                        without any word to anyone. And 
                        after the Lion Air crash, it's 
                        clear they mounted a campaign to 
                        continue to hide information from 
                        the pilots and the airlines.

                        We got a copy of the letter Forkner 
                        sent to Muilenburg about how bad 
                        the system was.

                        This is why we're here -- to hold a 
                        mirror up to their faces, make them 
                        look long and hard, force them to 
                        show who they really are. And 
                        sometimes, if we're lucky, people 
                        will see it when they do.

                        Well, everyone. It's a sad story. 
                        Boeing's stock is trading at a near

                                 PAUL
                        Thank you for allowing me to 
                        testify before you today. My name 
                        is Paul Njoroge and I come before 
                        you with a broken heart. It is not 
                        something that this Committee or 
                        that Congress can fix, but I push 
                        myself every day to try to do 
                        something in the memory of my 
                        family, my entire family that was 
                        killed in the second Boeing crash 
                        in Ethiopia. My wife, Caroline, a 
                        wonderful mother to our children, 
                        and who we talked about getting old 
                        together. Our three children, Ryan, 
                        six years old with the whole world 
                        ahead of him as he dreamed of being 
                        an astronaut one day. Kelli, just 
                        four years old, and the light of
                        everyone’s eye. And little nine-
                        month-old Rubi, a baby who sat on 
                        her mommy’s lap who I wish I could 
                        hold just one more time.
                            (beat)
                        I have nightmares about how they 
                        must have clung to their mother, 
                        crying, seeing the fright in her 
                        eyes as they sat there helplessly. 
                        And there was nothing I could do to 
                        save them. 
                            (beat)
                        My mom in law sat beside them with 
                        tickets I had purchased for them 
                        that was to be a trip of a 
                        lifetime. I paid for plane tickets 
                        that was to be a safe flight. I did 
                        not know all of the information of 
                        which Boeing knew about how 
                        dangerous that plane was, yet the 
                        corporation allowed 157 people to 
                        board that dangerous plane that 
                        could not land safely. I never knew 
                        it would be the last time I would 
                        ever see them.
                            (beat)
                        But I speak for more than myself 
                        who are trying to cope with this 
                        insufferable loss.

                        I speak for all of the families who 
                        lost loved ones whom they will 
                        never see again and who were 
                        tragically torn from their lives 
                        because of reckless conduct on the 
                        part of so many, particularly 
                        Boeing, a company who became 
                        steadfast in its single-minded 
                        quest to place blame on so-called 
                        “foreign pilots.” 
                            (beat)
                        Since the first Max8 crash in 
                        October, Boeing began a pattern of 
                        behavior blaming innocent pilots 
                        who had no knowledge and were given 
                        no information of the new and
                        flawed MCAS system that could 
                        overpower pilots. No manual, no 
                        training, no information was
                        provided to pilots on how that new 
                        MCAS system worked, yet they were 
                        put in those cockpits and expected 
                        to know what to do. Instead of 
                        accepting responsibility and 
                        informing pilots around the word, 
                        Boeing continued its blame game on 
                        pilots, to shift focus from its own 
                        responsibilities until the second 
                        plane crashed. Then the world 
                        turned its focus on those who were 
                        really culpable.

                        It could no longer be denied by 
                        Boeing.

           Paul takes a deep breath. We're left here, with this sobering 
           and heartbreaking picture of one man, who lost everything, 
           his entire family.

           And we have to ask ourselves, will it just be this man who 
           has to pay the price for the negligence and malfeasance of

           Boeing stated that its primary focus was to get the 737 MAX 
           back in the air, but has yet to get it reapproved.

           Boeing. He walked away with an estimated compensation package

           $17 billion in loans and loan guarantees to the U.S. 
           aerospace industry ... in essence to Boeing.
