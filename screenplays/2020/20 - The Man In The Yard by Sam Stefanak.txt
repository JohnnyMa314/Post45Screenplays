           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAWN

           Sunrise over a wheat field, stretching off into the horizon. 
           Thousands of looming stalks stand perfectly still. Unseen 
           crickets chirp their final songs.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (V.O.)
                        Once upon a time, there lived three 
                        little pigs.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING

           The wheat field ends abruptly at A THIN, DIRT COUNTRY ROAD. 
           On the other side of the road, acres and acres of unkempt, 
           six-feet-high, cereal ryegrass grow wildly. 

                                 YOUNG GIRL (V.O.)
                        One day, the pigs decided it was 
                        time to leave their mother’s home. 
                        So, off they went to build houses 
                        of their own.

           EXT. FIELD OF RYEGRASS - CONTINUOUS

           The unmarked road turns and jets onward through the field. 
           Next to the road, the last crooked remnants of WHAT WAS ONCE 
           A BEAUTIFUL OAK TREE reach toward the sky; its remaining 
           limbs gray, bare, and broken.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (V.O.)
                        The first little pig made his home 
                        out of straw. After it was built, 
                        he sat down to eat his dinner, 
                        until he heard a knock on the door.

           EXT. FIELD OF RYEGRASS - CONTINUOUS

           The road dead-ends at a single destination: a fenced in 
           residence. A sign on a METAL GATE reads: “PRIVATE PROPERTY.” 
           Behind it, a gravel driveway winds into the distance.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (V.O.)
                        It was the big... bad... wolf. He 
                        could smell the pig inside.
           EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The driveway leads to A WHITE, THREE-STORY, VICTORIAN 
           FARMHOUSE, surrounded on all sides by endless tall ryegrass. 
           And nothing else. For miles.

                                 YOUNG GIRL’S (V.O.)
                        “Little pig. Little pig. Let me 
                        in,” he growled. “Not by the hair 
                        of my chinny chin chin.”

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house is old, but has been kept in decent shape. The 
           bushes in the yard are in desperate need of landscaping and 
           the potted plants on the porch are all dying.

                                 YOUNG GIRL’S (V.O.)
                        “Then I’ll huff... and I’ll puff... 
                        and I’ll blow your house in!”

           IN THE BACKYARD, a JEEP sits in front of a garage. Behind the 
           garage, a BLUE TARP covers A DAMAGED PICKUP TRUCK; its front 
           end is smashed in and it’s missing the two front tires.

           INT. CHILD’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, ANNIE (6) sits on her bedroom floor and reads “THE 
           THREE LITTLE PIGS” to A SMALL STUFFED PENGUIN. She flips to 
           the next page and eyes its illustration apprehensively: it’s 
           the Big Bad Wolf, teeth snarling, approaching the Little Pig.

           She glances down at her Penguin, considers, then flips back 
           to the page before.

                                 ANNIE
                        But... then the wolf asked really 
                        nicely and the pig said okay and 
                        let him in and they painted water 
                        colors and became best friends.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           CLOSE ON the face of RAMONA (35). She’s asleep, but her eyes 
           are slightly open; in limbo between a restless night and yet 
           another morning.

                                 TEEN BOY (O.S.)
                        Mom.

           Ramona doesn’t wake.
                                 TEEN BOY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Mom?

           Poking his head through her bedroom door, is BEN (14). He 
           holds an XBOX GUN CONTROLLER and has A HEADSET on his head.

                                 BEN
                        Mooooom.

           Getting impatient, he walks to the bed and nudges her--

           Ramona JOLTS awake with a STARTLED GASP. Panicked, she looks 
           around, spots her son, and quickly calms down.

                                 RAMONA
                        (SIGH) Jesus, Ben.

                                 BEN
                        I was gonna let you keep sleeping, 
                        but... the power went out.

           On her bedside table, Ramona notices that her digital clock 
           is blank. No time. Not even a blinking “12:00.” Nothing. She 
           flicks a nearby lamp a few times. Nothing.

                                 RAMONA
                        Wonderful.

           As she sits up, we see that her left arm is in a CAST. She 
           carefully swings her right leg off the bed and straps it into 
           a BOOT CAST. She WINCES from the most subtle of movements. 

                                 BEN
                        Can you um, call the power company 
                        or whatever?

                                 RAMONA
                        Yeah. Yeah, I will.

           A beat. Ramona rubs her eyes.

                                 BEN
                             (delicately)
                        Can you do it, like, soon?
                             (RE: gun)
                        My Call of Duty regiment probably 
                        thinks I got kidnapped.

                                 RAMONA
                        (ANNOYED SIGH) Can I have a minute 
                        to wake up please?

           Ben spots a RED FLANNEL SHIRT tangled in her blankets. After 
           a beat, Ramona tucks it away, embarrassed and vulnerable.
                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Just... give me a minute.

           He stares at her, concerned. She’s getting annoyed.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I’m all right, okay?

           She smiles... and Ben finally leaves. She SIGHS.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The sink RUNS as Ramona SOBS into her hands. As she muffles 
           her crying, we spot a WEDDING RING on her finger.

           On a dime, she stops and turns the water off. She grabs a 
           tissue and dries her eyes, then takes a DEEP BREATH and 
           stares at herself in the mirror.

           She opens the mirror-medicine cabinet and grabs a PILL BOTTLE 
           that reads “PAROXETINE ANTI-DEPRESSANT.” She takes one. 

           In the light from the window, we see that her cast has 
           “ANNIE” written many times in big, sloppy letters and in 
           varying colors. In one spot, tinily written, is “BEN.”

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Using a CRUTCH, Ramona hobbles slowly back into her room. 
           Crutch... step... crutch... step... She grabs her IPHONE from 
           a dresser. It has 1% battery. She types in her password and 
           as it unlocks, it dies immediately.

           She GROANS and plugs it into a charger -- no charge. Duh.

                                 RAMONA
                        Right. (SIGH) Shit.

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                                 ANNIE
                        ...and then the big bad wolf wanted 
                        to play dress up. So--

           Ramona opens Annie’s bedroom door and peeks her head in. She 
           spots the book in her daughter’s hands and smiles.

                                 RAMONA
                             (teasing)
                        The big bad wolf plays dress up, 
                        huh?
                                 ANNIE
                        I changed it ‘cause Penguin doesn’t 
                        like the scary parts.

           Ramona eyes the stuffed Penguin then nods, understanding.

                                 RAMONA
                        Did you sleep in here all night?

                                 ANNIE
                        No. I slept with Ben.

                                 RAMONA
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh. (BEAT) Well, next time, don’t 
                        bug him. If you can’t sleep, you 
                        can come in my bed, okay?

           Ramona smiles. Annie doesn’t.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Outside Annie’s room, Ramona closes the door. She turns to 
           see Ben standing outside of his room, gun controller ready.

                                 BEN
                        Did you call yet? I’m missing out 
                        on killing Nazis.

                                 RAMONA
                        Um, I can’t, actually.

                                 BEN
                        Um. Why?

                                 RAMONA
                             (sheepish)
                        Phone’s dead.

                                 BEN
                        (GROAN) You do realize that cell 
                        phones need to be charged in order 
                        to work, right?

           He aims his gun at her. She swats it away.

                                 RAMONA
                        Hey, you’re lucky you still have 
                        Xbox privileges after that call 
                        from Mrs. Adams yest--
                                 BEN
                        Mom, I told you -- it wasn’t “a 
                        fight!” Mrs. Adams is full of shit 
                        and you know it.

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben, can we not today? Please?

           Relying on her crutch, Ramona heads toward the stairs and 
           slowly begins to descend. She has to carefully put both feet 
           on each step. First step... second step...

                                 BEN
                        Well, I guess I’ll go... read the 
                        Bible like some Amish kid.
                             (then, insinuating)
                        By the way, if you let your son get 
                        his own phone like he asked, we 
                        wouldn’t be in this here pickle.

                                 RAMONA
                        Not now please.

           Third step... fourth step... fifth step...

           Ben rolls his eyes and storms back into his room.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           The stairs end in the first floor foyer, by the FRONT DOOR. 
           It’s a sturdy, wooden door with a large, reliable bolt lock. 

           Eighth step... ninth step...

           Ramona finally finishes her descent of the stairs, wipes a 
           bit of sweat from her forehead, and takes a DEEP BREATH. She 
           readjusts her crutch, and turns into...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...the living room, which is being flooded with white light 
           from three large windows. As she hobbles through the room, we 
           settle on A LARGE FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH above the fireplace. 

           Its subject is A HANDSOME BEARDED MAN kneeling next to a dead 
           ten-point buck. The butt of his REMINGTON 700 HUNTING RIFLE 
           is on the ground and he smiles proudly. Underneath a hunting 
           vest, he wears the same red flannel shirt we saw on Ramona’s 
           bed.

           Ramona avoids looking at the photograph and crutches into...
           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           ...the kitchen. One step in--

           BARK BARK BARK! A LARGE BROWN DOG jumps out of nowhere.

                                 RAMONA
                        Jesus! (ANNOYED SIGH) Charlie.

           CHARLIE, a Rhodesian Ridgeback Pitbull mix (he’s a big dog) 
           wags his tail wildly. Underneath the dog’s right eye is A 
           CUTE TAN SPOT. His COLLAR jingles as Ramona pets him.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Yes, hi. Hi, Charlie, hi.

           Excited and playful, Charlie tries to jump up on her.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Easy, easy!

           She pushes him aside and the chaotic dog bumps into the 
           kitchen table, knocking a POTTED TULIP to the floor -- CRASH!

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Charlie! Come on, boy. Out. Out!

           Charlie runs wildly toward the BACK DOOR. Ramona unlocks it, 
           opens it, and the dog takes off outside.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        (SIGH) Christ, that dog.

           She closes the door again, locks it, and looks at the broken 
           pot, now in two pieces, its dirt spilled all over the floor.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        (GASP) My flower!

           An upset Annie runs in (holding Penguin like always), scoops 
           the tulip into her hands, and starts to tear up.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Mommy, he’s dead!

                                 RAMONA
                        No, no, no. He’s fine. Here.

           Ramona hands her a COFFEE MUG from the cabinet. Annie gently 
           places the flower inside and fills it in with spilled dirt.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        There we go.
           Ramona sets the flower on a windowsill for Annie to see. Its 
           new home reads: “GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK.”

                                 ANNIE
                        That was Daddy’s mug.

                                 RAMONA
                        Mm-hm. It was.

           Ramona stares at the mug longingly, then forces a smile.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        You hungry?

           Annie nods. Ramona grabs a frying pan hanging on the wall and 
           places it on the stove. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (calling out)
                        Ben! You want some eggs?

           INT. KITCHEN - A BIT LATER

           The three of them sit, finishing their breakfast. The fourth 
           chair, at the head of the table, is noticeably empty.

                                 BEN
                        ...then what would make the power 
                        go out if the wires are all buried?

                                 RAMONA
                        (YAWN) Could be a problem at the 
                        plant. Or maybe something got to 
                        the lines?

                                 BEN
                        Like something underground?

                                 RAMONA
                        I dunno. I guess.

           Ben sees Annie is having trouble cutting her bacon. So he 
           grabs her knife and fork and kindly cuts it up for her.

                                 BEN
                        It was probably a Graboid.

                                 ANNIE
                             (immediately concerned)
                        A what?
                                 BEN
                        A Graboid. From “Tremors?”
                             (getting into it)
                        They’re these big... monster worms 
                        that live in the earth... and when 
                        people walk on the ground, they 
                        grab their legs and... YUM!

           On “yum,” Ben snatches a piece of Annie’s bacon and eats it.

                                 ANNIE
                             (annoyed)
                        Mom!

                                 RAMONA
                        Don’t get her all worked up.
                             (to Annie)
                        Relax, baby. Those don’t exist. It 
                        was probably just Bugs Bunny.

                                 ANNIE
                        Who?

                                 RAMONA
                             (incredulous)
                        You don’t know who Bugs Bunny is 
                        either? “Ehh, what’s up, Doc?”

           Annie shakes her head no.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I have failed you as a mother.

                                 BEN
                        What about all those groceries Mr. 
                        Marcus brought yesterday? Is 
                        everything gonna go bad ‘cause 
                        there’s no power?

                                 RAMONA
                        It should be fine if we keep the 
                        fridge closed. So, let’s try not to 
                        open the door much.

           A beat. Ben takes a drink of water.

                                 ANNIE
                        Mr. Marcus smells bad.

           Ben LAUGHS, SPITTING a little water from his mouth.

                                 RAMONA
                        Annie!
                                 BEN
                        He kinda does, Mom. Gotta admit!

           Ben can’t help but CHUCKLE. Ramona shakes her head.

                                 RAMONA
                        Well, don’t mention it to his face. 
                             (downcast)
                        I don’t know how we would’ve gotten 
                        through the last few weeks without 
                        Fred and Nancy, so be nice. (BEAT) 
                        Plus, he’s a veteran, so you have 
                        to be nice to him.
                             (”on the bright side”)
                        And hey, if the power doesn’t come 
                        back by this afternoon... we’ll get 
                        to eat ice cream for lunch.

           Annie’s eyes widen, excited. Ramona smiles, then grabs her 
           plate and starts to get up. Ben notices she’s struggling.

                                 BEN
                        I got it, Mom.

                                 RAMONA
                        No, no. I got it.

           Ben goes to grab Ramona’s plate, but she holds onto it. They 
           “play tug-of-war” with it.

                            BEN
                                                     RAMONA (CONT'D)
           Mom, I got it.
                                              I can get it.

                                 BEN
                             (aggravated)
                        I’m trying to help you!

                                 RAMONA
                        You don’t have to!

                                 BEN
                             (snapping)
                        Let me DO IT!!

                                 RAMONA
                             (recoiling)
                        Okay, fine.

           Ramona lets go. Ben storms to the dishwasher, opens it, and 
           starts to put the plate inside.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        But, since the power’s out, you’ll 
                        have to wash it by hand.
           A beat as Ben reconsiders. Then caves.

                                 BEN
                        Okay fine, you can do it.

           Ben leaves the plate in the sink and exits. Ramona rolls her 
           eyes: Figures. Annie walks to the fridge and opens it.

                                 RAMONA
                        Annie. What did I say?

                                 ANNIE
                        But I want a treat.

                                 RAMONA
                        I said later! Maybe. Close the 
                        door.

           Annie, pouting, does reluctantly.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Uh, Mom? 

           Ramona YAWNS and rubs her eyes, still trying to wake up.

                                 BEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Mom?!

                                 RAMONA
                        Yeah?

           Ben re-enters. He looks concerned.

                                 BEN
                        There’s a man in the yard.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Outside, about a hundred feet from the house, just before the 
           tall ryegrass begins, an OLD MAN sits in a WOODEN CHAIR. 

           A BLACK PORKPIE HAT rests atop a mess of greasy, white hair; 
           its wide brim casting a thick shadow, obscuring his features 
           and making his face a haunting, lifeless blur. Are his eyes 
           open? Is he watching us? 

           His dirty, ragged black suit looks like it belongs in a 
           museum. A LONG BLACK COAT, slightly too big, sits atop a 
           BLACK BUTTONED-DOWN SHIRT and BLACK VEST. TIGHT BLACK SLACKS 
           encase sharp pointy knees. His BLACK LEATHER SHOES are worn 
           in, but clean.
                                 ANNIE
                        Who is that?

                                 RAMONA
                        I... I don’t know.

           His long legs are outstretched in front of him and his bony 
           gray hands dangle from the arm rests, giving him a casual, 
           comfortable, slouch. Like the still grass around him, he 
           doesn’t move at all. Is he breathing? Is he even alive?

           Ramona, Ben, and Annie stare silently out the front windows, 
           each studying the lifeless stranger in their yard.

                                 BEN
                        What a creep.

                                 ANNIE
                        Do you think he’s hurt?

                                 RAMONA
                        I’m uh, not sure.

                                 BEN
                        Well, either way, he’s trespassing 
                        and needs to get off our property.

                                 RAMONA
                        Okay, okay. Calm down.

                                 BEN
                        I should go outside with a bat and 
                        chase him off the yard.

                                 RAMONA
                        No you should not.

                                 BEN
                        Well we gotta do something before 
                        he chops down the door with an axe.

                                 ANNIE
                             (scared)
                        Mom?!

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben.

                                 BEN
                        What? Ex-cuuse me for being 
                        concerned about the scary man 
                        outside.
                                 RAMONA
                        I don’t see an axe, so -- chill.

                                 BEN
                        He could have somethin’.

                                 RAMONA
                        He doesn’t.

           A beat.

                                 ANNIE
                        He could have a grenade.

           Ramona shoots Ben an angry look: “Look what you did.”

                                 RAMONA
                        Annie, I promise you, he does not 
                        have a grenade. (BEAT) And stop 
                        watching your brother play video 
                        games.

           They all continue to stare. He remains perfectly still. 

                                 BEN
                        You think he can see us?

                                 ANNIE
                        I think he’s sleeping.

                                 BEN
                        Really?

           Ben squints, trying to get as good of a look as he can.

                                 RAMONA
                        I don’t think he’s sleeping. He’s 
                        just... not moving. At all.

                                 BEN
                        He almost looks...
                             (afraid to say it)
                        ...dead.

           A macabre beat. 

                                 RAMONA
                        He’s not dead.

                                 BEN
                        All right, I’ll just go throw a 
                        rock at him to be sure.
                                 RAMONA
                        Stop. He’s... resting. He’s 
                        probably very confused.

                                 BEN
                        Why?

                                 RAMONA
                        ‘Cause. Clearly he’s lost. 

                                 BEN
                        Well, lost or not, he’s freakin’ me 
                        out.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah, he’s freakin’ me out, Mom.

                                 RAMONA
                        Will you both relax? It’s a 
                        defenseless old man.

           Another long, quiet beat. 

                                 ANNIE
                        We should call the police.

                                 BEN
                             (pointed)
                        Great idea, Annie. But 
                        unfortunately, we can’t.

                                 ANNIE
                        Why not?

                                 BEN
                        Well, I don’t want to name names, 
                        but a certain Mom of ours forgot to 
                        charge her phone last night and now 
                        it’s out of battery.

                                 RAMONA
                        But it’s perfectly okay because 
                        everything’s fine.

                                 BEN
                             (smart ass)
                        When I get a phone of my own, I’m 
                        gonna keep that thing so charged. 
                        Y’know, in case of emergencies.

           Ramona ignores this. Another beat of uncomfortable silence.

                                 ANNIE
                        Is Mr. Marcus coming today?
                                 RAMONA
                        No. Tomorrow.

           Putting the pieces together of their possibly tricky 
           situation, Ramona nervously bites her lip, then stops 
           herself, trying not to let her face show any concern. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        This man will be long gone by then.

                                 BEN
                        How do you know that?

           Ramona doesn’t answer.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let me go get a bat.

                                 RAMONA
                        I said no.

                                 BEN
                        Okay, how about this? I’ll go 
                        distract him with my story about 
                        that time I threw up at EPCOT... 
                        while you sneak around behind him 
                        and...

           Ben pantomimes “beating someone over the head repeatedly.” 
           Ramona shoots him an annoyed look.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (shrugs)
                        Hey, no bad ideas in brainstorming.

           A beat.

                                 ANNIE
                        Where’s Charlie? Is he still 
                        outside?

                                 RAMONA
                             (under her breath)
                        Shit.
                             (then)
                        Yes.

                                 BEN
                        Nice! When this dude sees a two-
                        hundred pound dog running at him, 
                        he’s gonna be outta here so fast.

                                 ANNIE
                        What if Charlie bites him?
                                 RAMONA
                        A lawsuit is the last thing we need 
                        right now, so for everyone’s sake, 
                        I hope Charlie stays preoccupied 
                        with whatever animal he’s chasing. 

                                 BEN
                        Well, I hope he rips this dude’s 
                        head off.

                                 RAMONA
                        That’s enough.

                                 BEN
                        And the sooner the better too.
                        We don’t want to give him any 
                        chance to break in...

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben.

                                 BEN
                        ...tie us up...

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben!

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                             (can’t help it)
                        ...and eat us.

                                 RAMONA
                             (snapping)
                        STOP IT!

           She nudges him forcefully. Ben recoils.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I have everything under control! 
                        We’re in here, he’s out there, 
                        we’re fine!

           Ramona takes a DEEP BREATH, calming down again.

                                 BEN
                             (timid)
                        Okay, geez. I’m just concerned, 
                        that’s all.

           They all continue to watch The Man In The Yard, as if 
           expecting him to do something at any moment. He doesn’t.
                                 ANNIE
                        I wish Dad were here.

                                 BEN
                        Me too.

           A beat. 

           Ramona looks at her two kids and comes to a decision.

                                 RAMONA
                        I’m gonna go talk to him.

           She hobbles to the couch, plops down and starts putting A 
           BOOT on her left foot. (She keeps her right leg in its cast.)

                                 BEN
                        Uh, what?

                                 RAMONA
                        I’m gonna go outside and I’m gonna 
                        talk to him and you’ll both see 
                        that there’s nothing to be afraid 
                        of. And then we’ll all eat some ice 
                        cream. Deal?

           Ben sticks a finger in his ear and shakes it around wildly, 
           as if to unclog it.

                                 BEN
                        Mom, when’s the last time you 
                        scheduled me an ear appointment?
                        Because it sounded like you just 
                        said you were gonna do the dumbest 
                        thing ever.

           Ramona ignores him and continues tying her boot.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Well, at least take a bat with you!

                                 RAMONA
                        I am not walking out there with a 
                        weapon, Ben. Giving an old man a 
                        heart attack is not on my to-do 
                        list today, all right?

           Her boot now tied, Ramona uses her crutch to stand herself 
           up. She hobbles into the foyer. Everyone follows.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Ramona heads for the front door.
                                 BEN
                        I vote against this plan.

           Ben raises his hand, “voting.” He then grabs Annie’s hand and 
           raises it too.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Annie too.

                                 RAMONA
                        Too bad. I’m in charge.

           Ramona unlocks the front door and opens it. But Ben pushes it 
           closed.

                                 BEN
                        Y’know, technically, I’m the man of 
                        the house now. 

                                 RAMONA
                        You’re fourteen.

                                 BEN
                        Exactly! In some countries, I could 
                        be king!

                                 RAMONA
                        Oh yeah? What countries?

           Ben thinks. He has no idea.

                                 BEN
                        Game of Thrones!

                                 RAMONA
                        Stay here with Annie. 

           Ramona pushes his hand away and exits, closing the door 
           behind her. Ben looks down at his scared sister. 

                                 BEN
                        Don’t worry, I bet he’s just a 
                        Jehovah’s Witness or something.

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s a Jehovah’s Witness?

                                 BEN
                        They’re people who show up at your 
                        house and the only way to get them 
                        to leave is to join their religion.
                             (then, considering/joking)
                        Actually, I hope he’s a murderer.
           He smiles at Annie, trying to lighten the mood, but she 
           remains somber. He gets down to her level, comforting her in 
           a warm tone we haven’t yet seen from him. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey... I know Mom hasn’t really 
                        been “Mom” lately, but I’m here. 
                        And I’m not gonna let anything bad 
                        happen. Okay?

           He grabs Penguin and holds him up.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll look after you, and you look 
                        after Penguin, deal?

           She hugs Penguin, then finally smiles back. Ben makes a silly 
           face, sticking out his tongue and crossing his eyes. Annie 
           does the same. It’s cute.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME

           Ramona takes a few steps onto the front porch. From out here, 
           her view of The Man In The Yard hasn’t changed much. He’s 
           still sitting there, frozen. She walks -- with the use of her 
           crutch -- to the end of the porch.

                                 RAMONA
                             (calling out)
                        Hello? Sir?

           Nothing.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Sir? Can I help you?

           Still nothing. She begins carefully down the porch stairs, 
           one hand on the railing, the other holding the crutch under 
           her armpit. First step... second step... third step...

           She walks into the grass and slowly begins across the yard. 
           Crutch... step... crutch... step...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Ben and Annie watch nervously out the window. 

           EXT. FRONT YARD - SAME TIME

           Ramona slowly approaches The Man. Crutch... step... crutch... 
           step...
           As she begins to get a better view of this stranger, she can 
           finally make out his face under the dark brim. He is awake. 
           And he’s--

           smiling. 

           Crutch... step... crutch... step...

           With each step, his face becomes more and more visible under 
           his hat. A jolly grin shows off long, white teeth. 

           About thirty feet from his chair, Ramona stops. She wipes her 
           brow and readjusts her crutch. Her heart is pounding.

                                 RAMONA
                        Hello?

           A beat. The Man remains frozen, almost as if “on pause.”

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        ...Sir?

           The Man simply stares at her, still grinning.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay? Sir? Can I--

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Good morning, ma dear! 

           The Man speaks with a loud raspy, unsettling Southern drawl, 
           like a disgraced Televangelist with a smoking habit.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Pardon my unannounced arrival. I’m 
                        sure spottin’ me out here in this 
                        manner must have frightened you and 
                        your family.

                                 RAMONA
                        Um. (CHUCKLE) A little actually.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Well, I do apologize. That was not 
                        my intention.

           A beat.

                                 RAMONA
                        Can I help you?

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        I’m so glad you asked. Do you mind 
                        if I come in?
           Ramona thinks, quickly running scenarios through her mind.

                                 RAMONA
                        Um, I... I don’t know about that. 
                        (BEAT) Who are you?

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Y’know, where I’m from -- 
                        Cartersville, Georgia that is -- 
                        the true measure of a household 
                        lies within how they treat a 
                        stranger at their door.

                                 RAMONA
                        Well, around here we don’t just let 
                        anyone into our homes.

           The Man looks Ramona up and down.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        What’s your name?

                                 RAMONA
                             (hesitant)
                        It’s... Ramona. (BEAT) What’s 
                        yours?

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (savoring)
                        Ra-moaaan-ahhhh... Of course it is. 

           The Man’s unrelenting smile grows bigger than ever. Ramona 
           bites her lip, nervous.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        What a wonderful name. Though, I 
                        was taught in school that it’s 
                        proper to address a woman by her 
                        surname. So which do you prefer, 
                        shall I call you “Ramona” or shall 
                        I call you “Missus--”?

                                 RAMONA
                        Just Ramona.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Very well. (BEAT) I meant no 
                        offense. Ramona it is. I only ask 
                        because I noticed that beautiful 
                        ring on your finger.

           Ramona looks down at her wedding ring. She touches it with 
           her thumb, remembering that she had it on.
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Where is your husband this morning, 
                        Ramona?

                                 RAMONA
                        Hunting. He went out hunting.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ah, hunting! Such a rewarding 
                        recreation. I engage in it myself 
                        from time to time. And what is your 
                        husband out hunting this morning, 
                        Ramona?

                                 RAMONA
                        Deer.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Deer?

                                 RAMONA
                        Yes.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Huh. Well isn’t that peculiar. Deer 
                        hunting season in this county 
                        doesn’t begin until October. Or am 
                        I mistaken?

           Shit. She wrinkles her eyebrows, exaggerating her thinking.

                                 RAMONA
                        Right. It was uh, turkey.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        (CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE) Ramona, 
                        that also doesn’t start until 
                        October.

           Shit. Shit. Shit.

                                 RAMONA
                        Squirrel. Fox squirrel.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ah, fox squirrel. I see. So, he 
                        went out to hunt a few fox 
                        squirrels and left his feeble wife 
                        alone with two young children to 
                        care for? And in her current 
                        condition? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Now, what 
                        kind of a man does that? Clearly 
                        one whose momma didn’t raise him 
                        right.
           A beat as Ramona stares deep into his beady, unblinking eyes.

                                 RAMONA
                        What the hell do you want?

           For the first time, his grin vanishes. A scowl of 
           disappointment spreads from his forehead to his skinny lips.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Now that ain’t any kind of way to 
                        talk to a guest.

                                 RAMONA
                        You’re not my guest.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (aggravated)
                        And you’re a terrible liar. You’re 
                        not married. Well, you were, 
                        clearly, but you’re not anymore. 
                        Are you?

           Like it never left, The Man’s grin returns.

                                 RAMONA
                        When he finds you here-- 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Passed recently did he? Shame. If 
                        you don’t mind my asking, how did 
                        he die?

                                 RAMONA
                        If you’re not off my property in 
                        sixty seconds, I’m calling the 
                        police.

           Ramona turns around to head back, but--

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Did it have anything to do with 
                        that damaged pickup truck behind 
                        your garage?

           She turns back around to face him, grief-stricken. He smiles 
           wide, as if he somehow already knows the whole story.

                                 RAMONA
                        He... he had an accident.

           The Man and Ramona stare deep into one another’s eyes for a 
           long beat. He tilts his white head, intrigued by her answer.
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Did he, now?

           She SWALLOWS, then nods ever so slightly.

           The Man shakes his head, as if disappointed at Ramona.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        How unfortunate.

           Ramona stares at The Man, frozen with fear and hatred.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        At least you survived the crash. 
                        Save for those injuries to your leg 
                        and arm, you’re just right as rain, 
                        huh?

           Ramona doesn’t say anything. The Man pities her.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        But now... when you hobble up and 
                        down the stairs of that enormous 
                        three-story house every morning -- 
                        like a pathetic cripple -- you 
                        curse the person that put you in 
                        that ugly condition, don’t you?

           Tears well in Ramona’s eyes. Tortured, she nods slowly.

                                 RAMONA
                        ...Yes.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        That’s what I thought.

           A tense beat. The Man then looks down at Ramona’s casts.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        “Annie.”

           Realizing that her children’s names are all over her casts, 
           she panics and tries to cover them up, but it’s impossible.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Aw, young Annie had quite a field 
                        day signing your casts, didn’t she? 
                        Adorable. And “Ben.” Named after 
                        his father perhaps?

                                 RAMONA
                        You keep my children’s names out of 
                        your goddamn mouth.
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ben appears to have only signed the 
                        one time. And so small? He wasn’t 
                        too keen on signing at all, was he?

           Ramona glances down at “BEN” on her cast.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, have things changed 
                        between the two of you? Since the 
                        accident, I mean. Young boys tend 
                        to be so close with their fathers. 
                        (BEAT) Ever get the feeling that he 
                        wishes you had died in that 
                        accident instead?
                             (shrugging playfully)
                        (CHUCKLES) Kids.

                                 RAMONA
                        Get out of my fucking yard.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Oh, Ramona... I’m so sorry to tell 
                        you this but... (CHUCKLES) If you 
                        had any plans for today, you should 
                        go on ahead and cancel ‘em.

           Ramona looks around frantically, searching for something.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                             (feigned concern)
                        What is it? Whatcha lookin’ for? 
                             (”eureka”)
                        Oh, I know! You’re wondering where 
                        Charlie the dog has run off to.

           Her eyes widen, shocked. Oh my god.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Surely he should be running up here 
                        aaaaaaannny moment to chase me from 
                        your property. Well...

           From behind his back, The Man reveals a thin piece of fabric; 
           parts of it, dark red. He tosses it in front of him and 
           Ramona hears a recognizable JINGLE as it hits the ground.

           Even at this distance, she notices a shiny silver tag, where 
           the name “CHARLIE” is now covered in blood.
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        And right about now you’re 
                        wondering whether or not you can 
                        drive a stick shift with your leg 
                        in that cast. Maybe. (BEAT) But let 
                        me just save you the trouble before 
                        you drag Ben and little Annie out 
                        of the house...

           The Man leans forward as if to tell her a secret.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Your Jeep ain’t gonna start.

           He winks.

                                 RAMONA
                        ...W-w-why are you here?

           The Man’s grin grows larger than ever, becoming an unnatural 
           expression that no human face should be able to form.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        I was invited.

                                 RAMONA
                        By... by who?

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Well... by you, Ramona. 

           Ramona stares at him, not understanding.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Every evening, after you kiss your 
                        children goodnight, you lie 
                        restless in that big empty bed, all 
                        alone... and beg for me.

           On Ramona’s confused face, we...

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE

           Unable to sleep, Ramona lies on the right side of her king-
           size bed. The left side, noticeably empty. In her hands, she 
           clutches her husband’s red flannel shirt...

                                                         BACK TO SCENE:
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (sinister)
                        You need me, don’t you?

           Horror-struck, Ramona can only stare at this bizarre 
           stranger, terrified and confused. 

                                 RAMONA
                        ...What are you gonna do... if I 
                        let you in?

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        What do you think I’m gonna do... 
                        if you don’t?

           As the same violent thoughts race through both their heads 
           simultaneously, he cracks an excited grin. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Well? Whatta’ya say?

           Ramona turns and quickly hobbles back toward the house. She 
           hurries across the yard, BREATHING HEAVILY. 

           Crutch-step-crutch-step... Even at her fastest, she’s rather 
           slow. 

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           First step, second step, third step. Ramona shuffles across 
           the porch, reaches the front door -- but stops. 

           For a long beat, she’s frozen. Her hand clutches the 
           doorknob... her heart beats out of her chest... her face is 
           nothing but a panicked, blank stare... 

           Then, she TAKES A DEEP, CALMING BREATH, and turns the handle.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens and Ramona re-enters. Ben and Annie are 
           standing there.

                                 BEN
                        Well? How’d it go? Who is he? 

           Face-to-face with her two children, Ramona masks her concern. 
           For a long awkward beat, everyone is silent.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Mom? ...What’d he say?
           Ramona opens her mouth to speak... but can’t.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Tell me you at least asked him 
                        where he got that dope hat.

           She eyes her son and young daughter...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...Mom?

           ...and puts on a brave face.

                                 RAMONA
                        Everything’s fine. No need to 
                        worry. Perfectly harmless. He’s 
                        just... confused. Alzheimer’s, 
                        Dementia, definitely something.

           She hobbles into the living room...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...and looks out the window. The Man is still sitting there, 
           motionless, same as before.

                                 BEN
                        Did he say anything?

                                 RAMONA
                        He did.

                                 BEN
                             (”go on”)
                        ...What was it?

                                 RAMONA
                        He uh... he thought I was his 
                        nurse.

           A beat. Ramona avoids eye contact with them.   

           Are they going to buy it?

                                 ANNIE
                        His nurse?

                                 RAMONA
                        Yeah. So, he probably wandered over 
                        here from John the Twenty-Third. At 
                        least, that’s my best guess.

           Another beat.
                                 BEN
                        John the Twenty-Third? You mean, 
                        the old folks’ home by the high 
                        school?

                                 RAMONA
                        It’s a uh... an assisted living 
                        center, yeah.

           Ben thinks, wrinkling his brow, not buying it.

                                 BEN
                        Isn’t that place like... half an 
                        hour away?

                                 RAMONA
                        As soon as the power comes back on, 
                        I’ll call them and let them know 
                        he’s here.

           Ramona peeks outside -- The Man still hasn’t moved. Then, 
           masking her worry, she gives her children their marching 
           orders as confidently as she can:

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        So -- we’re all just gonna stay 
                        inside today. The front door is 
                        locked, the back door is locked. 
                        And under no circumstances are we 
                        going to open them. Okay?

           Ramona flashes Annie a reassuring smile. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Ice cream?

           Annie nods. Ramona takes her by the hand. 

                                 BEN
                        Mom, wait.

           Ramona ushers Annie into the kitchen, then stays behind per 
           Ben’s request. He and Ramona are now alone.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        What’s going on? You can tell me.

           A beat as she stares at her son...

                                 RAMONA
                        There’s nothing to tell.

           ...then exits into the kitchen.
           Ben looks down and notices that Ramona’s boot and cast have 
           left dirt stains on the nice carpet. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie sits at the table. Ramona grabs some bowls, spoons, and 
           two pints of ice cream.

                                 RAMONA
                        Vanilla?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes.

                                 RAMONA
                        Yes what?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes please.

           Ramona scoops the ice cream into two bowls and WHISTLES A 
           HAPPY TUNE, as if nothing is wrong whatsoever.

                                 RAMONA
                        One for Annie. Two for mom.
                             (calling out)
                        Ben? Ice cream? 
                             (then)
                        Ooo! Wonder if we have any 
                        chocolate syrup.

           She opens the fridge and sees some.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        We do!

           Ben enters, arms crossed, skeptical.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (to Ben)
                        Want some?

           A beat.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Ben?

                                 BEN
                        Okay, let me make sure I got it 
                        straight: this hundred year-old 
                        lookin’ dude escaped from his 
                        nursing home... walked like, thirty 
                        miles... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        found a wooden chair along the 
                        way... and just plopped down in our 
                        yard?

                                 RAMONA
                             (dodging the subject)
                        Uh, I dunno, I guess. Vanilla or 
                        mint chocolate chip?

                                 BEN
                        What’s his name?

           Ramona is trying desperately to ignore Ben.

                                 RAMONA
                             (to Annie)
                        Chocolate syrup?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes please.

                                 BEN
                        His name, Mom. Did he tell you his 
                        name?

           Ramona gives Annie her ice cream.

                                 RAMONA
                        (ANNOYED SIGH) No, he didn’t tell 
                        me his-- 

                                 BEN
                        Then how are you gonna check with 
                        the nursing home to see if he lives 
                        there?!

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben, I--

                                 BEN
                        So you’re just gonna call them up 
                        and say, “Hi, have you lost any of 
                        your old people recently? ‘Cause I 
                        got one in my yard. No, I don’t 
                        know his name, but hey, can you 
                        come pick him up anyway?”

           Ramona opens her mouth to say something... but has nothing.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        “Oh, and I’m sure he’s pretty ripe 
                        from his journey, so bring a few 
                        extra pairs of Depends!”
                                 RAMONA
                        Christ, Ben. Look, he...
                             (searching)
                        ...he told me he lives at John the 
                        Twenty-Third. Should I believe him 
                        or not?

                                 BEN
                             (perplexed)
                        Wait, wait, wait. He told you he 
                        lives there?

                                 RAMONA
                        Yes!

                                 BEN
                        But like... ten seconds ago you 
                        said you thought that’s where he 
                        came from!

                                 RAMONA
                             (growing frustrated)
                        No, I didn’t. I said--

                                 BEN
                        Yes you did! 

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben, I said--

                                 BEN
                        Mom, you said it was your best 
                        guess!

                                 RAMONA
                        DROP IT!

           A beat. Ramona stares at him angrily. 

           Ben doesn’t let up:

                                 BEN
                        I think you should get Dad’s gun.

           Annie GASPS.

           Ramona grabs a bowl from the counter and SMASHES it on the 
           floor. It shatters, sending sharp pieces all over the 
           kitchen. Ben and Annie recoil.

                                 RAMONA
                        Go to your room.
                                 BEN
                             (incredulous)
                        What?

                                 RAMONA
                        Go. To. Your. Room.

           A tense beat. Ben and Ramona stare one another down.

                                 BEN
                        (SCOFF) No.

           He exits into the living room as Annie starts to CRY.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Ben turns an arm chair around to face the window. He slumps 
           down in it, “on guard.” He stares at The Man In The Yard, who 
           still hasn’t moved at all.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Ramona SIGHS and rubs her eyes. She then grabs a broom from a 
           closet and begins to sweep up the tiny pieces of bowl. 

           Annie CRIES HARDER.

                                 RAMONA
                        Stop crying.

           She doesn’t.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Annie, if you don’t stop crying, 
                        I’m gonna take away your ice cream.

           At that, Annie stops crying on a dime and takes a big bite. 
           Ramona continues to sweep.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Ben watches out the window, pissed. He then glances up at the 
           photo above the fireplace, looking longingly at his father. 

           After a beat, he looks back outside.

           On The Man, sitting perfectly still in his chair, we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           THE EARLY AFTERNOON

           The sun is now high in the sky and The Man hasn’t moved an 
           inch. 

           Ramona is trying desperately to make today as normal as ever. 
           She and Annie are playing CHUTES AND LADDERS. Annie rolls the 
           dice and gets a “FOUR.”

                                 ANNIE
                        Four.

           She moves her piece four spaces and lands on a ladder.

                                 RAMONA
                             (playful)
                        Ooo, you got a ladder!

           Annie moves her piece up the ladder. She’s winning by a lot.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Dang, you’re good at this game. 
                        What’s your strategy?

                                 ANNIE
                             (shrugging)
                        I dunno, I just... roll the dice.

           Ramona LAUGHS.

                                 RAMONA
                        “Roll the dice.” I should try that. 
                        Okay, Mom’s turn.

           Ramona grabs the dice, briefly peeks out the window at The 
           Man -- yep, still there -- and then rolls. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Three.

           Ramona moves her piece three spaces. No ladder, no chute.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (teasing)
                        Hey, I rolled the dice like you 
                        said. How come I didn’t get a 
                        ladder?

                                 ANNIE
                             (shrugs)
                        Stuff happens.

           Ramona LAUGHS again.
                                 RAMONA
                        “Stuff happens.” That’s true! All 
                        right, Ben, you’re up.

           Across the room, Ben still sits in his chair, staring out the 
           window, still “on guard.”

                                 ANNIE
                        Ben, your turn.

           Another beat. He ignores them completely.

                                 RAMONA
                        Oh-kay, looks like I’ll roll for 
                        your brother... again.

           She rolls.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Three.

           She moves Ben’s piece three spaces. It lands on a chute.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh. Sorry, buddy.

                                 ANNIE
                        Ben, you got a chute.

                                 BEN
                        I’m devastated.

           Annie grabs the dice next. She rolls and one of the die 
           tumbles off the table and onto the floor. She bends down to 
           retrieve it--

           there’s A SPIDER.

                                 ANNIE
                        (GASP) Spider!

           Annie immediately leaps onto the couch, as Ben springs from 
           his chair.

                                 BEN
                        Whoa, look at that thing.

           The spider takes off quickly across the floor and Annie 
           SHRIEKS at it’s speed. Ben observes, slightly fascinated.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a Wolf Spider.
                                 ANNIE
                        Get it, get it!

                                 BEN
                        Okay, relax.

           Ben runs into the kitchen... and returns with an EMPTY GLASS.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll put it outside.

           Ben carefully creeps toward the spider, glass upside down, 
           ready to trap it. He calmly leans over... and slowly lowers 
           the glass... right on top of--

           WHAM! A LARGE BOOK is dropped on the spider, smashing it. 

           Ben looks up. Ramona did it.

                                 RAMONA
                        Got him.

           She sits back down on the couch.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Still your turn, Annie.

           They resume their game. On Ben’s aggravated face, we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER IN THE AFTERNOON

           Ben sits in his chair, but now he slouches a bit, rather 
           bored. Likewise, The Man is -- you guessed it -- still in the 
           same position out in the yard.

           Annie and Ramona now color with crayons. A few childish 
           drawings scatter the coffee table. Ramona draws a sunflower 
           while Annie draws the exterior of their house.

           Ramona watches as Annie grabs a black crayon and scribbles a 
           DARK STICK FIGURE sitting outside their house. In swirling 
           motions, she gives him a large, wide hat.

           Annie stops, gets up, and heads toward the kitchen.

                                 RAMONA
                        Where you goin’?

                                 ANNIE
                        I want some water.
                                 RAMONA
                        Okay. Just... come right back.

           Ramona flashes a smile as Annie exits. Once her daughter’s 
           gone, she closes her eyes and take A LONG, AND MUCH-NEEDED, 
           DEEP BREATH. 

                                 BEN
                        Mom, I just had a pretty good idea.

           He turns around in his chair to face her.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t we drive over to the 
                        Marcus’? 

           Ramona bites her lip.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That way, we can use their cell 
                        phone to call the old folks’ home 
                        and get this old geezer off our 
                        yard even faster. Bada-bing, bada-
                        boom, I’m a genius.

           Ramona holds up her casts.

                                 RAMONA
                        I can’t drive stick like this. You 
                        know that.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah...
                             (has all the answers)
                        ...but I can. 

           He smiles, proud of himself. 

           Ramona starts to shake her head no--

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Dad used to let me drive 
                        the Jeep up and down the driveway 
                        all the time!
                             (begging)
                        It’s ten minutes away and all on 
                        country roads!

                                 RAMONA
                        No.

                                 BEN
                             (aggravated)
                        Mom! Why not?!
                                 RAMONA
                        Because one, you’re not old 
                        enough...

           Ben lets out a LOUD, OVER THE TOP GROAN.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        ...and two there’s something wrong 
                        with the Jeep. I don’t know what it 
                        is, but I gotta take it in.

           A beat. Ben is completely bewildered.

                                 BEN
                        Really? With the Jeep? 

                                 RAMONA
                        Yeah, it’s not starting, I don’t 
                        know.

                                 BEN
                        Since when? I helped Dad replace 
                        the starter in March and there’s no 
                        way the battery is--

                                 RAMONA
                        I said no!

           Ben GROANS and turns back around, pissed. He slumps in his 
           chair like the teenager that he is.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        We’re staying right where we are. 
                        Inside. End of discussion. 
                        Everything’s fine. Stop trying to 
                        “save the day.”

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                             (under his breath)
                        You’re a bitch.

           She heard him.

                                 RAMONA
                        What did you say?

           Another beat.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (stern)
                        Ben. What did you--
                                 BEN
                        I said you’re--

           AHHHHHH!! It’s Annie SCREAMING from the other room. Ben and 
           Ramona jump up immediately, run towards the kitchen...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           ...and look O.S. at Annie. On their horrified faces we...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON Annie’s bare foot, sitting on the table. A SHARP, 
           TINY PIECE OF CERAMIC sticks out of her heel. It’s bleeding. 
           Ramona inspects it. Ben too.

                                 RAMONA
                        It’s a little cut, baby.

                                 ANNIE
                             (through tears)
                        It’s a piece of the bowl!

           Ramona feels terrible.

                                 RAMONA
                        I have some tweezers upstairs.  
                        Let’s go clean it out and we can 
                        put a band-aid on it. Kay?

           Annie nods. She grabs Ramona’s hand and they start to leave.

                                 BEN
                             (snide)
                        Way to go, Mom.

           She ignores him and exits with Annie. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           As they walk through the living room to reach the stairs, 
           Ramona briefly peeks out the window. 

           The Man still hasn’t moved.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Now all alone, Ben glances toward the back door, where, on a 
           small hook, are a set of CAR KEYS.
           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Ramona and Annie both hobble up the CREAKING stairs.

                                 ANNIE
                        I got a little blood on the stairs.

                                 RAMONA
                        That’s okay. It’s just blood.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           A beat as Ben listens to them go.

           Once he’s sure they’re on the second floor, he quietly 
           unlocks the back door and grabs the car keys. 

                                 BEN
                             (to himself, skeptical)
                        Something wrong with the Jeep, huh?

           He goes to leave, but then gets an idea. He turns around, tip-
           toes to the BASEMENT DOOR, opens it, reaches down the 
           stairwell... and grabs A BAT.

           Bat in hand, he exits silently out the back door.

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben shuts the door, then creeps through the backyard toward 
           the driveway. He carries the bat at his side, holding it near 
           the middle, like he’s seen in action movies.

           He steps over a COILED UP GARDEN HOSE as he comes to the 
           corner of the house. Eyes on the Jeep, he stops. It’s about 
           fifty feet away, parked by the garage. But in order to get 
           there, he’ll have to walk in plain sight of The Man In The 
           Yard. 

           A beat. He takes a DEEP BREATH... then goes for it. 

           He rounds the corner and walks briskly toward the garage. To 
           calm his nerves, he talks under his breath, all the while 
           keeping his eyes glued on The Man, a hundred or so feet away.

                                 BEN
                             (sotto)
                        Hey there, ya old bastard. How’s it 
                        goin’? Don’t mind me, just walkin’ 
                        to my Jeep.

           He holds his bat in the air, showing it to The Man.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        Yep, got a bat here. And I know how 
                        to use it too. That’s right, I hit 
                        two dingers over the fence last 
                        season. (BEAT) Sure, technically, 
                        one was a foul ball, but it still 
                        went over the fence, fuck you.

           Ben reaches the Jeep. Without ever taking his eyes off The 
           Man, he takes out the keys, unlocks the door, and...

           INT. JEEP - CONTINUOUS

           ...gets in. He puts the key in the ignition and turns it. 

           Nothing.

           He then remembers -- he has to push in the clutch -- and does 
           so with his left foot. He turns the key again.

           Still nothing.

                                 BEN
                        Hmm.

           He tries again and again and again, all while keeping an eye 
           on The Man.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Ramona puts a band-aid on Annie’s foot. 

                                 RAMONA
                        There we go. Feel better?

           Annie nods.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Good. Maybe it’s best we put some 
                        shoes on, huh?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah.

           Ramona grabs Annie’s hand.

                                 RAMONA
                        Baby, I didn’t mean for you to step 
                        on that. I’m sorry.
                                 ANNIE
                        It’s okay. It was an accident.

                                 RAMONA
                             (smiles)
                        Right. “Stuff happens.”

                                 ANNIE
                        Like when Daddy crashed.

           Ramona’s smile slowly fades.

           A beat.

                                 RAMONA
                        Right.

           INT. JEEP - SAME TIME

           Ben’s still trying to start it. No luck.

                                 BEN
                             (frustrated)
                        Come on. Come on, you piece of 
                        shit. (GROAN)

           He finally stops. He SIGHS, then pulls a lever near the 
           steering wheel, popping the hood. He gets out...

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...and walks to the front of the Jeep. For the first time 
           since he’s walked outside, he turns his back to The Man in 
           order to open the hood and inspect the engine.

           He looks inside -- a single, long, deep gash has severed the 
           car’s motor into two worthless hunks of jagged metal. The 
           Jeep’s engine has been sliced in half. 

                                 BEN
                        ...The fuck?

           He backs away and quickly turns around--

           The Man’s chair is empty.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit.

           He raises his bat in the air. His eyes dart around the 
           property: the fields... the driveway... the backyard... 
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, 
                        oh shit.

           ...the garage... the empty chair... back to the fields... 
           back to the empty chair...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Shoot. Shoot. Shit shit shit.

           Bat high and ready, BREATHING HARD, Ben walks cautiously and 
           very slowly back towards the house. Suddenly--

           CRACKLE! He GASPS and turns toward the unsettling noise--

           it’s just the tarp over top of the crashed pickup truck being 
           RUSTLED BY A GUST OF WIND.

           His eyes always moving, Ben turns the corner into the 
           backyard. He quickens his pace and, not looking where he’s 
           going, trips on the garden hose--

           and slams into the ground -- THUD! -- dropping the bat. It 
           rolls away in the grass.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        (PAINED GRUNT) Shit!

           He gets up, and--

           bumps right into Ramona. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Ahh!
                             (then)
                        (RELIEVED SIGH) Jesus, Mom.

           Furious, she grabs him by the shirt and pulls him inside.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Ramona and Ben enter. She’s pissed. She SLAMS the door behind 
           her and locks it.

                                 RAMONA
                        What the hell do you think you’re 
                        doing?! I told you to stay in the 
                        house!

           Ben’s not having any of it.
                                 BEN
                        Yeah? You know what else you told 
                        me?! That everything was fine! 
                        Guess what -- it isn’t!

           Ben turns to Annie.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Somebody hacked up the Jeep’s 
                        engine so now we can’t drive 
                        anywhere!
                             (to Ramona)
                        Yeah! I just went and looked! Gee, 
                        I wonder who that could have been!

           Ben, fuming, storms to the living room...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...and points out the window.

                                 BEN
                        Him!

           The Man is now back in his chair, same as before. Ben storms 
           back into the kitchen...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           ...and gets right in Ramona’s face.

                                 BEN
                        But you already knew that, didn’t 
                        you?

           Ramona doesn’t say anything. Her expression is an odd mixture 
           of guilt and anger.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (knowingly)
                        And where has Charlie been all day, 
                        Mom? Huh?

           Annie eyes her mother skeptically.

                                 ANNIE
                        ...Mom?

                                 RAMONA
                             (small)
                        He’s outside.
                                 BEN
                             (pointed)
                        Hmm. He’s sure been outside for a 
                        long time, hasn’t he?

                                 RAMONA
                             (RE: Annie, quietly)
                        Ben, please. 

           Ben shakes his head, storms past her and unlocks the back 
           door.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           He opens it...

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        HEY!

           ...and pokes his head out.

                                 BEN
                             (calling out)
                        Charlie?!

                                 RAMONA
                        BEN!

                                 BEN
                        Char--lie?! Come here, boy! 
                        (WHISTLE)

           Ramona tries to shut the door, but Ben uses his foot to keep 
           it open.

                                 RAMONA
                        Shut the door!

                                 BEN
                        What? I’m just trying to get 
                        Charlie back inside!
                             (calling out)
                        Here, boy! Want a treat?!

                                 RAMONA
                        Close it!

                                 BEN
                             (calling out)
                        Char--lie!

           Using all her strength, Ramona finally shoves Ben away from 
           the door and SLAMS it closed.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (insinuating/pointed)
                        Why don’t you care about where 
                        Charlie is, Mom?

                                 RAMONA
                        Keep. The door. Locked.

                                 BEN
                        He could be hurt! Maybe I should go 
                        look for him.

                                 RAMONA
                        EVERYONE’S STAYING INSIDE!!

           Ramona locks the door.

           A tense beat. Ben stares daggers at his mother. 

                                 BEN
                        He’s dead, isn’t he?

           Annie GASPS.

           Ramona says nothing. 

           Ben shakes his head, disappointed.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been telling us, over and 
                        over, that you have everything 
                        under control. But you don’t, do 
                        you, Mom?
                             (to Annie)
                        All day long, she’s done nothing 
                        but lie to us.
                             (to Ramona)
                        Right?

           A tense beat.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Admit it!

           She can’t.

                                 RAMONA
                        I’m... trying to protect you.

                                 BEN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Well, you’re doing a really good 
                        job. 
           Ben crosses his arms.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know why we should listen 
                        to you anyway. You’re on crazy 
                        person pills.

           Ouch.

           Ramona SLAPS Ben hard across the face. 

           He rubs his cheek and stares at her, shocked. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I should have done this a long time 
                        ago.

           He storms out of the kitchen, a man on a mission... 

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - SECONDS LATER

           ...and STOMPS quickly up the stairs.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Hearing her son head up to the second floor, Ramona realizes 
           exactly what he’s doing. Oh no.

                                 RAMONA
                             (panicked)
                        Ben! BEN! STOP!

           She hurries after him.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Ben storms down the long hallway, enters Ramona’s room...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...and opens her closet door. He shoves aside hanging clothes 
           to reveal a TALL, THIN, BLACK SAFE. He eyes its keyhole.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Ramona crutches through the living room with urgency.

                                 RAMONA
                        BEN! DON’T YOU DARE!
           She turns the corner and...

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           ...hobbles up the stairs in desperate haste. 

                                 RAMONA
                        GET OUT OF THERE!

           First step second step...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Ben throws open Ramona’s dresser drawers, searching. He digs 
           around frantically, tossing clothes, jewelry, and other 
           possessions onto the floor.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Meanwhile, as things escalate inside the house... out the 
           window... The Man sits there, as calm as can be.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Fourth step fifth step sixth st-- 

           Ramona’s crutch slips and she BANGS her bad knee hard against 
           the wooden stair. She GRUNTS, hurt.

           Her crutch TUMBLES down the stairs and CRASHES into the front 
           door. It lies on the foyer floor.

           Ramona grabs her knee, grimacing in pain.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Ramona’s things are scattered about the room. Ben searches 
           the last dresser drawer. Nothing yet. Frustrated, he turns 
           and spots her bedside table. He yanks its drawer open and 
           starts digging.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Ramona’s hurt, but continues up the stairs without her 
           crutch.

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben!
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Ben pulls his hand from the bedside table drawer. He holds a 
           SILVER KEY.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Ramona, BREATHING HARD, reaches the second floor. She hops 
           down the hallway toward her bedroom.

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben, please!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Downstairs, Annie walks to the front window, grabs the sill, 
           and looks out at The Man In The Yard. 

           The Man raises his long arm and waves at her playfully. 

           She backs away from the window, scared.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Ramona hurries toward her bedroom. She’s almost there-- 

           her door swings open and Ben steps into the hallway. Ramona’s 
           worst fear has come true -- her son is holding THE REMINGTON 
           700 HUNTING RIFLE; one hand firmly on the barrel, the other 
           on the trigger.

           At the sight of the gun, she GASPS.

                                 RAMONA
                        No!

           Ben tries to walk by her, but Ramona grabs the gun with both 
           hands. They “play tug-of-war” with the weapon. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Put that back!

                                 BEN
                        Give me it!

           Ben shoves the gun forward, thereby pushing his mother 
           backward down the hallway.

                                 RAMONA
                        Put it back!
                                 BEN
                        Let go!

           She doesn’t, she holds it tight, but continues to step 
           backwards against her will. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I said let go!

           Ben pushes her closer and closer to the top of the stairs.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (furious)
                        MOM!

           Because of her leg cast, Ben is winning. Ramona’s foot is 
           just inches from the stairs. She realizes this.

                                 RAMONA
                        Wait, stop!

           But he keeps pushing. They glare at one another; resentment 
           in Ben’s eyes, fear in Ramona’s. 

                                 BEN
                        LET GO!

           She squeezes even tighter. So he pushes more... and more... 
           until her boot heel hangs over the ledge of the stairs.

                                 RAMONA
                             (scared)
                        Ben... Ben, no...

           He’s won. He could shove her down the stairwell... 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           ...but he doesn’t. He yanks the gun around, swinging Ramona 
           away from the ledge. 

           Instead of pushing her down the stairs, he redirects her 
           further into the hallway. And with one hard shove, Ben tosses 
           his mother into the bathroom...

           INT. BATHROOM/INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           ...she loses her grip on the rifle, and is sent flying 
           backward, falling down. She BANGS her head on the bathtub. 

           She lies on the floor, hurt and in a daze, MOANING. The 
           plaster cast on her arm, now cracked from the fall.
           Ben clearly feels terrible, but presses onward.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry, Mom, but... if you’re 
                        not gonna protect this family, then 
                        I will.

           As his mother writhes in pain, he closes the bathroom door. 
           He hurries into his bedroom. 

           He returns quickly with a LONG EXTENSION CORD. 

           Inside, Ramona rubs her head. It’s bleeding a bit. She gets 
           up very slowly.

                                 RAMONA
                        (MOANING) Ben... put it back...

           Ben takes the extension cord and wraps it tight -- in a 
           figure eight formation -- around the bathroom doorknob and 
           the doorknob of the bedroom next to it, effectively “locking” 
           his mother inside.

           Ramona finally stands herself up and tries the door. She 
           turns the knob and pulls on the handle -- but it won’t open.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Ben?

           She tries pulling again. Still won’t open.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Ben! Open the door.

           She pounds her fist -- BANG-BANG! -- on the door.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Open it!

           Ben watches as the extension cord holds tight amidst his 
           mother’s attempts to escape.

                                 BEN
                             (to himself)
                        Sorry, Mom.

           He picks up the rifle and heads down the stairs.

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        Open the door!

           BANG-BANG-BANG!
                                 RAMONA (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                             (muffled)
                        Open the goddamn door!

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Ben walks down the stairs and approaches the front door. (We 
           hear Ramona POUNDING throughout.) 

           He takes out a BOX OF AMMUNITION from his pocket. He removes 
           a BULLET from the box, opens the chamber of the rifle and 
           sees-- 

           It’s already loaded.

           He eyes the bullet already inside, bewildered: Why is this 
           loaded? Who loaded it?

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Ben?

           Ben looks up to see his sister, clutching her penguin, 
           scared. 

                                 BEN
                        Don’t worry. Dad showed me how to 
                        use it. 

           He puts the bullet back into the box, closes the chamber of 
           the rifle, and, after a bit of effort, COCKS it. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s just like Call of Duty. 
                             (under his breath)
                        Theoretically.

           He makes a goofy face at her again... but she doesn’t make 
           one back. He unlocks the front door and exits. 

           Hearing the sound of her mother’s MUFFLED YELLS, Annie looks 
           up the stairs.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH/YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Ben SLAMS the front door and walks toward the edge of the 
           porch. He eyes The Man In The Yard, still in his usual spot.
                                 BEN
                        All right, asshole! Listen up! The 
                        United States government says I 
                        have the right to blast any 
                        intruder that trespasses on my 
                        property! Penal Code four, article 
                        a-hundred and six, section... uh, 
                        seventy. (BEAT) So I’m gonna give 
                        you ten seconds to get outta here 
                        before I blow your head off! 

           He raises the rifle to his shoulder.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Merica, bitch!!

           Ben adjusts the gun, remembering as best he can the form his 
           father taught him. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        One!

           Nothing.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Two!

           The Man doesn’t move at all.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Three!

           Ben looks through the scope, aiming right at his head.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Four! 

           Still nothing.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Five!

           The Man moves. He places his hands firmly on the arm rests 
           and pushes himself upward, slowly standing from the chair.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Six!

           When he’s finally upright, The Man is well over six feet 
           tall. Taken aback by his towering height, Ben is shook.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Seven!
           Keeping his head down and his face covered by his hat, The 
           Man takes a large step forward towards the porch. Then 
           another. Then another. Then another and another...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (alarmed, flustered)
                        Ei-eight!

           With each wide step, The Man’s towering height becomes more 
           and more clear. (Seven feet tall?) Ben blinks erratically: 
           “Am I imagining things?”

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        NINE!

           The Man is now twenty feet from the porch and shows no signs 
           of stopping. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I said “nine,” you piece of shit! 
                        Don’t make me pull this trigger!

           About ten feet away, The Man stops on a dime and lifts his 
           head, revealing his large beady eyes and unsettling smile.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (pleasant)
                        You must be Ben!

           Despite standing on the ground below the porch, The Man’s 
           head is somehow even with Ben’s. Ben stares in disbelief at 
           The Man’s abnormal height and lanky limbs. Was he always this 
           freakishly tall? 

                                 BEN
                        I will shoot you!

           The Man playfully raises his hands up in a surrender.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (chuckling)
                        I believe ya, son, I believe ya! I 
                        don’t doubt your responsibility to 
                        protect your home. In fact, I 
                        respect it. After all, it’s your 
                        job now, ain’t it? You’re the man 
                        of the house!

                                 BEN
                        Damn straight.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Daaaamn straight! Now that’s the 
                        right attitude!

                        that don’t mean it can’t be fun. 
                        Right? 

           He winks at Ben.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Though, I do wonder -- and don’t 
                        take this personally -- whether you 
                        actually have it in ya to shoot a 
                        defenseless old man.

                                 BEN
                        I’ll do it! Watch me!

           The Man looks Ben up and down, observing his stance.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Feet shoulder width apart... left 
                        leg slightly forward... butt of the 
                        weapon up against your right 
                        shoulder. That’s good form there, 
                        Ben. 
                             (big smile)
                        I take it you’ve gone huntin’!

                                 BEN
                        You sure smile a lot for a guy 
                        who’s about to have his head blown 
                        off.

           The Man CHUCKLES.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        It appears hospitality never made

                        Yeah, once.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Your daddy take ya?

           Another beat.

                                 BEN
                        Yup.

                        Rabbits.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        And did you kill any rabbits on 
                        your hunt, Ben?

           A long beat. 

           The Man finally gives Ben a look: “...Well?”

                                 BEN
                        No.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        No? Why not?

                             (embarrassed)
                        Didn’t... didn’t get a good shot.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Didn’t get a good shot. Your daddy 
                        kill any?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ah, so your daddy killed a rabbit; 
                        his son did not. Daddy did; son did 
                        not. How many did your daddy kill?

                                 BEN
                        Um. Nine or ten.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Nine or ten?! Goodness me, that’s 
                        one hell of a haul! So your daddy 
                        shot nine or ten rabbits on your 
                        hunt and you didn’t shoot any? Not 
                        one? Not a single one?

           Ben doesn’t answer. The Man pounces on this.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Did ya maybe... get cold feet?

           Silence from Ben. The Man’s grin grows wider.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Had one riiiiight in your sights...

                                 BEN
                        No. No, he said it was okay, we’d 
                        go again. He said next time--

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        But there never was a next time... 
                        was there?

           A long beat.

                                 BEN
                        No.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Shucks.

           The Man begins to casually stroll around perpendicular to the 
           porch, his hands behind his back. No matter where he goes, 
           Ben keeps the rifle aimed right at him.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        I always loved huntin’. Still do! 
                        Back home -- in Leflore County, 
                        Mississippi -- I used to hunt wild 
                        geese. You see, what you do when 
                        you’re huntin’ wild geese is you 
                        get yourself a little whistle. And 
                        when you blow it -- after much 
                        practice, of course -- it makes the 
                        sound of a goose. You get them 
                        geese to come to you! 

           Ben doesn’t move.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Hell, using that whistle, you can 
                        get those stupid creatures to do 
                        just about anything you want. Got 
                        pretty good at it myself. I swear, 
                        hand to God, with your eyes closed, 
                        you’d have thought I was an actual 
                        goose! After awhile, I didn’t even 
                        need the whistle! Just used the 
                        mouth the good Lord gave me. 
                        Imagine that.

           The Man’s grin slowly fades. He stares deep into Ben’s eyes.

                             (sinister)
                        See, what I like to do... is keep 
                        the wind at my back... let my prey 
                        get a whiff of me. Let ‘em know I’m 
                        comin’. Puts the fear in ‘em.

           The Man begins to slowly walk toward Ben, his beady eyes open 
           abnormally wide.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)

                        last line of defense. The instinct 
                        of every living creature. 

           Ben can only stare, practically hypnotized.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        When it fears for its life... a 
                        beast of flesh and blood will do 
                        the craaaaziest things. 

           He can’t look away from The Man’s sunken eyeballs.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Trickin’ an animal to come to you 
                        is one thing, but takin’ your 
                        time... trackin’ it... seein’ where 
                        it sleeps... toyin’ with it... 
                        watchin’ it panic... and then, when 
                        you got it trapped--

           The Man SNAPS his fingers. The loud sound makes Ben jump a 
           bit.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Mm-mm-mm... That’s huntin’.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG! Ramona continues to POUND on the door.

                                 RAMONA
                        Annie?! Annie, are you there?! Open 
                        the door!

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           On the other side of the door, Annie silently watches as the 
           extension cord holds taut despite Ramona’s best efforts.
                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        Hello?! Annie?! LET ME OUT!

           BANG-BANG-BANG!

           On Annie, unsure what to do...

           EXT. FRONT PORCH/YARD - SAME TIME

           The Man’s face is now only a few feet from the end of the 
           rifle. He stares right down the barrel at Ben, unafraid.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Wanna learn how to hunt like that? 
                        I could teach ya, Ben. I could show 
                        you how to finally kill the rabbit. 
                        (BEAT) All you gotta do... is let 
                        me come in.
                             (enormous beam)
                        Whatta’ya say? 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           BANG-BANG-BANG! Annie continues to stare at the bathroom 
           door. 

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        Annie! ANNIE! 

           EXT. FRONT PORCH/YARD - SAME TIME

           The Man awaits a response. Ben, rifle still firmly in his 
           hands, stares blankly at the stranger’s gaze.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        ...Well?

                                 BEN
                        No.

           The Man’s smile fades. He bares his teeth, and GROWLS 
           QUIETLY.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Why not, Ben?

                                 BEN
                        Because you killed my dog.

           He readies the rifle.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        And now I’m gonna kill you.

           The Man is taken aback.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (insulted)
                        I did what?

                                 BEN
                        You killed Charlie!

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Lord, I don’t know who would put 
                        such an awful idea into your head.

           The Man raises his index finger and thumb to his lips. He 
           blows a QUICK PIERCING WHISTLE.

           BARK! BARK! 

           Ben turns toward the noise and sees -- on the other end of 
           the yard, walking out of the ryegrass, is Charlie the dog. 
           Around his neck, his collar hangs as clean as it was before.

                                 BEN
                             (shocked)
                        ...Charlie?
                             (then, calling out)
                        Come here, boy! Charlie!

           The dog doesn’t move. His tail doesn’t even wag. He stays 
           obediently in the yard.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Charlie!!

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Your mother lied to you. She’s 
                        trying to turn you against me. Are 
                        you gonna let her?

           INT. BATHROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Ramona tugs hard on the doorknob to no avail. Out of both 
           breath and options, she stops, defeated.

                                 ANNIE
                        Mom?
                                 RAMONA
                             (elated)
                        Annie!! Annie, I need your help! 
                        Can you open the door?

           A beat. Ramona realizes why she’s not helping.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (remorseful)
                        Baby, I’m sorry I lied to you. I 
                        just...

           Annie stares at the door. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want you to worry. So I 
                        made up something else.

           Ramona remembers something Annie said earlier.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I changed the scary parts.

           A beat. 

           Annie looks down at Penguin, then begins untying the 
           extension cord knot.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (relieved)
                        Yes, baby! Hurry, hurry!

           EXT. FRONT PORCH/YARD - SAME TIME

           The dog stands oddly still in the yard.

                                 BEN
                        Come here, boy!

           Ben then notices the tan spot underneath Charlie’s left eye. 
           Wait... his left eye?

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (suspicious)
                        ...Charlie?

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        You wanna know what else your 
                        mother lied about? (BEAT) The night 
                        of the accident -- y’know, when you 
                        lost your daddy?

           Ben lowers the rifle, giving The Man his full attention.
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        She told you he was driving, didn’t 
                        she? 

           Ben nods.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                             (shaking his head)
                        Nope.
                             (whisper)
                        She was. Your mother crashed that 
                        truck. She killed your daddy.

           After a beat, Ben storms back into the house.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                             (snide)
                        My condolences, by the way.

           The Man’s devilish smile returns.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           A deranged Ben enters, SLAMS the door closed, and locks it. 
           He glares up the stairs with disgust.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Annie almost has the figure-eight knot untied. 

           On the other side of the door, Ramona pulls on the knob, it 
           can now open a few inches -- she’s almost free.

                                 RAMONA
                        Almost there, baby!

           Ramona reaches her hand around and undoes the rest of the 
           knot herself. She pulls again... the door opens and--

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Yes!

           the barrel of the rifle is shoved right in her face.

           She GASPS.

           Ben, a crazed look in his eye, aims the rifle at Ramona. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        What... what are you doing?
                                 BEN
                             (upset)
                        Is it true?!

                                 RAMONA
                        Is what true?

                                 BEN
                        You told me Dad crashed the truck.

           Oh no. Ramona SWALLOWS, caught.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You said the roads were wet and he 
                        lost control of the wheel.

           Ramona retreats backward as Ben walks toward her.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        But you were lying, weren’t you?

           On Ramona’s guilty face...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Downstairs, the living room is empty. 

           Outside, we hear the call of a WILD GOOSE in the distance: 

           SQUAWK!

           ...SQUAWK! SQUAWK! 

           Then the distant sound of an unfamiliar, yet calming voice...

                                 MAN’S CALMING VOICE (O.S.)
                             (faint)
                        Annie... Annniiieeee...

           A beat.

                                 MAN’S CALMING VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Annie, are you there?

           Another beat. Annie’s head slowly pops up from behind the 
           couch. She looks toward the window, confused.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Ramona eyes the rifle nervously.
                                 BEN
                        What happened that night, Mom? What 
                        happened the night Dad died? Can’t 
                        you be honest with me? For once?

           Ramona bites her lip.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (angry)
                        Tell me the truth!
                             (then, pleading)
                        Please.

           A long beat. 

           Ramona collects herself, takes a BREATH, EXHALES... and 
           finally admits to her son what she’s avoided telling him for 
           weeks.

                                 RAMONA
                        We left dinner that night and... 
                        we’d both been drinking. But since 
                        I’d only had two glasses of wine, I 
                        made Dad give me the keys, and...
                             (struggling)
                        ...and I drove home. (BEAT) When we 
                        turned onto Lake, the wheel just... 
                        got away from me, I dunno, and... 

           A tear rolls down her cheek.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        ...we slid off the road... and the 
                        truck flipped.

           On Ben’s angry face...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 MAN’S CALMING VOICE (O.S.)
                        Annnnniieeeee...

           Annie creeps toward the window and slowly peers outside.

           In the distance, standing on the edge of the yard, is A 
           HANDSOME, FAMILIAR LOOKING, BEARDED MAN. He looks identical 
           to the hunter from the framed photograph above the fireplace, 
           except his dark hair is parted on the opposite side.

                                 ANNIE
                        ...Daddy?

           Seeing Annie, his face lights up. He waves.
                                 DAD
                        Hey, baby girl!

           Even though the window is closed and he’s far away, Annie can 
           hear her dad’s welcoming voice as clear as day. 

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Aw, I’ve missed you.

           A beat as the hesitant Annie can only stare, wide-eyed.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ve...
                             (smiles)
                        ...missed you too.

           Transfixed, she slowly waves back. Her dad grins.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           The rifle’s still in Ramona’s face.

                                 RAMONA
                        When I woke up in the hospital, the 
                        police told me we’d hit a patch of 
                        black ice and that my blood alcohol 
                        level was well under the limit, 
                        so... it wasn’t technically my 
                        fault, but...
                             (ashamed)
                        ...it was. I know it was. 

           A tear rolls down Ben’s cheek.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I survived. He didn’t. (BEAT) And I 
                        can’t stop asking... 

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE

           We pick up where the last flashback ended. Ramona holds the 
           flannel shirt to her face and smells it. Her face contorted 
           in grief, she silently begins to WEEP...

                                                         BACK TO SCENE:

                                 RAMONA
                        ...why?

           A beat.
                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I lied because... I already hate 
                        myself. I didn’t want you to hate 
                        me too.

           Ben lowers the rifle and hugs his mother tight.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Annie -- her small hands on the sill, eyes still wide -- is 
           practically hypnotized by the image of her father.

                                 DAD
                        Hey, guess what!

                                 ANNIE
                        What?

                                 DAD
                        I got you something. A gift.

                                 ANNIE
                        What is it?

                                 DAD
                        Well, I can’t tell you, that’d ruin 
                        the surprise. (BEAT) You want it?

           A beat. She considers.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        ...Well? Do ya?

           Annie nods. “Dad” smiles wide.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Then you’re gonna have to unlock 
                        the door.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Ramona and Ben stop hugging. It’s back to business:

                                 RAMONA
                        He’s trying to turn us against each 
                        other. We can’t let him, okay? I 
                        need you on my side.

           Ben nods, then remembers:
                                 BEN
                        Mom, I saw Charlie. Only... it 
                        didn’t feel like him.
                             (putting it together, but 
                              confused)
                        I think he was... backwards. 
                        Like... like, in a mirror.

           On Ramona’s concerned look...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 DAD
                        Open the front door for me, will 
                        ya, Annie? Pleeeeease?

           Annie nods, excited, and walks into the foyer...

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           ...she reaches for the door lock -- stepping up on her tippy 
           toes -- and turns the bolt, unlocking it.

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        Let me in, Annie...

           She then twists open the door knob and--

           a gust of wind BLOWS the front door wide open. It SLAMS 
           against the wall.

           The wind WHIIIIIIPS through the foyer, blowing Annie’s hair 
           wildly in all directions, finally snapping her out of it.

           Standing on the edge of the porch, just a few feet away, is 
           The Man In The Yard; his long slender body completely still; 
           his head down; his face covered by his hat.

           Annie SCREAMS.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Ramona and Ben hear the scream and run out.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Annie runs up the stairs...
           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           ...right into Ramona’s arms. 

                                 ANNIE
                        He’s coming! He’s coming!!

           The three of them take off down the hallway...

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           The Man walks into their house, ducking his head down to pass 
           under the doorway. Once inside, he stands up straight -- the 
           top of his hat only inches from the ceiling. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (pleasantly)
                        Anybody home?

           On his wide, victorious grin...

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Ramona, Ben, and Annie -- as quietly as they can -- enter a 
           room and close the door.

           INT. OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           They’re in a small room with a desk, some books, etc.

                                 RAMONA
                             (whisper)
                        We’re gonna be okay. But only if we 
                        stick together.

           Ramona sits in a chair and quickly begins taking off her leg 
           cast. She points to a pair of mens’ boots in the corner of 
           the room.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        Grab me dad’s boot.

           Ben grabs THE LARGE RIGHT BOOT and hands it to her. She 
           shoves her cast aside and puts the boot on. As she quickly 
           ties the laces tight, she looks at the rifle in Ben’s hands.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        Where are the rest of the bullets?
           Ben remembers, and SIGHS. Pissed at himself, he shakes his 
           head no: “I don’t have them.” Ramona bites her lip.

                                 BEN
                             (whisper)
                        What do we do?

           Now wearing one of her boots and one of her husband’s -- and 
           no longer restricted by her leg cast -- Ramona stands up, 
           recharged and determined, but still clearly terrified. She 
           ties her hair back in a tight ponytail.

           On her nervous face, thinking fast...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The dark, towering figure enters, again ducking his head down 
           to pass under the archway. He slowly walks around and, using 
           his thin, pointy fingers, touches anything he can: the coffee 
           table... Chutes and Ladders... the crayon drawings... the 
           fireplace... and the framed photos on the mantel.

           CLOSE ON his fingers as they pass over school portraits... 
           the family on vacation... Ramona and her husband’s wedding...

           The Man’s finger stays on the happy newlyweds. He stares -- 
           almost sympathetically -- at the bride and groom. He then 
           notices a FUNERAL PRAYER CARD, leaning against the frame. 
           It’s from the groom’s recent service.

           With his finger, he taps the face on the prayer card.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           The office door opens. Ramona peeks out.

                                 RAMONA
                             (whisper, to Ben)
                        Go.

           Ben tip-toes towards the bathroom and grabs the extension 
           cord (from earlier) still lying on the floor. As he does, 
           Ramona looks down the opposite end of the hallway...

           ...at the ATTIC ENTRANCE on the ceiling.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Giant black boots step slowly on the linoleum. Massive pale 
           hands slide gently across the fridge... the counter... and 
           the cabinets.
           He sees Annie’s tulip on the windowsill. With one finger, he 
           gently touches its petals.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Underneath the attic door, Ramona reaches up and grabs THE 
           HANGING PULL CORD. She pulls on it and begins to lower the 
           ladder.

           A few inches down, the door CREAKS. Everyone freezes.

           A long beat. Silence. She starts to pull again. Once it’s low 
           enough, Ben unfolds the ladder to the floor. Ramona forces 
           Annie to climb up.

                                 RAMONA
                             (whisper)
                        Go, baby.

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME TIME

           The Man enters. He stands at the head of the table. He closes 
           his eyes... takes a DEEP BREATH... and squeezes the back of 
           the chair. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Ben ties the extension cord around the fourth rung of the 
           attic ladder, just above the hinge of the bottom section. 

           Above him, Ramona climbs into the attic.

           INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           STORAGE BOXES and VARIOUS JUNK fill the dark space. (It’s not 
           a liveable room; it’s storage.) Two small windows are the 
           only sources of light. Ben climbs up next, rifle in hand.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Having done a full circle of the first floor, The Man, taking 
           his sweet old time, begins up the stairs, each step CREAKING 
           LOUDLY.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (calling out)
                        My, you have such a lovely home!
           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Ben and Ramona stand above the entrance and pull on the 
           extension cord, thereby raising the ladder back up, and 
           folding it in the process. It CREAKS slightly. 

           They hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. Hurry, hurry.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           As The Man reaches the second floor, the attic door behind 
           him closes up into the ceiling just in the nick of time. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ramona? Ben? Little Annie? Come 
                        out, come out, wherever you are.

           He looks around, then enters the closest bedroom. Down the 
           hall, out of his sight, the attic pull cord dangles back and 
           forth.

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Ben and Ramona use the extension cord to “lock” the attic 
           closed, similar to how Ben locked the bathroom. He loops it 
           through the ladder and passes it off to Ramona. She loops it 
           around a wooden beam and passes it back to him.

           He ties it into a knot.

           INT. BEN’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           The Man looms in Ben’s doorway. He then extends his arms and 
           begins to feel the surfaces of Ben’s messy bed... his 
           dresser... his TV... a photo of Ben and his dad fishing... 

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Their “lock” now secure, Ramona, Annie, and Ben huddle 
           together in a corner of the room, breathing quietly, not 
           moving a muscle. 

           They can hear the LOUD FOOTSTEPS of the large man below them.

           INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Long white fingers slither across the roof of a doll house... 
           a plastic tea set... a glass jar filled with cowrie shells...
           Enjoying this, A QUIET, RUMBLING MOAN escapes his throat:

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Mmmmmmm...

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           They listen to The Man’s MOANING below.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                        Mmmmmmmm... Ahhh... 

           Ramona holds Annie close.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ANGLE ON Ramona’s bed. The DARK SILHOUETTE OF A LARGE MAN 
           grows over the messy white sheets.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        MMMMMMmmmmmm...

           The Man stands at the foot of the bed. He closes his eyes, 
           takes a DEEP BREATH -- sniffing? -- and SLOWLY EXHALES... 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                             (calling out)
                        Ramona... Ra-moooaaann-ahhh. 

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Huddled in the darkness, they can only listen.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                        I’m here, Ramona. I’m heeeeeeeere. 

           Ramona wrinkles her brow, still unsure what he means. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Just like you waaaaantedddddd.

           Annie looks at her mother, confused. Ramona shakes her head 
           no, trying to assure her daughter.

           Ben spots something nearby and gets an idea. They whisper.

                                 BEN
                        Mom.

           He points to A BOX. It reads “FIREWORKS.”
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        We can send a signal. 

           Ramona debates.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Like a flare gun. The Marcuses 
                        might be able to see it from their 
                        house. 

           She shakes her head.

                                 RAMONA
                        It’s still light out, they’d never 
                        be able to.

           Ben SIGHS, annoyed. 

           Then, his face lights up with a better idea.

                                 BEN
                        Then let’s start a fire.

           He points again to the box of fireworks. Relieved, Ramona 
           nods, almost cracking a smile.

                                 RAMONA
                        Now that’s a signal.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The dark, towering figure exits Ramona’s room. His long 
           fingers wiggle eagerly like the legs of a tarantula.

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Ben has all the fireworks out of the box and spread out on 
           the floor. There are a few rockets, a box of sparklers, one 
           roman candle, and a bunch of big cherry bombs. He begins 
           twisting two fuses together.

           Behind him, Ramona and Annie silently dig through nearby 
           boxes. Ramona finds a ROLL OF DUCT TAPE. Annie continues 
           searching for something.

                                 RAMONA
                             (whisper)
                        Anything?

           Annie shakes her head no. Ramona points to a box that reads 
           “CAMPING.”
                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        That one.

           Annie looks in it. Ramona then starts quietly (and very 
           carefully) crumbling up OLD NEWSPAPER...

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           The Man creeps slowly down the hall, like a parent playing a 
           friendly game of hide-and-seek with their kids. 

           He playfully peers into the bathroom...

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ramona? ...Ben?

           ..then into the office.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Little Annie?

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Ben continues to twist fuses together, creating one enormous 
           fuse, connecting all the different fireworks. Ramona puts her 
           crumbled newspaper balls into the box of fireworks.

           Annie finds something in the camping box.

                                 ANNIE
                             (whisper)
                        Mom.

           She tip-toes over to Ramona. Ramona grabs it and holds it in 
           the light. It’s A UTILITY LIGHTER.

                                 RAMONA
                             (whisper, relieved)
                        Yessss.

           She kisses Annie on the forehead.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Still walking down the hallway, The Man approaches the attic 
           entrance on the ceiling. 

           Right underneath it, he stops.
           He slowly tilts his head upward and notices it. He grins a 
           grin so wide it can barely fit on his white, gaunt face.

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Ben flicks the lighter, lights the fuses, and places the lit 
           fireworks back into the box (now filled with newspaper). 
           Ramona seals it closed with a strip of duct tape as we hear 
           the CRACKLING FIREWORK FUSES inside.

           Box in hand, Ben walks to the attic window, opens it, and... 

           EXT. HOUSE / INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           ...leans outside. Eyeing the distance from here to the field, 
           he realizes that this isn’t going to work...

                                 BEN
                        Shit.

           ...and begins climbing out the window onto the roof.

                                 RAMONA
                        The hell are you doing?

                                 BEN
                        I’ll never be able to throw it over 
                        the backyard from in here. 

           Ben carefully places one foot on the (very) steep roof 
           outside. As he lifts his other leg out, Ramona grabs the 
           fireworks box, preventing him from continuing. (Despite 
           whispering, things between them are as heated as ever.)

                                 RAMONA
                        You’re gonna fall.

                                 BEN
                        I won’t.

           She pulls on the box.

                                 RAMONA
                        Get back inside now.

           He gets in her face.

                                 BEN
                             (RE: box)
                        Mom. We don’t have time for this.
           A beat as Ramona listens to the MUFFLED CRACKLING of the 
           firework fuses in her hands. She bites her lip. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I can do it.

           Ramona just can’t bring herself to let go.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Do you want me on your side, or 
                        not?

                                 RAMONA
                        I do, but--

                                 BEN
                        Then prove it.

           She stares into her son’s eyes... then finally lets go of the 
           box and Ben climbs all the way outside. 

           The roof he now stands on is alarmingly slanted. He takes a 
           few steps toward the ledge... looks out into the fields... 
           prepares himself and, with one arm... heaves the box.

           It flies through the air... over the backyard... and lands 
           with a HARD THUMP in the field of tall ryegrass.

           Ben carefully climbs back inside where he, Ramona, and Annie 
           all look out the window, watching. They wait with bated 
           breath. Will it work?

                                 RAMONA
                             (sotto)
                        Come on, come on, come on.

           Annie hears something behind her. Thud... thud... thud... She 
           turns toward the noise and sees that it’s the attic door, 
           opening a few inches over and over. 

           Someone is trying to open it.

                                 ANNIE
                             (whisper)
                        Uh, Mom...

           But Ramona is preoccupied watching the box out in the field. 
           Finally... BOOM. CRACK. SNAP. 

                                 BEN
                        Come on, come on.

           The muffled explosions continue. The box bounces with each 
           one until -- BOOM! 
           -- it explodes completely, sending sparks, shredded cardboard 
           and lit newspaper flying. The pieces of ignited newspaper 
           float through the air; landing delicately in the tall grass. 

           After a beat, a patch of the field ignites. A SMALL FIRE has 
           started. Ben pumps his fist in celebration. A RELIEVED SIGH 
           from Ramona.

                                 RAMONA
                        Thank you, God--

           THUD! Ramona turns and realizes that The Man is pulling hard 
           on the attic door.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                        HelllooOOOoooo...

           She grabs Annie and holds her close. Another hard pull on the 
           door. Then another. Everyone eyes the extension cord lock. 
           Please hold. Please hold.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Are you up there?

           EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME

           Meanwhile, the fire blazes in the ryegrass.

           A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE begins to rise into the sky. 

           Their distress signal has been sent.

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           The Man continues to pull on the attic door -- THUD, THUD -- 
           but because of the extension cord, he can only open it a few 
           inches. 

           Annie looks at her mom, scared.

                                 RAMONA
                             (mouthing silently)
                        Don’t. Move.

           The Man pulls again -- THUD -- and this time, his right hand 
           squeezes through the small opening. The hand feels around 
           blindly, but everyone is safely out of its limited reach.

           Ramona looks at her children and puts her finger to her 
           mouth: “Quiet.”
           The Man begins to squeeze his entire arm into the attic. 
           Ramona, Ben, and Annie then watch in horror as the skinny arm 
           keeps coming...

              ...and coming...

                  ...and coming...

           It grows longer and longer. Ramona’s jaw drops. What the 
           fuck?

           The Man’s arm is now ten feet long. 

           Panic sets in. With a wider range of motion, the hand 
           continues to feel around. Ramona and the kids back up as far 
           as they can; Ben on one side, the girls on the other. But the 
           long arm just keeps coming...

                            ...and coming...

                                ...and coming...

                                    ...anndd coommiinngg...

           His arm is now fifteen feet long. 

           The unnaturally long arm reaches around blindly, clawing at 
           boxes and knocking things over, feeling for its prey.

           More of the arm keeps coming -- twenty feet long now -- as it 
           heads toward Ramona and Annie. Ramona pulls her daughter 
           behind a kayak that leans vertically against the wall.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                        I know you’re uuuup heeerrrreeeee.

           The Man’s bony fingers feel the kayak in front of them. His 
           long, pointy fingernails SCRAAAAPE the plastic just inches 
           from Ramona’s head... but the hand continues onward. 

           Like the leg of a giant spider, the thin arm rotates slowly 
           around the room, touching suitcases... old paint cans... a 
           crib... a pair of skis... an upside down bike. It casually 
           spins the bike tire: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK... 
           click... click...... click.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ra-moooooooaaaannnnnn-ahhhhh...

           It touches an OLD JEWELRY BOX. The hand opens it up and a 
           small ballerina inside twirls around to A BEAUTIFUL LULLABY.

           To the calming music, the arm swings towards Ben. He backs 
           far into the corner as the hand feels around near his feet. 
           To avoid getting caught, he grabs hold of a wooden beam above 
           him and pulls both legs into the air. The hand passes under 
           him, just missing his feet.

           As the arm continues onward, Ben puts his legs back down on 
           the floor. That was close.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Where arrrrrreee youuuuuu...?

           Feeling around, the arm is approaching the rifle, leaning 
           against the wall. Fuck. Too scared to move, Ramona and Ben 
           can only watch as his bony fingers dance toward the weapon, 
           inch... by... inch...
                               shit shit shit shit shit shit
           ...but it glides right over top of it, leaving the gun 
           untouched. Ramona and Ben sigh silently in relief.

           The arm continues onward, KNOCKING OVER a ski pole, which 
           causes a stack of magazines to TOPPLE OVER -- sending a cloud 
           of dust hurtling right toward Annie. Dust in her face, Annie 
           tilts her head back to sneeze... but Ramona places her hand 
           overtop Annie’s mouth at the very last second, stopping her. 

           Relieved, Annie sighs and leans on a golf bag beside her. The 
           golf bag falls over and hits the ground -- THUMP. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        AHA!

           The arm immediately swings toward the sound and grabs the 
           first thing that it touches -- Annie’s shoe.

           The hand wraps around her foot and begins pulling her. But 
           Ramona grabs onto Annie’s hands...

                                 RAMONA
                        NO! Let... go!

           ...just as the arm begins retracting back down into the 
           hallway below. It’s pulling Annie slowly as it goes and, 
           holding onto her daughter, Ramona is being pulled too.

                                 ANNIE
                        AHHH!! MOMMYYYYY!!

                                 RAMONA
                             (strained)
                        BEN! BEN, HELP!

           Ben grabs one of the golf clubs, and WHACKS the arm with it. 
           Nothing. He WHACKS again and again. Still nothing. The hand 
           is pulling his mother and sister closer and closer to the 
           attic entrance and there’s nothing he can do.
                                 ANNIE
                        AHHHHH!!!

           Ben then notices the hand is gripping Annie’s shoe -- and 
           quickly rips the shoe off his sister’s foot. 

           That does it. Annie is free.

           Still holding onto the tiny shoe, the arm retracts completely 
           into the hallway below, leaving Annie behind. Ramona grabs 
           her and hugs her tight.

                                 RAMONA
                        Baby, are you okay?!

           Meanwhile, Ben grabs the handle of a GIANT WOODEN CHEST, 
           drags it across the floor, and sets it over top of the attic 
           entrance. He then grabs anything he can and puts it on top to 
           make it heavier -- boxes, books, anything.

           Thanks to Ben, the small crack in the entrance is now blocked 
           off. All panting and out of breath, the three of them retreat 
           back into a corner, safe for now.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           CLOSE ON the fireplace. Entering from screen right, The Man’s 
           hand grabs THE LONG, SHARP FIREPLACE POKER...

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                             (giddy laugh)
                        Hee-hee-hee-heeeee.

           ...and immediately slinks away with it.

           INT. ATTIC - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re all huddled together in the corner. Ben peers out the 
           window, eyeing their distress signal, rising into the sky.

           A quiet beat. Then...

                                       CRAAACKKKK! 

           In the center of the room, the fireplace poker is shoved up 
           through the floor. Everyone watches as it descends back into 
           the hallway below. A few feet away -- CRACK! -- it’s shoved 
           up through again ...then descends.

                                 RAMONA
                             (sotto)
                        Oh, shit.
           Everyone stands and panics as the sharp fireplace poker 
           begins stabbing through the floor at random... 

                CRACK!                                    CRACK!
                                      CRACK!  
                       CRACK!

           ...like a deadly game of Whack-A-Mole. Wherever The Man 
           stabs, they immediately runs as far as they can from it.

                                                     CRACK!  
                        CRACK!   
                                           CRACK!

           With every violent thrust, a two-inch wide hole is left 
           behind, each allowing a ray of sunlight from the hallway to 
           flood upward into the dark attic.

                          CRACK!   
                 CRACK!                                           CRACK!

           CRACK! This time, the poker stabs Penguin, piercing right 
           through the stomach of Annie’s poor stuffed animal.

                                 ANNIE
                        (GASP) Penguin!

           Smelling blood, the poker descends. Ramona picks up Annie 
           just as... 
                    CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK
                       CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK!
           ...the poker stabs rapidly like a jackhammer right where she 
           was standing.

           Running away with Annie, Ramona trips and falls -- THUMP!

           A second later, the poker stabs -- CRACK! -- right next to 
           Ramona’s face. Annie still in her arms, she rolls across the 
           floor, just barely missing -- CRACK! -- another stab -- 
           CRACK! -- then another.

           On the other side of the room, Ben STOMPS his foot to draw 
           The Man’s attention. 

                                 BEN
                        Over here, you slime bucket! COME 
                        GET ME!

           The poker quickly descends and Ben STOMPS again, then takes a 
           step backward and readies both hands...

                                              CRACK!

           The poker rises right where he stomped and Ben grabs it. 
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Gotcha!

           Through the floor, Ben and The Man “tug-of-war” with the 
           poker. With one aggressive yank from below, Ben’s left hand 
           is sliced by the sharp hook at the poker’s tip. He SCREAMS as 
           blood drips from his hand, but he continues to hold onto the 
           poker, grimacing in pain.

                                 RAMONA
                        Ben!

           Ramona hops up, runs over, and grabs the poker too. With his 
           mother helping, Ben readjusts his hands for a better grip. 
           The two of them pull as hard as they possibly can.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (strained)
                        Pull! PULL! 

           Ramona and Ben, GROANING LOUDLY, wrestle with the poker, 
           avoiding its sharp points as best they can. But The Man is 
           stronger than the two of them. He pulls hard, forcing both to 
           their knees. They’re losing this fight.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Puuulllll!

                                 BEN
                        I’m... pulling...

           Annie, watching from the other side of the room, spots a 
           large cherry bomb lying on the floor. She grabs it, then 
           lights the fuse with the lighter. 

           Ramona and Ben are about to lose... but then Annie runs up 
           with the lit cherry bomb...

                                 ANNIE
                        This is for Penguin!

           ...and shoves it through the hole, down into the hallway.

                                        KA-BOOM!

           A brief flash of light illuminates through the many new holes 
           in the floor. Ramona and Ben pull the fireplace poker up into 
           the attic, victorious. They did it! 

           Ramona wraps her arms around Annie, and Ben wraps his arms 
           around the both of them. Ramona kisses Annie’s forehead 
           repeatedly as everyone catches their breath.
                                 BEN
                        For the record... she learned that 
                        from Call of Duty.

           He rubs Annie’s head, affectionately messing up her hair. She 
           smiles at her big brother.

           Their celebration is short-lived, however, as...

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                        Ah... ha... haaaa.

           ...A DEEP, HEARTY LAUGH begins to roll from below. As it 
           continues, it evolves into an unsettling THROATY MOAN.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        MMMMMmmmmm-aaaaaaaahhhh...

           As he MOANS, a LONG, THIN, SLIMY OBJECT sticks up through one 
           of the new holes in the floor and begins to wiggle around 
           like a worm.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        BlaghhaAaAaAahhh...

           They all stare in disgust, realizing it’s The Man’s long 
           tongue. It shakes wildly.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (tongue noises)
                        Lulllullllulllulllluul...

           Ramona can’t take it anymore.

                                 RAMONA
                        LEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE! 

           She grabs the fireplace poker and swings downward at the 
           tongue -- CLANG! -- but it retracts away just in time.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                        CHILDREN! YOUR MOTHER HAS BROUGHT 
                        ME UPON YOU! 

           Ben and Annie stare up at Ramona, confused.

                                 RAMONA
                        He’s lying!

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (O.S.)
                        SHE DOESN’T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO 
                        YOUUUU! SHE! HATES! YOU!
                                 RAMONA
                        Don’t listen to him! That’s not 
                        true! THAT’S NOT TRUE!

           Enraged, Ramona hacks at the floor over and over -- CLANG! 
           CLANG! CLANG! -- GRUNTING with each effort.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        GO BACK TO THE HELL YOU CAME FROM! 

           Crazed, she readies the poker once more, ready for anything.

           Beep-beep-beeeep... 

           Everyone freezes.

           In the distance they hear... Beep-beep... Beep-beep!

           It’s a car horn, approaching the house. 

           Beeeep-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!! It’s getting closer. They all listen 
           as tires SPEED down the gravel driveway... an engine turns 
           off... a car door SLAMS...

                                 OLD MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                             (distant)
                        Ramona?! Hello?!

                                 RAMONA
                             (elated)
                        Fred.

           The fire worked.

           EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

           An overweight man, FRED MARCUS (early 60s) runs into the 
           backyard, following the smoke.

                                 FRED
                             (panicked)
                        Ramona? I was driving down 19 and I 
                        saw smoke!

           He finally sees the extent of the fire in the field...

                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

           ...and sprints toward the garage.
           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Fred runs in, BREATHING HARD, and searches frantically.

           Finally, he spots it in the back -- a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. 

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lugging the heavy object, he runs through the backyard and 
           into the field of tall grass. Sweating and COUGHING, he 
           begins to SPRAY the fire.

           It’s working.

           After he gets one section nearly out, Fred turns around and 
           focuses on another. He SPRAYS the extinguisher again... but 
           it’s running low. He sprays every last bit, but the fire 
           isn’t out.

           BREATHING HARD, and COUGHING EVEN HARDER, he drops the 
           extinguisher and quickly unbuttons his shirt. Now in his 
           “wife beater,” he swings his button-down shirt at the fire. 
           We spot a TATTOO on his upper arm.

           His attempts to put out the fire are working. The red-faced 
           old man, GRUNTING and COUGHING as he does, continues to swing 
           his shirt at the fire.

           He STOMPS out the last bits.

           Fred looks around -- he has put the fire out. 

                                 FRED
                             (exhausted)
                        Christ.

           WHEEZING, he sits down in the grass. Red-faced and drenched 
           in sweat, he pulls out his handkerchief and wipes his face 
           and neck. 

           For a beat, he catches his breath.

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        Fred!

           Fred turns and looks around for Ramona. He doesn’t see her.

                                 FRED
                        Ramona?

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        Up here!
           He looks up and sees Ramona poking her head out the attic 
           window, waving frantically. He stands and walks toward her.

                                 FRED
                        Are you okay?!

                                 RAMONA
                        Fred, there’s a man! He’s trying to 
                        kill us! Help!

                                 FRED
                        Oh my God.

                                 RAMONA
                        He’s inside!

           Fred sees Ben’s bat (from earlier) and grabs it. He runs 
           toward the back door -- it’s locked -- he immediately runs 
           around to the front of the house.

                                 RAMONA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hurry, Fred! 

           INT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Fred runs up and cautiously walks onto the porch. He notices 
           that the front door is wide open. 

           He enters, bat held high...

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           ...and looks around. There’s no one in sight.

           On the ground, Fred spots Ramona’s crutch and the box of 
           ammo. He tightens his grip on the bat, ready to swing, and 
           looks around the house...

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Huddled together, Ramona and the kids are silent and still. 
           Ben grabs the rifle and holds it, ready.

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Fred enters the dining room from the foyer. There’s nobody in 
           here.

           He slowly checks under the table. Nothing.
           He continues onward, walking slowly into...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           ...the kitchen. 

           Nothing.

           He spots the basement door, opens it, and goes down.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           It’s dark. Bat out in front of him, he walks down the 
           basement stairs. He looks around.

           Nothing. Just a basement. Washer, dryer, water heater, etc.

           He retreats back up the stairs.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           He exits the basement and heads into...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...the living room. 

           Nobody. Nothing.

           Having done a full circle, he re-enters...

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           ...the foyer and begins up the stairs, slowly and cautiously.

           Despite his efforts to be quiet, the stairs CREAK as he 
           climbs them.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Fred reaches the second story. He sees dozens of holes in the 
           ceiling.

                                 FRED
                             (concerned)
                        Ramona?!
                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        Be careful, Fred! He’s somewhere in 
                        the house!

           Fred remains calm.

                                 FRED
                        You guys just hang tight, okay?

           Fred goes to check the rooms on the second floor.

           INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

           Ramona, Ben, and Annie all wait silently and anxiously.

           Ramona holds Annie close.

                                 RAMONA
                             (whisper)
                        We’re all gonna make it. We’re all 
                        gonna make it. Say it.

                                 ANNIE
                        We’re all gonna make it. 

           Ramona nods.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Fred enters Ramona’s room. Nobody in here. He eyes the closet 
           door. It’s open a tiny crack.

           Bat ready, he cautiously approaches it. Using the bat, he 
           slowly nudges it open--

           Nothing. 

           Nothing but the empty gun safe, its door open; the silver key 
           hanging from its lock.

           INT. ATTIC - MOMENTS LATER

           They all continue to wait.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                        Coast is clear.

           Ramona peers through one of the holes. She sees Fred, 
           standing in the hallway below.
                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        Checked everywhere. Whoever he was, 
                        he’s gone now.

           A COLLECTIVE SIGH OF RELIEF from Ramona, Ben, and Annie.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The attic ladder has been lowered and Ramona and Annie have 
           already descended. Ramona holds the fireplace poker. Ben, 
           clutching the rifle, his left hand bloody, starts down the 
           ladder with Fred’s help.

                                 FRED
                        Okay, I gotcha, Ben. 
                             (RE: rifle)
                        Want me to take that?

                                 BEN
                        Nah, I got it.

           Ramona, still keeping a watchful eye on the surrounding 
           bedrooms, looks down at her arm cast; it’s plaster now 
           falling apart. With some effort, she tears it off completely 
           and it drops to the floor, in pieces. 

           Ben finishes descending the ladder. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, Mr. Marcus.

                                 RAMONA
                        Yes. Thank God for you, Fred.

                                 FRED
                        Nah. I’m just thankful I got that 
                        fire out. Thing would have burned 
                        all day.

                                 RAMONA
                             (to Ben)
                        Hey. Great idea. Y’know, with the 
                        fire. And that throw? One in a 
                        million.

                                 BEN
                        It’s a good thing Coach Kelce moved 
                        me out into right field, huh?

           She smiles. 

                                 RAMONA
                        Proud of you. You saved us.
           He blushes, then downplays it like teenage boys often do.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah yeah, I know, I’m a genius... 
                        but how about we hold the applause 
                        until we’re actually outta here?

           Ramona puts an arm around Fred (for support) and they all 
           begin down the stairs; Ben and Annie in front, Fred and 
           Ramona behind them. Ben keeps the rifle ready, just in case.

           INT. FOYER/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           As they walk... 

                                 FRED
                        Where can I take you? Our place? 
                        Police? Hospital?

                                 BEN
                        How about Dave & Buster’s?

                                 RAMONA
                        I don’t care. Anywhere.

           Ben and Annie reach the first floor and exit. Ramona and Fred 
           follow close behind, out onto...

           EXT. FRONT PORCH/YARD - CONTINUOUS

           ...the porch. (The sun is starting to set.)

                                 RAMONA
                        I really owe you one, Fred.

                                 FRED
                        Oh, cut that out. (BEAT) You 
                        actually owe me like, fifty.

           Ramona LAUGHS. That feels good. Her arm still on Fred’s 
           shoulder, they begin down the porch stairs into the yard. 

           Ramona spots the tattoo on Fred’s arm. It’s a black and white 
           image of the U.S. MARINES EMBLEM, depicting an Eagle, wings 
           out, standing on top of a globe; visible on the globe are 
           North and South America. And behind the globe, a large 
           anchor.

           A beat. 

           Walking slowly through the yard, Ramona looks at the tattoo 
           once more. Something about it seems... odd.
           She eyes the western hemisphere on the globe... and realizes 
           that the east coasts are where the west coasts should be... 
           and the west coasts are where the east coasts should be.

           The tattoo is backwards. Like it’s in a mirror. 

           Oh my god.

           Keeping her cool, she removes her arm from Fred’s shoulder.

                                 RAMONA
                        I think I can walk on my own.

                                 FRED
                        You sure?

           Ramona nods, then uses the fireplace poker as a crutch and 
           continues toward the driveway as if nothing’s wrong.

                                 RAMONA
                             (calm)
                        Hey Ben. Can I see that?

           Ben turns around. She points to the gun.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, sure.

           Ben hands her the rifle then continues walking. (Ramona now 
           has the rifle and the poker.)

                                 RAMONA
                        Oh, and before we leave, can you do 
                        me a favor?

                                 BEN
                        Um, sure. What’s up?

           Out ahead, Annie reaches the driveway and looks around.

                                 ANNIE
                        Mr. Marcus... where’s your car?

           There isn’t one.

                                 RAMONA
                             (to Ben, still calm)
                        Can you run into the field with 
                        your sister?

           Ben turns and looks at her, perplexed.

                                 BEN
                        ...Huh?
                                 RAMONA
                        Grab Annie and run into the field.

           Ramona and Ben stare at one another. He doesn’t understand.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Now. Right now. GO!

           With one hand, Ramona swings the poker and hits Fred -- 
           CRACK! -- right in the forehead. Fred GRUNTS in pain and 
           falls to the ground. 

                                 FRED
                        Ramona?!

           She WHACKS him in the stomach. Ben and Annie watch in shock. 

                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        What are you--?!

           Ramona WHACKS him in the stomach with the poker again. Fred 
           writhes in pain on the ground.

                                 BEN
                        Mom--?!

                                 RAMONA
                        Run!

           Ben still doesn’t get it.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        RUN!

           Ben looks down at Fred... and finally spots the tattoo. He 
           takes off, grabs Annie by the arm, and they run into the 
           backyard. They head straight toward the field and disappear 
           into the thick, tall ryegrass. 

           Ramona WHIPS Fred across the face once more -- for good 
           measure -- then tosses the poker behind her so she can use 
           both hands to COCK the rifle.

                                 FRED
                        Stop! Stop!

           She puts her finger on the trigger and aims it right at his 
           face.

                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        No... no please...

           She starts to squeeze...
                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        Please, Ramona...

           ...but can’t do it. 

           She loosens her grip on the trigger and stares at the gun... 
           then down at Fred. Only, he’s no longer Fred. He now has a 
           wide, sinister grin and sunken, beady eyes. He LAUGHS.

           “Fred” grabs hold of the rifle and violently yanks it out of 
           Ramona’s hands. He KICKS her in the stomach, sending her 
           flying across the yard. 

           Ramona lands hard and rolls painfully to a stop. Then, 
           WINCING, she sits up. She looks toward Fred, but “Fred” is 
           gone -- The Man stands there now, grinning like always. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Got ya good, didn’t I? 

           Ramona spots the fireplace poker nearby and grabs it. She 
           stands and wields it like a sword, ready to fight.

                                 RAMONA
                        You want me? Here I am. But you 
                        leave Ben and Annie out of it, you 
                        son of a bitch.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        You’ve brought this upon your 
                        family, Ramo--

                                 RAMONA
                        Stop saying that! My children don’t 
                        deserve this.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        And your husband? Did he deserve 
                        his fate?

           Ramona clenches her jaw, hating him.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        A man can spend his whole life 
                        fighting vice with virtue... and 
                        then, with one bad roll of the 
                        dice... his brains end up 
                        splattered all over the highway.

                                 RAMONA
                        FUCK YOU!
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        It ain’t you who pays for your 
                        sins, Ramona. It’s your children. 
                        Did you think you could gamble with 
                        their fate and they wouldn’t become 
                        part of the game?

                                 RAMONA
                        You touch my kids, I’ll kill you.

           The Man watches as she retreats backwards towards the tall 
           grass...

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Oh, I’ll find ya. I’ll find all 
                        a’ya’ll. 
                             (grins wide)
                        Always do.

           ...and uses his fingers to blow a QUICK PIERCING WHISTLE.

           BARK-BARK-BARK-BARK!

           Behind him, on the far end of the front yard, A LARGE BROWN 
           BEAST comes barrelling out of the ryegrass. Sharp teeth 
           snarl... foam drips from its mouth... colossal paws dig into 
           the ground, kicking up dirt as it races straight at Ramona.

           Her face falls -- oh my god -- it’s Charlie.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        GIIT ‘ER!

           Ramona turns and runs into the fields, disappearing into the 
           tall grass like her children. 

                                 RAMONA
                             (calling out)
                        RUN, KIDS! RUNNN!

           “Charlie” follows, BARKING WILDLY. The Man walks casually 
           towards the fields, rifle in hand; a hunter, excited to hunt.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ben? Little Annie? Yoo-hoooooo...

           EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME

           Ben and Annie run through the dark, suffocating jungle of six-
           foot high grass. 
                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                             (in the distance)
                        DON’T STOP!

           Annie follows her brother as quickly as her little legs can.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD - SAME TIME

           Ramona, in agony, hobbles away from the beast far behind her.

                                    BARK-BARK-BARK-BARK!

           Sweat pours down her face as she forces herself to keep 
           moving through the maze, GRUNTING with every painful step.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (BEN & ANNIE) - SAME TIME

           The continue to run. Ben looks back and sees Annie is lagging 
           behind. 

                                 BEN
                        Come on, Annie! Run!

           He grabs her by the arm, pulling her along. Behind them, 
           their house begins to disappear in the distance.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (RAMONA) - SAME TIME 

           Keep going keep going keep going...

           Behind Ramona, the horrible growling grows louder. The beast 
           is getting closer...

                                       BARK-BARK-BARK!

           Keep going.

                                     BARK-BARK-BARK!

           Keep going.

                                  BARK-BARK-BARK-BARK!

           ...until finally she stops, turns around, and sees the rabid 
           “Charlie” speeding toward her like a heat-seeking missile. 
           She digs her back heel into the dirt, crouches down, and 
           readies the fireplace poker.

           The GROWLING beast leaps at her as she -- YELP! -- pierces 
           its chest. 
           In one swift motion, she tosses him over her head, where the 
           dog lands lifeless -- THUMP -- in the grass behind her.

                                 RAMONA
                        (SIGH) Christ, that dog.

           She creeps toward his lifeless body, poker still stuck in it. 
           She watches as his brown fur fades into a grisly shade of 
           grey. His legs, head, and torso begin to crumble away, like a 
           burnt log in a camp fire, until his entire body disintegrates 
           to ash...

           Ramona picks up her weapon and treks onward.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (BEN & ANNIE) - SAME TIME

           Thinking they’re far enough away, Ben slows down and 
           eventually stops. Annie too. HUFFING AND PUFFING, they both 
           lean over to catch their breath.

           Ben turns and peers through the grass. His heart sinks as, in 
           the distance, he spots The Man, rifle in hand, somehow hot on 
           their trail.

           He immediately ducks back down.

                                 BEN
                        He’s tracking us. 
                             (realizes)
                        He’s hunting us.

           He locks eyes with his sister. He sees the fear in her eyes.

           Ben suddenly gets an idea...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           ...grabs her hand and they take off again. This time, they 
           curve to the right, heading in a new direction.

           IN AN AERIAL SHOT, we watch Ben and Annie run through the 
           grass in a “U-shape,” heading back toward the house...

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (THE MAN) - MOMENTS LATER

           (The sun has now set, suffocating the field in darkness.)

           Cool, calm, and frighteningly in his element, The Man In The 
           Yard treks through the field. He stares down at the grass and 
           the dirt, spotting miniscule indentations -- unnoticeable to 
           the untrained eye -- and follows them.
           Never once doubting himself, he pursues the children with 
           ease, turning and heading back toward the house like Ben and 
           Annie did a few moments before.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (RAMONA) - SAME TIME 

           Ramona hurries blindly through the grass.

                                 RAMONA
                             (whispers)
                        Ben? ...Annie?

           Nothing.

           She’s not sure where to go, but continues anyway.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (THE MAN) - MOMENTS LATER

           A bent blade of grass here, a groove in the dirt there...

           The Man continues to follow the kids’ “trail” with ease.

           Suddenly, he stops. He looks to his right, then to his left, 
           then forward. He’s come to an unexpected fork in the road. 
           For a beat, he stands there, unsure. He licks his lips, 
           excited for the challenge, but then--

           He spots Ben, walking toward him, completely unarmed. The Man 
           furrows his brow, a bit confused.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        While I admire your bravery, Ben, I 
                        must say, I expected more intellect 
                        from the so-called “man of the 
                        house.”

           He raises the rifle.

                                 BEN
                        Psh, some hunter you are.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (insulted)
                        Beg your pardon?

                                 BEN
                        You said it yourself: gettin’ an 
                        animal to come to you? That ain’t 
                        the real way to hunt.

           The Man cracks a smile.
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Son, if I’ve lead you to believe 
                        that I follow a moral code... well, 
                        I’m sorry to disappoint.

           He aims the rifle again and--

                                 BEN
                             (puts his hands up)
                        Okay, okay! Wait, wait, wait!

           The Man listens.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        If that’s the case -- you want my 
                        mom, right? Fine. I can give her to 
                        you. Hell, all day, she’s done 
                        nothing but put us danger. Just... 
                        promise you’ll let me and Annie go.

           The Man lowers the rifle.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (sly smirk)
                        Deal.

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                             (calling out)
                        Mom! Hey, Mom!

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (RAMONA) - SAME TIME

                        Mom, we’re over here!

           Ramona hears him. He’s not that far.

                                 BEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I got him! I got him, Mom! 

           On her skeptical face...

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FIELD (BEN & THE MAN) - SAME TIME

                                 BEN

                        But... Annie’s hurt! Hurry, come 
                        quick!

           They wait, Ben’s hands still in the air.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey... you wanna hear a funny 
                        story? 

           The Man doesn’t answer.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        So for my sixth grade class trip, 
                        we went to Disney World. Dope, I 
                        know. My cousin’s class went to 
                        D.C. (FART NOISE) but we got lucky.

           A beat.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, we go to EPCOT one day, 
                        right? And we’re at the Japan 
                        restaurant for lunch and Chris 
                        Fillbach dares me to eat a ton of 
                        raw eel. So obviously, I did. I had 
                        like, twenty-five of those things. 
                        Disgusting. Plus, I drank a whole 
                        bunch of Dr. Pepper. Not part of 
                        the dare, I just love that shit.

           Listening, The Man cocks his head, quite confused.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        So then like, an hour later, we’re 
                        all in line for “Mission: Space” 
                        and I feel somethin’ brewin’ inside 
                        the ol’ tum-tum. Somethin’ mean. I 
                        knew I needed to get to a bathroom, 
                        but I didn’t want to lose my spot 
                        in line... so I yacked all over the 
                        place.

           The Man can only stare.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I tried to stop it, y’know, by 
                        putting my hand over my mouth? But 
                        man, that just made things so much 
                        worse ‘cause then it sprayed out 
                        like a fire hose. 

           Ben puts one hand over his mouth and uses his other hand to 
           pantomime “projectile vomiting.”

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Blugh, blugh, bluuuuugh! Eel and 
                        Dr. Pepper go everywhere -- the 
                        ground, my friends, Mrs. Adams... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        And because Molly Drake was wearing 
                        flip-flops, a little chunk of eel 
                        ended up in between her toes, I 
                        felt so bad. (SIGHS) Hands down, 
                        worst stomach ache I ever had in my 
                        life. (BEAT) But, y’know...
                             (sly smile)
                        ...I bet your stomach’s about to 
                        feel even worse.

           Bewildered, The Man opens his mouth to finally speak--

           A sharp object PIERCES right through him. Eyes wide, jaw 
           dropped, he looks down at the fireplace poker sticking out of 
           his stomach. In shock, he turns around... and sees Ramona.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                             (furious)
                        You bitch...

           He drops the rifle and falls to his knees. Ramona picks it up 
           as Ben and Annie (stepping out of her hiding place) come and 
           stand behind her. Ben smiles.

                                 BEN
                        Had me riiiiight in your sights... 
                        but you just couldn’t pull the 
                        trigger, could ya? 

           The Man grabs his stomach; his beady eyes starting to panic.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        No... nooo...

           He MOANS AND GROANS as he collapses onto the ground, his face 
           contorted in pain. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Aghhh... AGGGHHHHH...

           They watch, as he falls onto his hands and knees.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Gaggghhhhhaaaahhh...

           But suddenly... the moaning stops. On all fours, The Man 
           remains oddly still for a long beat. 

           Annie grabs Ramona’s arm.

                                 ANNIE
                        Did you... did you kill him?
                                 RAMONA
                        I...

           The Man slowly turns his head at them--

           he’s smiling.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (crushed)
                        No.

           He begins to LAUGH.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Ah... ha... haaaa.

           The Man slowly gets up... they all watch in horror as he now 
           stands at least twelve feet tall. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Kill me? KILL ME?! 

           Grinning, he RIPS the poker out of his body and stares down 
           at them, his long, pointy face now frozen in rictus.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        Try as haaaard as you might, little 
                        Annie... you’ll never even hurt me! 
                        Give up! Giiiiive upppppp! 

           He tosses the poker away and CACKLES WILDLY.

                                 RAMONA
                        RUN!

           Ramona, Ben, and Annie turn and race back toward the house.

           As they sprint away, The Man follows, his entire torso now 
           towering above the tall grass.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        GO, GO, GO!

           With each step, the giant behind them raises his gangly legs 
           high into the air, then down with a tremendous STOMP, in an 
           unnatural, almost cartoonish, galumph. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben and Annie emerge from the tall grass. Ramona exits last, 
           rifle still in hand. They all run around to the front of the 
           house...
           EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           ...and head toward the driveway.

           Halfway across the yard, Ramona stops.

                                 RAMONA
                        You two go on! 

           Ben turns and pulls on her arm.

                                 BEN
                        Not without you!

           She shoves him off.

                                 RAMONA
                        I’ll just slow you down! Go!

                                 BEN
                        Mom, we’re not gonna lea--

           She grabs Ben by the collar.

                                 RAMONA
                        Listen to me!

           Ramona speaks to her son in a stern, commanding tone that 
           we’ve never seen from her.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        You pick up your sister and you run 
                        down to the road. Someone will 
                        drive by. And until they do, you 
                        run as fast as you can. And don’t 
                        look back. Do you understand?!

           Scared, he doesn’t respond.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

           Ben nods. Annie wraps her arms around her mother’s waist. 

                                 ANNIE
                             (through tears)
                        Mommy, no!

           Ramona tries to shove her off.

                                 RAMONA
                        Go with your brother.
                                 ANNIE
                        But-but, you saw... we can’t hurt 
                        him! We can’t hurt him!

           Ramona looks into her daughter’s eyes.

                                 RAMONA
                        But that doesn’t mean we stop 
                        fighting. 

           Annie and Ben stare at their Mom, inspired.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        GO! NOW!

           Ben picks up Annie (still CRYING) and takes off across the 
           yard. As they disappear down the long driveway, Ramona 
           prepares for her last stand.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           From the back yard, The Man casually walks around the house; 
           the top of his hat now as high as the second story. The 
           slender giant gazes down at the tiny Ramona, standing in the 
           middle of the yard, rifle ready.

           With his enormous gate, he strolls confidently across the 
           yard. Ramona stares up at him, unafraid.

                                 RAMONA
                        This is your last chance. Get the 
                        hell out of my yard. 

           As The Man approaches her, he slowly shrinks back to normal 
           size with each step.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        You hear me? Leave! Leave and never 
                        come back!

           He continues... now just about six feet tall. Ramona holds 
           her ground as he walks toward her.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Stop! Don’t you come any closer! Or 
                        I’ll shoot!

           She raises the rifle and aims it right at him. He finally 
           stops about ten feet away from her.
                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll do it! I’ll blow your head 
                        right off! Let’s see you survive 
                        that, you bastard!

           The Man can’t help but CHUCKLE.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        My dear, sweet Ramona. We both know 
                        you won’t fire that gun. 
                             (matter of fact)
                        You can’t.

           The Man’s expression slowly begins to change. No longer one 
           of cruelty... but of duty and responsibility.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        And that’s why I’m here. To help 
                        you.

           Ramona lets out a QUIET GASP. She finally understands. 

           On her shocked face, we...

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE

           We pick up where the last flashback ended. Ramona, tears in 
           her eyes, looks toward her closet door. Coming to a decision, 
           she lets go of her husband’s flannel and reaches into her 
           bedside table for the silver key. 

           Then, eyes glazed over, she climbs out of bed and walks 
           toward her closet... opens it... shoves aside her clothes... 
           and uses the key to unlock the safe.

           Inside is the Remington rifle.

           A MOMENT LATER, Ramona is sitting back on her bed, staring 
           down at the long rifle laying across her lap. Finally, she 
           loads it, then COCKS it. She tilts her head back, places the 
           gun vertically between her legs, puts one finger on the 
           trigger, and rests her chin over the muzzle.

           She closes her eyes and begins to squeeze the trigger...

           A long beat.

           ...but her finger relaxes. The gun drops to the floor and she 
           begins to WEEP. She puts her hands together and prays.
                                 RAMONA
                             (sobbing)
                        Please... help me. It’s too much. I 
                        can’t... please... I can’t do it... 
                        please, help me...

           She falls to the floor, hands clenched, praying hard. On her 
           tightly intertwined fingers...

                                                            BACK TO SCENE: 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        You rest your finger on the trigger 
                        of that rifle every night. And 
                        every night, you hope you have the 
                        strength to pull it. (BEAT) But you 
                        don’t.

           He slowly walks toward her.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        I do.

           Tears well in Ramona’s eyes.

                                 RAMONA
                             (softly)
                        No...

           As he approaches, a terrified Ramona backpedals -- and trips. 
           She falls to the ground.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                             (weak, pleading)
                        No, please... please...

           He squats down next to her.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Tell me, Ramona. What is it you 
                        pray for?

           A tear rolls down her cheek.

                                 RAMONA
                             (ashamed)
                        Death.

           The Man nods knowingly.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        That’s right.

           He places his hands on the gun, taking control of it. 
                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        So don’t be surprised when he shows 
                        up at your door.

           EXT. DOWN THE DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

           Ben runs down the long driveway with Annie over his shoulder. 

                                 ANNIE
                        What about Mom?! WHAT ABOUT MOM?!

           Annie begins punching Ben in the back.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                             (angry)
                        BEN! WHAT ABOUT MOM?!

           Ben doesn’t stop.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Ben! Ben! PUT ME DOWN!!!

           She grabs a chunk of his hair and pulls hard. Ben YELPS in 
           pain and finally sets her on the ground, where she 
           immediately starts hitting and kicking him.

                                 BEN
                        Stop! Annie, stop!

           She doesn’t. So Ben kneels down and grabs her hands to stop 
           the relentless onslaught.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Mom said to run! Okay? That’s what 
                        she told me to do!

                                 ANNIE
                        We can’t leave her! We can’t! We 
                        can’t...

           Annie WEEPS. Ben tries to convince her...

                                 BEN
                        She told me to run!

           ...and convince himself.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        She told me to.

           Annie shakes her head.
                                 ANNIE
                             (through tears)
                        She told us to stick together!

           On Ben’s face, unsure...

           EXT. FRONT YARD - SAME TIME

           A defeated Ramona gazes up at The Man, tears in her eyes, 
           remorseful.

                                 RAMONA
                        I... I never meant to put Ben and 
                        Annie at risk. Truly, I didn’t, I, 
                        I...

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Shhhh... I know, I know.

           He rubs her cheek, like a father comforting his daughter.

                                 RAMONA
                        It’s just... It’s too much. 
                             (sobbing)
                        I can’t live with it. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        Shhhhhhh... Here. This will help.

           The Man grabs Ramona’s head, holds it steady, and shoves the 
           rifle under her chin. 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        No more pain.

           He grabs her hand and places it on the trigger... 

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        No more guilt. 

           ...then slides his bony index finger into the trigger guard 
           along with hers.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD (CONT’D)
                        No more restless nights.

           Ramona finds one last ounce of strength and tries to turn her 
           head away from him.

                                 RAMONA
                        No... noo...
           But The Man grabs her by the hair and forces her chin back 
           over the muzzle.

                                 THE MAN IN THE YARD
                        I admire your spirit, Ramona. I 
                        really do. But fight me off now, 
                        you know I’ll be back...
                             (sly smirk)
                        ...sooner or later.

           He’s right. Ramona accepts this. She accepts everything. 
           She’s given up. The Man has won. She shuts her eyes, ready to 
           die. The Man’s evil grin returns, enjoying every moment. 

           He slowly begins to squeeze, helping Ramona pull the trigger.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                             (faint)
                        Mom?

           At the sound of Annie’s distant voice, Ramona’s eyes open.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                             (faint)
                        MOM?!

           With one hand, she pushes the rifle forward just as their 
           fingers squeeze the trigger -- BANG! -- blowing The Man’s 
           head off his shoulders.

           His headless body remains still for a beat... then goes limp 
           and falls backward onto the ground like a rag doll.

                                 RAMONA
                        Not today, fucker.

           She watches as his decapitated body begins to crumble... and 
           slowly turns to ash. A light breeze WHIPS across the yard, 
           and the tiny grey flakes that once made up his body blow high 
           into the air... and disappear into the night.

           She won.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - A MINUTE LATER

           Ben and Annie run up the driveway and see a smiling Ramona 
           hobbling toward them, trying to use the rifle as a crutch.

           Seeing their mother alive, their faces light up.

                                 BEN
                        Mom!
                                 ANNIE
                        Mommy!

           Ben reaches Ramona first, takes the rifle, and helps her 
           stand. Annie runs up next and hugs her tight.

                                 RAMONA
                        Thought I told you to run and not 
                        stop.

                                 BEN
                        You expect the man of the house to 
                        take orders from you? (SCOFF)

           Ramona smiles. 

           Annie and Ben spot The Man’s hat sitting in the grass.

                                 ANNIE
                        You killed him?
                             (confused)
                        But he said...

           She stares up at her mom, her brow furrowed.

                                 RAMONA
                        The world’s full of monsters, 
                        Annie. Some big and scary, and 
                        others... just in your head. But no 
                        matter what, don’t believe anything 
                        they say. You’re stronger than 
                        them. I promise.

           She smiles. Annie smiles right back, taking this to heart.

                                 BEN
                        Mom... why did he come here?

           Ramona takes a moment to collect her thoughts. Then:

                                 RAMONA
                        Because I needed a reminder of why 
                        I have to keep going. 

           She puts her arms around them.

           In an EXTREME WIDE, we watch as they trek slowly across the 
           yard toward the front porch. Suddenly, a few lights in the 
           house flicker and then turn on all at once. 

           Power’s back.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           CLOSE ON Ramona, sound asleep. As we PULL OUT, we reveal 
           Annie, on her mother’s right shoulder. And as we PULL OUT 
           even further, we see Ben on her left. 

           WE SETTLE on a wide of the bed, where all three sleep 
           together soundly.

           After a beat, the DARK SILHOUETTE OF A LARGE MAN grows over 
           them... then vanishes. 

           For now.
                                                                  FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
